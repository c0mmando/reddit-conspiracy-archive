       I agree, a lot of my professors have been talking about how even a Bachelors degree is starting to become not enough when it comes to getting a job. How much "schooling" is someone going to have to go through until they are fit for a good job. I feel colleges are constantly getting more expensive to weed out the poor and keep the poor ignorant. However we do have scholarships, which is just a facade for this.

       I'm sorry, if college is a bunch of bullshit to you then just fucking drop out now and run for the border. It's the people that get into universities and colleges that don't believe that furthering their education is worth anything and just want to move to the next level that are cheapening the worth of a collegiate education. GO FUCK YOUR HIGH AND MIGHTY SELF. Unless you were some child genius and haven't lost the title of minor in your collegiate career, there isn't a damn thing keeping you at your college or university and running to the nearest border. Get the fuck out of the country that so many people are proud of if all you are going to do is use her for her benefits and then shit on her once you've entered the "high society" of the world.

What bothers me is that accessibility to good colleges for people is getting WORSE, great state schools are getting less and less from the state making them increase tuition. Most people should have at least some kind of opportunity to attend a good college within their community without having a $100,000 debt just for trying to become well rounded and educated.

       Thank you.  I felt the same way but have gotten to the point where I won't comment because I get slammed by nasty replies from 20-something people who honestly believe that they know everything.  If somebody thinks the country is bad or that education is for the lemmings...I want them out.

       Interesting point. I feel like the overall idea is to bring the current system to it's knee's in one way or another. The outcry or the "need" of the people will be cloudy and most people won't know what's happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       However no system is perfect and I don't think we will ever achieve a utopian society. We can try though.

       I lived in a communist country (Romania) from the day I was born until I was 28 years old and I can tell you that people won't wake up until their stomach are empty and even on a empty stomach they'll stay oppressed for decades. The people in US have it good. They have TV, cheap fast food... why get out and protest and risk jail or to loose their job? There will be no revolution in US in the near future. I foresee that the first step is when some states will break away from the union and become independent.

       I completely agree. I'm Romanian too, I was born just 3 months before the fall. However not much happened after Communism fell, the country was still poor and if anything times were much harder. I've lived in the U.S. all my life, but having been exposed numerous times to how people live in Romania I truly appreciated what this country stood for. I love America, it's a country of amazing opportunity and undiscovered wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see things happening that don't benefit the country and its people as a whole and that's what bothers me. It's true that how you treat your people is how your people will treat you. Why have a closed and secretive government, "representatives" that lie to get elected and then barely represent the people that chose them. The only good that comes from that is that people get frustrated, annoyed, and loose faith in political system.

       ...#12 : This isn't because of politicians, it's because of the American people and the structure/complexity of politics; it's not a "conspiracy."

       These 14 points are all effects of more complicated mediating variables and theoretically-founded causes. It's easy to point out a few splotches of embarrassment and shame in our American society. I think to correct these we need to examine why they happen (what causes these points and what makes us passive and accepting of them).

       I agree; I posted this in conspiracy because I felt I could get some intelligent conversation going on with people who think outside the box.

       every reason you stated is what makes me sad about our country. 
i am embarassed of my government.
      </p>
      <p>
       i want to run too, like many of you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       but the shackles of minimum wage jobs extrememly high rent, gas and bills i am no longer financially capable of going to school or traveling
      </p>
      <p>
       I am 22 yrs old and have never flown (airplane or otherwise) 
I have never gone on vacation and dont know jack shit about the world for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       to me that is imprisonment
      </p>
      <p>
       education is shitty, 
housing is shitty,
clothes are expensive so you have to buy cheap/shitty,
traveling is out of the question due to finances being shitty,
employment is shitty (due to shitty education)
      </p>
      <p>
       in side comment to education being shitty; put it this way in school i was NEVER taught logic  i recently started to understand its conepts along with the ne knowledge of fallacies LESS THEN A YEAR AGO

       Oh yes, Jewwatch.com. I'm sure that's a
       <strong>
        completely
       </strong>
       reliable source. For instance, they point out that the current publisher of the New York Times is a man named Arthur Sulzberger. Oh my, shock and horror,
       <em>
        there's a Jewish person pursuing a career in that company!!
       </em>
       A company that was founded by a man from a long line of Puritan Christians. A company that is publicly traded and thus cannot be said to be owned by any single group. A company that has run editorials critical of Israel like this one:
       <a href="http://alturl.com/5wzqd">
        http://alturl.com/5wzqd
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If your standard for "dominated by Zionist Jews who (implicitly) are being deceptive and manipulative" is that there are people who work for that company in senior positions who have Jewish names...then you're a racist asshole. First, not everyone with a Jewish sounding name is Jewish. Second, not every Jewish person is a Zionist. Third, even if a Zionist did work for the company, that does not mean that they can't separate their personal beliefs from their professional responsibilities. To presume that you can tell that something nefarious is afoot simply by
       <strong>
        looking at someone's name
       </strong>
       , as this website you cite does over and over again, then you're a bigot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually click over to this website (not recommended), you will see that for their profile of the NYT, they just copied and pasted a 1998 company profile of the New York Times Company produced by  Hoover's Company Profiles, and then pointed out that the family that the NYT takes its chairmen from is Jewish, as if there was something inherently nefarious about that. Yes, there appears to be some nepotism in the company, but nepotism is a practice that people all faiths enjoy. I guess if you're a blinkered racist idiot, it suddenly becomes sinister when
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the time or patience to go through every single link on that page, but skimming several shows that this is pretty much what this page does: it points out that there are these things called media companies, and that many of these media companies are big and own several newspapers, and that some of the senior officers of these companies appear to have Jewish names, and thus the Jews
       <strong>
        MUST
       </strong>
       be controlling the what the world thinks. And then it links to information about the secret plot to commit genocide against white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're concerned about the power of media conglomeration, great, protest to the FCC. But the problem with too few media companies owning too much of the national dialog doesn't  have
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to do with the fact that some senior media executives are Jewish, and
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       to do with the fact that
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       owning a media monopoly is a bad thing, no matter what religion they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're really going to get into media activism, might I suggest that you pick out a medium that
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       dying off left and right? Newspapers are on the way out. I notice that this "scholarly" website doesn't much care about television, radio, film, or the Internet. Maybe that's because the chairman, President, and CEO of Comcast is a guy named Roberts.

       I asked for you to name whoever it is you think is responsible for "Jewish domination" of the media, either on air or behind the scenes. You replied with nervously derisive laugher. It's one of those things that makes me go hmmm...
      </p>
      <p>
       Katie Couric's mother is Jewish, but she was raised Episcopalian. The only people who would care enough about her mother's religion to consider her Jewish are people who think that religious beliefs are hereditary. I.e. idiots, Nazis, and yourself. But I repeat myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomas and Sanchez were fired because they said things that were racist bullshit, and their bosses were concerned about how it would look if they stood behind their people when the said racist bullshit in public. The fact that you agree with their racist bullshit doesn't make their firings the result of a sinister cabal exerting untoward influence.

       If the jews actually did control the media, how would you know assuming they wanted to keep it a secret?

       Well, if they did...

       They'd probably make sure anybody working in the media that says they do, gets fired.

       Oh yes, Jewwatch.com. I'm sure that's a
       <strong>
        completely
       </strong>
       reliable source. For instance, they point out that the current publisher of the New York Times is a man named Arthur Sulzberger. Oh my, shock and horror,
       <em>
        there's a Jewish person pursuing a career in that company!!
       </em>
       A company that was founded by a man from a long line of Puritan Christians. A company that is publicly traded and thus cannot be said to be owned by any single group. A company that has run editorials critical of Israel like this one:
       <a href="http://alturl.com/5wzqd">

       If your standard for "dominated by Zionist Jews who (implicitly) are being deceptive and manipulative" is that there are people who work for that company in senior positions who have Jewish names...then you're a racist asshole. First, not everyone with a Jewish sounding name is Jewish. Second, not every Jewish person is a Zionist. Third, even if a Zionist did work for the company, that does not mean that they can't separate their personal beliefs from their professional responsibilities. To presume that you can tell that something nefarious is afoot simply by
       <strong>
        looking at someone's name
       </strong>
       , as this website you cite does over and over again, then you're a bigot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually click over to this website (not recommended), you will see that for their profile of the NYT, they just copied and pasted a 1998 company profile of the New York Times Company produced by  Hoover's Company Profiles, and then pointed out that the family that the NYT takes its chairmen from is Jewish, as if there was something inherently nefarious about that. Yes, there appears to be some nepotism in the company, but nepotism is a practice that people all faiths enjoy. I guess if you're a blinkered racist idiot, it suddenly becomes sinister when
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the time or patience to go through every single link on that page, but skimming several shows that this is pretty much what this page does: it points out that there are these things called media companies, and that many of these media companies are big and own several newspapers, and that some of the senior officers of these companies appear to have Jewish names, and thus the Jews
       <strong>
        MUST
       </strong>
       be controlling the what the world thinks. And then it links to information about the secret plot to commit genocide against white people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're concerned about the power of media conglomeration, great, protest to the FCC. But the problem with too few media companies owning too much of the national dialog doesn't  have
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to do with the fact that some senior media executives are Jewish, and
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       to do with the fact that
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       owning a media monopoly is a bad thing, no matter what religion they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're really going to get into media activism, might I suggest that you pick out a medium that
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       dying off left and right? Newspapers are on the way out. I notice that this "scholarly" website doesn't much care about television, radio, film, or the Internet. Maybe that's because the chairman, President, and CEO of Comcast is a guy named Roberts.
