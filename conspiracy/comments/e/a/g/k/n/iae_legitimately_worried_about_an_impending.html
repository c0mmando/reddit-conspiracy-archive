<p>9 to 40, that&#39;s quite a range.  The actual number is much closer to 9 than 40.  Either way, I wouldn&#39;t call that a disasrer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a decade of war in Afphanistan, at war in Iraq from 2003 now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Vietnam war went on for 2 decades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention Katrina and the horrific response thereto.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Katrina was bad, for that area, but they are recovering.</p>

<p>Do you really feel that any of those things you mentioned would be considered &quot;shit hitting the fan&quot;?  I wouldn&#39;t, in fact, my life hasn&#39;t really changed much at all.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because you will never get the real numbers.  The 9% figure comes from the labor department and they only take into account active, registered unemployed workers.   They don&#39;t count people who have never registered with the labor department, people who have to work at places like Wal-Mart part-time because they can&#39;t find full-time employment, etc.  The number is closer to about 30%</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Vietnam war went on for 2 decades.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am missing the point you are trying to make. The length of these wars mean we have not advanced as a civilization. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Katrina was bad, for that area, but they are recovering.</p>

<p>Come on, are you kidding? When was the last time you&#39;ve been to New Orleans?  What&#39;s bad for one of us is bad for all of us.  There&#39;s a Jewish poem ( I think it&#39;s a poem) that speaks to this mentality of not being concerned about your fellow man.  It&#39;s something like &#39;Then they came for the Jews, and I didn&#39;t speak up because I wasn&#39;t a Jew&#39; . . . Your logic is dangerously flawed and part of the reason we are in the mess we are in.  Make no mistakes about it, we are in a mess.</p>

Even if all-out nuclear war never happens (and I don&#39;t believe it will), we are still facing twin towers of potential from the global economic crisis and peak oil.

It is also true that we are on the brink of a &quot;new world order,&quot; but it&#39;s not the prison planet we have been told is coming. </p>

<p>There are huge problems in the world right now. Massive, massive problems. But there are forces more powerful than those who currently dominate our world, and they will not allow it to come to nuclear war or other mass death. One thing is what we know as karma; it is coming around and its effects are unavoidable to those in power right now. Another is highly advanced races who are ready to intervene if massive worldwide calamity comes to pass.</p>

<p>Definitely be prepared. Be ready, but don&#39;t be afraid. What is coming around the bend is something more beautiful than you ever imagined.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Specifically, there are many different groups. I&#39;m not an expert because I haven&#39;t met any of them personally, but here are some common ones. There are the Pleiadians, I believe these are known as the tall blondes. There are people from the constellation we know as Sirius, some of whom are actually feline-human types :/. There are people from Orion, Arcturians, and many others. Our galaxy is a very big place, and the multiverse is indeed infinite from our perspective. Both are teeming with life.</p>

<p>There are also what are commonly known as &quot;service to self&quot; races, or simply put the &quot;bad guys,&quot; although it&#39;s never that simple. These guys are kind of rare since, if you think about it, it&#39;s hard to develop extremely advanced technology without obliterating yourselves unless the spiritual progress comes along with it. Just look at the situation we are in right now with nuclear weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I find this field to be somewhat of a clusterfuck, so while a Google search is a good start be prepared for that.. </p>

<p>If I might recommend a couple of interesting sources I would point you to David Wilcock and Project Camelot, but use your own discernment with both. </p>

<p>For ET-specific info I really like James Gilliland. He and what he is doing at his ranch is truly unique in the world, although it&#39;s about to become increasingly common in the coming years. </p>

<p>Steven Greer is another interesting source although the man is a bit ego-heavy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s try the reverse then. What do you imagine will get this economy back on track?</p>

<p>The Fed is out of options. QE1 didn&#39;t work, so now we have QE2. Failure followed by failure. Great plan.</p>

<p>The Fed can&#39;t lower interest rates below zero. They can&#39;t raise interest rates above real inflation, because servicing the debt will balloon payments past infinity. Nobody&#39;s buying our crap bonds anymore.</p>

<p>We&#39;re already down 12 trillion dollars. 19 if you count the bad debt we bought from the banks. Over 80 trillion if you count all the unfunded mandates for the next 30 years.</p>

<p>Our exports are shit. We don&#39;t make anything anyone wants to buy, on the whole. (Yeah yeah, iPods, woo woo.)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve <em>always</em> argued this &quot;service economy&quot; was crap. Somewhere down the line, you have to actually create something physical that someone wants to buy. You <em>cannot</em> base a rational economy where everyone is essentially pushing fries out the window to everyone else.</p>

<p>Our glorious leaders (may peace be upon them) are obviously <em>not</em> willing to make the hard choices necessary to get our spending back in line with reasonable taxes. </p>

<p>Ben Bernanke is an idiot.</p>

<p>The Players are moving out of the stock market and into commodities. You&#39;ll all remember how well <em>that</em> played out a couple of years ago with gas prices. You&#39;ll start seeing the price of <em>everything</em> rise accordingly. Don&#39;t believe the BS about bad crops in India or whatever. </p>

<p>Nearly 40 million people on food stamps.
Thirty million Americans unemployed or underemployed. These are <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">government figures</a>.</p>

<p>Home prices are still falling, foreclosures haven&#39;t slowed down a bit. And I don&#39;t even <em>know</em> if the wave of business/retail foreclosures has even really started yet.</p>

<p>Face it, our economy is a gasoline saturated bonfire right now. The only reason I can&#39;t tell you how its gonna go up in flames is because there&#39;s too damn many people holding lighters.</p>

<p>Look at what happened to Argentina 11 years ago. The Banksters are playing out <em>exactly</em> the same scenario here.</p>

<p>Is that enough or shall I continue?</p>

<p>Please, please tell me that our Hallowed Leaders have a plan for getting us out of this, because I haven&#39;t seen diddly from them in a LONG time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding is that there are a wide variety of conspiracy &quot;theories&quot; that exist and have existed for a while. Because a portion of these happen to prophesy events: economic meltdown, war stuff, etc. Doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they predicted them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there&#39;s a lot of conspiracy proof as well :) Many conspiracy theories were proved as fact, for example, in the many, many, many books and first person accounts that said the war in Iraq was pre-planned and the WMD case was completely manufactured and meant to be deceptive. </p>

<p>So . . . you are either going to be lied to again and again and again . . . or you are going to start making calculated guesses as to what to believe based on the evidence you can find. </p>

<p>And you are either going to start getting pretty vicious about demanding a government that stops lying to you, and citizens who stop being willfully blind because they are too lazy to run their own government . . . or you are going to find yourself living through some crazy bad times.</p>

<p>Waving around the term &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and saying &quot;no one knows&quot; solves nothing does it. The fact that you don&#39;t know anything is cause you have decided NOT to know anything.  The fact that you don&#39;t think anything was accurately predicted is cause you have decided it is too much trouble to decide (based on all the evidence YOU can find) what to believe and based on that analysis to decide what you think is going to happen next.</p>

<p>PS:  I mention in passing, it was only a conspiracy for a long time that Jews were being burned in Ovens, that the Gulf of Tonkin was a lie, that Mortgage Backed Securities were a dangerous and destabalizing risk to the economy, etc.  </p>

<p>Sometimes that shit matters . . . sometimes NOT knowing the &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; is pretty damned expensive to people and their families. </p>
