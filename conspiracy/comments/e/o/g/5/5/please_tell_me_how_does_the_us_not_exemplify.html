    <div class="md"><p>Makes one wonder if we don&#39;t in fact live under a Zionist controlled government where certain information and speech are prohibited through social pressure and a variety of other means. After 65 years why does this remain such a social taboo? This whole story is not black and white as I was led to believe for 40+ years of my life. I have read the propaganda from both sides prior to and during WW II.  </p>

<p>Clint Eastwood made <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498380/">&quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot;</a> telling the story from the perspective of the Japanese who fought there. Why is no such telling allowed from a German perspective about their battles, etc? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the best of my knowledge, there has never been a film presenting the German point of view just prior to and during World War Two. The message is always twisted so that it consists of Zionist propaganda. Always. Even when made by Germans, films about WW2 are no more than Zionist propaganda. Not surprising, since the Zionists control Hollywood and a large portion of the movie business, at least in Western nations. Maybe some Iranian film producer will make an honest film on the War from the German perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Please Tell Me; How does the U.S. not exemplify Hitler&#39;s Fascist model of Corporations and Government working together? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Because both fascism and companies working in lockstep with the government predates Hitler.</p>

<p>I think the question you&#39;re meaning to ask is how does the U.S. not exemplify the version of fascism explained in this quote attributed to Benito Mussolini:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Corporate means something different in terms of Fascism.</p>

<p>The best explanation I&#39;ve ever read was <em>The Mass Psychology Of Fascism</em> by Wilhelm Reich. That&#39;s the book that shows how Fascism can crop up in any country, not just in Germany and Italy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;Corporatism&#39; meant something different when Mussolini coined the term than how it is presently used in America. </p>

<p>The idea behind fascism is to bundle together both private enterprise and government <em>under the rule of the political leadership</em>; it does not mean that profit-seeking corporations dominate the state and that the political leadership is weak. </p>

<p>A good example is the so-called &#39;Asian economic model&#39; which is, in reality, a fascist economic model. In Japan, CEO&#39;s received much lower pay and had to have their company&#39;s strategic plan approved by MITI, the ministry of industry and trade. MITI set goals for the CEO&#39;s to meet. CEO&#39;s were not compensated according to the profitability or market capitalization of their companies, but rather according to the extent of global market share that Japanese companies could acquire or according to some other goal or metric specified by MITI. </p>

<p>Strategic goals like changing the way the world thought of Japanese products were dictated by the trade ministry. Producing the highest quality affordable consumer products and dominating the automotive and consumer electronics were decided on as a matter of national policy and dictated to the CEO&#39;s. All Japanese auto manufacturers and consumer electronic manufacturers had to get the Ministry of Trade&#39;s approval to sell their products in export markets. That&#39;s why SONY &amp; Toyota have such good reputations.They were told not worry about maximizing profits and to earn a reputation for making high-quality, affordable products that didn&#39;t break. Today, few people think of Japanese products as junk. That&#39;s because this objective was dictated to the corporations by the Ministry of Trade.</p>

<p>Also, if Japanese companies had layoffs, the executives were expected to house the laid off workers in their own homes and to provide for their food and clothing needs. It&#39;s a completely different system than the American one where the politicians are weak and the real centers of power exist outside of the government. In a fascist economy to be a bureaucrat is to hold a higher station than a corporate executive.</p>

<p>In fascist countries the state rules over private enterprise, including big business; in America it&#39;s the other way around.  Also banking is typically viewed as public utility needed for providing capital formation needs at the local level. Banks are often nationalized or if they are private they are highly regulated.</p>

<p>In general, the economy is run with an objective of maximizing employment rather than maximizing corporate profitability. As mentioned before, executives receive lower pay, workers receive enhanced job security, and the political class wields more power than it does in America.</p>

<p>Looks like he&#39;s asking for a falsification of a statement with a counter example, to me.</p>

<p>His hypothesis is &quot;US exemplifies Nazi government + corporations&quot;, and he&#39;s asking for that to be countered. Perfectly reasonable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you&#39;ve confused the issue. I can prove I didn&#39;t commit murder by providing a counter example. For instance, a video of someone else commiting the murder. Or by proving I was somewhere else at the time. This happens all the time in courts all over the world.</p>

<p>Consider the following: &quot;please tell me, how are you not a hippopotamus?&quot;. You could prove that you are not a hippopotamus in numerous ways. Are you seriously suggesting that you <em>couldn&#39;t</em> prove that you&#39;re not a hippo?</p>

<p>&quot;Proving a negative&quot;, in the sense you implied, (actually argument from ignorance) is attempting prove a negative assertion for which there is no positive evidence, e.g. prove to me that there are no fairies. That can&#39;t be proven bwcause I can always counter that you just haven&#39;t looked in the right places. You could prove that fairies DO exist, simply by producing an actual fairy as evidence.</p>

<p>Just because a statement contains the word &quot;not&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be proven.</p>

<p>Otherwise, discrete mathematics would be in serious trouble, and several thousands of years of logical argument would need to be re-evaluated.</p>

<p>its just a stupid way to argue - that&#39;s why it isn&#39;t permitted in courtrooms all over the world, much less in any debate</p>
