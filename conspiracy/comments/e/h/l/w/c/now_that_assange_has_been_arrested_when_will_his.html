<p>US media is full of &quot;Assange arrested for <strong>RAPE</strong>&quot; and &quot;Assange arrested for <strong>SEX CRIMES</strong>&quot;.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t explain that the &quot;rape&quot; in question concerns the breaking of a condom and a woman scorned, who before the accusation made the &quot;rapist&quot; breakfast in bed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone knows there are two Julian Assanges. 
The first has been arrested in the UK and the second is in hiding in the Hymalayas. 
The one who was arrested has been &quot;blanked&quot;. A term used by members of the Fathers of Truth (movement behind Wikileaks) for wiping the memory of an individual. It wouldn&#39;t matter much anyhow, because this Julian knows comparatively little. His mind is mush now and the only information he&#39;ll provide the authorities is designed to be misleading. </p>

<p>The second Assange is hidden in a high-tech cave in the Hymalayas. He eats only white rice and small stones and drinks the nectar of the Banyan tree.</p>

<p>He is giving himself reconstructive facial surgery to more closely resemble Snape from Harry Potter. When that&#39;s done, he&#39;ll re-emerge, more glorious than ever, but this time under a new name (but still leading wikileaks): Raz al-Goul. </p>

<p>EDIT: The second Assange has changed his appearance according to my sources. His diet and self-conducted surgery have yielded a new appearance. HE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE SNAPE. I cannot tell you what he does look like because of a threat I have received from Kim Jung Il. KJI is intent on hunting down Assange (he is one of the few leaders who knows of Assange&#39;s double existence), in order to claim him as a prize. His plan is to show the world that he is the Supreme Leader by capturing a man no one else could. </p>

<p>KJI doesn&#39;t know that Assange has been alerted to this and has begun a second transformation. His diet now consists almost entirely of waffles and refried beans and he does virtually no exercise (Assange has traditionally been extremely fit, owing mostly to his love of lunges). </p>

<p>I will keep you posted as this develops. If KJI gets me (he won&#39;t, he&#39;s incompetent), please tell my story. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>At any rate, he must be doing something right...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can think of another scenario as well: The whole Wikileaks story is a big show (of which Assange can be ignorant) for later use as a modern medium which is ultimately trusted and supported by people.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example: They want to attack Iran, but they can&#39;t convince people through current mainstream media; people don&#39;t trust them. They&#39;ve already lied to people for Iraq and Afghanistan wars. So they need a new trusted-by-people medium to convince them about a war on Iran, directly or otherwise. Wikileaks sounds like a good plan, right?</p>

<p>Edit: Fixed a typo: Iran -&gt; Iraq</p>

While it&#39;s certainly possible that the government is actually committing a massively coordinated pr campaign involving multiple major international companies, a few large countries, and the livelihood of many of the world&#39;s best diplomats in the process, it&#39;s much more simple to assume that Assange has some connections to sensitive information and he knows how to raise a stink and piss off a lot of people in the process.</p>

<p>That said, it&#39;s a hell of an idea, and I&#39;ll actually be really impressed if our government can pull something like this off so well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect that the insurance file contains the equivalent of the Iraqi War diary files, but for current activities there and in Afghanistan, and more to the point without any details redacted. The release of that data could really put lives at risk. The question is: do the people in power in america care enough about those lives to not risk their release, or will they decide that those lives can be sacrificed as long as they can blame Assange for it?
We know they are willing to sacrifice lives, they just have to weigh up the damage to their image that will result compared to the risk of losing power and control in that region (and at home). If they think their power is safe they&#39;ll sacrifice everyone and anyone. I think Assange is screwed. The only hope for Wikileaks is if they can keep up momentum without him.</p>

According to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUYHlaMZWf8">Judge Napolitano</a>, the police knew here he was for some time and they were only waiting for the papers to be in order before making the arrest.  In fact, Assange was in contact with the authorities so it&#39;s not like he was trying to hide from them or anything.</p>

<p>The whole reason why you&#39;d deny bail is if there&#39;s reason to believe that they&#39;d run.  I think it&#39;s apparent that he had his chance to run and decided not to.</p>

<p>Hopefully it can be successfully appealed.</p>

<p>First of all. Providing links and research for other members of the Reddit community does not mean you&#39;re &quot;doing the thinking for them.&quot; So cut your condescending bullshit, nobody wants to hear it. No one here is better or worse than anyone else.</p>

<p>I&#39;m attempting to <em>not be naive</em> by questioning the OP&#39;s CIA-operative statement.

    <div class="md"><p>Very good questions but no death pool is required just yet. The current objective is to defame and discredit first, followed by acquisition of the fabled insurance file.  Then feel free to start placing your bets. I&#39;m predicting violent stabbing by way of an undereducated, mentally unstable, patriotic american sweepstakes winner on a reclusive beach in France. And the attacker will quote that he has no recollection of ever entering such sweepstakes bringing him to that fateful location. After extradition and en route back to the states- his aircraft will fall from radar forever. FTdoubleW Am I right, uncle? </p>

You do have to ask yourself however, is anything that assange has put out bad for those involved? I dont think that anybody doesnt want these things out. He still seems to be a patsy for the CIA. That said, you could be right, if they are done with him they will more than likely off him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe there won&#39;t be any need to make a martyr out of him. Highly publicized testimony from the accusers, plus some amplification of whatever shady things prosecutors find on him (&#39;ASSANGE HAD SEX WITH 15 Y.O. (when he was 15)&#39;), and repeating ad nauseum how the leaks put in danger the soldiers out there, and his reputation (and Wikileaks&#39;) will be tarnished forever.  For the average TV watcher he&#39;ll be the pervo-looking traitor that&#39;s also a rapist. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>And if this wasn&#39;t orchestrated... well, then he&#39;s the biggest idiot ever for doing those stupid things while on the run from every international agency and the USA should thank those two women for the best gift ever.</p>
