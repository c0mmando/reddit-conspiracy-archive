It seems unlikely that given the leaks coming out about the Federal Reserve that the USD can maintain it&#39;s value. The Fed &#39;bailed out&#39; every major banking institution in the entire world. By giving them a shit ton of free money.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNNFVjBVEtQ">FOX News is reporting it for fucks sake.</a> FOX News. The biggest psyops operation in the world. The same network that supported the US unwaveringly for the past decade through torture, an unjustified preemptive war, a housing/tech bubble... are now openly attacking the country. </p>

<p>Any chance of the US to engage in diplomacy is horribly decimated as well. Not just because of WikiLeaks. The US <em>people</em> shit-talked every other country for not having the liberties, not having the same rights, not having the freedom of speech.. all the while allowing the government to remove those liberties, those rights and freedom of speech.</p>

<p>The US government has no moral high ground to stand on. The US Dollar has nothing to stand on. It&#39;s all out in the open. </p>

<p>So what now? Is this crazy talk? What do you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct, stating that war drives the economy is historically accurate to a degree. </p>

<p>However, examining the situation as it stands currently with our military and economic standing, it&#39;s very difficult to support what appears to be a blanket assertion supporting war with Iran to &quot;lift all boats&quot;, as it were. Especially considering everything that&#39;s going on with the tax cuts right now. </p>

<p>In fact, a war with Iran stands to destabilize the region even more. It may go without saying, but Israel&#39;s only serious opposition in the region is Iran. If we knock Iran out of the picture, even if we do it &quot;successfully&quot;, then the job isn&#39;t over because we would then have to combat Israel&#39;s expansion progrom BY OURSELVES. The rest of the world would, I suspect, see it as karmic justice to let the US go it alone against the Israeli war machine we&#39;ve helped create over the decades. if you put any stock in the stories that US officials have been willingly, almost openly passing nuclear secrets to Israeli attaches for years, that even further complicates the issue. </p>

<p>And as much as I disagree that a war with Iran could be classified as potentially profitable for the American people, I&#39;m 100% sure that fighting Israel would be America&#39;s total undoing, provided we could make it that far without destroying ourselves first.</p>
