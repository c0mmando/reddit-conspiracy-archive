I feel like that whole subculture has largely died out. It seems like if it was real, more concrete evidence would be available, especially in the age of the internet. Too bad.. it was exciting back in the day.</p>

<p>I still want to believe :)</p>

Reptilians, those Nephilim guys and the Nibiru guys who are on their way... On the other hand there are the Luciferian master race controlling everything and waiting for the great harvest in a few years. They hope to guide humanity in such a way that we as individuals are able to enter the 4:th density.

However, he seems to be aware of the Law of One, which to me gives credibility to his claim to be well-studied in spirituality, one of 6 overall subjects the Illuminati focus on.

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence that extraterrestrials are here and have been here for a very long time is overwhelming. Exactly what evidence are you waiting for? Would you like them to land on the White House lawn? Well, that&#39;s not going to happen because they are looking for intelligent life too. </p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that the U.S. military-industrial complex is perfectly aware of the extraterrestrial presence. To them, they are invaders who must be shot down on site. I&#39;m not sure exactly what you mean by the subculture &quot;dying out,&quot; but I can tell you more people are awake and aware today than ever before, and the evidence couldn&#39;t be more massively abundant, <em>especially</em> with the internet! The evidence is so massive, so overwhelmingly obvious that I hardly know where to start. Presidents, Governors, other heads of state, senators, congressmen, pilots, high-ranking military officials, NASA scientists, Defense Ministers, and all kinds of other high-profile people have come out saying they have witnessed or are aware of the extraterrestrial presence and/or the hyper-advanced technology that goes along with it. Photos and videos are abundant online. There are so many undeniable case studies that I don&#39;t know how anyone could ever go from believing to not believing. </p>

<p>Like I said above, our military greets them with missiles and other advanced scalar weaponry we haven&#39;t even been told about. It is up to us on an individual basis to make contact. It is not up to the government or anyone else to <strong>&quot;tell&quot;</strong> us they are here. Raise your own frequency to a level where you stand out to them and you will have sightings. They will come almost as cheerleaders to prod you along your own spiritual evolution. Don&#39;t believe me? Well, buy a plane ticket and fly to Trout Lake, Washington and visit James Gilliland&#39;s ranch. Just one night is all it will take.</p>

<p>Rejoin us, my friend, for you already had the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been interested in UFOlogy for quite some time because it only goes so far, but <em>Out of the Blue</em> is, I think, considered more or less the gold standard by the community. There is also a sequel of sorts called I <em>Know What I Saw</em> (I think it was by the same man). You should be able to find them both full length on Google Video or chopped up on YouTube.</p>

<p>Up until a couple years ago i&#39;d watched pretty much every documentary on the subject, and I know i&#39;ve seen better docs than the one I just mentioned, but I can&#39;t come up with one off the top of my head. Anything on the Phoenix Lights will blow your mind. Even the then Governor of Arizona, Fife Symington (sp) saw these massive ships float over the city and later admitted to it, saying they were categorically not of this world.</p>

<p>Now, what I would really recommend is you skip the &quot;omg I saw something in the sky&quot; bs and go straight to the crux of the issue. Yes, the subject of UFOlogy is infinitely interesting but it always leaves you without an answer. <em>Contact Has Begun</em> is a documentary about the man I mentioned above, James Gilliland, who has UFOs buzz over his ranch in Trout Lake, Washington just about every night to say hello to his visitors (and <em>anyone</em> can go see it for themselves). I&#39;m very much a &quot;show me&quot; person so I was immediately attracted to this when I heard about it. No more theoretical ideas, just experiences. Also, UFOs are just the tip of the iceburg as to what&#39;s happening out at the Ranch, so I wouldn&#39;t jump in with both feet. Get used to this stuff a little at a time or your mind might reject it to protect its own version of reality.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t recommend <em>Contact Has Begun</em> highly enough to you, even though it&#39;s not exactly what you asked for. Also available on Google and Youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s something that can fly around better than jets can. We don&#39;t know what it is or where it comes from though.</p>

<p>I think this interview was a good one: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIv696A815o">p1</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMaQg9CMJns">p2</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAn-BPXeZeA">p3</a>.</p>

<p>Kean points out some events (<a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=4d7_1197484790">JAL in &#39;86</a>, <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=701_1268549064">Iran in &#39;76</a>) that have multiple modes of observation and are thus hard to ignore. She also says the <a href="http://www.ufoevidence.org/topics/cometa.htm">COMETA Report</a> changed her views. </p>

<p>Kaku notes that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_hypothesis">ETH</a> isn&#39;t that far fetched if you consider the possibility of an ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale#Energy_use">Type III Civilization</a> sending out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_spacecraft">Von Neumann Probes</a> to explore the galaxies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. First of all i&#39;ve never seen, talked to, or interacted with an ET that I am aware of. My story really isn&#39;t that incredible, except that it is.</p>

<p>About 2 years ago I started following the work of a man named James Gilliland. He has a ranch in a little town called Trout Lake, Washington at the base of Mt. Adams. He is a very wise and spiritually enlightened man, but he wouldn&#39;t tell you that, and it&#39;s what is happening at his ranch that is truly amazing. They have had ongoing contact at the ranch for quite some time and anyone can set up a tent and camp down there for a small donation to his non-profit foundation. Almost ever night, UFO&#39;s buzz over the ranch (they are very high up) and basically shine powerful lights down to say &quot;hello&quot; to everyone on the ground. The folks at the ranch call it &quot;powering up.&quot;</p>

<p>Well I learned of this and started following James and listening to his weekly radio broadcasts. A theme on the show was that you don&#39;t have to go to the ranch or get special training from anyone to make contact -- it&#39;s actually our responsibility to make contact on an individual basis. The government isn&#39;t doing it, they just intercept and attempt to shoot them out of the sky. We are the ones who are responsible for greeting these visitors and collectively asking for their help in turning our world around. </p>

<p>Maybe about 4-6 months after I began meditating nightly on seeing a ship (I actually would go for walks and hold this intention), a ship appeared around sunset one night. It was totally random. I already knew intellectually that this was happening, but seeing it was something else entirely. It was truly a magnificent experience. I walked out my back door, looked up, and saw a metallic sphere hovering at about standard airline cruising height. A small red orb appeared beneath it and then slowly began moving upward toward the craft itself. Suddenly, the sphere turned into a small point of light and then disappeared just like that. Since then I have had several more experiences, but this has already turned into a small essay.</p>

<p>And while I can agree to that idea, I would have to assume that the brain and soul are probably one in the same to continue with my chosen dogma - scientific reason - and work it into the thought that we&#39;re all connected at some level. I&#39;m much more of an evolutionary biologist than a conspiracy theorist, which as it turns out might end up leading us back to ancient astronauts, we&#39;ll just have to wait and hopefully see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Science and spirituality need not be mutually exclusive. Religion, yes, but our spirituality is as much a part of reality as anything we can measure with our early 21st Century technology. </p>

<p>Next time you are lying in bed and have a thought, ask yourself who is experiencing that thought. Consciousness will never be explained via neuroscience or similar disciplines, because it exists outside of the body. Not to discount the beautiful thing that it is, but in the end the human body is only an earthsuit.</p>

It doesn&#39;t surprise me though, there are sites all over the world that academia simply cannot acknowledge because it&#39;s too game changing. If the above story is true, it will simply fail to garner mainstream attention.</p>

<p>Personally, though, I think it&#39;s quite possible that my Grandma is going to live to see some game changing events and uncoverings. At this point it&#39;s really just a question of getting the information out, not a question of whether crazy shit is going down or not.</p>

This is crazy, you are the second person i&#39;ve run into on Reddit alone who talked about orbs around the ship!

See where I&#39;m going with this?  Humans are customized in the extreme for this planet...this miracle planet.  If aliens bodily came to this place what could they possibly teach us?  I mean <em>really</em>?  Would any sane species unleash humanity upon the stars by giving us technology?  <strong>People need to recognize</strong> that because we are <em>civilized</em> doesn&#39;t mean that we are Civilized.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting analogy with the toad and the fish, but I disagree. You asked what they could possibly teach us, well, how about how they got here to start with. UFOs = &quot;free energy&quot; from our perception. This would solve our energy crisis and everyone would have access to unlimited clean energy. Ocean water could be desalinated at will. The deserts could be brought to life. No one would need to go hungry or thirsty, and we could all travel the stars. Of course, that&#39;s just a start.</p>

<p>It is true that our biological, evolutionary minds are geared toward collective insanity. This is why we must evolve spiritually and raise our individual frequencies to a point where communication does indeed make sense between us and them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, I definitely hear what you are saying and I agree to a point. We are still at war with each other, and we are still mistreating the vast majority of our Earth brothers and sisters (lack of water, food, education, living standards). But I happen to believe the human race is at a turning point -- one that other people on other planets have gone through many times before.</p>

<p>Right now it is a relatively tiny number of controllers who dominate the planet and who are waging war and stopping necessary change from taking place. The average person (or at least a quickly expanding percentage of the population) wants equality, peace, and progress, and we will get it sooner rather than later.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Our own galaxy has some 70 000 light years in diameter, and a hundred billion stars in it. Even a travel at the 90% of speed of light would suffice to explore the galaxy back and forth with a few thousand spacecraft within a time span of e.g. one million years, which is really nothing in cosmic terms. Keep in mind that the faster you travel, the slowly time changes for you: e.g. if you traveled at the 99% of speed of light, the time would appear to flow 50x slower to you, and a 1000 ly journey could be completed in mere 20 years of your real aging. The only time that is lost for the traveler is in reference to the &quot;real&quot; world. This universe was designed to specifically enable advanced civilizations to explore their galactic neighborhood, but at the cost.</p>

I trust his word 100%.  So I am left with either he had a crazy moment or he actually saw aliens because I don&#39;t believe he is lying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would you go about explaining sightings in the 1940s and 1950s? We barely had the technology to create fighter jets let alone the ability to create aircraft that could stop, hover and change directions on a dime. One pretty high profile example of such a sighting was in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmCYH3uOV5c&amp;amp;feature=related">1952 over Washington DC</a>. They even held a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcRtkA1Rmvw">press conference</a> a few weeks later and the Air Force stated they had no idea what the objects were.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you happen to catch the recent episode &quot;Underwater Worlds&quot;?? There was a guy who showed up in there named David Wilcock, he is a really interesting character and you might want to check him out if you are interested in the subject. Even more relevant to the subject is Graham Hancock who also makes frequent appearances on the show. He is truly convincing on the subject of civilizations on earth existing far longer ago than is currently acknowledged by academia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t been interested in UFOlogy for quite some time because it only goes so far, but <em>Out of the Blue</em> is, I think, considered more or less the gold standard by the community. There is also a sequel of sorts called I <em>Know What I Saw</em> (I think it was by the same man). You should be able to find them both full length on Google Video or chopped up on YouTube.</p>

<p>Up until a couple years ago i&#39;d watched pretty much every documentary on the subject, and I know i&#39;ve seen better docs than the one I just mentioned, but I can&#39;t come up with one off the top of my head. Anything on the Phoenix Lights will blow your mind. Even the then Governor of Arizona, Fife Symington (sp) saw these massive ships float over the city and later admitted to it, saying they were categorically not of this world.</p>

<p>Now, what I would really recommend is you skip the &quot;omg I saw something in the sky&quot; bs and go straight to the crux of the issue. Yes, the subject of UFOlogy is infinitely interesting but it always leaves you without an answer. <em>Contact Has Begun</em> is a documentary about the man I mentioned above, James Gilliland, who has UFOs buzz over his ranch in Trout Lake, Washington just about every night to say hello to his visitors (and <em>anyone</em> can go see it for themselves). I&#39;m very much a &quot;show me&quot; person so I was immediately attracted to this when I heard about it. No more theoretical ideas, just experiences. Also, UFOs are just the tip of the iceburg as to what&#39;s happening out at the Ranch, so I wouldn&#39;t jump in with both feet. Get used to this stuff a little at a time or your mind might reject it to protect its own version of reality.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t recommend <em>Contact Has Begun</em> highly enough to you, even though it&#39;s not exactly what you asked for. Also available on Google and Youtube.</p>
