       When I was younger I was really into the whole UFO stuff but now that I'm older I don't really believe it anymore. I feel like that whole subculture has largely died out. It seems like if it was real, more concrete evidence would be available, especially in the age of the internet. Too bad.. it was exciting back in the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still want to believe :)

       not saying this, but -- they are already here and have been for a loooong time. Reptilians, those Nephilim guys and the Nibiru guys who are on their way... On the other hand there are the Luciferian master race controlling everything and waiting for the great harvest in a few years. They hope to guide humanity in such a way that we as individuals are able to enter the 4:th density. Do a Google search for "Hidden Hand", a great read (Q&amp;A) no matter if you believe this stuff or not.

       Ok, so he lost me a bit when he started talking matter-of-factly about a new currency by the end of 2009, which obviously didn't happen. However, he seems to be aware of the Law of One, which to me gives credibility to his claim to be well-studied in spirituality, one of 6 overall subjects the Illuminati focus on. I must admit I have been pulled in by this guy, whether he is legitimate or not.

       Yeah, that's how I feel, it doesn't really matter if he's is hoaxing all the was to Herp-Derpville. It's sill an interesting read. Dates and stuff should never really be mentioned when doing stuff like this, by HH I mean. I started researching the Law of One after reading this but it was a while back and it's not exactly a subject to take lightly.

       This is one of the most Interesting articles I've ever read. I'm now on a mission to meditate daily and keep my eyes on the heavens. While reading this I TRULY felt a moment of "world revolving around me" clarity. Impossible to explain. The fact that he was responding to random questions in such a short time, with insanely deep, consistent, and profound points, is worth a second look alone.

       Whether I like it or not, this ONE article has changed my daily view on life and relationships.

       The evidence that extraterrestrials are here and have been here for a very long time is overwhelming. Exactly what evidence are you waiting for? Would you like them to land on the White House lawn? Well, that's not going to happen because they are looking for intelligent life too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth of the matter is that the U.S. military-industrial complex is perfectly aware of the extraterrestrial presence. To them, they are invaders who must be shot down on site. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by the subculture "dying out," but I can tell you more people are awake and aware today than ever before, and the evidence couldn't be more massively abundant,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       with the internet! The evidence is so massive, so overwhelmingly obvious that I hardly know where to start. Presidents, Governors, other heads of state, senators, congressmen, pilots, high-ranking military officials, NASA scientists, Defense Ministers, and all kinds of other high-profile people have come out saying they have witnessed or are aware of the extraterrestrial presence and/or the hyper-advanced technology that goes along with it. Photos and videos are abundant online. There are so many undeniable case studies that I don't know how anyone could ever go from believing to not believing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said above, our military greets them with missiles and other advanced scalar weaponry we haven't even been told about. It is up to us on an individual basis to make contact. It is not up to the government or anyone else to
       <strong>
        "tell"
       </strong>
       us they are here. Raise your own frequency to a level where you stand out to them and you will have sightings. They will come almost as cheerleaders to prod you along your own spiritual evolution. Don't believe me? Well, buy a plane ticket and fly to Trout Lake, Washington and visit James Gilliland's ranch. Just one night is all it will take.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rejoin us, my friend, for you already had the truth.

       I haven't been interested in UFOlogy for quite some time because it only goes so far, but
       <em>
        Out of the Blue
       </em>
       is, I think, considered more or less the gold standard by the community. There is also a sequel of sorts called I
       <em>
        Know What I Saw
       </em>
       (I think it was by the same man). You should be able to find them both full length on Google Video or chopped up on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until a couple years ago i'd watched pretty much every documentary on the subject, and I know i've seen better docs than the one I just mentioned, but I can't come up with one off the top of my head. Anything on the Phoenix Lights will blow your mind. Even the then Governor of Arizona, Fife Symington (sp) saw these massive ships float over the city and later admitted to it, saying they were categorically not of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what I would really recommend is you skip the "omg I saw something in the sky" bs and go straight to the crux of the issue. Yes, the subject of UFOlogy is infinitely interesting but it always leaves you without an answer.
       <em>
        Contact Has Begun
       </em>
       is a documentary about the man I mentioned above, James Gilliland, who has UFOs buzz over his ranch in Trout Lake, Washington just about every night to say hello to his visitors (and
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       can go see it for themselves). I'm very much a "show me" person so I was immediately attracted to this when I heard about it. No more theoretical ideas, just experiences. Also, UFOs are just the tip of the iceburg as to what's happening out at the Ranch, so I wouldn't jump in with both feet. Get used to this stuff a little at a time or your mind might reject it to protect its own version of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't recommend
       <em>
        Contact Has Begun
       </em>
       highly enough to you, even though it's not exactly what you asked for. Also available on Google and Youtube.

       This. And if anything is alien in origin, or if they are here, they're working with our leaders because conscious nature is the same throughout the universe... they 'understand' that they need to rule us, and for providing tech to us, are allowed to pick off a few of us a year, drug us, shove something up our butt and drop us a few miles from home.

       There will always be apart of me that says "I want to believe." And ever since the show Ancient Aliens started airing I have been more and more convinced they were here at one point. Although no matter how much I want to believe, until some evidence pops up there will always be apart of me that says "maybe not." What I DO believe in is other life in the universe, I feel space is just too vast and random for there not to be other life out there, even if its just microbial.

       Did you happen to catch the recent episode "Underwater Worlds"?? There was a guy who showed up in there named David Wilcock, he is a really interesting character and you might want to check him out if you are interested in the subject. Even more relevant to the subject is Graham Hancock who also makes frequent appearances on the show. He is truly convincing on the subject of civilizations on earth existing far longer ago than is currently acknowledged by academia.

       Negative, fellow human.  The probability of Th'lurflian contact with the human race is infinitesimally low.  Please desist from inquiring anymore, because my calculations suggest this is a waste of effort and/or time.  Do not associate yourself with other fellow human beings who claim they have had contact with Th'lurflians or any other extraterrestrial beings.  They are frantic and ill-advised.  I bet my tentacles on it.

       Like I said, just telling the OP what my opinion is really. I just feel compelled when seeing posts like this to say "I am one who believes they exist". The details of my story are not something I wish to talk about in any case. Maybe I will one day, but that day is not today, sorry.

       I'm sorry to hear about your negative experiences. Just to make you aware, some people in the exopolitics community believe that many negative "abduction" type experiences are a result of advanced reverse-engineered government technology used to trick us into believing it's "them." I don't really know where exactly I fall on this, but I do believe the vast majority of ETs visiting our planet are benevolent.

       Sure. First of all i've never seen, talked to, or interacted with an ET that I am aware of. My story really isn't that incredible, except that it is.

       About 2 years ago I started following the work of a man named James Gilliland. He has a ranch in a little town called Trout Lake, Washington at the base of Mt. Adams. He is a very wise and spiritually enlightened man, but he wouldn't tell you that, and it's what is happening at his ranch that is truly amazing. They have had ongoing contact at the ranch for quite some time and anyone can set up a tent and camp down there for a small donation to his non-profit foundation. Almost ever night, UFO's buzz over the ranch (they are very high up) and basically shine powerful lights down to say "hello" to everyone on the ground. The folks at the ranch call it "powering up."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I learned of this and started following James and listening to his weekly radio broadcasts. A theme on the show was that you don't have to go to the ranch or get special training from anyone to make contact -- it's actually our responsibility to make contact on an individual basis. The government isn't doing it, they just intercept and attempt to shoot them out of the sky. We are the ones who are responsible for greeting these visitors and collectively asking for their help in turning our world around.
      </p>

       Maybe about 4-6 months after I began meditating nightly on seeing a ship (I actually would go for walks and hold this intention), a ship appeared around sunset one night. It was totally random. I already knew intellectually that this was happening, but seeing it was something else entirely. It was truly a magnificent experience. I walked out my back door, looked up, and saw a metallic sphere hovering at about standard airline cruising height. A small red orb appeared beneath it and then slowly began moving upward toward the craft itself. Suddenly, the sphere turned into a small point of light and then disappeared just like that. Since then I have had several more experiences, but this has already turned into a small essay.

       You understand that if you meditate and believe enough that a coffee mug can contact the dead, that that damn coffee cup will be contacting the dead at some point, right? The brain is powerful, but I dont know if we can contact other species with it yet.

      <p>
       And while I can agree to that idea, I would have to assume that the brain and soul are probably one in the same to continue with my chosen dogma - scientific reason - and work it into the thought that we're all connected at some level. I'm much more of an evolutionary biologist than a conspiracy theorist, which as it turns out might end up leading us back to ancient astronauts, we'll just have to wait and hopefully see.

       Next time you are lying in bed and have a thought, ask yourself who is experiencing that thought. Consciousness will never be explained via neuroscience or similar disciplines, because it exists outside of the body. Not to discount the beautiful thing that it is, but in the end the human body is only an earthsuit.

       I'm about the same age, and I completely agree. Thanks for the tip on that story, I will check it out. It doesn't surprise me though, there are sites all over the world that academia simply cannot acknowledge because it's too game changing. If the above story is true, it will simply fail to garner mainstream attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, though, I think it's quite possible that my Grandma is going to live to see some game changing events and uncoverings. At this point it's really just a question of getting the information out, not a question of whether crazy shit is going down or not.

       It was on Yahoo news on my work comp's homepage. Kinda laughed pretentiously at it being there, not gonna lie. I had the thought that all sorts of stuff, like arsenic metabolizing life and ancient sites, might be brought more to forefront by the media to distract from the embarrassment of the wikileaks data dumps.

       You might be interested in a book by a, hmm, I believe he is a microbiologist, Dr. Bruce Lipton. It's called Biology of Belief, and it's about epigenetics (and the ramifications for current Darwinian dogma) and the nature of the cell.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may agree with him or not, but the book would at least be worth a read for someone with your interests.

       You're not going believe me, I keep trying to think about how I could have been hallucinating but I was only 16 (28 now) years old and I have never done any drugs....
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets just say that what I saw in the sky equaled to at least 3 world trade centers, it was bullet shaped and had a chrome glow to it, around it were 3 or 4 different colored orbs flying around it; red, green, blue and if I remember correctly a violet or purple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I turned my head to tell my brother to see and it was gone, it lasted about 10 seconds.

       Amazing!! You should read my other posts, I totally believe you. I've seen them on more than one occasion. This is crazy, you are the second person i've run into on Reddit alone who talked about orbs around the ship! Read my other post -- in my sighting this red orb appeared beneath the craft, then it slowly started moving up toward it. Then ZIP the craft was just a point of light then it was gone. It's so crazy that we both saw these orbs and even both called them orbs...
      </p>

       I can't imagine how crazy it would have looked if there were all different colors like that!

       What meaningful interaction could a Toad have with a Fish?  If by some miracle they could communicate, what would they say?  What value would that communication be?
See where I'm going with this?  Humans are customized in the extreme for this planet...this miracle planet.  If aliens bodily came to this place what could they possibly teach us?  I mean
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       ?  Would any sane species unleash humanity upon the stars by giving us technology?
       <strong>
        People need to recognize
       </strong>
       that because we are
       <em>
        civilized
       </em>
       doesn't mean that we are Civilized.  The human psyche is a deeply flawed fucked up reaction to a million years of death and disappointment and hunger.  Honestly...we are fucking insane as a species..we make no logical sense and we will eventually snuff out.  Some little green men will probably be watching with huge sighs of relief.

       Interesting analogy with the toad and the fish, but I disagree. You asked what they could possibly teach us, well, how about how they got here to start with. UFOs = "free energy" from our perception. This would solve our energy crisis and everyone would have access to unlimited clean energy. Ocean water could be desalinated at will. The deserts could be brought to life. No one would need to go hungry or thirsty, and we could all travel the stars. Of course, that's just a start.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is true that our biological, evolutionary minds are geared toward collective insanity. This is why we must evolve spiritually and raise our individual frequencies to a point where communication does indeed make sense between us and them.

       what I'm saying is...no sane species would come within a million miles of us.  They wouldn't give us technology willingly...we'd have to take it.   Would we happen upon a planet of brilliant, but psychotically blood thirsty killers and say "Ya know they just need to read Shakespeare and study Calculus and then they'll be OK!"
No...species would become like people.  If you had to choose from a room full of people to gift a life-changing education to....would you choose the vagrant with the blood stained hands or the book nerd who loves his fellow living creatures?

       Lol, I definitely hear what you are saying and I agree to a point. We are still at war with each other, and we are still mistreating the vast majority of our Earth brothers and sisters (lack of water, food, education, living standards). But I happen to believe the human race is at a turning point -- one that other people on other planets have gone through many times before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now it is a relatively tiny number of controllers who dominate the planet and who are waging war and stopping necessary change from taking place. The average person (or at least a quickly expanding percentage of the population) wants equality, peace, and progress, and we will get it sooner rather than later.

       Just my perspective.

       I certainly believe that we're not the only "intelligent" life in the universe. The problem is that's pretty much meaningless unless there exists the possibility to travel much faster than light.
Assuming it's possible, then sure I believe Aliens can come visit, and probably already have.

       Our own galaxy has some 70 000 light years in diameter, and a hundred billion stars in it. Even a travel at the 90% of speed of light would suffice to explore the galaxy back and forth with a few thousand spacecraft within a time span of e.g. one million years, which is really nothing in cosmic terms. Keep in mind that the faster you travel, the slowly time changes for you: e.g. if you traveled at the 99% of speed of light, the time would appear to flow 50x slower to you, and a 1000 ly journey could be completed in mere 20 years of your real aging. The only time that is lost for the traveler is in reference to the "real" world. This universe was designed to specifically enable advanced civilizations to explore their galactic neighborhood, but at the cost.

       Right, but this is all from the perspective of our current early 21st century understanding of physics and the cosmos. Keep in mind they could be thousands, millions of years more scientifically advanced than us. We have a pretty good understanding of what we know, but we don't know shit.

       I saw a flying saucer during the day - on a perfectly blue sky -  it was white in color - it made no noise - and it was moving toward a cloud.  It wasn't that high up off the ground.  I pulled over the road and watched it.  But it was definitely saucer shaped - it was no airplane - and as close as it was to me - I would have heard it.  But it made no noise whatsoever.  I now believe in disc shaped objects.  People are seeing UFO's.

       I would not believe in any thing related to alien visitors except for the fact that a very trusted person I know had a sighting that could be best described as seeing an alien ship.  I trust his word 100%.  So I am left with either he had a crazy moment or he actually saw aliens because I don't believe he is lying.

       All I have to say is, The Dogan(mabey wrong spelling, slightly drunk at work, pub.), look into how they ploted and mapped the star named after them and their alien visitor cave drawings, expressing an alien visitors.

       How would you go about explaining sightings in the 1940s and 1950s? We barely had the technology to create fighter jets let alone the ability to create aircraft that could stop, hover and change directions on a dime. One pretty high profile example of such a sighting was in
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmCYH3uOV5c&amp;amp;feature=related">
        1952 over Washington DC
       </a>
       . They even held a
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcRtkA1Rmvw">
        press conference
       </a>
       a few weeks later and the Air Force stated they had no idea what the objects were.

       You should at least
       <em>

       to take a look at the evidence. You might be surprised as to what you find out. :)

       i did, but never found anything convincing and to be honest, in this day and age w/ easy possibilities of digital manipulation i don't think i would trust even a high quality footage any more... nor have i met anyone irl... so until i see something myself i will stay a sceptic

       If you are worried about digital manipulation or manmade technology (both of which explain many so-called UFO sightings), Google the Battle of Los Angeles. Yeah, that really happened.

       Did you happen to catch the recent episode "Underwater Worlds"?? There was a guy who showed up in there named David Wilcock, he is a really interesting character and you might want to check him out if you are interested in the subject. Even more relevant to the subject is Graham Hancock who also makes frequent appearances on the show. He is truly convincing on the subject of civilizations on earth existing far longer ago than is currently acknowledged by academia.

       I haven't been interested in UFOlogy for quite some time because it only goes so far, but
       <em>
        Out of the Blue
       </em>
       is, I think, considered more or less the gold standard by the community. There is also a sequel of sorts called I
       <em>
        Know What I Saw
       </em>
       (I think it was by the same man). You should be able to find them both full length on Google Video or chopped up on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until a couple years ago i'd watched pretty much every documentary on the subject, and I know i've seen better docs than the one I just mentioned, but I can't come up with one off the top of my head. Anything on the Phoenix Lights will blow your mind. Even the then Governor of Arizona, Fife Symington (sp) saw these massive ships float over the city and later admitted to it, saying they were categorically not of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what I would really recommend is you skip the "omg I saw something in the sky" bs and go straight to the crux of the issue. Yes, the subject of UFOlogy is infinitely interesting but it always leaves you without an answer.
       <em>
        Contact Has Begun
       </em>
       is a documentary about the man I mentioned above, James Gilliland, who has UFOs buzz over his ranch in Trout Lake, Washington just about every night to say hello to his visitors (and
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       can go see it for themselves). I'm very much a "show me" person so I was immediately attracted to this when I heard about it. No more theoretical ideas, just experiences. Also, UFOs are just the tip of the iceburg as to what's happening out at the Ranch, so I wouldn't jump in with both feet. Get used to this stuff a little at a time or your mind might reject it to protect its own version of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't recommend
       <em>
        Contact Has Begun
       </em>
       highly enough to you, even though it's not exactly what you asked for. Also available on Google and Youtube.
