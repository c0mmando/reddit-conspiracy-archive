       Okay, full disclaimer: I don't agree with the truther movement, and I believe that Al Qaeda was behind the 9/11 attacks, directed by Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my question is, whats the deal with thermite? From what I have read, thermite could come from a large variety of source, from welding to explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also see the presence of thermite often used as proof of explosives. Can someone explain this argument to me? How can you differentiate regular-thermite from government-conspiracy thermite?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not trying to be facetious, just hoping someone has an explanation for this. I'm not anti-truther, I'm pro-truth. So please explain this in a logical fashion. Thanks!
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Changed Pakistan to Afghanistan, though not sure it matters since I've already been downvoted. I'm not here to argue, I'm here because

       In the circles I've gone round and through, which is a crucial step you may also take - just start going through 9/11 research sites (some place like
       <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/">
        http://911research.wtc7.net/
       </a>
       ) and read what you can about whatever details you're interested in because thermite is only the start of our worries.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll go ahead and say the sciency keywords I've learned and may be misusing, which is why it's better to point you in the direction of the papers and documentation. Thermite is distinguished from thermate, the latter of which has sulfur added to it. Otherwise all you need is aluminum and iron oxide - the aluminum and oxygen bond, creating molten iron and an exothermic reaction. Of course you need the proper proportions and it's usually in powdered form. It's not used as an explosive but as an incendiary, for melting steel in military applications, primarily demolitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nanothermite however is still a thermite compound, the difference being that the material put together is on a much smaller scale, the elements being built up at the molecular scale. It's almost like shrinking ordinary thermite, or just building it up fractionally, but all the proportions remain the same. Thermite could potentially result in a natural reaction where the necessary elements and conditions are present, but nanothermite can only be engineered by the human hand, because the pieces are simply too small and precise. An analogy could be finding DNA in seawater.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the red/grey chips that are found in the dust are characterized by even, orderly molecular configurations that result in shapes and angles that appear entirely artificial. Saying they're byproducts of the collapse is like saying crop circles are the effects of wind. There is geometry and mathematical precision to the material, at a scale where you need a microscope to see it. This is as far as I need to understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look into the Jeff Farrer or Niels Harrit interviews if you want a step-by-step explanation of the Steven Jones hypothesis, which is really just observation of the evidence.

       I'm glad you appreciate the information but just checking to see what other people think of my explanation of the facts is not going to change them. I think I know what part you're not entirely convinced by, and that's the matter of perfect molecular geometry at any size being susceptible to natural occurrence, which in this case would be from heat and pressure. EDIT #2: I just realized that this doesn't make any logical sense because nothing that happened on 9/11 should be considered natural or happenstance. This is what the search for truth should be all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I would say Jeff Farrer's interview is required viewing because of the level of detail to which he describes the likelihood of the drywall or other office debris providing the material to jerry-rig nanothermite in a manner consistent enough to cover every single dust sample collected... Just watch the interview.

       Okay, so this seems to be somewhat convincing (and the first evidence I've seen that the thermite may be unique and identifiable as explosive). R/conspiratard has led me to believe that Bentham is a junk science journal, and its not peer reviewed. This is slightly off topic, but care to convince me that Bentham is a reliable source? Or do you have a peer reviewed source? Thanks!

       The publishers at Bentham say their articles are peer reviewed. Herkimer and others of his ilk say they are not. I'll let you decide for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bentham is not the source. The scientists that wrote the article are the source. Bentham is only the publisher and, being an open journal, one of the only places that would make the article available to anyone that wanted to see it as opposed to the normal pay-to-see journals that professionals have preferred in the past because there's money in it.

       So many good points there. I love how people who demand only content from journals that are peer reviewed never consider that the bigger the journal the more it depends on leadership deciding which peers they permit to review their journal. If your conclusions go against the grain then you're not a peer. When did peer pressure, majority rule, and the messenger trump the message?

       As a general principle, peer reviewed journals have more credibility in science than non-peer reviewed journals.

       What I question is thinking that an arbitrary amount of peer review increases or decreases the legitimacy of any thing, if the thing being reviewed doesn't or can't change in the process; if the qualities of the original observations are unchanged. The findings of one peer cannot be trumped by a majority of other peers - look at someone like Galileo - there really is no method except democracy for peer-review science to sustain itself, because vary rarely is there such a thing as a real peer - the only thing that matters is truth in evidence, not truth in making conclusions from evidence, unfortunately, because that already steps into the realm of conjecture, though for some reason we don't mind when the scientific community does so, except when it suggests that the public at large is wrong about something, hence the line of anti-intellectualism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Experiments should be conducted in an easily-repeatable manner so that the original results can be confirmed, but that still means those experiments had been made and presented by the discoverer, the individual who comes up with conclusions first. He or she is responsible for the entire setup before anyone else takes their own stab at it. Most people then read the report and if it's "done well" and not missing any holes as far as human logic can reason from the data shown then they're not very likely to question the conclusions and thus go along with the experimenter's assumptions, because after all he or she is the one most familiar with the details, and it takes more than time to run experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're telling me all peer review journals maintain a staff that actually independently (that means every peer individual working there) conducts every experiment suggested to the journal and then compare results, rather than do mere fact-checking CIA-style, then I'd be much impressed that there are enough resources to replicate such sophisticated procedures, but then each report we read would be written by the journal, it wouldn't be the one submitted to it. What actually happens is that an experiment is limited by the abilities of its creator, and his or her capacity to get help and advice from colleagues before the report is completed and submitted to the journal. All significant review has to have already been completed for the so-called peer review journal to accept a hypothesis as having been thoroughly tested.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem isn't the word review but the word peer. Who or what organization could count as a peer of NIST? Would NIST be open to suggestion that another, "independent" organization repeat every one of the steps they took in putting their NC-STAR masterpiece together? Why is such a request met with scorn and skepticism by supporters of the official government theory? Yet all we'd be asking for is an additional peer review. It really is arbitrary because you still need some number of accepted peers already to vote on whether they accept a new one. The idea of scientific consensus is still mired in public opinion.

       Thermite is a very exothermic reduction-oxidisation reaction, it's not an explosive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thermite is used in cutting lances in welding.

       Cutting Lances were used to cut the remaining steel beams after the incident.

       Herkimer has been debunked hundreds of times here on reddit and at digg before that. The only thing I can say is to review his claims and sources and then do the same for these.

       In November 2007, the Corriere della Sera reported that Cossiga had declared that everyone knew that 9/11 had been engineered by the CIA and Mossad with the "help of the Zionist world" to discredit the Arabs. He was, of course, being ironic – though this did not stop the statement circulating all over the internet. –

       It seems ironic that you would turn around and focus on questioning someone else's theory - I mean you've stated that you think it was Osama bin Laden yet you lack evidence. Not to mention the fact that he isn't even wanted by the FBI in connection.

       is thermite proof of explosives if there are other causes of thermite? I don't mean to challenge you on this, but
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       can people tell if thermite residue is explosive, and can you cite who has performed this test?

       It's not a matter of "residue," so much as "unreacted thermite."  The purpose of its deployment, furthermore, is not to simply explode the whole building, but to initiate a controlled structural collapse, by critically weakening the core support columns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here is what completely verifies this theory:

        here
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how the columns are cut diagonally, at an angle of about 65 degrees, so that the columns will simply slide off, initiating a collapse.  Then, keeping that in mind, view this video:

      </p>
      <p>
       and notice how the steel columns collapse into their own footprint, as if dissected in multiple places.
      </p>
      <p>
       The metal from the collapse was, in spite of laws requiring the retention of evidence, shipping overseas immediately to be reforged:

       It's a shame there was never a criminal investigation into 9/11. It's a shame that no forensic evidence was ever examined by the law or even by the insurance company. If there had been an actual investigation, maybe we wouldn't be asking these questions over 9 years later.

       I've studied the evidence in-depth and can propose plausible explanations for every assertion of the 911 truther movement, except two:
      </p>
      <p>
       1). WTC 7 wasn't hit by an airplane, and the fires inside weren't fueled by jet fuel like in WTC 1 and 2. There's no way WTC 7 came down on its own. That was a controlled demolition. Remember: 3 buildings fell that day, but only two were hit by jets.
      </p>
      <p>
       2). The thermite found in the four WTC dust samples from four different locations was engineered, so unless the gov't had a huge stockpile of this stuff inside the towers, there's no explaining how it ended up there. I've heard there's only one lab in the world that can create nano-thermite. I won't mention where it is because nothing can be proved.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        is the piece of evidence that is most bothersome. Turn it over, look at it from every direction and ask how a 40-something story skyscraper fell straight down in 6.5 seconds when it wasn't hit by a plane. No way does a building pancake like that on its own. Never in the history of skyscrapers and fires has anything happened like that. Hope that info helps...

       1) Falling buildings generally produce debris,

       The best evidence is in the videos of the demolition. A building that is on fire, hit from debris, does not fall straight down in 6.5 seconds. Just doesn't happen -- talk to any demolitions expert or civil engineer. The building would crumble and tip, not fall straight down (which is hard enough to pull off even by demolitions experts). And say for instance the building was damaged beyond repair and had to come down. Explosives couldn't be set up so quickly in a burning building. The explosives had to already be in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my "entire argument," other people posting here have given mountains of evidence and links. I only pointed out the facts that tipped me from skeptical of the truther claims to almost sure that WTC 1, 2 and 7 were controlled demolitions. When I reviewed the evidence presented by the 911 Engineers and Architects for Truth (at last count, over 900 professionals have risked their careers to bring this info to the public), I had to agree that the official conspiracy theory presented by the 911 Commission and media is simply too full of holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the firefighters saying "pull it," I have no fucking clue. Why did the BBC report that WTC 7 had fallen, while it still stood? Why were two vans full of explosives found in NYC that day? Why were Israeli Mossad agents, posing as movers, cheering as the planes hit? Why was World Trade Center security shut down the weekend before the attack? How did solid steel melt in a jet-fuel fire that couldn't possibly get hot enough to melt steel without the presence of an incendiary? Why were Mossad agents posing as art students centered in areas of the U.S. where the hijackers lived? Why was air security over the eastern U.S. so lax that day?

       Same old circumstantial 'evidence' that's been parroted many a time before. I'm not even going to bother countering all them as I've done many a times before and it does nothing to sway someone set in their viewpoint.

        ad hominem

        There indeed is a shortage of actual structural engineers who claim WTC was demolished with explosives. This page lists well over 1000 certified structural engineers, certified by the Structural Engineering Certification Board (SECB) of The National Council of Structural Engineers Association. And that is just certified structural engineers in United States, Puerto Rico &amp; Virgin Islands, certified in 2005 or later. Consider, how many thousands of more of structural engineers there are worldwide. And how many of these over 1000 certified structural engineers question the events of 9/11?

       You're right, the architects and engineers signed a petition for a new investigation, not to claim for sure that WTC was demolished. What I want to know is how three buildings collapsed within their own footprints at free-fall speeds, when in the history of high-rise fires there's never been a single collapse? Answer that for me and I'll go back to watching the night sky for alien motherships.

       If your advanced enough, try to get some World trade center steel, have it analyzed for thermite, learn the difference between the different type of thermite.

       those two should be a great start for you, any real American will investigate this Conspiracy to it's fullest without bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill tell you though there is a lot of evidence that this was a Israeli Mossad Operation against America, to bring the US into a War against the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israeli's attacked the US before, search the USS Liberty, where Israeli's killed a bunch of US navy and sunk that ship. They tried to make it look like Egypt did it so that the US would attack Egypt.

       i know most of the crime scene evidence was shipped to china, but some people have some saved, its possible to see what's inside the steel, the exterior would be far too contaminated by now, but even that should show some thermite.

       And I'll bite, you idiot. Jet fuel doesn't burn hot enough to melt steel. however, jet fuel burns hot enough to cause steel to lose 90% of its structural integrity. it's not a simple case of 1499 Degrees steel is fine, then 1500 it suffers a catastrophic collapse. Notwithstanding the office furniture, drywall, carpeting, paper, desks, curtains, the other 1000 possible combustible items, oh and remember how the jet fuel was delivered, via a plane. that kinda affects integrity of buildings too. they're not designed to have jets parked in them.

       There were measurements taken on 9/11 and there are people who claim that they were running down the stairs and there were explosions in the lobby. A fireman said a third explosion and the building will collapse.

       How about extremely unlikely?  It's impossible to be completely certain about most things, including whether or not 9/11 was an inside job.  I'm comfortable if I can conclude the it is extremely unlikely that my government perpetrator behind the event.

      <p>
       Again, prove to me that the molten metal people saw in the ruins of the towers was steel, not aluminum.  Also, explain to me why molten steel in the ruins weeks after the towers collapsed indicates that thermite was combusted.  After all, the combustion of thermite is an extremely vigorous reaction, and it would have all combusted within seconds, not weeks.

       The aluminum came from the bodies of the aircraft and office furnishings.  It melted due to the fires in the building.  It pooled because the floors were sagging since the girders were all softened by the flames.

       There is a paper on the molten liquid as seen by millions of people dripping from WTC towers before the collapse. Simply,
       <a href="http://journalof911studies.com/letters/MoltenWhat2.pdf">
        the conclusion of this analysis is inescapable. The liquid metal was molten iron.

      <p>
       Calculations have shown that the floors would have sagged due to the heat below them.  The thin cement floor would create a surface where the aluminum could collect and be heated by flames below.

       Again, how does thermite explain this?  You're the one making the claim that molten some weeks later is evidence of thermite.

       Okay, so this seems to be somewhat convincing (and the first evidence I've seen that the thermite may be unique and identifiable as explosive). R/conspiratard has led me to believe that Bentham is a junk science journal, and its not peer reviewed. This is slightly off topic, but care to convince me that Bentham is a reliable source? Or do you have a peer reviewed source? Thanks!

       How about extremely unlikely?  It's impossible to be completely certain about most things, including whether or not 9/11 was an inside job.  I'm comfortable if I can conclude the it is extremely unlikely that my government perpetrator behind the event.

       Prove to me it was steel, not aluminum.

      <p>
       Again, prove to me that the molten metal people saw in the ruins of the towers was steel, not aluminum.  Also, explain to me why molten steel in the ruins weeks after the towers collapsed indicates that thermite was combusted.  After all, the combustion of thermite is an extremely vigorous reaction, and it would have all combusted within seconds, not weeks.

       You're right, the architects and engineers signed a petition for a new investigation, not to claim for sure that WTC was demolished. What I want to know is how three buildings collapsed within their own footprints at free-fall speeds, when in the history of high-rise fires there's never been a single collapse? Answer that for me and I'll go back to watching the night sky for alien motherships.
