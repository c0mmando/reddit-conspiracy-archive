       There is a growing sentiment that more often than not the US's leading politicians and corporations aren't acting in the best interests of the populace. It just feels like a significant segment of them have given up on fixing the economy and are getting ready to throw the masses under the bus as they search for the best way to squeeze out a few more pennies.

       To get to a place where America doesn't become a total dystopian calamity, we are going to have to rethink almost everything that we do. The changes necessary to end up as a relatively prosperous and enjoyable place to live are going to have to be enormous, we are going to have to abandon a lot of things that are really useless and pointless. Keeping up with the Joneses is going to have to be seen as the aberrant behavior it is. And the system that encourages it has to go. Plus the trend towards putting in place a police state has to stop.
Sadly, I don't see any good signs. It's most likely going to lurch along until it finally implodes, and what comes out the other side is going to depend on whether we have Ghandi or Pol Pot at the helm when the dust settles.

       This is true, and not many agree with me here -&gt; I feel that Anarchism, even in a split-second in terms of overall timelines, is what bring about change. People throw off every chain that held them back and dive into chaos for a short time so that they can rebuild. I'm not an Anarchist at heart because honestly, it's pure madness to have to have to deal with every contradiction to it... but I do feel it is the only way to segue from the mess we have ourselves in now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uberlizard has good points as well - We have to 'rethink' everything. Which means making peace with the fact that things have changed first. And face it, how many people dwell on ex's?
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll have to not only retool the educational system, but as a people, LOVE knowledge - again, how many people have looked at you funny for knowing something obscure - it's "weird" to know stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll have to look at the institutions of culture that are taxed for some reason, and happily abolish them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll have to, as a people,
       <em>
        decide
       </em>
       to
       <strong>
        FREELY
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        PEACEFULLY
       </strong>
       live together, sharing everything we can. I honestly believe that the only road to peace is going to come from a single frame of mind. Unlike the Luciferians, Rhodesians, Illuminated, or what have you's - I don't think people should be forced into that single frame of mind, especially unknowingly. I don't believe in World Government, I believe in no government, just a state of being that we evolve to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be a pipe dream, but it might also, and I hope so, be a vision of the future. Even if it is distant as all hell from now.

       Thanks for putting this like this. I've been having trouble communicating this to people effectively, and so they usually take it as offense to them and their country. As a Canadian, I can just hope that whatever good comes of any changes ripple upwards as well, because our country isn't what it used to be these days either.

       Honestly, I think a huge step in changing the American political landscape, would be a substantial return to State's rights being more prevalent and utilized more. I can't really comment on the Canadian parliament...
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that holds back a unified people is the corruption of the human spirit. There are enough resources on the plant to sustain the life of everyone alive now, and more, if they are properly used. The standard of living could be raised for everyone, exponentially, if things ran on a utopian level. This is pretty clear by how much shit is wasted in the Western world that could be put to good use in the third.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is partly why I'm a skeptic on anthropogenic global warming. I think we contribute, a measurable but still small amount to the problem. The universe does so much shit that we don't fully understand, and solar storms effect our planet for millennia for all we know. I look at Vietnam, Thailand, China, India, basically the entire Asian continent and large parts of Russia as well, and see billions of two-cycle engines roaring in mopeds, taxi carts, you name it... I'm not saying it justifies anything I selfishly do here that has an impact on the planet, I'm just saying that those of us in these hemispheres are bombarded with propaganda because we are the ones who keep the wheels of the world turning. Fool the people who
       <strong>
        spend
       </strong>
       into thinking they are helping to save the world (a very heroic frame of mind to put people in) and you can easily turn a profit while continuing the practices that made you rich, and selling a problem and solution together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I went off on that tangent because even 'thinking people' get stuck in dogma and ideal, and don't stop to notice things like this for the most part. We're all so caught up in ourselves that even when we try to act globally, it's convoluted. Thank the politico's who took over that movement in the 80's... I understand why people have empirical mindsets because I'm passionate about conservation and being earth friendly myself and would love to convert everyone to my state of thinking - but how then do I justify playing God?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that question there that people fail to ask or answer for themselves, and it has gotten us into some big friggin' messes over the last 100,000 years.

       Um....Ghandi hated black people in an open vocal manner. He was for the Hindu, in a very nice effective manner, but........very very racist.

       He also supported the caste system, so.........

       Take a look at any of the players involved and you can see from a management perspective that they know their goose is cooked, that they have no chance and no future and they are all collectively trying to loot as much as they can before the curtain or guillotine falls.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why Goldman are paying out their entire earnings (which itself is based on stolen, fraudulent or embezzled money but thats another story) in profits to their constituent staff rather than investing and growing the business like any normal sane company. All the investment banks are doing the same, its a 'lets split the loot and scram' mentality that is pervasive in criminal groups for the simple reason that it makes it harder for law enforcement to freeze the stolen funds (because the company as an entity doesn't have any!) as they have to instead pursue each and every member of staff as an individual to recover their ill-gotten gains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is classic anti-predator herd mentality, like gazelles scattering before a lion charge. And this is a microcosm of what's happening to the US as a whole but with creditor nations like China and a whole slew of pissed off international law firms and insurance companies.

       There is no doubt in my mind that is what's happening.  That's why I am doing the same thing (on a much smaller scale of course).  I will see how long I last. . . I'm guessing longer than most others.

       I really wouldn't be so concerned if people would wake up . . . but they won't.

       This past week I was talking to a friend about Wikileaks and our conversation was ended abruptly when she asked "what's wikileaks". Between that and the crazy religious people,  I have no hope for our society and no faith in our policymakers.

       I feel that way too some times, but wow, this is an amazing time to be alive. The fact that wiki leaks exists say's a lot about our species given our history... We are discovering more about how nature works, how to save lives, how to be cool to each other more than any generation before us and it's all unfolding in front of our eyes. This is all history in the making and even though the stakes are a bit scary but we're all in together.
Things like Gates and Buffett giving away a huge chunk of their cash, Wiki leaks, Wikipedia, the fricken internet! where you can have these kinds of conversations without fear of prosecution (for now ;( )

       I know this is a relatively small subreddit, but instead of asking for a DAE circlejerk, could you just state your opinion in the title?  And what is your basis for saying "there is a growing sentiment that more often than not ..."  it's this kind of foolish statement with lack of citation that makes all of the tinfoil hatters look insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I tend to agree with you, but I have no evidence of motivation to present so I am not going to make any presumptions or make baseless statements of fact.

       Many months or or even years ago, music was written was predicting what you say now.  Here are just a few interesting examples:

      <p>
       Wait's the lone, supreme commander
      </p>
      <p>
       From the boys from Charlie-Street
      </p>
      <p>
       And he waits for inspiration

       When he's running with the mob

      <p>

       Sadly, I have felt this way for a while, as well. We seem to make some small improvements as time goes by. Many things are better than they were in the past, but we are very far away from the America we are supposed to be. The things that are happening in our government to make it easier for corporations to squeeze more and more money from all of us are really terrifying. I have really been trying to decide whether or not to begin a the process of transitioning to another country. You used the "sinking ship" metaphor, it that situation, do you abandon ship or go down with it? Personally, I would prefer not to go down on a ship that is sinking because those that we have chosen to take care of and protect said ship are actively sabotaging it. I ask myself "how bad do things have to get before it is time to find something else?". As of right now, I dont know.

       One encouraging sign.  2 years ago it seemed only 1 in 10 people I knew had any clue about what was happening.  Recently I've made a point of starting conversations with people I work with etc. and find that nearly half are making some preparations for a financial dowturn(major) and seem to "get it".  And those are just the ones that will talk about it.  I feel there are some that believe in keeping it to themselves.

       Think about it, Americans are a very large and spend happy population. Why would the corporations drain us for all we have and move on when they could keep us around and exploit our consumerism to it's fullest as they have been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the corps just had their most profitable year ever, but they can't keep that up if the middle class gets taken completely out of the picture as it looks like has been happening lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue what is wall street's next target? In the past few years they've exploited gas prices, home prices and fucked over the middle class severely in each case and profited enormously doing so, what will be the next thing they fuck over? It'll probably take some time as the middle class recovers, then they'll be ready and lubed up for the next round. Am I the only one noticing a pattern with this?

       No offense and I mean this with the utmost sincerity.

       Your attitude is this country's problem.  We are arrogant, ignorant and apathetic! We are not on this planet alone.  In terms of population we are not the most populated nation.  Businesses are global now.  We just have been good advertisement for these companies.  There are more people in Asia that have jobs now (jobs that we once had), people who are becoming consumers just like we showed them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it is possible for us to completely collapse.  Corporations will move along.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right, there is a pattern of boom and busts.  With every bust wealth is concentrated to fewer and fewer people.  This go round we are bankrupt.  It will catch up here soon, just when the last unemployment check is cashed.

       No offense taken. I think you misunderstood me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand what you're saying about the rest of the world. But hardly any other country has such a rabid taste of consumerism as America does.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't be ideal to abandon a place like the USA when we have a ripe population that has been immersed into this type of culture for half a century or more.
      </p>
      <p>
       A similar thing happened during the great depression, but the country bounced back, it just took a long time. I would like to think it takes more than a few douche bags with $ symbols in their eyes to destroy this country. You can point out all the bad, but don't leave out the good. We can be resilient when it comes down to it. Not all Americans are as dumb as the stereotype says.

       Maybe I am being a pessimist. . . that is possible. But I don't want to live through a depression unprepared.  There is for sure one coming, rather, one has already started.

       I don't think Americans are horrible dumbasses, I think they are not well informed and blissfully ignorant of the scams being run on them.  I think they are happy to be ignorant as long as they get to have their suv's, lattes and big screen tv.  When that's gone. . . what will they do?  Try to steal the beans that I saved. . . and I will shoot them! &lt; Joke, btw.

       no offense intended, either, and please look through some pictures of cities in different countries and regions with expansive outdoor advertising that might lend invalidity to your claim...

       well, you get the idea--even though many of the above searches recycle images from search-to-search, a short scroll/page through the images found reveals the point behind my statement--that most of the planet, by now, is being inundated with advertising, and impetus, to push consumerism...not in-and-of-itself a problem, actually--and the plain and obvious intent, by now, to manipulate People into blind, rabid consumers
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a problem...
      </p>
      <p>
       this goes for banking, too--and someone else made a similar point to the one which follows, earlier:
      </p>
      <p>
       any sane banking structure, whether an individual ORG or a cartel of groups, will work toward healthy,
       <em>
        stable growth
       </em>
       , and refrain from participating in bad-business (actually CORPORATE suicide) practices such as lending to large cross-sections of
       <strong>
        clients whom they know cannot pay, over the long haul
       </strong>
       ...just as any producer/distributor of goods knows that over-saturation of markets is damaging to both producer and consumer, over the long haul...
      </p>
      <p>
       seems like Self-Evident Truth, to me...

       Well, we live in a system. In this system we do not rely on our innate skills to hunt and gather any longer. That's been replaced by making money and "living easy" so to speak, and the excess time spent is basically for entertainment and socializing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be very difficult to stop spending money as that is directly tied with our survival in the system in which we've adapted and rely on to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be nice to have a set up in the middle of nowhere, hunt and grow your own food, rely on solar for electricity, dig a well ect.. That would be ideal and certainly worth looking into if you made that choice.

       That's the problem; there is no choice.  People don't have a choice to register their children for a social security number.  People don't have a choice to not send those children to school(or home school them using same criteria). People don't have the choice to live free, building and hunting without first registering your firearm, getting a license to hunt, paying taxes, etc.  We are not a free people with the choice to live in this "system" or not.  This system is forced upon us; some of us can see it and some of us can't.

       My kids don't have SSNs, no one is compelled to get one just for being born. Even as an adult, you are not required to have one, accepting it is a choice you make. And one can continue this way for quite some time. Many states have exceptions where you don't have to give a SSN for a DL as long as you can truthfully certify that you have never gotten one. (Don't lie about this, those who have ended up in legal trouble.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding sending kids to school or home schooling them, there certainly is a lot of freedom to do so, though it varies by state. In every state though people have found ways to do unschooling legally. Since unschooling is legal, more structured forms of education can certainly be legal as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hunt on your own property or that of someone you know without a hunting license. You can hunt without registering a firearm as long as you are not using a handgun. Rifles and shotguns do not require licenses in most of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxes you do have to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the things you have accepted as requirements are prisons within your own mind. This is common though, people assume things because the system likes them to assume it. For example, many people are claiming Mr. Assange is a criminal even though he has committed no crime under any nation's law. But they keep getting told he is a criminal, so they assume it is true. Likewise are ideas about guns, hunting, ID numbers, and education.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing stopping anyone from living off the grid, growing and produce what they use, in harmony with the environment, raising their children according to the customs of their culture and history, and living in a community of like minded individuals, if they want to and assuming they can find any and not drive them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do it. Anyone can.

       We are at the end stage of seeing our open system closed down. Naomi Wolf has an excellent talk on this subject. Once an open system has been closed there is no peaceful way back. It is my belief that this system that is rising is unsustainable and will collapse of its own weight. The deal is one has to stay out of the way as the empire collapses. Those of us that manage this will be the ones to put it back together. The ideas that true anarchy espouses will be useful on the other side of this collapse. They mean nothing now.

       That coffin thing is old, dumb, and thoroughly debunked. Talk to anyone in the mortuary business. Those are

       There are two ways of approaching the situation.  Economics and the power control structure.  When talking to my friend about economics and which option, currency or stock to buy we remind each other of "the agenda".  Basically yes, the elite are stealing as much money as they can before the US "goes under".
      </p>
      <p>
       Economically it is simple.  Short and medium term the big players and their agents are making a killing stealing money.  Their interest rates are 0.5% and they are using that money to buy anything domestically and internationally that they want.  Our money is being devalued to loan them money to do this.  The common people are being lured back into the market to invest and then plug will be pulled on both bonds and stocks when everything is lined up for them to steal the most possible.  Pensions will be taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       The larger picture is that there is a push towards larger regional blocks that are administered by banks, corporations and large bureaucracies.  The US dollar will be destroyed and it will be replaced by a regional currency or a basket type currency like the SDR (special drawing rights) that contains gold, yen, renminbi (yuan), sterling and possible euros.  Then all that will be necessary will be to secure permanent taxation methods since currency manipulations will not be reliable enough.  They will need to prove the stability of this new currency for some period of time so that is a priority.

       They've given up because people are lazy, irresponsible and don't want to work. No one forced you to take out that loan. No one forced you to swipe that card. You did that all on your own, because you were lazy, you didn't want to work for the nice things in your life. So don't blame them, blame the populace. The government, the Illuminati, whatever you want to call them, they are giving you exactly what you wanted, you wanted to be free from responsibility, but in doing so, you sold yourself. Welcome to the welfare state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "populace" is like a dog, it's been owned for so long, it expects the bowl of food to just be there for him, it can't work for the food, even if you released him, it doesn't know how to hunt. It doesn't want to hunt. It just wants the food. The dog will beg before his master, and out of love the master will give the dog food. The dog has no right to sneer at the hand that feeds it. It didn't want to be independent, it didn't want to work, it gave itself up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep swiping your cards America, keep avoiding responsibility. The people don't want to work more, they want to work less and get paid more, keep increasing wage, keep taking out loans for things you can't afford. Stay on unemployment, you don't want to work, collect your checks, collect your food...sacrifice your independence. I guess John F. Kennedy was lying when he said people want to be "free and independent." People want to be free from responsibility. The people's greed did this, their laziness did this. The government is giving you exactly what you asked for. You wanted the plate of food, and didn't want to do anything want to do anything for it. The government is there, giving out checks, providing all kinds of aid. The Banks are there, ready to give you a loan. You take their food, you eat it, and then when you get hungry again you have the audacity to sneer at them for not feeding you enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point your fingers at the bank. No one asked you to take out the loan. There were plenty of good houses in the neighborhood. Your greed, made you choose the one you couldn't afford. Your paycheck is coming in next week, but the new video game is coming out this weekend, swipe your card. You asked for the food, you got it. Your paycheck isn't as much as you hoped, you can't pay the game off. Point your finger at the bank, say its interest rates are too high, they charge too much...hide your irresponsibility behind your delusion. You borrowed the money, you bought the stocks. You borrowed the money, you used it for "investment". You borrowed money to buy the house. You borrowed money to go to school, you didn't want to work hard. The hand was there, ready to feed you if you did a good job as young pup, it didn't want ANYTHING in return then. You were irresponsible, you slept and ate all day. You think they are playing you? No, they love you, you are just busy playing yourself. You did this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't want to be owned? Quit trying to get the fruit without the labor! Quit going to the goldsmith! It has been centuries and no one has learned. Either accept the hand that feeds you as your master, or, you can hunt. You can be free and independent. So put your goddamn porky little finger down, you fat, lazy, irresponsible, delusional cancer. Get to work America. Fucking change it.

       Actually, Americans work longer hours than citizens of most other developed nations. And obesity in America is not simply a result of consumerism, but also due to the kind of foods made available to consumers; take, for instance, high fructose corn syrup needlessly added to most foods. Borrowing money to attend school does not mean Americans don't want to work hard. However, for most Americans - given the inflated price of a college education and an increasingly competitive job market - it is the only way to afford higher education. And those cards you are referring to: the problem for most credit card holders is not an inability to pay their original debt, but the inflated interest rates tacked on every month, which can be increased to staggering amounts without notice. And exactly what checks is the government handing out, when we do not even have access to affordable healthcare? I could continue, but suffice to say that your opinion is over-simplified, condescending, and - uh - fuck you.

       Agreed. Sadly, most Americans equate socialism with evil without understanding what it means. I personally think that most Americans either choose to remain,or are, ignorant about the state of our country, but the populace alone should not be blamed for systematic inadequacies - and corruptions.

       The dollar is debt based because the people are debt based. The dollars value corresponds to inflation. When the dog is being fed and isn't working for it, where is the food coming from? It's being stolen. Watch what happens to your bank account when people don't pay their debts. The dollar inflates, they're stealing YOUR money. They are lazy, they want it all and don't want to lift a finger. And we appease them. Why? Because we love them. We don't want to see our neighbors starve.

       This is not the point that I was getting at. People are irresponsible, they are greedy. If you want to eat, you gotta work. If you don't, you're a thief. You steal from your neighbors. Your credit card is just as bad as the welfare check. Some live off debt, some live in debt, and together they steal everything, they cause inflation and hurt everyone and then point their fingers at the same loving hands feeding them. And they think they have the right to do this, they think they ARE right to do this. This is delusion. It is insanity.

       It's living off/in debt that is the problem. Borrowing money to buy things you clearly can't afford. Borrowing money for a free meal.

       You create the debt by borrowing money. No one is putting a gun to your head and forcing you to go to the goldsmith. The bank is there because you demanded it. You didn't want to work.

       Wrong, debt is created by the central bank whenever they feel like printing more money.  In order for the interest to be payed off more money is needed than the principal, so the central bank creates more money (and in turn more debt).  It's a never ending cycle and the only people that get screwed are the people you're blaming.  You're the equivalent of some asshole blaming a rape victim for getting raped because they dressed "slutty"...

       The "goldsmiths" were the the first bankers. In exchange for gold, they would give out receipts. These receipts became currency. As long as no one asked for a free meal, as long as no one tried to replicate the note, then the illusory value of the gold would not fluctuate. People wanted free meals though. So the goldsmith gave it to them. The goldsmith gave it in the form of a loan. This essentially "created" more gold on paper. People are greedy, they want more and more and don't want to do anything in return. Instead of working for the gold, they went to the goldsmith. They borrowed as much as they could. Greed and delusion. Now instead of trading in gold to the goldsmith. The gold that had actual value. People are handing over their homes and their land as collateral. Greed and delusion. They haven't learned. They are just as lazy as they were then. Just as irresponsible. Once they have nothing left to give, they'll blame the goldsmith, they'll try to kill the goldsmith because they think the goldsmith was wrong. He wasn't. Is it wrong if the goldsmith tries to protect himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't argue for a second, that there isn't corruption involved to some extent. You can't continue to push the blame around though.

       The entire point that you're missing in terms of banking is that the Goldsmiths realized they could print more receipts without intaking new gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the receipts for gold were traded as currency they essentially had control of the money supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as everybody didn't try to collect their gold at once, this illusion works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The corruption runs deeper than that though, in the form of interest. The goldsmiths (banks) can charge interest on loans of receipts (money) without anything backing them up. That's the problem with a debt-based FIAT currency - it's that system on a huge scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every person in the world does not know how the system works. You cannot blame them for not understanding when it has only been since the rise of the Internet that people have had access to the information that explains it.

       Inflation is like an undertow, constantly you dragging you down into debt because for most people, who get 3% a raise a year, they're actually losing ground because the real (non-BS gov figure) inflation rate is higher than that.

       Plus, they're screwed over by the fact that the banks keep the money they create or themselves, loan it out to other people with money, and perpetuate the cycle that keeps people poor and in debt.

       I think you make a vast leap in suggesting anybody who borrows money is at fault. Indeed, they don't have a gun pointed at their head, but in a society as economically oppressive and unjust as the USA, combined with a population brainwashed into thinking consumption is a religion, most of them are virtually forced to go into debt to buy the things associated with a successful life.  Plenty of other countries have populations who borrow and seem to manage far better - because they don't have to pay through the nose for other things such as decent education and basic health care. The problem is the US (and the banks) have made debt the
       <em>
        norm
       </em>
       , when it should really be the exception in people's personal finance.

       What you are saying could be true virtually everywhere. America has suffered under incredible propaganda for generations, forced to die is pointless wars, brutalized and attacked by people meant to protect them, the country is run by criminals - literally. We have by far the biggest military industrial complex on earth, who understand the threat that the people pose. A lot of serious work has been done to subvert the people in this country - what you are saying here is sincere but rooted in the strong ignorance you blame everyone of.

       Don't you think there is some blame on the fact that the populace is massively manipulated though advertising since childhood, lies through public relations and lobbying and just a general being sold a bill of goods&gt;?  We have been told to keep shopping because it's good for the economy, we are told that everyone should be a homeowner.  We have been sold the fact that everyone must have updated appliances by the big box store sale flyers.  Credit cards offer 18 months financing, 60 months 0% interest for your new automobile!!! 
Even the big-giant mega churches have told the masses that wealth is good and a gift from god. 
The individual should take some blame, but you can't forget the manipulation that has occurred.
       <br/>
       Additionally, you are forgetting that the dire circumstances people are in now have made people more frugal, and many have cut their credit cards up a long time ago.
Also, most of the people in my life that are still fortunate enough to have jobs work hard, really hard.  I know construction workers, lawyers, nurses and teachers &amp; none of them are lazy in the sense you are saying.

       Yes, Americans are indoctrinated, even from a young age. There comes a time when parents must tell their kids about Santa and the Easter Bunny. Red Flag right there- lying to your kids regarding mythical creatures/figures then having to tell them at 12 that no, it was all a lie. It doesn't get better either. Americans are bombarded with advertising and dogma, and for the most part they accept it as part of the culture.

       In fact, hubby and I were having a conversation @ dinner tonight over this issue.  Context: On vacay in New Zealand at a top resort and were having a wine that "struggled" as a grape and a piece of meat that was "pampered."  I said that the struggle makes hearty and the pampered makes rich... the middle class, if you will, has no direction and no flavor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said at dinner that this idea is personified in humanity and is, indeed, an issue that our own children are going to have to "struggle" their ways out of.  Of course, I was raised poor, white, southern trash and hubby had a silver spoon so we're obviously authorities on the subject. ;o)

       I wasn't being mean about the middle class but I do think it's an overblown idea.  (Hell, I'm middle class today by most standards.)  But what really is it?  There's always something that comes up.  Aren't we all sort of struggling?  Maybe I'm just sort of being nostalgic for an easier, younger time.  Maybe I'm just full of wine... ;o)

       To me there are only two things worth working for: yourself and helping your fellow man. I'm sure those can be broken down to include thousands of specifics, but I don't care what you work for. It better be honest and you better be working. If you don't want to work, and you wanna eat. I'll feed you. I'm your fellow man. But you can and you will sacrifice yourself to me in the process and you better not complain. You don't get to sit at the table if you're not bringing anything to it. You'll get my love, but not your independence and freedom. I'm DEBT.

       I really liked that analogy. And I understand what you're saying. Except, the way I see it, the struggled are now living in debt, and the pampered are living off of debt. It's really the same thing. This is the game that they chose to play. They are playing it alone and they think they are winning.

       Nope, I was a "struggled" with NO real debt...  Credit is a "luxury" afforded to those of the middle; the lower have no access and the higher have no need.  I married a higher and he taught me what money means and I taught him what life means... Except for the occasional psycho blow up on either part, we're a fab match.  We made lazy kids though because we're each trying to impart different lessons and we're both right. ;o)

       The lower have no access? The banks offering loans to unqualified individuals is what help cause the mortgage crisis. The higher class will use debt as an asset, they use it to invest. Trade it. The middle class uses it exactly as you say, a "luxury". Clearly a disguise they use to buy things they think are assets, but really end up being liabilities.

       This doesn't apply to everyone. And you can't point fingers. No one forced you to get the loan and buy the house you couldn't afford.

       The dollar is debt based because the people are debt based. The dollars value corresponds to inflation. When the dog is being fed and isn't working for it, where is the food coming from? It's being stolen. Watch what happens to your bank account when people don't pay their debts. The dollar inflates, they're stealing YOUR money. They are lazy, they want it all and don't want to lift a finger. And we appease them. Why? Because we love them. We don't want to see our neighbors starve.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your asking what I think the future of money will be like...then it will be backed by energy. You will be rewarded based on how much energy you help generate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not the point that I was getting at. People are irresponsible, they are greedy. If you want to eat, you gotta work. If you don't, you're a thief. You steal from your neighbors. Your credit card is just as bad as the welfare check. Some live off debt, some live in debt, and together they steal everything, they cause inflation and hurt everyone and then point their fingers at the same loving hands feeding them. And they think they have the right to do this, they think they ARE right to do this. This is delusion. It is insanity.
