    <div class="md"><p>Also, noone mentions the fact that we have these other exposed plots all over our news and the like, yet nothing regarding 9/11. So the borderline retard government, that can&#39;t do anything right, that gets caught at every turn and foiled on every plot, pulled off one of the biggest false flag attacks in history? Really? The bush administration? So.. The massively incompetent government was in turn.. Competent? They couldn&#39;t even cover up watergate, for fucks sake...</p>

<p>Noone talks about the thousands of people that would have had to been involved in 9/11. No, they just want to talk about how that building &#39;looked like a demolition therefore it was&#39;. That&#39;s not evidence, thats misinformation dare I say, or in the least, heresay and conjecture.</p>

<p>The only conspiracy around 9/11 is that the bush administration was not competent in acting on information they had about an impending attack. They let it happen to further their agenda. That&#39;s my personal conclusion. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my personal opinion as well.  However, I don&#39;t hold it with very much conviction.</p>

They do everything right? If they did, we wouldn&#39;t know about their foiled plots. We wouldn&#39;t know a lot of things that we do know, if they had their way and did everything right in their own eyes.</p>

<p>Edit: I posted this post before you edited your post adding the second part to your post. So within my post, I now create a reply to the second part of your post. Yo dawg...</p>

<p>Good point. Funny, the president of Iran was the one really calling for an international investigation into 9/11, yet a good percentage of the American populace thinks he is the one that was responsible for it.</p>

<p>I can say one thing, we do have the terrorist pre-9/11 memos that were leaked. They were largely ignored at the time, and its believed that 9/11 was the result. I&#39;m looking into how specific these memos were myself (there were quite a few regarding this in the year of 2001).</p>

<p>Happy hunting.</p>

<p>One of the mysteries about terrorism is the Lockerbie bombing, which happened on the anniversary of the Vincennes attack on that Iranian 747.  How on earth did they come to the conclusion that the bomber was from <em>Libya</em> ?</p>

<p>Also this one: <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2010/11/fbi_thwarts_terrorist_bombing.html">The Christmas Tree Bomb Plot</a>, here is some more on about <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704584804575645231250507948.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">it</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Quite sophisticated agents were basically grooming this individual,&quot; he said of the FBI&#39;s efforts to assist his client in preparing explosives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The threat was very real,&quot; said Oregon&#39;s FBI Special Agent in Charge Arthur Balizan. &quot;Our investigation shows that Mohamud was absolutely committed to carrying out an attack on a very grand scale. At the same time, I want to reassure the people of this community that, every turn, we denied him the ability to actually carry out the attack.&quot; </p>

<p>Mohamud maintained his interest in carrying out the attack and spent months working on logistics.</p>

<p>He provided the FBI operatives with a thumbdrive that contained detailed directions to the bomb location and operational instructions for the attack. </p>

<p>On Nov. 4, Mohamud and the FBI operatives traveled to a remote spot in Lincoln County, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack. </p>

<p>On the drive back to Corvalis, FBI operatives quizzed Mohamud about whether he was capable of looking at the bodies of those who would be killed in his planned Portland attack. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they gave him a bomb to detonate in the forest to trick him into thinking they would give him one to detonate in a square does it really sound like they tried to stop him at every turn? I mean they even gave him the dud bomb to put in the square. They drew things out as far as possible to stir up a panic when they could have simply picked him up at the first indication he was a threat.</p>

<p>The main evidence against the defendants was a videotape that was either about going on vacation, or, as the Justice department argued, a tape filled with coded references to a plot that couldn&#39;t be proved to actually exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The existence of Operation Northwoods alone convinced me that our government will go to great lengths to &quot;create&quot; an enemy.  After the Cold War ended, we had no well-defined enemy.  With no enemy, the military-industrial complex was at risk.  Suddenly, &quot;terrorism&quot; emerges and establishes itself as the world&#39;s greatest threat.  It is also the perfect enemy.  Invisible, with no borders and never able to be completely defeated.    </p>
