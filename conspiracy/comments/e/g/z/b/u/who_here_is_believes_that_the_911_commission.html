        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Follow up question</strong>: If so, do you consider yourself to be a conspiracy theorist and why? I&#39;m not trolling but I am just curious about your world view. </p>

<p>And please, this isn&#39;t an attempt to add fuel to a raging debate - it is simply to question people on their world view, find out why they think what they do.. please can we have restraint? </p>

<p>EDIT: The only justification I am getting from all of this is that people seem to believe the official version only because the conspiracy version is so unbelievable. That is bad reasoning - at best the truther movement is about discussing what <em>seems</em> to have happened, which is a sign of intelligence. It&#39;s not like you have to weigh in on whether or not explosives were used. You don&#39;t need to believe anything about 9/11 in order to see that the official version is garbage.</p>

<p>The problem with the official version continues to this day with what is called terrorism today. Who could possibly think that the 9/11 is connected to the &quot;Underwear Bomber&quot;? As a follow up to 9/11 we got &quot;The Shoe Bomber&quot; - really? Why is it that people who bravely question the official dogma are the ones who get all the attention and ultimately scorned?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I am concerned once you see that the government is lying then you really have no choice but to try to make sense of it all - and that makes you a conspiracy theorist. If you question the assassination of JFK, the magic bullet theory - if you know that the government lies, the moment you try to explain why that is, you become one. Virtually everyone is already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been said that &quot;a lie will make its way around the world before the truth even gets its pants on&quot;. Usually, it is people who believe the official 9/11 conspiracy theory who say that, which is interesting because I believed &quot;the lie that went around the world&quot; for many years, and only recently went looking for the truth. When you look at it in this context, the saying is true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying what actually happened for sure during 9/11. I assume you took a good critical look at both sides of the argument, waited to make up your mind and to the best of your knowledge the government made the more compelling case, right? </p>

<p>At least I hope you can accept that we have grounds to be skeptical what with being given the perpetrator a whole 45mins after the crime had been committed - it&#39;s not a style of detective work I am familiar with. And of course with the questionable track record with respect to the truth - there are of course many more problems.</p>

<p>Is there any event in history that to you is an obvious conspiracy? Just as a matter of reference..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea that someone, somewhere would talk is not based on anything resembling reality. The FBI just recently gave up on ALF break-in at UIowa. Furthermore, there ARE people who are speaking up and speaking out. Unfortunately, those who cling to the official conspiracy theory dismiss them one-after-another, usually just by saying, &quot;oh. well that guy is just crazy&quot;... And that&#39;s the end of it.

    <div class="md"><p>So, troll-like poster, on the off chance that you are <em>not</em> disinfo, let me give you a few pieces of data that may have slipped by your research.</p>

<p>There were NO Arabic surnames on <em>any</em> of the passenger manifests.  Tough to &quot;hijack&quot; something if you&#39;re not even there, no?</p>

<p>On flight 93 <strong>the one that was shot down by the USAF over Shanksville Pa.</strong></p>

<p>Funny thing about that flight.  You see, when they recovered the black boxes, one of the piece of information that was discovered by Pilots for 911 Truth was that <em>the cockpit door had not been opened during the entire flight.</em>   So tell me, how <em>do</em> you hijack a plane without opening the cockpit door?</p>

<p>There&#39;s more, &quot;charley&quot;, but I have a busy morning.  If you look for truth, you can find it.  Or, you can eat whatever shit the government is peddling today.</p>
