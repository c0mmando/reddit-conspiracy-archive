       <strong>
        Follow up question
       </strong>
       : If so, do you consider yourself to be a conspiracy theorist and why? I'm not trolling but I am just curious about your world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       And please, this isn't an attempt to add fuel to a raging debate - it is simply to question people on their world view, find out why they think what they do.. please can we have restraint?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: The only justification I am getting from all of this is that people seem to believe the official version only because the conspiracy version is so unbelievable. That is bad reasoning - at best the truther movement is about discussing what
       <em>
        seems
       </em>
       to have happened, which is a sign of intelligence. It's not like you have to weigh in on whether or not explosives were used. You don't need to believe anything about 9/11 in order to see that the official version is garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with the official version continues to this day with what is called terrorism today. Who could possibly think that the 9/11 is connected to the "Underwear Bomber"? As a follow up to 9/11 we got "The Shoe Bomber" - really? Why is it that people who bravely question the official dogma are the ones who get all the attention and ultimately scorned?

       As far as I am concerned once you see that the government is lying then you really have no choice but to try to make sense of it all - and that makes you a conspiracy theorist. If you question the assassination of JFK, the magic bullet theory - if you know that the government lies, the moment you try to explain why that is, you become one. Virtually everyone is already.

       Everyone who accepts the official story of 9/11 is a conspiracy theorist. They theorize that 19 Arabs and bin Laden, KSM, etc. conspired to commit the crimes of that day.

       That's not true, at all. What you become, or what you were all along, is a truth seeker. The words 'conspiracy theorist' are used to discredit truth seekers.

      <p>
       *Some people know the situation and know how easily things can be orchestrated. Some people accept the truth and trudge on. Some people constantly search for it. Others have their own lives and thats all that matters. And so turns another day on Earth...

       I think it's good that talk of 9/11
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       a conspiracy is accepted in larger circles of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's instructive that 9/11 IS a conspiracy precisely because of how much investigation has actually been done into the issue. Government response to anything is highly interpretable.

       It has been said that "a lie will make its way around the world before the truth even gets its pants on". Usually, it is people who believe the official 9/11 conspiracy theory who say that, which is interesting because I believed "the lie that went around the world" for many years, and only recently went looking for the truth. When you look at it in this context, the saying is true

       Actually, donald rumsfeld admitted $2.3 Trillion was missing on 2001-09-10. At the time, that amount of money was about equal to 1/3 of the total national debt. Also, I have yet to hear a convincing explanation as to HOW the terrorists (whoever they are) were able to hit the pentagon an hour or so after it was obvious that the nation was under attack. By that point, the pentagon hit wasn't even a surprise attack.

       Even the family members who don't believe in the conspiracy theories believe that the commission was a whitewash.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the question in your comment - absolutely - ever heard of the Manhattan Project? 50,000+ people working to build the first nuclear weapon, all decompartmentalized. All of this was top secret until the first bomb fell on Hiroshima.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying I believe 9/11 was a conspiracy, but if you believe that the Government can't keep a secret, you're either incredibly fucking naive, or stupid, or both.

       Well evidently you can't fucking read, because you missed the part where I said "Not saying I believe 9/11 was a conspiracy"... And you also imagined the part where I said that flight 93 was shot down.

       I'm not saying what actually happened for sure during 9/11. I assume you took a good critical look at both sides of the argument, waited to make up your mind and to the best of your knowledge the government made the more compelling case, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       At least I hope you can accept that we have grounds to be skeptical what with being given the perpetrator a whole 45mins after the crime had been committed - it's not a style of detective work I am familiar with. And of course with the questionable track record with respect to the truth - there are of course many more problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any event in history that to you is an obvious conspiracy? Just as a matter of reference..

       The idea that someone, somewhere would talk is not based on anything resembling reality. The FBI just recently gave up on ALF break-in at UIowa. Furthermore, there ARE people who are speaking up and speaking out. Unfortunately, those who cling to the official conspiracy theory dismiss them one-after-another, usually just by saying, "oh. well that guy is just crazy"... And that's the end of it. If you want to keep your head buried in the sand, nobody can stop you, but don't expect the rest of us to stand next to you as you do it.

       So, troll-like poster, on the off chance that you are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       disinfo, let me give you a few pieces of data that may have slipped by your research.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were NO Arabic surnames on
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of the passenger manifests.  Tough to "hijack" something if you're not even there, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       On flight 93
       <strong>
        the one that was shot down by the USAF over Shanksville Pa.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing about that flight.  You see, when they recovered the black boxes, one of the piece of information that was discovered by Pilots for 911 Truth was that
       <em>
        the cockpit door had not been opened during the entire flight.
       </em>
       So tell me, how
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       you hijack a plane without opening the cockpit door?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's more, "charley", but I have a busy morning.  If you look for truth, you can find it.  Or, you can eat whatever shit the government is peddling today.

       Let's make it simple. Did the government successfully lay out a case for who perpetrated 9/11? I don't have a suspect in mind at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe that members of US government have committed acts of treason and successfully covered them up?

       Israeli Mossad. If you google "Israeli television interview 9/11" it'l probably come up.  Three Mossad agents admittting they took part in the set-up of 9/11.  That's

       'The government can't keep a secret that big' is the oldest and most easily argued excuse in the book. There are whole government agencies whose job it is to keep secrets. It's called top secret clearance and there are many levels and much compartmentalization as well as employees signing NDAs, so you can imagine how it would not be hard to keep it secret. Also, I really don't see what a leak from a whistleblower to WikiLeaks on unrelated issues proves anything.

       Actually, donald rumsfeld admitted $2.3 Trillion was missing on 2001-09-10. At the time, that amount of money was about equal to 1/3 of the total national debt. Also, I have yet to hear a convincing explanation as to HOW the terrorists (whoever they are) were able to hit the pentagon an hour or so after it was obvious that the nation was under attack. By that point, the pentagon hit wasn't even a surprise attack.
