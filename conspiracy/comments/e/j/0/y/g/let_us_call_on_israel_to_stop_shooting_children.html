    <div class="md"><p>What concerns me is how many people <em>will</em> die eventually. Occupied Palestine is a powderkeg ready to go. The only thing keeping the entire Middle East from annihilating the Israelis is U.S. support. That won&#39;t always be there. Mark my words, there will be a day where the Israeli state stands alone. When there is another Holocaust in the form of a mushroom cloud it will be the fault of the Israeli&#39;s fascist policies and their failure to make a just and amicable peace when they had a chance instead of making cynical excuses why not to.</p>

<p>And yes, America is responsible too. Israelis should start thinking about making a home there, because I fear the &quot;Israel Experiment&quot; is way past the point of working. It could have been beautiful.</p>

<p>Please, open an history book and not your crappy Bible. Jerusalem is a jewish name, not a palestinian name. Palestinians claim to be arabs, and arabs come from Arabia. From 632 onward, Muslims conquered by force any land that they currently occupy. From Morocco to Indonesia, from Bosnia to Sudan. For 14 centuries, their only word has been : convert or die.</p>

<p>How about christian gay haters who force them to commit suicide ? Will they too burn in hell ?</p>

<p>How about the Pope or Mother Theresa for encouraging an out-of-control birth rate that leads to poverty, disease and misery ? Will they burn in hell ?</p>

<p>Where do you read that in what I wrote ? You are projecting your own religious fantasies because as a religious person, your logic is deeply flawed. </p>

<p>Here is how you reason : </p>

<p>1- thulminos supports the right of Israel to exist without because constantly attacked</p>

<p>2- colonel_fantastic knows that some Israelis defend the right of Israel to exist base on religious motives</p>

<p>3- hence thulminos supports the religious wackos of Israel</p>

<p>Oh boy are you confused ! I am secular person. I support the right of Israelis to live peacefully in Israel based on geographical and historical reasons. And by the way Israel respects its religious minorities. You live better as a muslim or a christian in Israel than in any neighboring arab country. There are even arabs in the Knesset.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pharisees and hypocrites speaking of holocaust then go and do it everyday to Palestinians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>72 % ( 6 million ) of the european jewish population died in the Holocaust.</p>

<p>The palestinian population has increased by 30 % over the last decade. If the Israelis are trying to eradicate the palestinians, they sure suck at it despite having been taught by some very efficient genocidal Nazis.
If you use complicated words, make sure you understand their meaning.</p>

<p>Really? because in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_age_of_Jewish_culture_in_Spain">book</a> ,it says otherwise.</p>

<p>I think this is enough evidence that your position is weak as well as your argument. All what you did is spouting bullshit and lies like your fucked up prime ministers do and did long before. It seems that its is the only thing your kind is good at, that and mass murder. You guys seem to nail that part.</p>

<p>We are not Fox news here. So I suggest you take one step AFK because it appears to me that even your keyboard is so fucking sick of your BULLSHIT, Terrorists sympathizer.</p>

<p>Over and out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This fucking sentiment is what allows violence in this world to continue. You justify a condemnable act by saying that it either &quot;might save lives&quot; or &quot;could be dangerous if we don&#39;t&quot;</p>

<p>If Isreal shot a bomber that happened to be a child there wouldn&#39;t be near the issues that we&#39;re having. Fact of the matter is that shooting children happens when the children are innocent and not carrying bombs. No matter what you say after that, if you are defending the shooting of innocent children you are a monster and inhuman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey, none forced the Palestinians to engage in violent actions. They started it in 1948 despite the fact that one year before, they had a beautiful example of a people freeing themselves non-violently, in India.</p>

<p>Since then, they kept spreading lies (the so-called palestinian genocide, despite the fact that their population increased by a factor of 4, the so called &quot;they stole our country&quot; lie, despite the fact that there was never a palestinian state ), they hijacked numerous planes in the 1970 and they finally committed atrocious suicide attacks amongst the Israeli civilian population.</p>

<p>And now that they &quot;elected&quot; a terrorist organisation to represent them, Hamas, they still want to be seen as victims ? </p>

<p>Who cares if there is such a thing?  The fact is that Israel <em>took people&#39;s land away from them</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>they hijacked numerous planes in the 1970 and they finally committed atrocious suicide attacks amongst the Israeli civilian population.</p>

<p>How does this justify shooting children?</p>

<p>Zionists also engaged in terrorist acts before the state of Israel was formed; should Palestinians be shooting their children, also?</p>

<p>Hamas was <em>democratically elected</em>, yet neither Israel nor the USA has ever attempted to engage them on this basis.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if Israel wants to provoke violence so that it can be returned ten-fold.</p>

<p>Now why would that be I wonder?  It couldn&#39;t be to do with the fact that Israel is colonizing the West Bank by stealth, could it?</p>

<p>The truth is, Palestinians had many opportunities to settle peace with Israel, but they wanted everything because they couldn&#39;t accept the very existence of Israel. They were misled by terrorist leaders, From Arafat to Hamas since the very beginning. Israel is the only country in the world that other countries vowed to destroy. Israel doesn&#39;t wish to destroy Lebanon, Syria or Jordan. The opposite is not true though.</p>

<p>You are speaking nonsense.  Every single time that a cease fire has been organized, it has been sabotaged by Israel.  Ok, at the start, it was quite difficult to see this, but now it is pretty blatant.  Israel&#39;s tactics are clear: Ceasefire successful?  Bomb some tunnels.  Peace process in progress? Build more settlements.</p>

<p>It shows your obvious lack of knowledge about what is a Godwin point. It is not the mention of Hitler that makes a Godwin point. A Godwin point is given to someone who calls his opposing debater &quot;Hitler&quot; or &quot;Nazi&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the way it appears in the West bank, where Israelis are still taking land from Palestinians.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s such a weird statement.</p>

<p>By your logic, you would seem to think it OK if Native Americans were to expel the inhabitants of California at gunpoint, as this is analagous to Israelis to returning to their ancestors&#39; purported homes and expelling the current inhabitants.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Can you please give up on &quot;unmotivated&quot; ?  I think we&#39;ve established that Israelis are dispossessing people of their land.  And, whenever murder is mentioned, I like to point out that Israel has killed ten times as many Palestinians as vice versa.</p>

<p>Oh, you slipped in that word, &quot;unmotivated&quot;.  So would you describe Israel&#39;s murder of thousands of Palestinians as &quot;motivated&quot;?  That&#39;s an interesting concept.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So in 1948 Israelis kicked out the palestinians at gunpoint ? There was a mass displacement of palestinians similar to the population transfer of India and Pakistan following the indian independance right ? Can you point us to the record of such an occurrence ?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Until recently, Palestinian suicide bombers targeted Israeli civilians. Israelis focussed on palestinian militants ( military targets). The terrorists were quick to learn and started to use their own population as human shields.</p>

<p>The conflict escalated during the second intifada and following the thousand of rockets sent through the border with Lebanon, palestinian civilians started to get hit by the Israelis as well.</p>

<p>Now of course, if you bring back the events in the wrong chronological order, I can understand that the Israelis look as bad as the palestinians. Unfortunately for your theories, time flows in only one direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How long ago was Arafat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fatah was replaced by Hamas in 2006. So Arafat&#39;s legacy ended 4 years ago, replaced by something even worse. That is how long ago it was, about 50 months.</p>
