       What concerns me is how many people
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       die eventually. Occupied Palestine is a powderkeg ready to go. The only thing keeping the entire Middle East from annihilating the Israelis is U.S. support. That won't always be there. Mark my words, there will be a day where the Israeli state stands alone. When there is another Holocaust in the form of a mushroom cloud it will be the fault of the Israeli's fascist policies and their failure to make a just and amicable peace when they had a chance instead of making cynical excuses why not to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, America is responsible too. Israelis should start thinking about making a home there, because I fear the "Israel Experiment" is way past the point of working. It could have been beautiful.

       What caused the holocaust was idealism set in romanticism, which is a European concept. That's why they go around killing entire species i.e. passenger pigeons, Native Americans, Bisons, Dodos etc. Middle East is old enough to know that there is no good diaspora, bad diaspora. There is good persons and bad persons.

       If you mean, don't talk about Israel at all regardless of the atrocities they commit, then fuck that.  It doesn't matter what group of people it is, if they fucking decimate another group of people because they think they're the "Chosen Ones", then fuck that shit.

       Please, open an history book and not your crappy Bible. Jerusalem is a jewish name, not a palestinian name. Palestinians claim to be arabs, and arabs come from Arabia.

       Where do you read that in what I wrote ? You are projecting your own religious fantasies because as a religious person, your logic is deeply flawed.

       Here is how you reason :
      </p>
      <p>
       1- thulminos supports the right of Israel to exist without because constantly attacked
      </p>
      <p>
       2- colonel_fantastic knows that some Israelis defend the right of Israel to exist base on religious motives
      </p>
      <p>
       3- hence thulminos supports the religious wackos of Israel
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh boy are you confused ! I am secular person. I support the right of Israelis to live peacefully in Israel based on geographical and historical reasons. And by the way Israel respects its religious minorities. You live better as a muslim or a christian in Israel than in any neighboring arab country. There are even arabs in the Knesset.

       72 % ( 6 million ) of the european jewish population died in the Holocaust.

       The palestinian population has increased by 30 % over the last decade. If the Israelis are trying to eradicate the palestinians, they sure suck at it despite having been taught by some very efficient genocidal Nazis.
If you use complicated words, make sure you understand their meaning.

       That is ad-hominem by definition. You're dismissing his argument about shooting children based on a belief in God. From the context, it could be assumed he was talking about what he thought was your God and not his own. Your logic is flawed. You're an apologist and your arguments are irrelevent to the topic.

       When that child is walking towards you with an explosive vest to potentially murder you? I'm not saying that it's nice, or that children should be targeted, but there are definitely are certain extreme circumstances in which action would have to be taken. This is especially true when you're fighting an enemy who train their children to do this. Don't you think?

       This fucking sentiment is what allows violence in this world to continue. You justify a condemnable act by saying that it either "might save lives" or "could be dangerous if we don't"
      </p>
      <p>
       If Isreal shot a bomber that happened to be a child there wouldn't be near the issues that we're having. Fact of the matter is that shooting children happens when the children are innocent and not carrying bombs. No matter what you say after that, if you are defending the shooting of innocent children you are a monster and inhuman.

       hey, none forced the Palestinians to engage in violent actions. They started it in 1948 despite the fact that one year before, they had a beautiful example of a people freeing themselves non-violently, in India.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, they kept spreading lies (the so-called palestinian genocide, despite the fact that their population increased by a factor of 4, the so called "they stole our country" lie, despite the fact that there was never a palestinian state ), they hijacked numerous planes in the 1970 and they finally committed atrocious suicide attacks amongst the Israeli civilian population.

       And now that they "elected" a terrorist organisation to represent them, Hamas, they still want to be seen as victims ?

       Hamas was

      <p>
       It's almost as if Israel wants to provoke violence so that it can be returned ten-fold.

      <p>
       Now why would that be I wonder?  It couldn't be to do with the fact that Israel is colonizing the West Bank by stealth, could it?

       The truth is, Palestinians had many opportunities to settle peace with Israel, but they wanted everything because they couldn't accept the very existence of Israel. They were misled by terrorist leaders, From Arafat to Hamas since the very beginning. Israel is the only country in the world that other countries vowed to destroy. Israel doesn't wish to destroy Lebanon, Syria or Jordan. The opposite is not true though.

       You are speaking nonsense.  Every single time that a cease fire has been organized, it has been sabotaged by Israel.  Ok, at the start, it was quite difficult to see this, but now it is pretty blatant.  Israel's tactics are clear: Ceasefire successful?  Bomb some tunnels.  Peace process in progress? Build more settlements.

       Can you please give up on "unmotivated" ?  I think we've established that Israelis are dispossessing people of their land.  And, whenever murder is mentioned, I like to point out that Israel has killed ten times as many Palestinians as vice versa.

       So in 1948 Israelis kicked out the palestinians at gunpoint ? There was a mass displacement of palestinians similar to the population transfer of India and Pakistan following the indian independance right ? Can you point us to the record of such an occurrence ?

       Until recently, Palestinian suicide bombers targeted Israeli civilians. Israelis focussed on palestinian militants ( military targets). The terrorists were quick to learn and started to use their own population as human shields.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conflict escalated during the second intifada and following the thousand of rockets sent through the border with Lebanon, palestinian civilians started to get hit by the Israelis as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now of course, if you bring back the events in the wrong chronological order, I can understand that the Israelis look as bad as the palestinians. Unfortunately for your theories, time flows in only one direction.

       Fatah was replaced by Hamas in 2006. So Arafat's legacy ended 4 years ago, replaced by something even worse. That is how long ago it was, about 50 months.
