       Hmm never thought of it that much...Now with everyone trying to "revenge" Assange by attacking the Paypal and Mastercard sites, a law to "protect" these sites would mean internet censorship at its best. Game over.

       yes but hes spoken out against Israel in speeches. And he lists Israel in the three rouge nations that we have most to be worried about (along with Iran and N. Korea) Have a listen yourself:

       I had this exact thought today. I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it, but surely Mr. Assange must know the ramifications of  WL's anti-government actions could ultimately promote internet censorship... especially now with this "cyber warfare."

       Look at Alex Jones and the stuff that he exposes(and has for years)

      <p>
       Then look at Assange, and the way he's being persecuted.

       IMO, this proves once and for all that all the mainstream conspiracy truthers are in fact paid shills, and its just another case of tptb playing both sides of the track.

       Exactly.  Even if Wikileaks revealed concrete evidence that the attack was wholly undertaken by Al-Qaeda, the truthers would just ignore it, or add Wikileaks to the list of conspirators.  They ignore any evidence that doesn't reconcile with their preconceived narrative.

       There is only evidence that Al-queda DIDN'T do it.  I have yet to see any evidence whatsoever that shows that 19 hijackers who don't appear on flight manifests and of which SIX of them are still alive, managed to drop WTC7 into its own footprint at free fall speeds!  That's a good one.  Yep, Al-queda really did do it, but there is nothing to show that they could have even been remotely able to pull off what happened that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ahhh, or that's what you're trying to do.  Divide wikileaks from "thruthers" and thus wikileaks is the more reliable (somehow) group and thus should still be more trusted than "thruthers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer at its best right?  So what if the same people who did 9/11 are the same behind wikileaks?  Funny that Julian Assange thinks that 9/11 WAS done by 19 hijackers and is annoyed that people could POSSIBLY think 9/11 was an inside job.  Funny no?

       Although your point is swimmingly lucid, I think it's the wrong point, as the top comment already made it. The truth is one narrative, and it matters which one it is, even if nobody knows it entire. The only narrative that was preconceived is the first one we got.

       The laws of physics were suspended on 911, fuck Wikileaks, Al-Qaeda, CIA fuck them all. Look at the building collapses, INSIDE MOTHERFUCKING JOB. There is no information that can be leaked that can prove that the collapse was due to fire and an airplane impact.

       It's amazing to compare pictures of airline crashes to what is seen at the pentagon and flight 93, there is simply no plane, no evidence at all of anything resembling what would normally be seen.

       Holy shit! Operation Northwoods! Some warmonger at the pentagon came up with a propaganda scheme that a.) would have harmed zero civilians, b.) was roundly rejected by civilian leadership and c.) was completely unnecessary for the government to justify its aggressive stance against Cuba.  This. Changes. Everything.

       I have and go out of my way to get to know anyone from that part of the world.  You know why?  I want to know what they think.  Even if its just the usual crap.  I spoke to a gentleman from Iran, he has some VERY different thoughts about Israel and as such they are worth looking into and possibly corroborating with others.  There is a barrier between people and speaking about Israel.  Most don't have the balls tospeak and be blacklisted......I don't give a shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Israeli's do what they do, its easy to determine who goes out of their way to "blacklist" whom.
      </p>

       If you don't see the sarcasm, you need to read more posts and see what people think around here.  Generally, its' not the "evil brown people" that are the focus, regardless of the detractors comments.

       I'm sure if there is any documentation on it being an inside job (Not saying it is or is not), its not going to be released by wikileaks. That Information is way to confidential for anyone of question that could leak it would not have it.

       This was my first thought as well, and still my thought. There isn't just paperwork floating around about this stuff. There is, but it is labeled way above 'secret,' if it's labeled at all. Afterall, the government is not a big mean bad guy who conspires against us. It was a small, powerful group who perpetrated the attacks on 9/11.

       I'm hoping the 'insurance package' Assange has tucked away contains details on the following unsolved mysteries.

      <ol>
       <li>
        What happened to ALF after he was taken by the feds.

       I figure that if indeed Assange is a CIA operative, then the insurance package really does something along those lines. Maybe the insurance package is just there to answer the question "Why
       <em>
        hasn't
       </em>
       he disappeared yet?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish he'd just release whatever is in it anyways if it is important, and if he gets offed as a result then we know who did it without a doubt.

       Most of the 'problems', though, are generally considered at first to be actual problems by the masses. The only people against Assange at the moment appear to be the embarrassed politicians themselves and conservative America.

      <p>
       The majority of the rest of the world appears to be behind the movement.

       Perhaps if a false flag attack that can be attributed to the revelations in the leaks could be carried out, there'd be more chance of polarizing people against 'freedom of information'. Even that seems like a stretch, though...

       Julian Assange has already said that there is no 9-11 conspiracy and people shouldn't bother looking into it.  He went on to say that he is

        annoyed by 9-11 truthers
       </a>
       .  This raises a few flags especially because it was the main stream media that brought him out of obscurity.  Fox News is calling for his assasination - that's just another way of trying to say the leaks are absolutely true.  Fox News gives less credit to Obama.  They call our own president a liar but Julian Assange reveals the truth?  The media could have tried to discredit him.  Not only do they bring global attention to him, but they confirm what he says is true.  If it looks like a psy-op and smells like a psy-op . . .    We'll see.  He also

       I don't think you understand how important truthers' 9/11 beliefs are to them. It's a cornerstone truth for them, integral to their whole world view. Without that belief, their whole concept of the world falls apart. Telling a truther that 9/11 was a terrorist attack is like telling a devout Christian that Jesus never saw the crucifixion coming. It's an article of faith to them. It can't be false, or else almost everything they believe is false, and they're lost.

       I'm being a little goofy here.
I consider my self a truther, because I want the truth.   Thats all.
9/11 wasn't what we are officially told.   More happened on that day then the public knows.   I sincerely doubt that it is as bad as some say it is, but I know its worse then most accept.    Somewhere in there is the truth.

       Don't generalize a group of people, some of which are accomplished and very well respected scientists and engineers, just cause of a few crack pots who have trouble remembering to take their medicine in the morning make some insane-er statements then the rest.

       Well you're not quite a truther then. Truthers feel they already know the truth. What they want is acknowledgment, and the necessarily profound consequences that would entail. And don't start that "respected scientists and engineers" stuff. Having 1 out of every 10,000 of the western world's engineers agree with you isn't impressive - it's embarrassing. I could get more engineers to agree that bigfoot exists than truthers can get to agree with them about 9/11.

       I'm sure there's a ton of credible documentation accounting how terrorists conspired to pull off 9/11. Besides documentation, the entire thing was caught on video, at like ten different angles. I personally watched it live on TV as it happened. So I, for one, would like to see some creditable documentation that the government WAS behind it. I've watched loose change and read up on the conspiracies, and I don't buy their take on it. I truely believe that if the Government wanted a terrorist attack, they'd allow one to take place or have people commit to it faithfully. I don't think they'd leave the kind of evidence that everyone points to.

       The rest of the gov's story is so full of holes that it's hard to believe anything they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said,  I'm not telling you a missile hit the pentagon,  I'm not telling you that the buildings were brought down by the gov,  I'm not telling you that it was Israelis.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is the official story is a sack of shit, and until I see evidence that PROVES what they said, then I'm not going to believe much out of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's all I'm trying to say... lots of holes, don't believe them,  so I end up as a 'truther' because I don't believe the official story.   That said, I think about 50% of truther theories are complete bunk,  but they have as much evidence as the official reports.

       I was very surprised at how well they protected the rubble as they carried it off in brand new special purpose trucks identically designed and gathered in order to haul away the rubble and evidence. I was also impressed at the readiness of the US to undertake this cleaning effort by providing the brand new designer pickers that were so "perfectly designed" for something of that exact nature.  How did they know?  the US is freaking amazing.  Where did all the rubble go and why aren't any other agencies allowed to investigate?  you know, for a second opinion?

       Of course it was terrorists. Maybe it wasn't Al Queda, maybe it was. It wasn't Iraq, or an attack from any other nation. It wasn't a US Military operation, so terrorist seems as accurate a label as any.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a cover-up. The US Government tried to hide how throughly it failed, systemically at all levels, at protecting thousands of people from the fundamental threat of lunatics with box cutters. The DMV probably could have prevented this too if it was doing it's job right. While the intelligence community was out trying to thwart the second cold war, nobody was left paying attention to the real problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US Military did not stage 9/11. Setting aside their institutional loyalties for a moment, it just doesn't make sense. At the very least, these evil masterminds would make sure the planes would have enough of a payload to collapse the building without having to detonate explosives. They wouldn't care about how the buildings collapsed, as any organization who would kill 3000+ wouldn't draw the line at another thousand and a few more collapsed buildings. They certainly wouldn't rig explosives beforehand for everyone to discover.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wouldn't shuffle passengers around, or re-route flights beforehand, or anything of the sort. If the government knew about this attack, don't you think they'd be slightly more prepared for the aftermath? It doesn't pass the smell test.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen any 'evidence' of government involvement that wouldn't be better explained as evidence of a government cover-up as to just how unprepared they were; I see a lot of saved careers in truther evidence. As far as the science behind the collapses, I suspect we all saw an accurate account of what happens when you fly airplanes in to the twin towers. With my feeble understanding of the variables in play, the way the collapse took place seems plausible enough to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know who or what group planned the attacks, or really for what reason. On some level I figure the government pointed a finger without really knowing all the facts. On another level, I don't trust the terrorist organisations to be honorable enough to only take credit for their own attacks. I half suspect that some group did it just because it could be done, or because of some god-driven delusion. Frankly, i'm surprised that doesn't happen more often.

       You point to naivety with my 'trusting' the government and the media (although if you had actually read my posts you'd see that I don't), however when I ask you to present some of this evidence that points to a probable inside job, You reply with a highly suspect link that I judge to be unreliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 and the 4th Reich? I mean, c'mon. Do you actually give credence to the notion that Nazi's attacked us on 9/11? I'm certainly not going to spend two weeks pouring over all the crap on some nut-job truther site. I don't trust your ability to objectively look at current events, political reality, history, etc and dispassionately try to put all the pieces together to a terrorist attack that happened almost a decade ago.  Conspiracy Theorists are best at taking events and data that don't go together and using it all to support their foredrawn conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ask you again to present some real evidence that contradicts my viewpoint.  Being an intelligent redditor with an enlightened sense of conspiracy theories, Shirley you can present something that isn't as ludicrous as terrorist nazis. I look forward to seeing it. I am a skeptic; thus the reason I think your fulla shit. But i'm open mind; so i'm waiting for someone to convince me otherwise...

       I don't know the absolute truth but I am confident that if it was an inside job that there wouldn't be a single cable about it.  Keep in mind how many people supposedly have access to this information and for how long.  I'm sure it would have come out looooong ago if it was there.

       Maybe instead of dropping bombs on them you might try an alternative approach, kittens. I guarantee that if ANY Al-Qaeda members have severe allergies to cat's, the cat's will find them.

       Even if some evidence did surface it would be dismissed as fake or whoever the source, instantly marginalized and discredited. The MSM would report more on those statements and the story would be a blip.  And the public would continue believing what it has continually demonstrated it wishes to believe because to consider otherwise would destroy their belief system. Because if indeed it was something other that the government said it was, what then? Most people don't want to think about that so they don't.

       Anyone ever see the movie: The Emerald Forest? At the end, the dam is blown up. The audience sees the guy with the bomb. And we also the rush of water - both of which may have took the damn down. But they happen almost in unison. I've always thought about that moment when thinking about 9/11. Or what might possibly happen during the winter solstice in 2012. What does "man made" really mean? If we were to look at the Earth from above during a "natural" disaster (Earthquake, tornado, hurricane etc) - we would just see a bunch of energy moving around. Similarly, if we viewed a riot from above the Earth - we just see this shifting of energy. But are riots "natural"? Are "hurricanes" man made? Or is it a combination of both. Can we really separate ourselves from the universe? I suppose it's all about intent - do we really believe that we can live better?

      <p>
       That took a bit of a tangent. But I stand by it, nonetheless.

       I understand the "humans are part of nature too" idea here, but I think you've gotten lost in the semantic weeds. "Natural" and "man-made" are generally understood to mean "events not directed by humans" and "human-caused events", respectively. It's not always that clear-cut of course, there can be overlap, but that's what they're understood to mean.

       I think an interesting way to think of this is that humans are a natural part of this universe.  Therefore even though we have man-made structures or things such as riots, are that not natural?  For we are natural ourselves.

       He has publicly said it is "load of nonsense" (paraphrasing). I would love for wikileaks to actually leak something of substance, in fact, anything of substance. So far, this has been a total non event, just a few embarrassments for fat bureaucrats to worry about. However this alarms me, because maybe this is the most disturbing part of it; this "leak" just gives the government a righteous up your arse round of ammo to block internet freedom, enforcing ACTA, and fucking us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly hope that wikileaks is a good thing, because I believe information should be free, but they are so far showing nothing of substance, and it all helps the military industrial complex ultimately.

       Yes it is true Saudi and Yemeni "terrorists" flew passenger jets into the trade towers.  The subsequent collapse of those towers and building 7 have yet to be adequately explained.  I would be happy with some engineering models or other fact/math based explanation.

       Of course the reason that Assange is 'annoyed with 9/11 truthers' may be  the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       who/what/how/when of 9/11 is in his insurance file. After knowing that, I'm sure he's angry at the wackos talking about holographic aircraft, laser weapons and plane switcheroos. Guess the truth is much more pedestrian, while still shocking.

       I am saying I am not noticing anything about Israel that has hit the mainstream from the released cables.  You probably guessed that Israel's influence in America is my investigative hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be many reasons for it - American diplomats maybe did not say much about that country, or what they said was not exciting enough, or maybe there is a cover up, or maybe Wikileaks cut a deal with Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know, and I rarely speculate when I don't have any data on a given subject.

       I doubt they failed to say anything about Israel. They know that their defense of Israel is embarrassing and hard to defend because of Israel's behavior. Someone surely would have said something. This is the most likely thing, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I highly doubt Wikileaks is cutting deals with governments, especially just one specific government.

       exposing 911 will lead directly to exposing such critically important info as you mention--and the fact that, whether anyone likes it or not, there
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been a Grand Conspiracy which has affected
       <em>
        every

       aspect of the directions of our Societies, and, hence, our lives and prosperity (i am
       <em>
        not

       meaning "financial" prosperity--i'm talking about the basic, general betterment of our Conditions of Life)...

       </em>
       Socially mutual...
      </p>
      <p>
       even now, as more and more of us talk amongst ourselves, and think on what's gone before, what's happening now, and what might be to come--even now, our attentions and efforts turn in that direction, albeit slowly...
      </p>
      <p>
       whistleblowers in
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       facet of the current SYSTEM would do in-estimable service to humanity to expose such things--the UFOs, if indeed they are "here" (and, i repeat--i
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       believe), will
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       be here, then...and, who knows, perhaps they will even appreciate and respect us more as Conscionable entities, if we do, indeed, "wake up," and fix our own conditions, according to our ability, by our own intellects, compassion, and efforts...
      </p>
      <p>
       idk--well, yes, actually, i
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       know...i'm
       <em>
        certain

       that would be the case...and would pave the way for our being actually

       the UFOs can wait for disclosure (they've waited, allegedly, for centuries, already, perhaps, according to UFOlogy pundits)--our own specic sanity and salvation (not to mention our Individual lives!), through our own recognition, determination, decision, and actions

       Nah, I agree with Docsavage.  9/11 is the one big thing that most of the shit we are experiencing today stems from.  Identify and stop this issue and you curtail the efforts of those people who clearly think they should be in charge or own people on any level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep thinking about when the Aliens will arrive and you'll be bar coded and slaving away and wishing you had a backbone X amount of years prior.  Aliens are real, lets be honest.  They're out there.  They aren't here to help out in any direct manner or they would have already.  I think Hiroshima would have been a good time to intervene.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really don't see that as the priority??  This is no laughing matter.  Your actions are tracked and predicted for the future and you think the aliens will maybe save us or something?  Never mind, it doesn't matter......ask yourself what your priorities are.  Think of your family and any family you may have in the future and think if it helps you to resolve these issues now or later.  Which would be more difficult?

       9/11 was orchestrated by UFO'S using quantum teleports!

       Is that what you want us to say? With tin foil hats on?

      <p>
       9/11 != UFO invasion with Bush in his space craft at front. So what does this mean?  It means you lose, you dork, you are basically an obvious shill trying associate 9/11 and crop circles together to degrade any credibility, because I guess we all believe the same crap huh?

       9-11 Was orchestrated to launch the Jewish hoax known as the War on Terror - with its preplanned wars and infringements upon our freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The official account is that the World Trade Center buildings suffered spontaneous structural collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alternative account put forth by Scholars For 9/11 Truth is that the WTC buildings were destroyed via controlled demolition by pre positioned devices.

      <p>
       “I’m constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud.”

       "We can see the Israeli Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu coming out with a very interesting statement that leaders should speak in public like they do in private whenever they can. He believes that the result of this publication, which makes the sentiments of many privately held beliefs public, are promising a pretty good [indecipherable] will lead to some kind of increase in the peace process in the Middle East and particularly in relation to Iran."
      </p>
      <p>
       The article also quotes Huseyin Celik, deputy leader of Erdogan's AKP, as hinting that the leaks were engineered by Israel. Celik is quoted as saying: "One has to look at which countries are pleased with these. Israel is very pleased. Israel has been making statements for days, even before the release of these documents. Documents were released and they immediately said, 'Israel will not suffer from this'. How did they know that?"

       Just because Assange isn't yet convinced of a 9/11 conspiracy, that makes him a Zionist? Also, the fact that Israel is 'pleased' or wasn't overly affected in the leaks doesn't prove
       <em>
        anything.

       I can understand why you feel it's silly that people ask for citations for things that are on the front page. However, it won't
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       be on the front page, but people might still come across this through a search. They'll see the citation as, "it's on the front page", but that could be days/weeks/months ago by that time, and of course by that time, it'll be no-where near the front page.

       There is only evidence that Al-queda DIDN'T do it.  I have yet to see any evidence whatsoever that shows that 19 hijackers who don't appear on flight manifests and of which SIX of them are still alive, managed to drop WTC7 into its own footprint at free fall speeds!  That's a good one.  Yep, Al-queda really did do it, but there is nothing to show that they could have even been remotely able to pull off what happened that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ahhh, or that's what you're trying to do.  Divide wikileaks from "thruthers" and thus wikileaks is the more reliable (somehow) group and thus should still be more trusted than "thruthers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer at its best right?  So what if the same people who did 9/11 are the same behind wikileaks?  Funny that Julian Assange thinks that 9/11 WAS done by 19 hijackers and is annoyed that people could POSSIBLY think 9/11 was an inside job.  Funny no?

       Although your point is swimmingly lucid, I think it's the wrong point, as the top comment already made it. The truth is one narrative, and it matters which one it is, even if nobody knows it entire. The only narrative that was preconceived is the first one we got.

       The rest of the gov's story is so full of holes that it's hard to believe anything they say.

       That said,  I'm not telling you a missile hit the pentagon,  I'm not telling you that the buildings were brought down by the gov,  I'm not telling you that it was Israelis.

       All I'm saying is the official story is a sack of shit, and until I see evidence that PROVES what they said, then I'm not going to believe much out of them.

      <p>
       That's all I'm trying to say... lots of holes, don't believe them,  so I end up as a 'truther' because I don't believe the official story.   That said, I think about 50% of truther theories are complete bunk,  but they have as much evidence as the official reports.
