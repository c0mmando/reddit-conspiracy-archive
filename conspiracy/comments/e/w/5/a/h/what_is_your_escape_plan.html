       With the proverbial turd getting closer and closer to hitting the fan and creating a shit storm of epic proportions what are you doing to make sure you don't come out covered in shit? And in addition to that what can I do help protect my self?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea yea buy gold and silver, but do you think that will help you when there is a shortage of food? Lets see here do I want gold or do I want to eat tonight?
      </p>
      <p>
       Buying gold and or food to last X amount of time isn't going to help me that much because I'll be stuck in a major city which is going to get hit pretty hard. I mean if the dollar collapses I probably wouldn't feel safe leaving the house because riots are sure to break out. Then again at that point I probably wouldn't feel safe in my apartment either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking for somewhere to go with with like minded people that are willing to move out into the middle of no where, or are already there, and live off the land. This is basically the only reasonable solution as the entire country will probably be immobilized. No food and no clean water makes for a terrible and painful death. You really think FEMA and other emergency services are going to be able to do anything? We all know their reaction with Katrina was abysmal and now they will have to help the entire country.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the

       </a>
       actually come to life and rips this country a new asshole while the dollar is worthless, or it possibly being the catalyst that causes it to be worthless? That is the making of a shit storm the likes of which this world has never seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are you doing to prepare for yourself and the others around you for the worst case scenario?

       i just don't understand this buying gold shit. Gold is at record high prices right now. Don't throw your money down the toilet. And I think you're right, unless the nukes start to fly, gold won't do you much good.

       As the dollar falls, the value of gold tends to go up.  As long as the Fed continues quantitative easing, gold will rise. If you look

       gold tends to move in inverse to bear and bull markets. As we hit the bursting of the internet and housing bubbles, the price continued to rise. Like any other market trend, its not perfect, but its movements have been reliable over the years.

       But my point is it that your going to have one hell of time getting there. I don't know where you live but I'm sure the roads will be congested to all hell with others that have similar ideas. This leaves you with walking there and carrying enough food for the trip plus survival gear which is going to suck balls. Maybe even impossible if you live far enough away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you get up there do you know how to survive in the mountains in the middle of a Canadian winter? You are going to need to be able to find enough food to last the winter which will not be an easy task even for the most prepared.

       buy a 4 wheel drive (you can get a used bronco for like 2k and they all come with 4 wheel drive and plenty of power) outfit the vehicle so that it can be mobile on any surface and survive any environment/civil unrest. keep emergency kits in this vehicle. understand your local environment. know how to obtain water and purify it. know your local plants and which you can eat. dandilions are pretty much everywhere and can make a great salad. keep yourself in good physical shape. always keep rope and a knife. just be creative, fire can be made from so many sources, my favorite is using different types of glass to magnify the suns rays...or having a lighter handy. i have completed a number of survival classes maybe you should sign up for one. i once paddled 60 miles in a kayak in a 4 days, on salt water, with no food, i made my fresh water, and caught my food, it was awesome. i also did one in the woods where i built a shelter and used a snare to catch a bunny for dinner. the one in the woods was very tough because all i was given was what i could carry on me without the use of a back pack. I wouldnt say that i have restored old 4x4s, run everday, practice wilderness survival, etc. to prepare for anything i just found it interesting and made them hobbies of mine.

       In a shtf scenario I don't think the government is going to allow people to drive around the countryside living off the land. I think they will claim you are some kind of security threat / radical, and they will come for you.

       One month of food is nothing. At minimum you need 6 months. Ideally you need 2-3 years worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       A more important point is that water is way more important than food. You would need 2 weeks worth bare minimum. Ideally you have 2-3 months worth, but it's hard to store.

       I absolutely agree. I will stock water when I need to. I also need a generator and yes maybe a gun if things get bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people have not done any preparation. You have to start where you are. Start stocking some things and then keep building it up. It's like saving money. Some preparation is better than no preparation and more is better than a little.

       I live in a small city. I could stay here for awhile, but if things really break down I'll have to get out of Dodge. I'm not currently in a place in the country that I would plan to hold up in for six months. I do have a place to go up in the hills, with water, food and friends. I may be living in a tent for awhile, but that's fine.

       If civilization collapses, silver is worthless.  There's no going back to silver and gold until everything stablizes - if ever.  It's just not as useful as it once was.

       Currency would gasoline.  Solar panels.  Wind-up radios.  Tents.  Outdoor winter clothing.  But mostly non-perishable food:  Canned goods and dry goods.

       Gold is valued too high to be practical, but silver will be used. All the other things you mentioned will be used as well. Anything truely useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the collapse will be quick, still it will be somewhat incremental. It will come in waves. I think some people will not be able to adjust, but may of us will be OK.

       Stay put... I live in a rural area of werstern australia. I live on 23 acres with my own rainwater, veges, cattle, sheep and goats. I have recently brought another property (land only 90 acres) that is 30min drive away that borders national forrest that has abundant wildlife eg rabbits, kangaroos, emu's and pigs(so I could set up camp there if required. I have four firearms (3 rifles one shotgun) I will stay put and defend with my wife and kids.

       I've only jokingly thought about this in the event of the Zombie Apocalypse, but I do have a plan of sorts, however I'm fleshing this out on the fly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking of putting together a go-bag, to contain basic essentials, change of clothes, survival tools, tent, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in the UK so don't have immediate access to weapons. However, my old school has a cadet force and has many semi-automatic SA-80 rifles onsite along with plenty of ammo. Reasonably easy to get to if you have the tools and know exactly where they are, plus the added benefit that I would probably be the first there and not many people know of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm a bit of an airsoft geek and 99% of the British public wouldn't know the difference between an airsoft G36C and the real steel. Especially if I was wearing my navy coveralls, combat boots, and webbing. It'd be enough to get the majority of people out of my way immediately, just by intimidation, enough to at least shock them. However, it wouldn't be long until I got my hands on a real rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm fortunate enough to live in Surrey, close enough to London to be in a big town, but only 15 minutes from the country if I'm properly going for it.  Being a large town there are a lot of luxury vehicle showrooms, my preference would be a Mercedes G class.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the plan would be this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Shit hits the fan, complete anarchy, people dying in the streets.
       </li>
       <li>
        I work from home, so would simply grab my go-bag and get kitted in my mil-sim kit complete with airsoft G36C and Glock side-arm to complete the illusion.
       </li>
       <li>
        The wife knows to come straight home. A 15 minute walk, or a 7 minute jog.
       </li>
       <li>
        We jump in the car and head for the Mercedes dealership, picking up a G class. Using my airsoft rifle to scare the shit out of anyone who might put up any resistance.
       </li>
       <li>
        We drive to Ikea for supplies. Why Ikea? Because they have a food section, tinned, dried, and fresh (albeit Swedish food). Everyone else is going to head to the major supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsbury, who's going to head to a furniture store for food? Only me.
       </li>
       <li>
        We then head to the petrol garage to stock up, including filling a few jerry cans for good measure.
       </li>
       <li>
        We then head to my old school and acquire rifles and ammo.
       </li>
       <li>
        Behind my old school is a massive field, crossing this would cut maybe 15-20 minutes of regular traffic (more time saved if the roads are a nightmare) and leads straight onto the A roads to the motorway. G Class comes in handy.
       </li>
       <li>
        Get to the motorway fast, using progressive driving techniques.
       </li>
       <li>
        Motorway progress should be good, most people would still be in shock at this time (and wouldn't even have a plan).
       </li>
       <li>
        Get to the country, find a nice area of woodland with a stream, and set up camp.
       </li>
       <li>
        Turn on the radio and await further updates whilst drinking a cup of tea and cooking up some baked beans.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Total time from putting the plan into action to arriving at camp (fag packet maths) - 105 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although this was conceived tongue-in-cheek, I'd appreciate any criticisms or recommendations. A joke (but achievable) plan is better than no plan at all.

       Wouldn't be a problem in that timeframe, most people wouldn't be reacting as quickly as me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, it's mostly dual carriageways all the way to the motorway, which wouldn't be too much trouble to navigate at pace even if there was traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing with our road networks down here is that, if you know of them, there's always a number of side roads and lanes that you can take that will bring you closer to where you want to be. So even if the main roads were jammed you could find a way through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, I'd be in a big hefty Merc, I would be able to push stubborn vehicles out the way.

       The man with the plan I see. The key to any plan for a situation like this is the go bag, without it you wont be getting very far. One thing I would change is the getting food part. If you are getting non perishables anyway you should just stock up now. You might also want to wait on picking up those weapons as chances are that if its a week day school would be in session which might make their retrieval a bit more difficult. Going back at night might be a better idea. Then again waiting until then might make it to late.
