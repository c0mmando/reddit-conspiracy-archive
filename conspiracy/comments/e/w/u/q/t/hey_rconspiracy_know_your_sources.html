       That is true we should check to see who the writer is on every story. To check for bias, religious affiliation, etc. People should also check into the ownership of the publication of the website, information source, etc.

       Are we allowed to discuss weather or not there is sufficient evidence for the holocaust and the details therein? Also does the term "zionist banker jews" qualify as anti-semitism? Please answer as this is really important.

       If the only bankers you notice are jewish, maybe you aren't anti-semitic, but you are short sighted. And sure, you can discuss whether or not there is sufficient evidence for the holocaust but I have found that most holocaust 'skeptics' haven't done shit for research on it and repeat the same confused points.

       Presumably you have done research on holocaust skepticism? I don't think you can judge a band by it's, dude. In general historical revisionism is a pretty serious subject and considering how much flak they get, they can't afford to make weak points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as a general point about Jewish banking. Usury (which in a historical context means to charge interest) was something which Europeans were forbidden from doing by the Church. Jewish people were not under the same laws as they were allowed to charge interest to gentiles. Muslims were also forbidden from charging interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury#Historical_meaning">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury#Historical_meaning
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This article primarily deals with how it was that Jews in Europe came to become so heavily involved with money lending. It also makes the typically stupid claim that the Jews were being persecuted so they had to engage in morally reprehensible acts but why were they being persecuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       No mainstream source really explains why it is that Jews were hated but if you asked a European from the middle ages, they'd say it was because Jews are infamous for engaging is treason, seeking to influence and corrupt governments, and general problems of dishonesty in dealing with the local people. Hence pogroms and other attacks that didn't affect other minorities. So from a conspiracy stand point, the Jewish roots of modern banking do need to be acknowledged in a particular way.

       I realize that plenty of people do in fact assume that everything in this subreddit is nonsense after they see that some of it is nonsense. Of course that's not true. The problem is that some of the participants here are actively trying to make the subreddit look as bad as possible, such as
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/e8cg9/i_know_we_dont_want_to_post_every_rconspiracy/c1640dd">
        these folks

       and
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/shill/comments/dcv5v/thetoucan_aka_ransommccoy_aka_mandragonhu_aka/">
        these folks
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       To me this subreddit is valuable as a place where unconventional ideas can be presented. Some of it will be accurate and well documented, some of it will be reasonable but poorly documented, some of it will be nonsense offered sincerely and some of it will be nonsense offered maliciously. Given the way reddit works it is simply not possible to exclude or even minimize either kind of nonsense. I agree that people should be encouraged to fact check and do their own research. But I strongly disagree that people should accept accountability for the actions of other members of this "community".

       I think you're missing the point.

      <p>
       A lot of stuff in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       , but not provably true.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that's OK, because it's necessary to have hypotheses before truth can be established; it's all part of the scientific method.

       A lot of the conspiracies here really
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       very long-lived, enough to have entered conspiracy-theory folklore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of them are simply entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favourites:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The dancing Israelis on 9/11
       </li>
       <li>
        Who shot JFK?
       </li>
       <li>
        Gold-coated tungsten bricks at Fort Knox
       </li>
       <li>
        Legislation to open large number of detention camps at military bases in the USA
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Good times, and new information just keeps popping up, to be kept in mind should anything supportive come along.

       people can put out what they like the whole idea of conspiracy theories is you don't believe jack until you have evidence - that is the fun of it - if for example sorcha faal wants to tell us about a ufo invasion then let him - he wil be bombarded with the excellent redditors but i am totally against stopping these people from airing their views no matter how stupid they are - if you don't like it down vote it!

       I'd like to add that if you have some huge breaking story, search some of the names or locations first in Google News.  If the best source you have covering the story has wordpress, blogger, or blogspot in the URL... don't submit it.

       As something of a side note I don't think that posts that come from a serious christian angle and condemn "Satanism" should really be allowed here. It's not that I refuse to consider the bible as a source of conspiracy theory but to constantly infer that it's basically god v the devil or some other theological point is pretty tiresome to wade through if you don't subscribe to that narrow subgenre of religion.

       Then help them to see the symbolic connections between their eschatology, the material world, and the abode of heaven, not as it appears in imagination, but as embodied in the living principles of truth and goodness to which we must cleave ourselves for there to be any hope of a satisfying future.
