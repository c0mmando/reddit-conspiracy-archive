<p>Sound familiar at all? No? Ok, then how about these stories from last year:</p>

</ul>

<p>Need I go on? What all these stories have in common, besides the obvious, is that they were concocted by one &quot;<a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index632.htm">Sorcha Faal</a>&quot;, a longtime disseminator of completely unadulterated bullshit, that for reasons beyond my comprehension, much of the internet is determined to take quite seriously.</p>

<p>So <strong>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE</strong> for the love of all that we hold dear, learn to fucking discriminate truth from fiction! Learn to fact-check! Learn to research! Because this really <em>is</em> serious business, and your lazy confirmation bias and sophomoric approach to knowledge makes all of us look ignorant, paranoid, and foolish.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Looks like the submitter of today&#39;s story took it down, kudos to them for doing the right thing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Presumably you have done research on holocaust skepticism? I don&#39;t think you can judge a band by it&#39;s, dude. In general historical revisionism is a pretty serious subject and considering how much flak they get, they can&#39;t afford to make weak points. </p>

<p>Just as a general point about Jewish banking. Usury (which in a historical context means to charge interest) was something which Europeans were forbidden from doing by the Church. Jewish people were not under the same laws as they were allowed to charge interest to gentiles. Muslims were also forbidden from charging interest.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury#Historical_meaning">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury#Historical_meaning</a></p>

<p>This article primarily deals with how it was that Jews in Europe came to become so heavily involved with money lending. It also makes the typically stupid claim that the Jews were being persecuted so they had to engage in morally reprehensible acts but why were they being persecuted.</p>

<p>No mainstream source really explains why it is that Jews were hated but if you asked a European from the middle ages, they&#39;d say it was because Jews are infamous for engaging is treason, seeking to influence and corrupt governments, and general problems of dishonesty in dealing with the local people. Hence pogroms and other attacks that didn&#39;t affect other minorities. So from a conspiracy stand point, the Jewish roots of modern banking do need to be acknowledged in a particular way. </p>

<p>I realize that plenty of people do in fact assume that everything in this subreddit is nonsense after they see that some of it is nonsense. Of course that&#39;s not true. The problem is that some of the participants here are actively trying to make the subreddit look as bad as possible, such as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/e8cg9/i_know_we_dont_want_to_post_every_rconspiracy/c1640dd">these folks</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/shill/comments/dcv5v/thetoucan_aka_ransommccoy_aka_mandragonhu_aka/">these folks</a>. </p>

<p>To me this subreddit is valuable as a place where unconventional ideas can be presented. Some of it will be accurate and well documented, some of it will be reasonable but poorly documented, some of it will be nonsense offered sincerely and some of it will be nonsense offered maliciously. Given the way reddit works it is simply not possible to exclude or even minimize either kind of nonsense. I agree that people should be encouraged to fact check and do their own research. But I strongly disagree that people should accept accountability for the actions of other members of this &quot;community&quot;. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re missing the point.</p>

<p>A lot of stuff in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is <em>possible</em>, but not provably true.</p>

<p>However, that&#39;s OK, because it&#39;s necessary to have hypotheses before truth can be established; it&#39;s all part of the scientific method.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the conspiracies here really <em>are</em> very long-lived, enough to have entered conspiracy-theory folklore.</p>

<p>Some of them are simply entertaining.</p>

<p>My favourites:</p>

<ul>
<li>The dancing Israelis on 9/11</li>
<li>Who shot JFK?</li>
<li>Gold-coated tungsten bricks at Fort Knox</li>
<li>Legislation to open large number of detention camps at military bases in the USA</li>
