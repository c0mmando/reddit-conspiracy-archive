<p>I&#39;m telling you, I have pictures of one of these towers.  With Location (Sawgrass Mills Mall, South Florida) and with a license plate that identifies the apparatus as belonging to the <em>Sunrise</em> police department.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve offered <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a whole ton of stuff that conspiracy groups tend to salivate over....and you&#39;re giving me grief for offering it.  What&#39;s your angle?</p>

<p>Read the last few posts again. Did you not realize how ridiculous they were? Now compare it to this topic. If you&#39;re going to make a topic about some images, then what&#39;s the point of not having any images in the first place? Obviously people are already interested in the images if they clicked on the topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much more simply can I break this down for you?</p>

<p>There was absolutely NOTHING stopping you from posting the images in the first place. I&#39;ve been replying, people have been upvoting/downvoting, so I&#39;m pretty sure <em>someone</em> is interested in these images.</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t feel like posting the images in the first place, then there wass absolutely no point in making this thread at all.</p>

<p>If you still don&#39;t understand what the point of my earlier posts were, then again, you are one dense ( pardon my language ) mother fucker. They were meaningless, what was the point of typing out a place holder for a reply when I could have just posted a regular reply in the first place? It&#39;s ridiculous.

    <div class="md"><p>Catch-22, at this point.</p>

<p>I do want to post those pictures, shit I took the time to stop and snap them.  However, so far, I&#39;ve gotten nothing but scorn and trolls from this subreddit.</p>

<p>Why go thru the hassle (camera - usb- imgur - reddit)  when nobody seems to care?</p>

<p>As I said from the start, if you want these pictures, tell me.  If you just don&#39;t care, than I&#39;ll delete them.  It&#39;s faster than putting them on imgur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, I see all the hate you are getting, and let me explain to you why:</p>

<p>a) You&#39;re playing a cock-tease, simply put. The whole &quot;if you want them, ill upload them&quot;, &quot;i might lose karma for it&quot; talk. Your post says &quot;I have a whole bunch of pictures&quot; POST THE FUCKING PICTURES</p>

<p>b) Those &quot;mobile prison towers&quot; can also be called &quot;elevated security booths&quot;. I see plenty of security booths around NYC - at construction sites, in front of government buildings, in busy commuter areas, etc. They&#39;re not &quot;prison towers&quot;, they are elevated so that whoever sits in them can have a better view of the area. There is no controversy over them unless you are a brainwashed moron. </p>
