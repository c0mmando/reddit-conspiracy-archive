<p>Low IQs relative to what?  What empirical and objective measures are you using to draw this conclusion?  Call me crazy but I&#39;m skeptical of your opinions, and you have provided me no reason not to be.</p>

<p>There are a vocal minority of people who have the inability to argue a position and resort to posturing and pseudo skeptisim, but that is by no means the entire subreddit, nor should the be the posters you engage with or take seriously.</p>

<p>A parallell can be drawn to the handful of Anti Semetic posters who populate this reddit with their opinions/links.  Does that mean that all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> readers are jew hating bigots, (sheep and sickening) obviously not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But Mr. Jones is a well known shill, who is put into that position by his backers - undoubtedly he exists precisely so that intelligent people stay away. But you can&#39;t use Alex Jones as proof that the system doesn&#39;t lie. You live in a world where subterfuge and propaganda don&#39;t exist. I&#39;m sorry but the facts don&#39;t allow you to operate as though everything is just peachy. I don&#39;t think anyone can say what is true - but it is rational to suspect conspiracy, if you can&#39;t do that then you aren&#39;t really thinking. There is nothing wrong with thinking out side the box so long as you temper it with logic, but taking up the absolute position that conspiracies don&#39;t exist is plain wrong - because they do. Alex Jones is evidence of how deep it goes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the point I&#39;m making. You&#39;re guilty of the very thing you&#39;re accusing the skeptic community of.</p>

<p>To be a skeptic, you must arrive at conclusions based on facts and evidence. Not a gut feeling. If there is not enough evidence, your conclusion is inconclusive. </p>

<p>A gut feeling is a great starting point. But it should never end there. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll also point out that I like conspiracy theories for a couple of reasons: they&#39;re entertaining (and I don&#39;t mean in the haha, look at those morons entertaining); they DO allow you to approach a problem or a situation with a different point of view. </p>

<p>However, until evidence has been weighed, I do not buy any conclusion. </p>

<p>You&#39;re supposed to be the skeptic here. Randi isn&#39;t a scientist - that should really be enough. You let a stage magician make claims about reality which you are skeptical about. That kind of stupidity is mind blowing. There are many more issues where skeptics are obviously refusing to look at good data etc. You owe it to yourself to do your own thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by &quot;let [Randi]... make claims about reality&quot; ?</p>

<p>You know that at any time Randi&#39;s opinions or statements can be examined? And so what if he isn&#39;t technically a scientist: That doesn&#39;t stop him from using the scientific method. Anyone can use it.</p>

<p>Do you have specific grievances with Randi? What I mean is - What claims has he made that (you think) the skeptical community has embraced without checking out for themselves?</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>Randi claims to have an experiment (if you will) that currently disproves various psi claims etc. There are gaping flaws in the way he goes about doing this. The skeptical community accepts his challenge as if it were scientific and is intentionally blind to the pitfalls. Skeptics shouldn&#39;t show this level of bias to a given outcome. </p>

<p>Randi&#39;s challenge supports a traditional idea about reality - the idea that psi cannot be shown to be real etc (so in detail here, the idea that only things which are measurable/provable etc are real is a claim. It doesn&#39;t get addressed much but accurately speaking we don&#39;t have a completely accurate model for reality, hence skeptics are making a claim as well - one which also needs to be proven.) </p>

<p>So the problem is that there evidence has been brought forward that would normally be accepted by any other part of science. Of course it&#39;s discounted for various lame reasons, but the fact is that the Randi challenge has already been won - it&#39;s just that Randi doesn&#39;t accept data as proof. I pick on Randi because he has this swagger which is so convincing - and because skeptics use it so often &quot;Wouldn&#39;t the Randi challenge have been won if it was real?&quot;</p>

<p>So in the question of scientific evidence Randi does a great job of distracting from that data that exists - and he&#39;s a propagandist and a shill, and he attacks ideas that real scientists are trying to work on. It is my opinion that this level of hostility serves some agenda - to allow Randi to operate within a truly skeptical community is wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of voice you think I was asking those questions in, but I can assure you that they were sincere.</p>

<p>Obviously you think evidence is somewhat... pointless?</p>

<p>I shall quote you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the fact is that the Randi challenge has already been won - it&#39;s just that Randi doesn&#39;t accept data as proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and I ask again: When was the challenge been won, by whom and how? And if it HAS been won, then it was won under conditions as stated in the challenge. Otherwise... it can&#39;t have been won, surely? That&#39;s like winning the Grand National... but not on the day the GN was held. Yes?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t assume I&#39;m taking the piss - I&#39;m asking a serious question. Of course, you can attempt to insult me again, even with a cheeky smiley wink at the end of the sentence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay correction, the Randi challenge has been rendered meaningless by the data that is OUT THERE. I don&#39;t understand how you can struggle so much with that concept. Randi is void, meaningless, defunct, redundant, useless,  because of EVIDENCE.</p>

<p>Even if there was none the Randi challenge would STILL BE MEANINGLESS BECAUSE IT IS NOT SCIENTIFIC. Okay understand what that means - it was never significant in the first place. </p>

<p>Insofar as the Randi Challenge is a kind of inquest for the truth then some basic evidence for psi has been provided - what is needed now is more and better research. So in a kind of informal way evidence has been provided it&#39;s just that the Randi challenge in typical unscientific fashion RULES OUT EVIDENCE THAT REQUIRES INTERPRETATION OF DATA. Arguing doesn&#39;t change the facts. If applied more liberally Randi would rule out many theories and concepts that are accepted within science. There is a difference between skepticism and clever ways of nullifying real data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTW I just want to mention that you are not a skeptic because the notion of actually doing a bit of simple inquiry is foreign to you. You ought to take a neutral position on PSI for instance and simply read the best evidence and read the best counter evidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very simple to contrast what a properly executed scientific inquiry is, what it is meant to achieve, what it may or may not draw as a conclusion. The Randi Challenge fails to live up to those rigors. From it&#39;s outset is meant to defend a pre-drawn conclusion about the nature of reality - I myself was deceived by Randi for sometime, so many people cited it. </p>

<p>Randi is a high profile skeptic (or biased asshole as some would prefer) so automatically you can&#39;t have double blind anything, his association with the project guarantees biased outcomes. If it&#39;s supposed to be a scientific inquiry, why do people feel as though they taking a penalty in world cup final? These things can and are obviously exploited by Randi to a particular outcome - and this isn&#39;t uncommon there is a juvenile theological war going on right now. the same sorts of tactic can be seen by high profile atheists. It&#39;s not that doubting is wrong, it&#39;s that many people have clear beliefs about what is and is not possible. Randi and Dawkins promote a kind of militant Materialistic dogma that institutional science seems to have a fondness for.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really come here to make a case for PSI, just to make one against Randi. The evidence that I would present has been rejected by the skeptic community because the reason was something like, PSI is an extraordinary claim so you need extraordinary evidence to prove it, or something like that. So if you accept that kind of reasoning then there is no need to bother looking for evidence. </p>

<p>The book is: The Conscious Universe: The Scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena - perhaps you have heard of it. It is simply an interpretation of the data that has been available for years. To me it gets rejected because it is ultimately too boring for the doubters, but it is good science. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read back up the thread and you&#39;ll see that I started my comments asking plain and simple questions. How you initially interpreted them, well that&#39;s only for you to know. But I assure you they were sincere - I don&#39;t know much about the Randi challenge at all, other than it&#39;s been around for quite some time and that no-one has won. And that many people refuse to take it. And that Randi dismisses some people outright.</p>

<p>The only thing I said (claimed, even though I said &quot;From what I understand...&quot;), regarding the challenge, was that it is &quot;not unscientific&quot;. It&#39;s not simply: &quot;What card am I holding up? No you&#39;re wrong - mythbusted!!!&quot;</p>

<p>When it comes to being conclusive - I don&#39;t think anyone (connected with the challenge) has claimed that it is to be considered conclusive evidence of whether or not a phenomena exists. That&#39;s where proper studies come in.</p>

<p>The point of the challenge (ignoring whether or not Randi has used it as promotional material) is that many people don&#39;t take him up on the offer. I am of the opinion that it is THESE people that Randi has set up the challenge for - to show them up in so far as they won&#39;t put their money where their mouth is. Kind of a &quot;Oh yeah, well if you&#39;re for real then come and do this, chicken!&quot;</p>

<p>Childish, maybe, but people <em>do</em> take the test because they think they&#39;re have &#39;powers&#39;. And invariable they do no better than chance.</p>

<p>I have to say, though, considering how many people are of the opinion that it&#39;s a load of rubbish and Randi doesn&#39;t accept all comers and isn&#39;t that terrible etc - I&#39;d be interested in knowing who has that opinion. I have a feeling that the majority are people who make certain claims about certain things.</p>

<p>(By the way - Throughout all of this, I have not stated my acceptance of the claim (other than to say &quot;from what I understand... it&#39;s not unscientific&quot;), I have not stated my support of Randi, and I have not (in this thread) stated that I am a member of the skeptical community. Just saying.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh well great, what can I say - why didn&#39;t you say so in the first place? The issue is that you only focus on the Randi issue, as if in defense. It is the internet and it&#39;s hard to gauge what a person is getting at so I&#39;d say you implied yourself to be a skeptic - but I don&#39;t really think that  And I did get a couple trollish comments which </p>

<p>As for the test - one issue that I often suspect is this. I believe that if a person believes something is true, they can/could make it happen. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever done a test for psychic ability but having conviction that it is real really does matter. It could well be that Randi is psychic black hole - people actually lose their ability around him (and others like him.) Science needs to perhaps deal with the possibility that particular emotional states are needed in order for a good demonstration to be conducted. We have some really powerful evidence that a person can for example lift significantly more weight than normal when asked to visualize it in a specific way - and importantly banish all doubt that it is possible. So in a certain way I think the main problem here is that what we think is possible could have a limiting influence on this.</p>

<p>Another bit of quasi evidence is that the major war powers of the world have all put quite a bit of effort into remote viewing and I am convinced they did get results. There are a few somewhat famous incidents where remote viewers were able to spy on Soviet weapons projects etc. If such technology existed then it would make sense that we are be dissuaded from believing in PSI - as a matter of national security perhaps.</p>

<p>Nobody said the Randi challenge was particularly meaningful. It&#39;s a statement, more than anything. It&#39;s offered, and continues to offer, a clear and easy way for someone to win a great deal of money by demonstrating the efficacy of something generally considered pseudo-scientific. The skeptic community generally finds it interesting and amusing, but the existence of the challenge isn&#39;t integral to or necessarily representative of the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think skeptics are truly skeptical - if they were, I think they would be on the side of the outcast points of view. The problem is that high profile skeptics represent the mainstream opinion about things (materialism being the philosophic stance.) It&#39;s basically the same issue with atheists - a lot of misrepresenting the opposition and premature declarations of victory. The problem is really politics, I tend to see it all over the place - the skeptic believes in the scientific community as being beyond reproach, a stance I see as being ignorant. The fact that skeptics are willing to take on the prosecution of so-called heretics must be called into question. I enjoy the use of my skeptical faculties but I adamantly reject the label &quot;skeptic&quot; - I&#39;m more sympathetic to the term conspiracy theorist because that is an external label used to dismiss valid ideas - but there is nothing wrong with it per se. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think skeptics see the scientific community as “beyond reproach&quot;. Certainly they will defend it more often than not, especially when it is the whole institution and philosophy that is &quot;science&quot; that&#39;s being attacked. But skeptics I know delight in debating the accuracy, conclusions and merits of individual scientific theories or results. As another small criticism of your generalisations, I would argue that materialism, while a growing influence on or world and a dominant philosophy in the scientific arena, is far from popular. Have you seen the ads for psychics on television? Read they&#39;d horoscopes in the papers? Most people have a decidedly dualistic stance on reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And dualism is pretty important but as popular as it is - our whole educational system has been given over to scienceism materialism etc. Science used to also accept dualism, as in &quot;we&#39;ll deal with the material world and let the church do the rest&quot; I think it can be argued that materialism has more power than it should - mostly because people are tired of being screwed with from religion and perhaps there is a sense that it&#39;s also happening from science and education generally. I have serious misgivings that peer review represents some form of excellence in thought and isn&#39;t a kind of censorship. Skeptics in my book really are all about debunking - things like psi research, and its done very badly. I already mentioned Randi who isn&#39;t a scientist and probably nothing but a big jack ass, and people respect him only because he basically defends the mainstream - it&#39;s bad. But I can accept that the people are more nuanced - i just think high profile skeptics deserve some skepticism too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s difficult to get past this wall of athiesm/materialism that people often present. If you want to understand this you have to accept the softer side to humanity. Spirituality makes a good degree of sense to us. It&#39;s much more appealing to think of your soul as though it continues after death. The idea that we cease to exist after death is uncomfortable to humans - and it causes other pain and suffering to us to believe that. If you believe that we are all ultimately these divine souls or whatever, it helps to ease the pain of being human, you&#39;re more likely to empathize and less likely to get worked up about things that happen here on earth. (within reason you can go over board of course.) 
It&#39;s not so important that it can be shown to be real because science accepts that what we call reality is a slippery thing - we understand it but only to a certain degree. 
It&#39;s maybe not possible to have proof of everything as we would like so we have to theorize. In a sense spirituality is a theory which I think goes some way to explain reality better. I don&#39;t accept a purely materialistic view because that describes me as a kind of &quot;biological robot&quot; which I find cheapens the whole thing. 
So although I don&#39;t have a real solid opinion about spirituality I think it really does work well with the world the science has revealed. Again religion and theology is something I see as being a somewhat separate issue.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol! So lacking in a convincing argument... (!) Surely you have some evidence, or argument to back up your claim, rather than assuming that the whole scientific community is corrupt?</p>

<p>Has the community ousted those who fake claims? Yes, a number of times.</p>

<p>Does the peer review method (generally) find out about doctored data and falsified claims with some degree of rapidity? Yes.</p>

<p>Scientists don&#39;t just say &quot;Yay look at that, how wonderful that it worked!&quot; and just moved on. If a claim is made that is useful and revolutionary, then the method and practice will be used widely. If the claim is false then it will become apparent quickly.</p>

<p>Can you explain how I am naive? Note: I&#39;m approaching this as an academic scientist, but not one in or near pharmaceutics. </p>

<p>Make up your mind about people quickly, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that my first venture into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and the two people I&#39;ve conversed with, on the same thread, have been dismissive and not given any details of their claims/opinions.Could it be a theme around here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you think everything <em>can</em> be definitely proven...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What has that got to do with whether or not peer review has discovered frauds?</p>

<p>Is it, or is it not, the case that peer review etc is a good method for determining whether or not a claimants is being accurate and &#39;true&#39;, particularly for any follow up to their work is generally done by more and more people as their work proliferates? (again, ignoring pharmaceuticals)</p>

<p>Please, please - tell me where I&#39;m going wrong, unless you&#39;re also another high and mighty who can&#39;t be bothered to deal with another one of these silly skeptics who needs evidence before they believe a claim - isn&#39;t it annoying when we apply that reasoning to a claim that <em>you</em> make?</p>

<p>They rarely ask the question: &quot;Could evidence presented to the mainstream be manipulated or faked?&quot;</p>

<p>That is what you said. My first comment was in response to this. You then told me I was wrong to assume that peer review (that thing I often masturbate myself silly to) was a viable method for detecting fraudulent claims.</p>

<p>I think that about covers that issue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Protocols is a fabricated document, and is entirely fictional. It was originally produced in Russia between 1897 and 1903 (perhaps motivated by the First Zionist Congress, held in Switzerland in 1897), and was partially based on an 1864 French book Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu. Implicated in the creation of the forgery was Pyotr Ivanovich Rachkovsky, head of the Paris office of the Russian Secret Police during the same time period.</p>

<p>The source material for the forgery was the synthesis of an 1864 book of fiction by French political satirist Maurice Joly, titled Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu or Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu, and a chapter from an 1868 book of fiction entitled &quot;Biarritz&quot; by antisemitic German novelist Hermann Goedsche, which had been translated into Russian in 1872.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for the scientific method to work you have to keep only only one variable independent. </p>

<p>When you come across complex issues, the reductionist approach can only work over very short periods of time as any longer the results do not hold up to scrutiny as there are too many competing variables.</p>

<p>e.g. Pharmaceuticals --&gt; SSRIs flood the brain with serotonin to aid depression because it works quickly. Healing the gut (where 80% of serotonin is made) is the best long term strategy for depression, BUT takes longer and so is thrown out (not scientific?!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think skeptics see the scientific community as “beyond reproach&quot;. Certainly they will defend it more often than not, especially when it is the whole institution and philosophy that is &quot;science&quot; that&#39;s being attacked. But skeptics I know delight in debating the accuracy, conclusions and merits of individual scientific theories or results. As another small criticism of your generalisations, I would argue that materialism, while a growing influence on or world and a dominant philosophy in the scientific arena, is far from popular. Have you seen the ads for psychics on television? Read they&#39;d horoscopes in the papers? Most people have a decidedly dualistic stance on reality.</p>
