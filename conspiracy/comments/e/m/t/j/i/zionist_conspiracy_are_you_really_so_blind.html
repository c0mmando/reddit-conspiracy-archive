       Clearly there are Zionists, people who want the state of Israel to be Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       But think about it like this.  If we had a two-state solution, it's plausible (not saying likely, just plausible) that any pro-caliphate Muslim movement would convince Muslims to move into Israel (assuming it's NOT a Jewish state, just a democracy) and create a large pro-Islamic voting bloc.
      </p>
      <p>
       After some time, the new laws would in effect turn Israel into another Muslim nation.  I think the US and the EU do not want that to happen because as long as Israel remains non-Muslim, the caliphate cannot be expanded, Muslims cannot amass further power, whatever.  That is my rationale for why the US and EU want Israel so badly to remain non-Muslim.  In other words, Israel is a proxy being used by the Western interests to prevent an accumulation of Islamic power.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means it's not the Zionists leading the US and EU around by the nose, it's more like both groups are having their desires met.  The Zionists get an exclusively Jewish land (which is contrary to the idea of global harmony/democracy) and the US/EU gets a powerful tool for delaying the accumulation of Muslim power.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr It's not JUST the Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  When I talk about Israel being not just a Jewish state, I'm referencing what the neighboring, Arab states want out of Israel.  That, and of course liberating Palestine, seem to be the two things stopping them from recognizing Israel's right to exist.

       Isreal is the puppeteer, The West is the puppet.  After all, who is fighting the wars in the Middle East on behalf of Israeli interests, Israel or America/Canada/Britain/Australia/Europe?  How many Israeli soldiers are fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan for so-called American/European interests?

       In all seriousity, I remember reading something about how China was planning on building this big pipeline in Iraq.  Then we invaded.  Years later, we were planning on building a pipeline that would run through the tip of Georgia (I guess through South Ossetia) and - what do you know - Russia invades just the tip (lol) of Georgia.  I guess my take on a lot of wars has turned away from "oligarchy gets resources" to "oligarchy denies others resources."  I can't see how displacing the political structure of Iraq really helped Israel - they certainly are not Israel's biggest threat.  And maybe it did help Israel, but it also hurt China so I think the US was killing two birds with one stone.

       The Israeli flag has two blue bars that represent two rivers, and between those bars is a Star of David that represents Israel, the people.  Do you know which two rivers they represent?  Israel's inheritance of the land between the Nile (Egypt) and the Euphrates (Iraq).
      </p>
      <p>
       ארץ ישראל השלמה‎, Eretz Yisrael Hashlemah
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible contains three geographical definitions of the Land of Israel. The first, found in Genesis 15:18-21, is vague. It describes a large territory, "from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates", comprising all of modern-day Israel, the Palestinian Territories, and Lebanon, as well as large parts of Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eretz Yisrael, or
       <em>
        Greater Israel
       </em>
       , occasionally refers to the Promised Land (defined in Genesis 15:18-21) or to the Land of Israel, and is also called Complete Land of Israel or "Entire Land of Israel", (ארץ ישראל השלמה)‎.
      </p>
      <p>
       The design of the Israeli 10 agorot coin was briefly a subject of controversy. In a press conference called by Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat in Geneva on December 13, 1988, he claimed that the obverse design of this coin incorporates a map of "Greater Israel" that "goes from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia, from the Red Sea to the Euphrates", and thus reflects Zionist expansionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israeli 10 agorot coin can be seen

       It's not a war of Jew vs. Muslim.  It's a war of strength and power.  This is not religious anymore, it's political and politics are for politicians.  As we all know, politicians are evil.

       You are likely not thinking for yourself.  You see, your reason, logic and fairness is out the door.  You're likely playing favorites, based on either a false religious doctrine or not recognizing that all peoples don't have industries promoting their victimhood in every nook &amp; cranny of entertainment and education.  Or, you might think, "well, this is true, but what Israel is doing to Palestine is what we did with the native savages who were present when we finally arrived to our New World, so, it's Ok, I think, yea".

       Well that's a good analogy.  However, I do believe that what Israel is doing is wrong.  I don't think I've said that to the contrary.  I'd like to separate out Jews and Zionists; and I don't believe that most Jews get stuff by complaining about the Holocaust.  Zionists almost certainly, but not every Jew is a Zionist - just want to make that distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, I think I'm thinking for myself by giving Jews the benefit of the doubt in the same way that giving Palestinians unfettered freedom and absolution from Israel allows them the same benefit by assuming they won't turn into an Islamofascist proxy.  None of the groups are bad, but institutions exist for amassing power and wealth through global politicking and trade which greedy individuals embark on.  As ABsynth808 put it above, Zionism is the current banner under which these greedy people march.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess there's a lot of vague terminology regarding Jews and Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       My original point is that it's the "pro-Israel politicians" (who are not necessarily global Zionists) that are being used by the EU and US.  And maybe the opposite was true when they got Israel founded.  But going forward, I'd like to distinguish between people who take the banner of Zionism to further their global financial power and those who are genuine Zionists who simply want a Jewish state of Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't think I've said anything that implies what Israel is doing is okay.

       I don't think it's the commonly accepted truth that Zionist goals extend outside of creating a Zionist nation.  If you care to elaborate...

       Yes, the fact we even have our fake fiat debt to sell is part of the elite zionist movement.  USA never sold its debt like it was money until after 1913.   The zionists want everyone to buy and own bank debt, so then they can control all nations with these fake illegal debt instruments.

       Meh, I call BS.  Even if it happens, it's institutionalized.  And if there are a lot of Jews that run the show, it's an occurrence and in no way related to a global Zionist movement.  What could they possibly want?  They already have Israel plus some extra land.  There's no drive for a global Jewish society.  I believe there's a depopulation drive, but it's being pushed by people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, too.  I think it's just a rich-guy thing, and there happen to be a lot of Jews in that circle.  Furthermore, the creation and maintenance of a Zionist nation helps the rich stay rich by influencing global politics, and that's where it ends.  Taking it any further gets quasi-religious and I just don't see that being the case.  It's all institutionalized power; and hey, if collateralized debt was invented by Jews, that doesn't necessarily tie it into a global Zionist plot.  A global rich-guy plot, maybe, but Zionism is a tool in the greater scheme of things.

       I agree but this is at the lower levels.  The upper elite are the bankers, the bankers are all zionists (not even necessarily jewish).  And if tomorrow there were a more aggressive dominating religious sect other than zionsism, all the elite would convert and become that new religion.  Religion has always and always will be used as a way for men to control other men.  I agree zionism "isnt it" but its what the elite are using right now to rally behind.  No one can attack Zionism without being labeled a kook psycho racist.  Its perfect for now until the majority of people identify the problem, falsely being Zionism, and then the elite move over to another group when their done using zionism.  Right now the problem is Zionism, but zionism itself is a cover.  We really have a handful of evil corrupt families that are trying to depopulate and control and enslave the world.  Call them what you want.

       Also, i ve seen what the zionists are doing to the plaestinians.  sorry, i dont want to live anywhere near a zionist and Im afraid in the future my children will have to fight off aggressive zionism settlement encroachment.
