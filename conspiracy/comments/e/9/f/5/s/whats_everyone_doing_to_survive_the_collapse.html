I&#39;m even considering cashing in all my rrsps&#39;s and taking it off the stock market and converting it. I have a 1 bedroom in vancouver and pay a morgage. Not feeling very safe about that, but dont really know what i can do to get out of it without losing a ton of money.  Does anyone actually have survival gear ready? Or stored food?

    <div class="md"><p>Some people can do all the things you listed and still afford to buy gold and/or silver.  I don&#39;t think many people recommend buying gold and/or silver before buying what you suggest, but if you can afford it afterwords without cutting it close why not?</p>

<p>I feel far safer having my savings in precious metals rather than fiat currencies, you never know when the central bank will decide to devalue your savings by printing massive amounts of new money.  The purchasing power of gold and silver has stayed pretty consistent throughout history, it&#39;s the fiat currencies that don&#39;t last long and fluctuate like crazy all the time.</p>

<p>Growing a garden is one of the best ways to ensure survival, plus it has the benefit of supplying you with the healthiest food possible.  After learning how to grow a garden learn how to preserve your food so food from your garden can get you by all year if needed.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to spend 60 dollars on seeds, but if you buy something else make sure it&#39;s either heirloom or open pollination seed, hybrids are only good for one grow, the seeds they produce are usually worthless.</p>

<p><a href="http://shop.ebay.com/141414becky/m.html">These</a> seeds are a lot less of an investment, but at the same time not nearly as good of a deal.  250,000 seeds divided by 60 dollars equals roughly 4,167 seeds per dollar, with the cheaper kit you only get 2,500 seeds and it costs over 10 dollars.</p>

<p>I just realized you&#39;re in an apartment, if that&#39;s the case growing a garden is still possible but limited.  If you have a balcony utilize that, otherwise you can still grow many things inside with the right setup.  If there is empty land near you use that, permaculture is the solution to many problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t just go get as much gold and silver that your money can buy. Granted, it IS a good idea to have SOME of your worthless paper converted into precious metals. If you ask me, convert your money into a few other things: Training (learn how to survive with nothing), Survival gear (sleeping bags, tents, water purification, etc..), bug out bags for home and car (in case you need to leave). Remember ONE serious suggestion: STAY PUT. Seriously - 95% of the people out there, when SHTF will up and leave because they aren&#39;t prepared. If you can stay where you are for AT LEAST one week, you should be good. At that point, the mass hysteria should have subsided enough to begin to search about for survivors and assistance. Of course all of this is assuming that you aren&#39;t directly affected by said disaster or happening, i.e. soldiers aren&#39;t busting down your doors or a nuke went off within 50 miles of you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are in a near communist state like California you would be advized to get out while you can. If the Federal government becomes unable to pay for its operations (which is what would happen after a currency collapse) a balkanization would occur. Texas would become its own state and may not even let in people from other states (half the jobs created in the US this year were created in low tax Texas). States like california would have a complete junk bond rating but the business friendly states would at least have a good credit rating and access to capital ensuring at least some form of civilization.</p>

<p>Los Angeles would immediately become like Mogadishu. In anti-gun states the law abiding yet unarmed citizens would be hunted for sport by roving gangs. Citizens in pro-second-amendment states would fare much better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the oscillation hits the defecation, I&#39;m going to move as far north as comfortably possible and live in a heavily-wooded/mountainous area. I live on Vancouver Island, so &quot;acquiring&quot; someone&#39;s boat would be essential. Since you live in Vancouver, I suggest you do the same. Bring all your gold and silver and we could create a hidden, possibly subterraneous, compound. Oh yeah, bring some guns.</p>
