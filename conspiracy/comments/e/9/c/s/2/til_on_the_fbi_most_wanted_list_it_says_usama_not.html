    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no mention of him because he was never found to be involved in the attacks through any legal process.</p>

<p>In order to be responsible for the attacks, he would have to be involved, in order to prove that he was involved, you would have to gather evidence, present it to a federal grand jury, and that jury would decide based on the evidence whether or not he was involved.</p>

<p>Since this was never done, the FBI can&#39;t just say he was involved.</p>

<p>Also, the spelling of his name is irrelevant, that&#39;s just basic differences in translation.  If you wanted to write his name properly, you would write أسامة بن محمد بن عوض بن لادن</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume that since there was no actual evidence that they never bothered to pursue it.</p>

<p>If you recall right after the attacks Colin Powell came out saying that they were going to present the case to the American People to show the evidence that we had of his involvement. (In order to gain the population&#39;s support for any military action).  A day or two after Powell said that, the White House backtracked on his behalf saying that they weren&#39;t going to be doing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more important issue here is what has the U.S. government done since 9/11 to make us more secure? The short answer is, very little. The longer answer revolves around the implementation of Neo-Con policy that has been waiting in the wings since Reagan and finally found a &quot;trigger&quot; to be achieved. We are not safer because of the &quot;war on terror&quot;, this has been proven statistically and functionally.</p>

<p>The purpose was to force increased surveillance, deleterious foreign policy, and a general trampling of civil rights down the throat of the populous in an attempt to keep us &quot;safe&quot; all the while profiting VERY handsomely from war and war-related expenditures. As always follow the $$$.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden#Variations_of_bin_Laden.27s_name">There is no universally accepted standard in the West for transliterating Arabic words and names into English, so bin Laden&#39;s name is spelled in many different ways. The version translation most often used by English-language mass media is Osama bin Laden. Most American government agencies, including the FBI and CIA, use either &quot;Usama bin Laden&quot; or &quot;Usama bin Ladin&quot;, both of which are often abbreviated to UBL</a></p>

<p>Plus</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives#Current_Most_Wanted_list">Although bin Laden later appeared on the first publicly released FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list on October 10, 2001, he was listed there for his alleged role in the 1998 embassy attack, and not for his alleged role in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, because the most wanted lists name fugitives charged with a crime by a prosecutor or under indictment by a grand jury. Bin Laden was named as an &quot;unindicted co-conspirator&quot; in, for instance, the federal indictment against convicted terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui, but has not been formally indicted for his alleged role in the September 11, 2001, attacks.</a></p>
