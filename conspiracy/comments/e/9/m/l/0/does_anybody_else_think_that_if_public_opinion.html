       It is a generational thing I think, my folks said the same thing. I am so shocked and disappointed at how easily they fall for all the nonsensical BS- If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about. These words actually came out of my father's mouth. He is an educated man, I felt ashamed.

       if they would have tried to pull this shit in the weeks after 911 i don't think the public would have been too keen.  people were pretty upset with nail clippers, 3oz bottles, and shoes off; if they would have been forced to either appear naked to a stranger, or be felt up, i don't think that the reaction would be any different.

       I don't think that this is the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you believe it was an inside job or not, the fact remains that it was US foreign policy that created an environment to foster such attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe people are beginning to realize the reasons  that the USA was targetted.

       I agree with something may happen soon, it's possible. I however disagree that they will say your quote. Remember they are trying to control us with a mask on. They aren't going to show their cards they are simply going to allude to the fact that TSA needs to be MORE secure. They will simply say they are stepping up security and making it all mandatory because we're in the RED ZONE, RED is a crazy and scary color oooOoooOoooooooOOOOoo.

       the money is already spent, if all the scanners sit in some warehouse collecting dust, well that will cost even more money, war on terror is to make money, spending money on useless weapons and security is the point, stopping the scanning doesn't need more terror to keep the funding flow, if anything they will come up a more expensive less intrusive system, tag line being "we heard your complaints, so here's our new ($1 billion) security system)

       Probably not the scale of 9/11, but yes, there will definitely either be a rash of attempted bombings/hijackings in the near future. Wouldn't be surprised for one or more to occur this week.

       To answer the question... no.  I don't want the TSA to just allow anyone to freely enter a secured zone, and no one is suggesting as such.  What everyone wants is REAL security and stop with all the BULLSHIT.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want a different set of rules in place.  If any part of my luggage is going to be searched, I should be present to make sure they are not stealing my stuff.  Do a Google search for "TSA stealing".
      </p>
      <p>
       Running people though a back scatter X ray prevents nothing.  If a terrorist has no issues with trying to blow himself up, I'm pretty sure they will overcome any issues with putting items up there asses to get past security.  So what was the point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are there not bomb sniffing dogs at every TSA check point?
      </p>
      <p>
       How is it safe to have passengers grouped together while waiting in line?  Seems like to me a very easy/cheap terrorist attach would be to just get in line at a busy airport then blow yourself up... don't even need to purchase a ticket.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about weeding out the fucking stupid people from the TSA?  I've had to explain what the fuck this was:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.fratfury.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Corona-Extra-Lime-Fridge-Bottle-Opener-1.jpg">
        http://www.fratfury.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Corona-Extra-Lime-Fridge-Bottle-Opener-1.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This was after they checked it to make sure it wasn't explosive and had been looking at it for 2 minutes.  If you can't fucking figure out a god damn bottle opener while... in it's packaging, then how the fuck can I expect you to figure out anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had to explain fucking $20 silver coins.... after they opened up my bag, took them out and handled several of them.  I think I pissed them off when I then started to count them out loud to make sure they were all there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being too stupid to understand that a carry permit is legal ID... and I had to have a fucking FBI background check to get it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, public opinion of the TSA will not cause another 9/11.  What I expect is a change that actually makes us feel safe.  I fear the stupidity of the TSA more than I do any terrorist when I fly.

       The public isn't going to convince the TSA of anything. They have no leverage. Your congress people safely ignore you because your dollar contributions do not exceed four digits. The airlines ignore you because someone else will buy your seat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way the TSA will change is if a substantial percentage of people stop flying. A 40% drop in revenues
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       get the airlines to petition to government to loosen up. However, I fully expect the public to capitulate and return to Jersey Shore within a few more weeks and the TSA Rapescans and hand-jobs will become an accepted part of travel by those who continue to fly.

       The thing is, if a terrorist attack occured at the hands of our govt, people could potentially realize it. If THAT happened, man Obama would be fucked and so would our trust in the govt completely. So, it could happen, but the risks far outweigh the benefits of this particular scenario. It's more likely that there'd be a fake "attempt" that didn't actually get carried out due to some other force.

       I certainly believe it is possible, but it would have to be seriously more cunning than anything before it. I m with most people on this it seems in that people are more cognizant of false flag events and civil liberties (or the lack thereof)...

       Sadly, the government doesn't even have to do it. Any reasonably I telligent terrorists would pick now as a time to try something. They don't even have to be successful. Being caught would work just as well to encourage more people to accept the erosion of liberty.

       Why?  What would happen?  Do you honestly believe r/conspiracy... or even reddit as a whole is in the majority?  Do you honestly believe the average American thinks for him/herself?  Do you actually have faith that the American people have a breaking point when it comes to shit like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I very seriously don't think so.  The average American believes the shit they see on the "news" - let's stop calling it just one network.  If you believe there is actual
       <em>
        news
       </em>
       on television (with one or two unpopular exceptions), then you're just taking a bite of different flavored bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have the money, they have the power, they have the numbers, they have the media... we have what... some free thinking individuals and a couple basic cable comedians?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think, even if you could convince every single person you know... hell, every single redditor along with a bunch of people they know... to join a "rebellion" or "revolution" or whatever buzzword you decided to tack onto it, that you and all of those people could do anything besides maybe occupy a city or two for awhile before being blasted to fucking hell?
      </p>
      <p>
       They have the media, they have the zombies, they have the money, they have the power.  We're fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR - "They" could stage twenty more 9/11s in the next ten years, and the only result will be more liberties (and a whole lot of buildings) gone, and possibly a few million "rebels" utterly destroyed.  Fap 'em while you got 'em.

       So you are certain that the underwear bomber, the shoe bomber, the ink-bomb, the times square bomber, the Denver shuttle bus driver, etc, were all staged events with an endgame of herding US citizens into naked X-ray machines or an invasive groping?  If I sound sarcastic, I mean to.  I'm asking because I'd like to understand the thought process.  Here's my guess at the inner-workings:
      </p>
      <p>
       " the US gov is inherently bad; the people who run the US gov are inherently evil; the various beurocracies and buerocrats that comprise the unwieldy apparatus that is the us gov are so organized and disciplined that they are able to pull the wool over our eyes while keeping it all a secret; therefore it is a safe assumption that the tsa is just a continuation of the norm and if we don't fall in line with the policies soon, "they" will dramatize another false flag operation on cable news to scare us into the scanners."
      </p>
      <p>
       Really?  Over all the other possible, subtle ways of looking at what our current situation is, this is what you decide is fact?  Based on what?
      </p>
