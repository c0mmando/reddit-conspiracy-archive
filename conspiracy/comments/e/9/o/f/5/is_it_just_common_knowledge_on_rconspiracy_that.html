       I've read a decent amount about various hypothesis regarding 9/11, and I'm not convinced either way (I doubt that we were told the whole story, but I'm also not convinced that it was entirely carried out by the government). But browsing around on this subreddit a lot of you seem to talk like it's not still in question. Is there some particular account or fact of which I'm not yet aware that clears up all reasonable doubt one way or the other?

       There are 3 theories about 9/11:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        That US government made it happen.
       </li>
       <li>
        That US government allowed it to happen.
       </li>
       <li>
        That the US government ignored warnings by accident and the hijackers acted alone.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I personally lean towards #2, although I'm not pretending to know what happened on that day, like most of the conspiracy theorists &amp; debunkers do.  People on both sides of his issue seem to act like they know what happened with certainty, which I think is the wrong thing to do.  There's nothing wrong with admitting that you simply don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a number of things that we do know that makes 9/11 being allowed to happen (at the least) a real possibility.  Historically speaking, plans were
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">
        on the books
       </a>
       and approved by the joint chiefs of staff in the 1960s to stage attacks on American soil to justify an invasion of Cuba.  Things like the

        Iraq invasion
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1550366.stm">
        Afghanistan invasion
       </a>
       , (and possibly parts of the Patriot Act) were ready to go pre-9/11.

       </a>
       tell us that citizens' lives are worth relatively very little.
      </p>
      <p>
       So with that in mind, I'm not ruling out any of the alternative theories.  Add in that a ton of the victims &amp; first responders claim to hear explosions before and after the planes hitting, and I'm not one to wholeheartedly subscribe to the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like everyone else, I don't know what happened.  But at least I'm willing to admit it.

       You know? it's crazy to assume that AIDS isn't real but...I once read a reasonably interesting article that asserted that HIV did not necessarily lead to AIDS as we are commonly led to believe which I though merited further consideration. I don't have the source however so you can safely ignore this comment.

       Yes, but: When you say "THE government" you mean the U.S. government.

       But attacks like 9/11 and never amateur productions. SOME government did it. We know it wasn't Iraq, or Afghanistan... so who?

       One other major issue about 9/11 is that Osama Bin Laden said he didn't do it, infact two out of three video's claim he didnt do it.
      </p>

       The third video is a fake, and has been proven as such.

       I've only been on reddit a few month so can't comment with a hundred percent certainty but it's worthy to note you're in /conspiracy/.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen hundreds of posts here that when:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        researched further (i.e. another take not from a biased source: rense, inforwars, revolutionarypolitics etc - what most conspiracy theorists call 'new media' or something similar, claiming authority from the fact they aren't 'big media')
       </li>
       <li>
        fact checked
       </li>
       <li>
        taken in context
       </li>
       <li>
        applied logic and reasoning to
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       all come up short, and will be happy to provide some examples if you like. the comments sections of said articles are filled with circlejerk comments, and any attempt to criticise the article (be it constructive or not) or daring to have an opposing viewpoint (when backed up by a decent argument &amp; evidence) will be swiftly buried in a flurry of downvotes. (again, I can provide examples of this happening to me)
This doesn't exactly make it a fair playing field so the abudance of topics will be made by people who are
       <strong>
        100% sure without a doubt that the gubberment did 9/11
       </strong>
       and upvoted by the same type, whereas skeptics or people with genuine questions are fucked over by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if that didn't make much sense, I'm pretty high and it's late. as a side note I'd be interested in what reasons you have for feeling you haven't been told the full story.

       Perhaps not control, but their celebration and the whole Urban Moving Systems situation should have been enough circumstantial evidence to include in the investigation and was highly suggestive of Israeli participation at the very least.

       From what I've read, "somebody" made a call to police saying Palestinians were on their way to bomb one of the bridges. The police responded by actually closing all of the bridges and then caught some Israelis in a van at a different bridge. It's been a long time since I've read it but it seems there were at least two vans involved, one having traces of explosives and one loaded with explosives. I can't remember which one was at the bridge. Sorry I can't provide a source but a web search may turn up something if you're interested.

       Operational control would actually have had to come from a much higher level than the top people at Mossad or the CIA (if they were also involved). Even the FBI agents being told to back off their investigations prior to 9/11 suggests the same.

       It doesn't have to be the bush's although they could be complicite the issue about the Israelis is that they planned a failed tunnel attack which could mean they did plan 911.

       Fair enough. But there is also the matter of the hijackers' identities being more than a little sketchy. Several appear to have been stolen identities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now which government was it that recently got in trouble about stolen identities to cover a hit?

       I would say it is common knowledge that it was concocted to get the U.S. into the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. I would add that Iran is the ultimate goal of the warmongers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are wondering "Why Iraq?" if they knew there were no WMDs, the answer is, you can't invade Iran without tanks in Iraq.

       I was out on a sick day from work the day it happened, just hated that place, and decided to stay home.  I got a call from the girl, around 10 or so in the morn, saying a plane flew into one of the towers, so I went and turned on the news and watched for a bit, and went back to surfing the web in the other room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Got a call a half hour or so later, the girl informing me, that a 2nd plane, had hit the second building.  It felt wrong from the start.  How could the most heavily defended country in the world allow two arrows, to fly through all defense to hit their target?  It smelled of a guard asleep at the switch.  Negligence.  The problem with that, is just it ain't one person guarding our airspace.  It's many.  Then the buildings burned, for hours, and crumbled like so much paper.  That also felt wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       These were constructs made by our ancestors, and frankly they made shit to last.  Not like the crap our country has manufactured the last 40 years or so.  It takes heat, massive heat to render steel liquid, and frankly, an airplane's mass, even loaded with jet fuel, at least to me, doesn't pack the whallop needed, to level those buildings.  There's something faulty in the physics there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I joked with my girl later, saying, "The jews did it".  I don't dislike any one culture, as we're all human.  I was kidding, at the time, but thought to myself, wow, what an excuse to suck America dead in the middle of the middle east conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such an injury must be avenged, and how quickly, did our country demand a sacrificial lamb.  The problem was it was us, laying our neck bare for the knife.  The young of America, sent off to load the coffers of Kings, yet again, as history just returns again and again to the same old story.  Are there conspiracies?  Are there wealthy people willing to break the rules, and make the rules to favor their offspring?  Yes.
