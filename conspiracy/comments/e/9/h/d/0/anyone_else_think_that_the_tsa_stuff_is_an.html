       Did you know that the patriot act is a word for word copy of a bad original, a law precipitated from the Reichstag flase flag event ?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Given their built-in weakness and their willingness to swallow the most outrageous Big Lies emanating from the propaganda ministry and the media, most Germans were fruit waiting to be plucked by the Nazi harvesters. â€˜They still fall for anything. After all that, I do not see that one can blame the majority of Germans who, in 1933, believed that the Reichstag fire was the work of the Communists. [The Parliament burned down and a convenient Communist arsonist was fingered, which the Nazis used as the excuse to unleash police-state tactics against all opponents.] What one can blame them for, and what shows their terrible collective weakness of character clearly for the first time during the Nazi period, is that this settled the matter. With sheepish submissiveness the German people accepted that, as a result of the fire, each one of them lost what little personal freedom and dignity was guaranteed by the constitution; as though it followed as a necessary consequence.â€™"

       In my opinion, what "is about to come" wouldn't have came without the government's overreaction to 9/11 and the clamp down on our civil rights. Things were just fine in 2000. 2001 was fine, until the PNAC (Project for a New American Century) got their way and got the war they wanted. They're creating the fascist country they've always wanted, under the guise of protecting us from ourselves.

       I agree with you.  But, this latest affront to our rights is just unreasonable without some knowledge of a need for it, (in their eyes).  I am proposing that the whole TSA fracas is not designed to stop terrorists and is in fact only designed to search citizens that might consider revolting against some future unknown, (by us), crisis.

       they have been doing this for some time. pushing a little farther to see if there is backlash, instituting new non-lethal measures to torture before bringing you in, no more habeas corpus. then there are the death camps that are built and ready to be used. all this is to desensitize and probe (probably eventually will literally probe the public) for the totalitarian federal government control and utter abolishment of states rights. overlord obama is working quickly, I have to wonder why.

       A major theory brewing now is that these machines are to be used to prevent people from leaving the country with their wealth in precious metals. Nations are now refusing to buy US treasuries. Instead of defaulting on the debt the fed is going to hyperinfnate the currency. This will make the great depression look like a walk in the park.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the last great depression FDR simply confiscated people's gold outright. Now that more people are informed and would rebel against such a confiscation the government is just going to try to force the people to leave any remaining wealth on the homeland.

       I think the government is setting things in place for the beginning stages of outright revolt in the next 2-5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this with the Food Safety act, which would prevent people from growing their own food, and with these TSA scanners as well. I expect even more legislation to pass in the next year that looks benign (we just want to keep people safe) but is really meant to give them further control of our lives.

       I think the bigger picture is that it was just a get rich quick scheme for those selling the machines.  Money makes the world go round.  Taking away American rights is only a worthy cause if you can make a buck.

       It's the non-contractural government that forced the machines on the people not the free market. Government is a hired gun that goes to he highest bidder. It's time to stop supporting the institution of the hired gun.

       I'd say the bigger picture is getting civilians gradually used to ever more invasive violations of civil liberties / privacy, with the secondary goal being financial gain (Michael Chertoff heads one of two companies producing the machines, with new contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars).  Similar to the story of Blackwater's rise, where the main benefit was supplanting / privatizing the military, rather than just financial gain for Cheney and his pals.

       I've also noticed that political dunderheads such as Hillary Clinton are now speaking out in favor of this garbage, too.  That's how they continue to get legislation like this passed.  Since everything to do with "national security" is a secret and only certain congress-critters and others can "know", the sociopathes at FBI et al can make up whatever story they like and these idiots believe it because it is a secret so they don't have to show anybody the proof that, for instance, the FBI intended the "shoe bomber" to get far enough so they could lie and claim there was actually some danger.  They made up the danger themselves.  That's the problem with a military industrial complex.  When we give lots of extra money to the spooks and they tell us they can't tell us why because "it's a big secret", they almost all start behaving like 5 year old bullies because we let them.

       In "And Not a Shot Is Fired" Jan Kozak explains "pressure from above and pressure from below" tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       How to become a dictator
      </p>
      <p>
       The creation of "emergencies" is a part of the totalitarian agenda. The creation of "emergencies" gives the gove...rnment an excuse to "crack down". Then the creation of tyranny becomes justifiable and inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       When "emergencies" erupt the population accepts totalitarian measures as "the
      </p>
      <p>
       only alternative to the chaos". The action is in the REACTION.
      </p>
      <p>
       This tactic is called "pressure from above and pressure from below".
      </p>
      <p>
       The Communist book, called "And Not a Shot is Fired" by Jan Kozak , explains this entire strategy. Jan Kozak, who was then a member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, explains how a free government was actually transformed into a totalitarian dictatorship - legally. "And Not a Shot Is Fired" originated as an internal Czechoslovak Communist Party strategy paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       "And Not a Shot is Fired" is a "'how-to' manual for takeover of a free and elected system of government, through legal means. Kozak's discussion is not theory about what "might" be possible to accomplish the seizure of power. It is a history of a technique that was actually proven, by its implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Not a Shot Is Fired by Kozak -
      </p>
      <p>
       Jan Kozak explains
      </p>
      <p>
       Pressure from above
is what Jan Kozak called "revolutionary parliamentarianism". "Revolutionary parliamentarianism" means working INSIDE of the system to change laws in such a way as to increase the power of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pressure from below
consists of the creation of the "emergencies"; which are then used as the excuses to increase the power of government. Karl Marx referred to pressure from below as "the proletarian struggle". Pressure from below might involve violence, or it might simply be the creation of the appearance of popular support for the increase in the power of government.

       There is precedent for the situation the States are currently in. The last time it was this bad they were referred to as colonies. And for the record, this had nothing to do with tea tax, it had to do with the Bank of England and King George preventing the colonies from using their own monies that were not controlled by the BofE thus allowing them to become too successful by not being forced to pay back interest on a debt that was made up (money printed from nothing) to begin with (National Debt).

       Well someone at the TSA is
       <strong>
        really
       </strong>
       paranoid.  But, of who?  Certainly Al Qaeda isn't going to board a plane in Charlotte NC with a bomb in their butt crack just blow up a plane , when they could just as easily, fill some carry-on  luggage with 100 times as much explosives and blowup the whole crowded TSA security check point.

       I gotta admit, I can't understand the hysterical naysayers and downvoters in this thread. Maybe Americans are the proverbial frog in the pot of water gradually heating up so they don't realize the absurdity and danger of what's happening, but from overseas, all this TSA shit just looks wacky and bizzarre. It honestly feels like watching some weird sci-fi movie, where the US is basically standing on the doorstep of fascism, waiting for the boss to open the door and usher everybody in.  "PAPERS PLEASE" is something you're used to hearing in a WW2 movie about Nazis, or stories about the Apartheid years in South Africa. Not the USA in 2010 - it seems like we're in a parallel universe we weren't meant to be in.

       They're getting ready for the world to run out of resources.  Oil will be painful, but just wait until we start running out of clean water and seeing large scale ecological collapse.  When people are starving order will get very hard to maintain.

       You know they haven't even started drilling in Antarctica yet.  You would be surprised at how much oil is still available.  But, once China develops enough that they do not need to sell anything to us, then we are going to see a drain on those resources like never before.

       Also, there are FEMA camps all over the place. Nothing good can come from this.

       Hard to argue your point about Bush v. Obama. On policy, not much has changed.

       Personally, I think we are all watching a superpower implode. I know this ... there will be blood in the streets soon.

       This is at the heart of the establishment's tactics to turn the people against eachother. The "Tea Party" Movement is just one such obvious example - keep the people busy fighting with eachother, and you don't have to worry about them fighting against the government.

       I gotta admit, I can't understand the hysterical naysayers and downvoters in this thread. Maybe Americans are the proverbial frog in the pot of water gradually heating up so they don't realize the absurdity and danger of what's happening, but from overseas, all this TSA shit just looks wacky and bizzarre. It honestly feels like watching some weird sci-fi movie, where the US is basically standing on the doorstep of fascism, waiting for the boss to open the door and usher everybody in.  "PAPERS PLEASE" is something you're used to hearing in a WW2 movie about Nazis, or stories about the Apartheid years in South Africa. Not the USA in 2010 - it seems like we're in a parallel universe we weren't meant to be in.
