    <div class="md"><p>Not that this will work anyway, but I fail to see how bringing about a collapse in the banking system is supposed to make life <em>better</em>. &quot;YAY we collapsed the banking system. Oh fuck our money isn&#39;t worth anything now. Oh well fuckit, we&#39;ll just loot everything in order to survive now. Now instead of the banks controlling the world, it&#39;s being controlled by the biggest bullies with the biggest guns. Oh shit, our &quot;revolution&quot; seems to have made life worse. &quot;</p>

<p>I agree that the Banking system is a cabal, and needs to be stopped. But gradual change is the only way to do so without bringing about a complete and utter social catastrophe. Remember that what was effectively a collapse of the German banking system and economy is what lead to the rise of fascism and Adolf Hitler, and ultimately WW2.  Tens of millions of people died in that war, and people all across Europe are affected by it to this day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to change the banking system is to expose fruad, thanks to people who want to wait for incemental change, we have lost money since 1968. </p>

<p>Quantitative easing is making our country go broke, the federal reserve charges us interest to print our own money, we don&#39;t have a gold backed note.</p>

<p>Banks are screwing the people and no one is doing anything, every president sonic JFK got murdered has been a tool for the banks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with attempting to bring about &#39;gradual&#39; change is that it will be met with &#39;gradual&#39; opposition from the entrenched banking powers. I wouldn&#39;t be confident that some grassroots movement for stricter regulation would stand a chance against big money banks and the politicians in their pockets, and in the end, stricter regulation would still leave the banks in a position allowing them to act hegemonic. To truly dismantle their power would require an outright redistribution of their wealth. Try campaigning on that platform without immediately being blackballed as a commie.</p>

<p>The other way to topple big money interest from their seats at the top would be a devaluation of the currencies they trade with. To attempt such a thing may seem like cutting off your nose to spite your face, but if your nose has a malignant tumor it is probably still in your best interest to do so.</p>
