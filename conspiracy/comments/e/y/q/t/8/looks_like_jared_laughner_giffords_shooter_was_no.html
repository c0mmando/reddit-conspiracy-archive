       Using some of my Google skills to cut out all of the current news I was able to find some of this kid's writing that I don't think anyone else is aware of just yet, and I just figured I'd throw it on to the pile.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you that aren't aware he had posted some videos to youtube that are currently circulating:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Using some small clues I was able to pull up some of his posts that he made under a different name.

      <p>
       Really sad that this kid was too stupid to see through his own nonsense.  Even the people on the ATS forums seemed to have a difficult time making sense out of his ramblings.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is anyone I would like to punch in the face right now, it would be this guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh well. I think this is actually a compilation of more stuff written by him than anyone else has published so far, given his other postings are pretty sparse for content.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I decided to delete this post.  While it does shed light on this kid's obvious psychological problems, and does create a potential partial motive with some of the NASA stuff, in the end it's probably more beneficial to keep unwanted attention and possible criticism of ATS where it isn't needed.  Thanks for playing.

       I think Jared Loughner is erad3 posting on ATS.
       <br/>
       erad 3 posts on ATS.
       <br/>
       Therefore erad 3 is Jared Loughner.

       I agree, the odd writing style on these ATS posts is similar to the text of his YT videos. I feel like reading too much more of this shit is going to make

       Yes ATS has picked up on this because of the OP's investigation. I just created this account to let you guys know that you are probably going to bring a lot of heat down on us at ATS. Not that they probably wouldn't have figured it out though sooner or later. But now, it won't be long until they are reading all my posts over there about my utter distaste for the government and probably come knocking on my door.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this idiot did today was totally uncalled for and ATS and most of its members do not condone his actions. We are like you guys, we believe in conspiracies but we shouldnt be held accountable for this jerks actions, like we will be when they find out he was a member. It wont only be ATS when they come, it will be all conspiracy sites, although we will be the first. I'll let you know when they come for us and what happens...,

       We don't blame you.  Or at least I don't.  It's clear he was crazy and the people on your boards seemed to recognize that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck with the storm that's likely to come down on you.  If OP hadn't found this, someone else would have very soon.  You should just be glad OP gave you some warning before a shit more people know too.

       Edit: Also, I don't think it'll be too bad.  FBI will certainly request the IP logs of his writings.  But there are way scarier places on the net for them to worry about.

       Yea we appreciate the heads up I guess. It sucks to have this guy on our boards. I have said things about the government over the past year that was close to crossing the line, but I would never go out and shoot or hurt anybody, but they wont see it that way. Freedom of speech is a thing of the past, especially now with what has happened. DHS is going to crack down hard with an iron fist now. This guy just managed to get rest of our freedoms taken. Like the OP, I'd love to punch this guy in his face....

       it's entirely possible he's a member here too and no one has found his writing yet.  The thing is, the feds will know just about every where he ever posted probably.  His writing style was so distinct, the googles will help track down what I'm guess is going to be a lot of writing from all over the web.

       What you talking about, the guy posted stuff on youtube and myspace as well, its hardly fair that anyone would put the blame on them.
Also, it looks like ATS users didnt really support him, and in fact someone told him to get help, if anything it makes ATS look good.

       ATS is widely held to be a CIA thence Ziomossad front, which indicates their involvement in the whole affair has been ongoing, at least since the phony internet posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spam at other Zionist front websites, Prison Planet and Infowars for instance, all promotes acceptance of the official "lone gunman" scenario, comparing Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords murder with other known false flag ops, that similarly blamed patsies Lee Oswald &amp; Sirhan Sirhan!
