    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>During some periods of geologic time (e.g. Cretaceous Long Normal), the Earth&#39;s magnetic field maintained a single orientation for tens of millions of years. Other reversals seem to have occurred very rapidly, with two such reversals during a span of 50,000 years. Occidental College geologist Scott Bogue and Jonathan Glen of the US Geological Survey even found evidence in the ancient lava rock of Battle Mountain, Nevada, indicating the possibility of a rapid geomagnetic field reversal over a period of only four years. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brunhes_geomagnetism_western_US.png">Graph of geomagnetism since last reversal</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking that a pole shift is upon us. </p>

<p>The Earth&#39;s magnetic field is currently weak (when last I heard) and the earth&#39;s  north magnetic pole is moving southward. </p>

<p>One of the things not mentioned by others is the possibility that humanity is under the current heightened, unbalanced, shifting negative magnetic influence of the Earth. </p>

<p>This, it seems, is not a  time of ordinary human negativity. </p>

<p>It appears to be exaggeratedly heightened negativity, especially as shown by the ideas and acts of our elite.</p>

<p>Our collective minds are electrical in nature and must be influenced by the changing magnetic field of the Earth. </p>

<p>The final pole shift  cannot come quickly enough for me. It can only be a shift from negativity to a more positive influence.</p>

<p>Come on, flip that magnetic field quickly for me, Earth, and come roaring back in healthful strength.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it is your opinion and you have the right to think whatever you want, but science and physics don&#39;t work that way. You can&#39;t associate &quot;pole shifting&quot; = &quot;change from bad to good behavior somehow related to the electrical nature of the brain&quot;</p>

<p>The pole shifting is natural, it has happened before, and it&#39;s not a quick event. Also, our brain is an electrical machine, that&#39;s true, but external magnetic fields (specially weak fields like the earth magnetic field) don&#39;t cause behavioral changes.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t drive crazy when you walk through an airport scanner, nor when you approach a neodymium magnet to your head. Both are much, much stronger magnetic fields, and they don&#39;t have any appreciable effect in our brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the comment you responded to was off the cuff.but your reply was inaccurate on at least two points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and it&#39;s not a quick event.</p>

<p>weak fields like the earth magnetic field) don&#39;t cause behavioral changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I say that when a magnet is persuaded to change lines of force to its opposite pole that happens suddenly . Haven&#39;t you ever played with magnets? A neodymium will snap your fingers severely and uh, suddenly.</p>

<p>The earth&#39;s magnetic field is not comparable to a neodymium magnet though  because the earth&#39;s field has a resonant atmosphere around it.</p>

<p>The earth&#39;s magnetic field along with its atmosphere give rise to the Schumann resonance which resides between the ionosphere and the earths surface and  has been established as being 7.8 cycles per second which corresponds with the resonance frequency of the human body which is also 7.8 cps. That indicates to me a correspondence between the magnetic resonance of the earth and the magnetic resonance of the mind and body of man and therefore  his behavior. </p>

<p>I think greed is now at a level that would never develop except under an outside influence such as the magnetic interplay upon the human magnetic resonance. Yeah, It&#39;s not science it&#39;s a theory but it has in my opinion  a high likelihood of turning out correct.  Bring that flip. I&#39;m ready.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The earth magnetic field is generated by the rotating iron core. In order to shift the magnetic field, the rotation has to be shifted too. That CAN&#39;T happen in a short time span (read: decades), it needs much more time to shift the rotation. Also, I don&#39;t understand your analogy with the magnets.</p>

<p>Science is science, opinions are opinions. You can think the magnetic field has a behavioral impact on humans and the pole shifting will affect us, but don&#39;t try to back it up with scientific claims because you might caught your fingers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even a theory, it&#39;s an hypothesis. </p>

<p>I&#39;m open minded, I like to think about hypothesis and obscure things. But some things are just impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong.</p>

<p>TMS induces electric currents in the brain with a variating magnetic field. Those electric currents can either generate cerebral activity or remove it.</p>

<p>The earth magnetic field is pretty much constant and much, MUCH weaker.</p>

<p>Even if we lived in Marvelous Land where you could change the brain activity with weak magnetic fields, that would not mean a shift in the polarization would provoke a change &quot;for the good&quot; in our behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agree, i&#39;ve read (no source but you can find many references) that bees and birds rely on the earth&#39;s magnetic fields to navigate - if the earth&#39;s magnetic poles are shifting this would surely cause them to become disorentiated during migration.  I&#39;m guessing the same could apply to the recent fish and crab kills.
edit: just saw your reply below, you have already covered this - and there appears to be a lot of studies which support this argument ie migratory birds and fish all have magnetic sense.</p>
