       This reddit has turned into a Jew-Zionist hate fest.  Every post on here seems to get labeled as part of the 'Zionist plan'.

       Is that all you people have got?  Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to really enjoy reading through the posts/comments and getting into the debate in here but, lately it seems to have just turned into a blame the Jews hate fest, which is a real shame as there used to be some insightful dialog on here.

       Not to say that there aren't ANY ties whatsoever to the Zionist movement or what have you, but this is just ridiculous.  r/conspiracy is not a place for people to bitch about who is being blamed.  If you have a constructive argument to pose as to the evidence that Zionist or Jews DON'T have anything to do with a specific conspiracy theory, feel free to bring it up and discuss it.  But if you're just going to make a post that inspires argument over a null issue, I'm sure there are better subreddit's for your posts.

       And, as a postscript, Israel is IN FACT responsible for stealing 1.5 Terrabytes of TOP SECRET American research regarding the F-35 that is worth in excess of $200 Billion.  That's not an accusation, it's cold hard fact.

       Actually, the government was quite strict.  The designs were to be solely for the American Air Force and Navy.  The F-35 is said to be the culmination of American military weapons knowledge.  It was designed with the specific intent to be launched at the end of 2010, and be guaranteed to maintain air superiority (i.e. it's so f*ing advanced that no other country would be able to make a better plane) until 2040.

       More like permanent blindness if you ask me...

      <p>
       What kind of planes does the Israeli air force fly currently?   F-15s, F-16s, F-4s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where did they get them?  Straight from the US.  What did they pay for them?  Nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not saying they didn't steal the docs, I am saying they had absolutely no motive whatsoever to steal them.  They know the States will just give them planes once they have rolled off the production line in quantity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if some of their pilots have already flown them.

       There is plenty motive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever the United States provides weapons systems to NATO allies, they only offer less sophisticated variants of those weapons.  i.e. we never give them our top of the line electronic counter measures on their fighter planes because we always reserved the best of the best for our forces.  Israel probably would have gotten those technologies at least a decade later. I guess they couldn't wait for Hannukah.

       A 10 year minimum advance on your air force technology is plenty of motive.

       So, you think they would jeopardize their relationship with the US to maintain the air superiority that they already have and are assured to always have as long as they don't piss off the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy it.  It doesn't make sense unless they think the US is going to attack them otherwise they have very little use for those systems when they are primarily fighting against 70-80's era Soviet planes.

       Well, seeing as government officials themselves stated that they new for a fact that it was Israeli spy's who stole the documents, either there is a conspiracy that Israel is planning something against us, or that the government wants us to think that Israel is planning something against us.

       uh, don't agree. Many Jews are anti-Zionist, anti-Zionist not equal to anti-semitic.  Israel has some extremely horrid policies (i.e. war crimes in a lot of cases) and since they are a self-declared state, one must not conflat being anti-Israel with being anti-Jewish (or really even anti-Israeli.)  The Israeli government is actually run by a very small number of people.  This is not at all unlike being against US foreign policy, for example, that doesn't make a person un-American or anti-American.  I find your argument primitive, overly general and most un-clever.

       Many Jews, perhaps most, are not Zionists. Zionism is a perversion of traditional Judaism and many rabbis have said exactly that. Other rabbis have outlined a Zionist agenda. We must not confuse the two.

       Conspiracy redditors: I also think there is a conspiracy but the people to blame are
       <em>
        Zionists
       </em>
       , their supporters, many of them not Jews but in it for the money, and specifically the
       <em>
        Likud Party
       </em>
       of Israel. Please read about those two groups and you will get more credibility and the attention of far more people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Think of it this way: Some criminals are Irish American or Baptists or Methodists, etc. but not all of those 
Methodists are criminals clearly.

       For a lot of us here there are two completely different trains of thought regarding Jews and Zionists. Zionism is politically motivated and is responsible for much of the terrorism around the world as well as the terrorist factions that created Israel. Judaism is a religion. Some of us are anti-religion. That means anti-Christian, anti-Muslim
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       anti-Jew. It's a completely different argument. However, there are also a lot of Christian Zionists as well as Jewish Zionists and that makes each of those two groups doubly hateful and for two different reasons.

       Ha, not likely.  But they play the card very well!  I'd say the zionists are fucking the jews the way to the creationists are fucking the christians the way the jihadists are fucking the muslims.  The black sheep always gets the most attention.

       Yes, the Zionists and the Likud Party play the cards well but would you admit that at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       Jews don't agree with those two groups and their manipulative techniques?

       Well of course, i thought i already said that.  I could say that i don't like the states as a whole, but i know many individuals from there that i like just fine.  Could say the same for the jews.. there are some things that they all do that i don't like, but i know a number of them and they're just fine.

       We don't hate Jews.

       We hate Zionists.  And that's Zionist anything, be it Jewish, Chrisitian, Catholic.

       Reddit hates groups that think they have the right to 'more' just because of some stupid and false sense of entitlement.

       I have no people.  I am an athiest.  I just don't believe that every single conspiracy out there is the result of a Zionist movement.

       <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=195342">
        this

       .  It turns out Israel is going to get some F-35s after all.

      <p>
       It begs the question, what the hell do they (Israel) really have to do to piss us (American Politicians) off?
