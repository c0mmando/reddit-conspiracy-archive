    <div class="md"><p>I was outside my house sometime around 3:00am about 9 years ago when I heard a whirring. It was faint but it grew louder, and then I looked up and saw a dark triangular shape drifting by overhead. I was speechless and just stood there watching it as it flew off into the distance until I couldnt see it anymore because of lack of light really. It maintained a constant speed and direction and had no flashing lights of any kind. It seemed like it was flying really low and very slow. Probably just a stealth bomber right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree with your overall view. This would be a phenomenon that would be happening over the entire globe, likely through out our modern history. How many billions and billions of people have there been? How many governments do we have as of today, now how many have risen and fallen? It seems statistically very very unlikely that not one person has come forward with undeniable evidence, and arrogant to think that western governments (or even just the major world governments) would be able to be the gatekeepers of that evidence. </p>

<p>That being said, I do think it&#39;s possible you are right. I just don&#39;t think you are - in a friendly way.</p>

Enlisted men,officers of various rank and civilians of various import and position have ALL reported , some on their death-beds that what fell at Roswell was not of this earth. When someone is dying they don&#39;t often lie to their families. It continues to this day with people still reporting that Roswell was an alien spacecraft piloted my non-human entities. All the infomation is available online for your study. It is my opinion from study that it actually happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I were to recommend one book on the subject and one I&#39;v read myself and that goes into the nitty-gritty of the subject it would be the &quot;Truth about the Roswell Crash&quot; by Kevin Randall and Donald Smithd. As for a video , there was one shown several years ago on TLC that was produced by the BBC that was pretty much a video of the book . The name as I recall was simple Roswell . I agree you on one point tho, way too much BS just to make a buck... study carefully and make up your own mind! Thats the scientific approach!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The are several books I would recommend: Alien Agenda by Jim Marrs is a good overall view of the history of the alien presence, Above Top Secret by Timothy Good and the UFOs and the National Security State series by Richard Dolan, these two are quite large and go over the history of UFOs and the US Government, worth a skimming at the least.</p>

<p>There are also several books that delve into the idea of ancient aliens and human origins by looking into ancient texts and artifacts like Chariots of the Gods by Erich von Däniken (he actually has quite a few good books), Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock (mostly about lost human civilizations/technology but worth a look) or Zechariah Sitchen&#39;s works which looks at the ancient Sumerian texts and is a good basis for research that most in the Extraterrestrial research world have looked at even if you don&#39;t agree with all of it.  This is by NO means a complete list of what&#39;s out there, but a good start. There is truly a plethora of information out there on the subject, with of course your healthy dose of disinformation mixed in,. It&#39;s up to you to research and discern what resonates with you. Hope this helps!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To the Roswell guys: </p>

<p>The alien ships are so technologically advanced they can traverse the void between the stars, moving faster than light, and withstanding the rigors of deep space travel... yet, a thunderstorm knocks one out of the sky and kills the occupants??? Come on... and a dolphin mistakenly capsized over one of our Carriers.</p>

<p>I cannot believe that creatures with the technological prowess and intelligence necessary to for interstellar travel, survived the trip, but crashed when they got here because of a minor atmospheric disturbance. A storm that could have be predicted hours in advance by a wind sock and 17th century barometer, and easily survived by a Boeing 707.</p>

<p>Considering how obsessed, paranoid and secretive the government was about the possibility of the Soviets developing nuclear weaponry, the answer given by the Freedom of Information Act request a few years ago seems incalculably more likely than aliens: not a weather balloon, but a high altitude isotope detector meant to see if the Soviets had already secretly tested a bomb somewhere in Siberia. The Air Force was not keen on letting the public know that they were worried about a nuclear war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here I am again, ready to get slammed with down votes but, well...whatever.</p>

<p>I do believe that there is other life out there in the universe but, the distances they need to travel are very prohibitive to making it here.</p>

<p>That said, if they have the technology to make it here I am quite confident that we the people, the governments and militaries would have no idea whatsoever.</p>

<p>We can barely make it to our own moon and still have problems launching satellites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a matter of reluctance.  I totally dig and respect Tesla&#39;s inventions and his fight and &#39;loss&#39; against Eddison.</p>

<p>I put him on the same level as Einstein who would have faced the same problems we fact today with space travel.  And that&#39;s even before we had computers!  Space is a very harsh environment.  The distance we would need to travel is pretty hard to wrap our heads around.</p>

<p>I think we are getting close to the point where we could try and make it to Mars but, what then?  The next planet is more than twice as far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I highly suspect that the technology already exists to transport us to Mars in hours rather than days.  NASA Jet Propulsion Lab did a commissioned study to cost the price of getting one of those monstrous tunnel boring machines, that drilled the channel tunnel here in England through to France in the eighties, up to the moon in 1983.  They said back then it would be $250m.  To get it to the moon.  In 1983.  How can they cost something they allegedly don&#39;t have the technology for?</p>

<p>Also it&#39;s a simple matter of accounting.  The black budget programs are vast and unaccounted for.  Governments are nothing compared to the size of the private sector.  Ed Grimsley watches these private companies in the outer atmosphere with his night vision goggles, flying craft doing right angles at four thousand miles an hour.</p>

<p>You have US nuke silo soldiers saying their weapons were rendered useless by UFOs.  You have Gary McKinnon alleging he hacked into wide open NASA networks in 2001 and seeing Navy logs for an off-world fleet.  Then the US government WENT for him, trying to scare him into shutting up, they wanted to put him in Gitmo.  You have governments around the world apart from the US releasing files from their security services UFO study departments with reams of info on unaccountable craft in the skies in their airspace.  You have James Clerk Maxwell&#39;s physics equations being &#39;simplified&#39; by Oliver Heaviside, pointing perhaps to suppressed theory by knowledge gatekeepers.  No big deal, the Vatican has done it for centuries.</p>

<p>So on reflection, I don&#39;t think government is hiding alien life.  They are continually looking the other way from  the ongoing drip-drip disclosure.  They can&#39;t confirm or deny, all they can use is mealy mouth rhetoric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This statement kinda touches on the whole Atheist/Theist debate in that too often we try to rely on our very limited &quot;HUMAN&quot; understanding when trying to explain other-worldly events or possibilities. Just because we cannot fathom something doesn&#39;t mean it does not exist. I imagine near unlimited energy via nuclear energy caused quite a few people some head-scratching back in the twenties and thirties. I have a bigger question, one that is not so difficult but perplexing nonetheless. Why do most supposed alien spaceships have exterior lighting? As I understand it, we have exterior lighting on our aircraft as a means to being seen by other aircraft, to avoid mid-air collisions and such. Has the alien technology, as advanced as it is, been unable to overcome such a thing as mid-air collisions while having obviously mastered interstellar travel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they are just scared to loose their credibility as world leaders and think that they are better than ET. Maybe not better, but just afraid to loose the system they have been creating to enslave us so to speak. Star Trek does make a nice picture of the first encounter, no more famine or poverty after 2 years. What is hard is to get the big picture and understand our leaders agenda. I wish that an alien race would just uncover all that system for us, clean the governments of corruption and just make our lives just more than just work to create shit, earn money to buy shit, throw away the shit and go back to work some more.  </p>

<p>&quot;This documentary explores the phenomenon of the &quot;Reptilians&quot; from a different point of view than most. The film makers attempt to bring forth the most compelling evidence for the existence of the &quot;serpent race&quot; in an organized and serious manner. It seems the idea of Reptilians or other worldly themes within the &quot;truth movement&quot; is a dividing point for some people. PPFRC tries to examine this subject completely and unbiased in one of the most thorough studies ever conducted. Are these entities known as Reptilians or Reptoids actually real? It is up to you to decide!&quot;</p>

Heck even Beck slipped some points that this might happen, although he doesn&#39;t make sense as usual<br/>

I also like how The Ev3nt(the show) portraits the aliens as actually human(no not reptilians in<br/>
 human clothing like in V)<br/>
The Government must be desperate if there going to this lengths<br/>
