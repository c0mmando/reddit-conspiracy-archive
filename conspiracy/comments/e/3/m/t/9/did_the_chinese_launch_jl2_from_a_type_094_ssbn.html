<p>While you make an interesting suggestion, any foreign govt. committing such an act would be going far beyond a show of force, to an act of war.  Even if the missile were aimed out to sea, there would be a near-immediate response.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of missile subs out there, and have been for some time, and for a potentially hostile launch to occur without at least a spinup in the readiness of the nation&#39;s armed forces, seems too far-fetched for even me to believe.  </p>

<p>IF they did do this, we have a few options.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We could start applying tariffs to all the goods coming into this country that would offset the devaluation of their currency.  This would immediately make their exports less competitive, less trade... </p></li>
<li><p>We could merely turn away all imports for 3 months.  That would virtually put them into an economic tailspin, while Walmart&#39;s shelves might go a bit bare, we&#39;d be fine.</p></li>
