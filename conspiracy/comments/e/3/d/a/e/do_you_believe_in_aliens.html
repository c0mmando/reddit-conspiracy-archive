       I think it is foolish to believe there is no life outside of ours on Earth.  We have not completely cataloged life on our own planet, who in their right mind can say for certain what does or does not live outside our blue sphere (or amongst us).
      </p>
      <p>
       We once believed the Sun revolved around the Earth.  We once believed the Earth was flat.  We think the universe is 13 billion years old, and our planet is 4.5 billion years old.  There is much room for other species to evolve to the point we have, and they don't have to be on an Earth like planet to live IMHO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one don't believe we are so advanced that we can say with 100% certainty that we are the only 'intelligent' beings in the universe.

       Agree with everything here except for the "impossibly low" part. With technology moving as fast as it is, how long is it before we realize a deep space scanner that can pick up signs of life? After that, how long before we can meet? I say very long time, but not impossible.

       I think modern physics sees it as unlikely that the speed of light could ever be broken, including for any sort of scanning meaning the vast distances involved do make the chances impossibly low.

       There are thousands of stars within 50 light years of us. That sort of distance does not require the speed of light to be broken.

       The problem with your argument is that you can claim
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       photo or video is faked and thereby can be dismissed. Personally, I think
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmWp590TUAE">
        military
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlFl8zooTZk">
        pilot testimonies

       are much more powerful. Not to say there haven't been

       I didn't claim any such thing, I just stated that I hadn't seen any such photos or videos. The problem with military and pilot testimonies, is the most groundbreaking ones are generally followed by the release of a book. UFO enthusiasts are cash cows for people who make shit up and release a book about it.

       I wholeheartedly agree, but military testimony is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       different. Typically, those military personnel who are disclosing their witness accounts, have been debriefed on their sightings and are told that it either "didn't happen" or is top secret. When they come forward and tell their story, they're violating all sorts of security protocols and subject themselves not only to prosecution, but ridicule as well. IMO, it takes
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       for an ex-military person to come forward and tell their story.

       Well, 3 of them are releasing books. Here in the Australian military, if you violate those security protocols, you are disciplined. The thing is, these guys didn't violate anything, they weren't reprimanded because they exaggerated real, unclassified events, then released books. Which many of you will buy.

       There are tons of great photos out there but most of them are not on the internet.  What is on the net are a bunch of photos and videos taken from cell phones, which are a very inferior camera as it is.  So bad camera = bad photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also my friend is a retired TWA/AA pilot, and he said there is basically not a pilot alive that has not had multiple encounters with UFOs and they all believe in them.  They don't eveb report UFOs to air traffic control unless it is a navigational hazard.

        there is basically not a pilot alive that has not had multiple encounters with UFOs

      <p>
       So all pilots regularly see UFOs but not a single one ever thought it might be an idea to take a decent video or photo of one?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are tons of great photos out there but most of them are not on the internet

      <p>
       So where are they then?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying theres potentially tons of evidence and people just can't be bothered uploading it?

       Trust me, aliens are fucking scary. thats enough reason right there to why they always take shitty pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I've never seen anything on the web that would convince me of the existence of aliens - or ufos for that matter. But, having seen both ufo's and aliens with my own 2 eyes i can fucking tell you they are a real, and there's no way i would try to convince anyone of their existance, because it's so unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, i do believe within the next couple of years they will come out of the closet so to speak.

       As for the alien encounters I've had - forget it, I'm not going there. If you wan't to know why, look no further then your original reply to me, which insinuates I must have a mental illness if I've seen an alien. However I will relate My sighting of a UFO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone's a skeptic until they have seen one with their own eyes, and I'm sure some are hoaxes or mistaken celestial/man made objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a multitude of pilots, air traffic controllers and police officers who have filed reports, but that barely scratches the surface of sightings that go unreported. I know quite a few people who have seen objects in the sky that cannot be explained - this is far more common amongst the people i know in rural areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my own ufo experience:
about 4 years ago, while a friend and I were star gazing with my telescope at 3AM.
      </p>
      <p>
       The object appeared from the SSE, traveled directly over us in an arc, and headed off in a NNE direction. (Heh, it was shaped pretty much like a
       <a href="http://www.obh.snafu.de/%7Emadley/starwars/dataimg/imperial_star_destroyer.gif">
        Imperial Star Destorer
       </a>
       from underneath), extremely massive, completely quiet and appeared to be at a very high altitude. There were lights underneath and some were flashing. Unfortunately, due surrounding trees and and a nearby cliff, the object - which to us seemed to be moving super fast - was only visible for a short time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure they saw a similar object in phoenix, referred to as the
       <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5545276251937701731#">
        phoenix lights.
       </a>
       ( part about pheonix lights starts at 06:40).
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know where it was from or who made it, but i'll tell you what it wasn't, it wasn't a fucking weather balloon, a normal plane, and it wasn't Jupiter.

       Sounds much more likely it was some other type of experimental aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, I'll be honest, unless you and at least 2 other people saw the same "alien," chances are it was some form of hallucination, dream, delusion, illusion, or otherwise.

       .... Your response is understandable and predictable. I recieved the same reaction when I first mentioned it 20 years ago as a teenager - haven't mentioned it since to anyone in real life, and this is actually this first time I've mentioned it on the net - and i might add the last, no sane person appreciates being called delusional.

       Exactly.  We should define our terms here.  Aliens, extra/inter-dimensions, demons  - if you reform the question "Do you believe in "(non-human intelligent entities)", the people with a negative answer will be the vast minority.  55% of people believe in the devil - does he qualify?  I think so.

       Why is it so difficult for people to believe in the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial beings? In the vastness and shear unimaginable size of the universe, why is it unfathomable to consider human-like life to exist elsewhere? Furthermore, why would anyone even consider it unlikely for a civilization to be thousands or even millions of years ahead of us in technology and understand how to manipulate the fabric of space? After all, these are concepts us monkeys are already theorizing about. I doubt they travel eons in speeds equal to or lesser than light just to come here. However, I would believe that if you could warp space and/or time you could easily move about the entirety of the universe. There might even be a way to detect life like ours from light years away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's a stretch to believe these things. If you told people 100 years ago that we would all have small devices in our pockets(cell phones) that could contact anyone on Earth at any time they might call bullshit on you, but here we are. All of our thoughts are derived from existing elements and the infinite possible interactions of such. For example, no one can picture a color that their mind hasn't seen or that doesn't exist. In this regard, is it not fair to say that if someone CAN imagine something that it must exist is some fashion?

       The odds of no aliens, no human civilizations from ancient times who splintered off, are impossible.  Who the fuck built the pyramids and FACES on Mars? If we got to Mars that long ago, how could we have not gone farther?

       And who is to say WE are not aliens, brought here, or perhaps, the more evolved primates indigenous to earth were infused with alien genetics time and time again leaving us with the diverse group of humans we have now?  What do you think?

       Since you ask, I think you're an idiot who hasn't bothered to read about several effective methods by which the pyramids were probably built (not to mention the methods for feeding and housing the large groups of people who did the work), or the close-up photographs of rocks that don't look anything like faces except at the sort of distances which make faces show up in clouds, craggy rock walls, or even tortillas (due to our hardwired ability to see faces in nearly anything).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say it is unlikely that we are the only intelligent life in this galaxy, let alone the universe, but answers like yours make the question of whether intelligent life has evolved on Earth debatable.

       actually I just watched something on the history channel that explained about how it would have been almost impossible for humans to build certain walls and the pyramids considering that the stones in the walls fit together just perfectly and to shape them would take immense heat for the type of mineral it was made out of. And at those times the technology wasn't there. The man on the history channel explained that "it was either aliens or God".

       There was also a lot of other things they talked about. They sounded pretty convincing, but hey...they need their ratings too.

       Aliens...
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we still using this term, really? I mean come on. Aliens is a term that typically designates little grey men who, if real, are as much artificial as alive. Alien is a loaded term with alot of fear, rumors, and lies surrounding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrials are people just like us. Just because they were born on a different planet doesn't make them scary or evil or something to be feared. If anything it's our insane military-industrial complex that is to be feared. We are the ones trying to shoot them out of the sky, not the other way around. Let's keep it classy and refer to them as extraterrestrials or simply the Greater Family of Man.

       you don't really know this though for a fact. it is very optimistic of you to think this way and hopefully that is the case.They might not look like us, they might not look like anything we think they look like either. They might look like something we've never seen before.
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be creatures that could live on planets we could not live on. Like a fish can breathe in water, we can't. Unless you have actually met an alien you can't say for sure if they are built the same as us.

       Microbial life outside of the Earth is possible although only indirect at best evidence has been found primarily on Mars. That said, their spreading across multiple planets is suspect because the main means would be to hitch a ride on ejecta from a planetary impact. If this scenario is unlikely, then life would have to arise independently for each inhabited planet, necessitating billions of years of relatively unhindered development.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if they beat the evolutionary odds, they may or may not be near our technological levels (since they could have their own knowledge and culture productions). Thus, they very easily could be just as stuck on their rock as we currently are. Or destroyed by a quasar. If there are a handful of extant alien civilizations, who knows if we'll find them out there?

       I think you are very pessimistic about the size of the Universe and the nature of organic chemistry. I am certain that 1000 is a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       conservative lower bound estimate of the number of intelligent civilizations in the
       <em>
        Universe
       </em>
       . There are probably millions, billions, or even trillions. I assure you that neither you nor I have any grasp of the sheer quantity of planets out there. Not to mention, Earth is only 4.5 billion years old. There were 10 billion years before that. The Earth is young compared to most of the stars and planets that once existed (and perhaps still remain).

       The probability of life existing elsewhere is extremely high but with the vast size of the universe and the low chances of being able to break the speed of light the chances are we'll never know.

       sheer numbers predict that their is alien life forms on other planets. However, because of the 'Great Filter', and some humanity's death grip upon power and assets, and hypocritically, the rest with a soul-deadening grip on the unreality of a god, I fear that humanity will die off long before we create the technology to visit these other worlds. I also believe that life like ours may be very unique, wherein 'life' on other planets may just be living organisms, not yet of a mind like we can posess.
