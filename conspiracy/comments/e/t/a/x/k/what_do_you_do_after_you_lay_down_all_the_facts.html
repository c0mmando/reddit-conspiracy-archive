<p>That jews were warned to avoid WTC?
That flight 77  didn&#39;t hit the Pentagon?
The flight 93 was diverted to ohio, and the plane and occupants were somehow disappeared?
That the WTC buildings were downed by explosives previously placed?</p>

<p>I won&#39;t call you crazy if you believe those things, but I will say I certainly think you are wrong.  Reading  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_conspiracy_theories">wp article</a> helps. </p>

Mossad may have had a man, or men, inside the terrorist organization that carried out the attacks, or they may not -- no way to know that. But they probably got advance information somehow that the attacks would take place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was quite the opposite. I thought truthers were out of their minds for a good 7 years, then I finally sat down, looked at all the facts without bias, did my own research, and came to the conclusion that the story we&#39;ve been fed is NOT the real story. Does that mean it was planned and executed by the Bush administration? I don&#39;t know. But I DO know, what we&#39;ve been told can&#39;t possibly be the truth, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a &quot;conspiracy&quot; per say.</p>

These same people that preached open minded-ness to me had closed their minds to the idea that they could possibly, just maybe be wrong. I now find myself outside of the truth movement when it comes to all the &#39;factual&#39; claims they spout, yet inside it in a sense of some of its messages and calls for more investigation. I still find it totally cool to question the official story, but the real science behind what happened on 9/11 seems to, in my opinion point a lot closer towards the &#39;official account&#39; (there is no actual defined official account, at least not officially) than it does to what &#39;truthers&#39; claim; warm wishes - Dr__House, former 911 truther.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying it was most definitely a man in a cave. But I will say that your statement underplays grossly what those kinds of people with the right amount of money are capable of.</p>

<p>Personally, want to know what my current belief in all of this is? I&#39;ve shared it here before (but I wouldn&#39;t expect you to dig through my comments). I believe elements within the American government knew this was coming and allowed the attack to happen. From who or what, is unsubstantiated in my opinion, though I have a strong feeling it was the man in the cave you refer to. The man we funded all those years ago. </p>

<p>Cheney had zero authority in commanding or assuming command of NORAD.</p>

<p>And your whole thing about cave men really, really just downplays the potential of human beings. You do realize that sometimes something mean, nasty small and awful can destroy something big and beautiful, don&#39;t you?</p>

This was the purpose of you jumping in, so, what did you discover that changed your views? Do you have anything to support your conversion? I didn&#39;t say he had authority over NORAD.

<p>Again though, I&#39;ll re-iterate: The vice president has no direct command over Norad. What this means is he was not capable of giving a stand down order.</p>

<p>Cheney is guilty of many crimes, and if you ask me the guy should be hung for his crimes against humanity. But this is one thing that he&#39;s not guilty of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes some of the things are crazy, theories involving dozens or hundreds of government officials, hidden bombs, cruise missiles...these things are indeed straight up crazy. The reality is that only 2-3 people in the government needed to know about these attacks in order to allow them to happen. ALL of the rest could have been taken care of with outside terrorist training, all the insiders would need to do is provide them with the needed security info so that they could actually get on the planes, and then remove the US&#39;s air defenses at an opportune and known time. Basically the ONLY people that needed to know was George Bush, Cheney, and Bin Ladin who would have been taking care of the outside training based on his supplied intel... the other possible person that knew of the activity was Donald Rumsfeld, who while unneeded for the plot to be successful, has a very high probability of having been involved based on a variety of evidence. It also is likely Condoleezza Rice may have had some knowledge before hand that something was going to happen in New York, which she likely overheard in a discussion between Cheney, and Bush due to the fact that she made several calls to her family telling them to leave the area just hours before the attacks.</p>

<p>Is it a coincidence that Cheney and Bin ladin were friends in the CIA decades ago? That they actually wrote a book on terrorism specifically detailing the tradecenter attacks TOGETHER? That Bush&#39;s entire family has had close ties with the bin Ladin family for decades? That Cheney is a sadistic corrupt bastard who holds no value for human life to begin with?</p>

<p>When you take Occam&#39;s Razor to the scenario, it doesn&#39;t look just possible, it appears to be highly probable. Especially considering how much, and how quickly certain entities actually benefited from the attacks, not to mention the character of the individuals involved.</p>

<p>Would be very interested to see that cable. Because if it ever does surface, I can pretty much guarantee you that it will be proven to be a mis-information hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ummm  you DO know that Dick Cheney did indeed assume control of NORAD less then an hour before the terrorist attacks right? He personally redirected all fighter groups in the new york/washington area to Florida for &quot;antiterrorism drills&quot;, this is a matter of public record. It was indeed the ONLY time in US history that a Vice President had assumed control of NORAD, that combined with the given orders, and time frame is pretty much proof positive that Cheney was taking very specific actions in order to allow the attacks to occur. </p>

<p>Of course there is always the chance it was just a giant coincidence...  after all, a stand up guy like Cheney would never do such a thing right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting that.</p>

<p>I will reiterate my point again that the vice president has absolutely zero authority or right to assume command of NORAD.</p>

<p>And as seen in the above shared link, he held only a partial role in assisting to setup and <em>observe anti terror drills</em>. </p>

<p>He did not have any authority, or &#39;control&#39; over NORAD.</p>

<p>We have heard from zero soldiers that Cheney assumed control of NORAD.</p>

<p>We can in fact point to the generals who were actually in control of NORAD that day. None of them had the last name &quot;Cheney&quot;.</p>

<p>Not only did he order the fighters down to florida, but even after the first attacks, when one of the jets was clearly seen 50 miles out heading straight towards the pentagon, when fighters DID have the opportunity to intercept and possibly direct the plane down, Cheney specifically ordered them not to do so. Telling them to stand down even as the plane came within just 5 miles of the target.</p>
