       Killing solves nothing. Hasn't history proven that? You know, besides the occasionally thinning of the gene pool of the psychos and dictators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, to use the cliche "killing them would make us no better then them."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, [generally speaking] people are just so comfortably believing everything that is said to them and they don't know how to question authority anymore. If more people could think rationally for themselves, we'd have a whole lot less problems.

       A people are the most free when their government is scared of them. Right now the government knows they can get away with whatever they want. We need them to be scared shitless again. Same with the corporations. Take out a few of those bailout CEOs and their (s)elected politician buddies, get the message through.

       Killing those few would give nothing more then the remaining living individuals everything they want: to be able to justify increasing "security" in the name of "safety" because the "terrorists" are no long religious zealots "who hate our freedom", but homegrown anti-establishblahblahbhlahblbah.
      </p>

       I get what you are saying though - unfortunately the people in masse would believe that scare tactics bullshit and let those changes go by unopposed.

       Absolutely agree, but I think it's created on purpose, because elite knows that.
People can't do shit until they unite and start thinking rationally.

       That we need the equivalent of 'revolutionary' changes is without question. A few quick thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) This Reddit conversation may not be enough, but it is a place for getting politically educated: if the tone can stay on a high level, w.o. the childish stuff, it is useful ..
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Revolutionary violence route? Look at France. The people (Le Peuple) fight, they kill, they get killed, the elite take over again. Happens over and over again throughout the 19th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) I'm not saying we can't learn anything from a highly politicized culture like (pre-Sarkozy) France; my point is simply that the old Revolutionary way didn't work that hot; and in any case it will take entirely new, creative approaches to respond to the challenges of PR-based, neo-liberal pretend democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) C'mon you pussies, give me some good creative thinking! What the hell we send you to college for? (NB: obviously point no. 1, above, is not to be taken in a crudely literalist sense).

       Exactly. We need to be as cold-blooded as the monsters who are running our lives and bleeding us dry. Why is it that George W. Bush can order a hundred thousand people killed and never lose a minute of sleep, but when someone proposes putting his skanky ass in prison, suddenly they become a terrorist? It's a double standard, and if the people are to gain control over their own government once more, they must be as ruthless to the owners of America as those owners are toward the people.

       I should have started the minute Bush began eroding the Constitution, limiting free speech to "zones" and torturing people. Its the people's money that finance bailouts and wars, the same money should be used to eliminate the plague known as politicians.

       Actually, if you compare the "islamic extremists" which the US i fighting now - the psyche of this opponent will be very similar to what they would see fighting an armed US uprising. However, I am sure US citizens would be more reticent to blow themselves up - at least for the first few years of a conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the population were distraught enough and felt they had nothing to lose, there would certainly be suicide missions.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point though, due to all the flouridation that the US pop has been under, any uprising is doubtful.
      </p>
      <p>
       WRT flouridation; aside from the drinking water - dont you assume that the base water for all major drinks (wine, beer, soda, juice) is all flouridated?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no escaping the domestication through flouridation except via rain-water collection (illegal) and a well (illegal unless registered and permitted).

       Have you noticed that we cannot pass a national health care bill, to provide health care to the population - yet for some reason everyone takes without question that the government is the benefactor of good dental hygiene?

       You're obviously just too misinformed to really understand. I am sure you'd feel a lot more comfortable if these were issues that were brought to your attention through mainstream media outlets rather than straight from the mouth of the EPA.

       I'm not living in America anymore, so my perception is only what I see here. As an outsider, I really can't believe how far the people have let the government trample, crush, and vaporize its citizens rights and liberties. What will it take for people to take action? The things you cited should be enough, but apparently not.

       What you are seeing in America is the combination of Orwell and Huxley's nightmares.  Huxley saw our downfall in our own desires, which is why information and entertainment overload put most people into a sedated mindset.  Whether they drown themselves in entertainment or infotainment it doesn't matter, they have the illusion of freedom.  This decreases the number of politically and socially minded people who could fight the encroaching police state that Orwell feared.

       As someone who raised himself on Goldman, I learned after a while that she and others like her were devil's in disguise, utilized if not funded by the Illuminati elite. Disinfo and divide-and-conquer are complex systems that have been perfected by the religious, banking, and governmental capitals of the world since they stole Egyptian knowledge and dismantled the Caesar's rule.

       They absolutely utilize it, whether or not it's their own.  If .5% of the population were in on it, that would still put 30,000 Illuminati members in each of the 50 states. Keep cutting it down and the numbers are still staggering. So, it's very possible that the Illuminati are in fact a criminal gestapo, just that lower echelon members are unaware or less aware of their own organization's doings.

       And for the record, you haven't identified shit either, so drop the condescension. If you're so enlightened, you're a corrupt asshole for blasting someone else and not providing a single shred of anything to back yourself up. Believe me, I'm all for gaining knowledge, so please, crack some over my head.

       don't get me wrong in what i'm about to say, i'm all for a revolution..
      </p>
      <p>
       It bugged me for years that no one was taking any real action and "the wool was being pulled over everyones eyes" (and still does).  What I eventually realized though is even though all this shitty stuff is going on with politics and big business and what not most the people in this country are living really good lives.  Sure our economy is kinda in the shitter right now but it happens, europe hasn't been doing great either the past few years.  Basically we've had a gimmie gimmie gimmie attitude and we're now living with what we've been given. Yeah we took too much and now most of us are giving some back (some more than others) but most of us realize that if we had of said stop to all we were given before we wouldn't be in this mess.  Once we get back to living within our means and things are still being taken from us is when people will start to take action.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem like we should take action now instead but personally I'd rather not give up the great house i live in, in the great neighborhood with my beautiful drive to work up PCH everyday to work in an office with my desk no more than 50 feet away from million dollar yachts producing something useful to the world just so I could be part of a revolution which isn't happening right now and won't have anyone else willing to participate with.  The day may come where I feel people are suffering enough due to other people where I would be interested in spearheading that revolution but that day isn't today.

       You my friend, are not the one to benefit from a revolution then, as it seems you are not in the majority of people who are fed up with the conditions of living the government has imposed. Be thankful for that.

       oh i'm absolutely in that majority, i just know that being pissed off about it and sitting around is not going to benefit me and at this point going out and trying to do something about it is only going to put me in a worse position than i'm currently in (much worse for me in particular).  Most likely the only thing that would happen if i tried to take action (especially the action i would take) would be me ending up in jail or dead.  Even if not to that extreme, taking any real action that would accomplish anything would mean i would have to quit my job (or get fired) which means I would lose the house i'm living in and my car (good luck trying to take that from me) and i would still accomplish nothing other than looking like some lunatic conspiracy nut (looks at the forum i'm posting this in).
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you are somewhat right though, i'm not in the majority where i'm not in my early to mid 20s any more where I haven't had the time to build an adult life for myself and now i have things to lose.  Ideology is a young mans game and an unwinnable one at that.

       Exactly, you have too much to lose. That's your weak spot. You are just looking out for yourself, like everyone else, but we have to look at the bigger picture. Not to be dramatic but being dramatic, there's a saying that goes like this:

       my original point is people aren't looking at the bigger picture of what's going on right now, which is absolutely nothing new is going on.  Things get fucked in some way, then they eventually get remedied.  Look around you right now, you see some walls around you, a roof over your head, food in the fridge, etc. etc?  Yeah us people in the US still have that as well.  We have to deal with the problems the previous generation created and we'll end up fixing them eventually but creating a whole new set of problems for the generation that follows us.  Having a government causes that problem, if we had no government each generation would keep repeating the same problems as the previous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone has reasons to be pissed off about our situation it would be me.  I made good money, then had a medical injury which kept me from working for 6 months so i blew through all my savings, my insurance dropped me because of it, then i had difficulty finding a new job and a year and a half later that's just finally coming back together.  As of a month ago I'm getting audited by the IRS, my car insurace is through the roof because of a bunch of retarded tickets and accidents that were in no way my fault, and i'm constantly paying money for things like parking tickets, speeding 10 miles over the speed limit etc.  Those are all problems caused by my government but I look around and none of those things are currently bothering me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure I could go on a rampage because of the IRS and start a revolution to get rid of taxes but there's a LOT of people who who think we should be paying taxes (maybe less than we do but i don't support paying any income or sales tax).  The same goes for everything, we're all just trying to live together and we'll continue to have problems no matter what changes.  Just live life because it turns out when you do, those government things aren't that big of a deal.

       What if one of the most effective actions you could take is to simply buy some silver? Silver explodes in price, you get rich, and if enough others do the same, the corrupt paper money system that enables wars and destruction of the middle class is exposed for the ponzi scheme it is and is replaced with honest money. You can do this from within the comfort of your nice home.

       This is to protect their interests and business dealings at home and abroad.

       It has nothing to do with protecting people...it's about protecting assets. The only reason they would want to protect people....is the same reason a farmer wants to protect his livestock.

       Well specific parts of MW2 aren't political but the objectives given out by Shepard are. He goes on and on throughout the game about how everyone watched when a nuke went off (in MW1) and nobody did anything about it. He is trying (through covert means) instigate false flag situations which will result in American patriotism spreading like wildfire through the US and which will cause a surge in applicants to "serve their country." And to be honest, that's probably what every major world power gov't does nowadays.

       I must've missed it. It's kind of odd though, the government stimulates the civil unrest, only to bring the hammer down on those who do. Just what is the point, if not oppression in its purest and most sadistic form.

       FYI, this is almost exactly what happened to the Roman Empire toward the end of it's Republic years. Large land/business owners (mostly Patron families) began using their wealth to undercut and corner their markets, driving all of the smaller business owners out of business. The resulting unemployment was "solved" by way of conscripting the "less fortunate" (those who got screwed) into the Roman Army, or recruiting them to work as servants and/or guards within the Patrician households.

       That would explain the ridiculous size of the armies back then, kind of like what China and North Korea are doing. In the end, the only thing left is to join the army, as cannon fodder.

       Yep. That's also why there were so many revolts, which in turn led to the conversion to Empire (no freedom, but peace &amp; stability)

       I imagined the Reddit hivemind wouldn't appreciate this post much, but now I realize the term "conspiracy" is losing its negative connotation, as more and more people are coming to their own senses about the subject matter. I hope it continues this way :D

       You guys are actually just figuring this out, aren't you. It must be so different, viewing this mess from inside. I mean, what you just said, everybody else in the world, outside of the USA, we've known it for a long time. I did a post about 6 months ago, telling America that nothing short of armed revolution was going to save them from the mess they've created, ignored and allowed to fester. I got downvoted to hell. But it seems like you people are actually waking up.

       Napolean said that religion was to keep the masses from killing the elite. Consider too what a terrorist is. One can do more damage with political policy rather than with rocks or grenades these days. I think you are on to something ...

       The government knows this all right, but thankfully they have weapons like mass media and faux diseases that, gosh wouldn't you know it, there's already pills for! The government might be inept in a lot of ways, but when it comes to keeping the people from an uprising, they sure are on the ball.

       I disagree. It's security theater not designed to protect anyone but to calm angry "patriots". So, it's not to protect themselves, but to line certain pockets (

        selling scanners

       , etc.). Same with the "war". The Iraq military event was never an official war. It's the facsimile of a war to move money into certain pockets.

       The only thing it serves to protect is the bottom line of the military industrial complex. If you make everything illegal, then you can fine and imprison everyone. More money to build more prisons and track ever more "criminals".

       I hope you're not seriously holding out for a revolution.  We already know who the power brokers are in the US &amp; in the world.  People could already be going after them, but they're not.  People don't care and aren't willing to make the effort.  Sorry to disappoint you, but it's only going to get worse.

       Stop using money stop playing their game. Thats all everyone has to do. Then it all falls apart and we get to rebuild. I suggest having 6 months of food on hand for the transition. Encourage your peers to do same such that everyone has enough. We will be faced with the task of restructuring the entire economic output of humanity. Hopefully with our internetworking technology we can make it a fairly smooth and organic process. Focus on local needs first. We'll network that into a global mesh in time.

       So I buy 6 months worth of food, and the companies will have an advanced 6 months of my shopping. This will hurt them how? It's a start, but it will have to be flawless.

       well dont do it all at once, you know, but buy a lot of the items that are on super-sale when you see them etc (buying lots of loss-leaders actually hurts them if thats all you buy from them). And if you know local growers who are into canning/preserves etc then it would be a good idea to become friends with them and see how you can help them out in turn and perhaps add to your stash that way again without using money.

       You're in the post-revolution mindset, that's good in the sense that you believe it will happen. However, efforts must be put to the primary cause. Civilization and universal brotherhood will prevail and take care of the rest. May sound corny, but it's the way things have always been. Of course survival skills are essential, but it may not be crucial, depending on the outcome. Better wait to see than waste efforts on the unnecessary.

       I thought about just not giving a fuck anymore and letting our masters continue to rape and pillage the planet, but eventually it will reach your front door. I choose to fight. I have very little to lose and I hope your (true) feeling of security and well-being lasts as long as possible.

       Truth. Problem is, it's inevitable that a small group of people will always figure out how to game the system in their favor, no matter what that system is.  Revolution, at best, merely resets things for a bit—and at worst, sets up a pre-gamed system that was worse than what is usurped.  That said; the current charade is gonna collapse under its own weight probably sooner rather than later…

       Independent of what is to come, what is going on now has to stop. By force or otherwise. The government is choosing force, so we too shall play the game. We have strength in numbers. So whatever may come next, I hope the message will be understood by future leaders.

       I would hope so. I wonder if the person on the other side of the screen in a FBI office agrees with any of this, or are they so brainwashed that they consider everything the government does is OK.

       They absolutely utilize it, whether or not it's their own.  If .5% of the population were in on it, that would still put 30,000 Illuminati members in each of the 50 states. Keep cutting it down and the numbers are still staggering. So, it's very possible that the Illuminati are in fact a criminal gestapo, just that lower echelon members are unaware or less aware of their own organization's doings.

       And for the record, you haven't identified shit either, so drop the condescension. If you're so enlightened, you're a corrupt asshole for blasting someone else and not providing a single shred of anything to back yourself up. Believe me, I'm all for gaining knowledge, so please, crack some over my head.

       Also - Who said they were my enemy? Maybe I whole-heartedly agree with every last thing they supposedly plan to do because it's simply survival of the fittest.
