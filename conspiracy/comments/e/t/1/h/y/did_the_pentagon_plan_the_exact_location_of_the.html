       I think they did exactly that.

       Here are pictures that I got long ago by searching Google Images for " Pentagon " back in 2002  They came from a Pentagon page labeled " contingency plan " as I recall.  I was shocked ,   then I spread the pictures and the now defunct link around.

       Cruise missile is bs to trap the gullible.  It was
almost certainly fly-by-wire, which means they
could have wanted to establish a couple of exact
gps locations, and a vector.  A line on the ground
is kinda handy for that.

       Please explain that to me. You are saying that some people from far away were controlling the airplane, right? And they were using GPS to determine position. And they used a "vector" (I know what vector means, I don't know what it means in this context). So how would it make sense to have a line on the ground a few score meters in length? At that point at that speed either they see the Pentagon or they are not going to see the line in the grass.

      <p>
       No, probably not--it was probably either controlled by
a computer on board which had been fed the vector
and co-coordinates we are talking about, or from an identical plane on a
slightly different vector (which would explain the contradictory
sightings by a large number of equally reliable witnesses as
to the exact flight path)--or by the elint plane the pentagon
inadvertantly admitted to the existence of to a congressional committee back around
06.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe all three, just to be sure.  There are, I believe, about 200 pilots
now, who have signed on to the pilot 9/11 web site, many of whom
have flown the airplane involved, who flatly deny that they could
make a 7x7 go 500 miles an hour 20 feet from the ground, and hit
a building dead square horizontal after a 5g 10000 ft turning descent.
       <br/>
       Much less a couple of goat-herders
who flunked cessna 172 touch-and-gos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll bet a computer, with it's much faster reflexes, or a couple of co-ordinating computers + a
fly-by-wire human, could, however.

       no, of course not.  If it's a computer, what's the computer supposed
to go on? Instinct?  The line estabishes a vector onto the target, and
lets you eyeball a distant point or points you can then get the exact
co-ordinates of,
and lets the people on the ground look around for possible difficulties
or give-aways or possibilities to lend credence to the story along that line.

       I doubt it was some vision system focusing on a line in the grass. I am amazed that you think that somehow since all those pilots could not fly the plane that a computer could do a better job. The best way to run plane like that is give it the final destination and a GPS. And GPS technology was 20 years old in 2001.

       What if there's a big old water tower along that vector?  What

there were lots of flyover witnesses--or as few as possible.

       Yea, they do, if you have enough money.  Regardless, I wasn't
suggesting the plane should eyeball, I was suggesting the plane's
journey's planners were eyeballing--off into the distance, mulling over
whether this was the best approach, or not.

       So what? Do you know anything about vision control systems? They don't use lines, they use landmarks. And GPS is far better. In fact, do you know anything about navigation? You take where you are and the destination and determine you heading from that.

       Give me a break.  I come from a 3-generation construction family,
you use chalk on the ground, on wood pieces, on raw construction

conduit cutouts.  Have you not observed the chalk indicators city
workers use ubiquitously to discover &amp; mark out for construction
crews where and how to dig up streets? In one of those pictures
there are firefighters pretending to fight a fire--and you don't think
they might have had a reason, valid in your mind or not, to want
an indication laid on the ground as to whereall around the
building they should be setting up their fire evolution?  I'm sorry,

       No, I really don't.  The line is there, co-incident with the pictures
of some group apparently planning an attack on the pentagon, and
when they are gone, the line is gone.  Whether the line is useful
or not, they pretty obviously wanted it there.  The line is also
apparently remarkably close to the actual flight path of the
plane that hit the pentagon.  These are interesting facts, whether
or not any of your arguments about the use of the line mean
diddely.

       Now I am confused. Do you have the date for the satellite photo? I find it rather amazing that we just happen to have the photo of the one day this line existed.

       We are not talking about a construction job, though. Sure, if you are putting up a wall or digging something you might use a chalk line.

       A light pole will not get into and jam the engine. And by that point in the flight the engines are not really doing much. Engine failure 100 feet form impact won't change anything. What I know is that a pole will collapse if a car hits it and the plane has a bit more momentum. The issue with geese is that they get sucked into the engine and jam it and the plane loses power.

       I've no idea which photos you are talking about, but I will take a stab.
The reason that there's a connection between the sat. photos and

drill picture.  Which is something I believe the op pointed out when
he posted the pictures.

       No it doesn't.  It rests on what was reported to me by the op, that
they openly said they were planning an attack drill, which it certaily looks like, and the curious fact
that there is a line, &amp; fire trucks, co-incident with said drill (dispute your rather
ludicrous attempts to distract from said co-incidence by flapping your wings
like a chicken with it's head cut off) that just happens to be just about
aligned with the fllight path on 9/11.  Sure, it might all just be
an extra-ordinary coincidence.  But you can't make that certainly
so just be bleating about it convincingly.  And I'm getting pretty fed
up with the mounting number of extra-ordinary coincidences that
seem to have taken place on 9/11, so I have no compunction about
looking at this and mulling it over as much as I please.

trash fire in an outbuilding, that could have just as easily been
set on purpose, for practice.  As far as I know, only
the sat. photos are not part of the set supplied proudly by the 
pentagon to highlight their disaster preparedness so...what would
justify thinking they aren't fake firefighting.  ....And, so what?
Fake or real, they are still going to smear up any chalk, or whatever,

       I was pointing out, perhaps not as well as I might have, that the two satellite images demonstrate that
the line, and all the disaster drill evidence were all there in the first
photo, and all gone in the second.   Absent dates for the sat. images,
this is not terribly compelling data, but it isn't a refutation either.  I do not
know how long it took to put that line up, or how long it was there, and
did not intend to express an opinion on the subject, only to note that
they were all the evidence was there in one satellite image, and all gone
in the next.

       Sharp turn my ass.  That's looks like two different lines to me.  And, by the way,
the line in photo 2 is far from uniform in width and fineness.  It looks rather fine

       No my claim is that it is not uncommon to make such marks, in any
number of ways--I'm not particularly hung up on chalk, except for
a certain personal fondness--for
many reason during staging and construction of any sort of complicated
event, including stage plays and ballets, even.  And it is far from
unreasonable to imagine putting such a line down for people planting
random airplane parts and parking fire vehicles to simulate a disaster
to align themselves with along the assumed path of the incoming
source of the disaster.

       Your argument is entirely irrelevant and you should drop it.  I don't
know it is chalk, I don't know it isn't.  I don't know what it was for,
but I know it was there during the planning of a disaster very like
the 9/11 disaster, and in
roughly the same direction and location as the flight path of the
plane on 9/11, and, wiggle as you will, laying such a line down would
be a natural thing to do, and most people do it, if you were trying to hfake an air crash
with a bunch of people and big things moving around.

       Heavy is not the issue. Geese are small and they squish up jam things. And it takes a bunch of them to jam an engine. But if the engines were off it would not have made much of a difference at that point.

       But that time it would not matter in the slightest. By that time a full reverse on one side and full rudder would not have made a difference. The plane was going 500 mph. That means it covered the last mile in about 7 second. Changing the control surfaces would not do a thing.

       A line on the ground that is a close match for the
direction and location of the 9/11 event, which the
op maintains he found by researching into pre-9/11
sat. ops, and an openly advertised disaster drill, pre-9/11, that involved
putting airplane parts on the pentagon lawn, and included
a picture of planners hudding over what appears to be the same location on a model
of the pentagon where the plane collided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I have proof?  No.  Do I have reasonable cause for suspicion?  Yes.   Do I have
reasonable enough cause to indict?  Maybe, in conjunction with NORAD lying to
the the 9/11 commission, making  up three different stories about why they
couldn't defend the Pentagon.  On those grounds alone, the Chief Council of the
9/11 commission wanted to indict for perjury.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the extra-ordinary fact that this same Pentagon managed to fill
the sky with a cart-load of disaster drills being performed too far away to be
of aid that very day, &amp; failed to authorize launches of ready aircraft on the east coast
even with air force base generals watching the CNN coverage of the twin
towers &amp; begging for permission, until too  late, and will not release any but
a tiny piece of one video of the event, and waited until 06 to admit (inadvertantly
to a congressional committee), that they had a surveillance &amp; control plane in the
area--probably the distant white plane in some of the videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why, in fact, I think you ought to feel an obligation, if you are a plain old
honest human, to suggest why this drill
could not have been a prelude to  9/11.  I think the net evidence of malfeasance of
some sort is good enough to indict and start a prosecutorial investigation, and
the  chief council for the 9/11 commission agrees, and I think this drill would be
accepted  in court as prosecutorial evidence, which you have not countered with
anything  of sufficient weight to throw it out--the fact is, there are coincidences
here that would seem more than random to a typical juror or prosecutor--your
niggling distractions and counter-evidence that, at base, consists of your
theoretical opinions, to the contrary notwithstanding.

       Yep. I was available in some form since the 80s. In 2000 they military allowed usage of the full signal rather than the previous commercial degraded one.

       I don't get how that makes any sense. For "planning" use a rope and two stakes if you need it. But I still don't see what purpose it could serve. What planning would require them to make that big path? And what does a civil war have to do with this?

       GPS would be of less help to the people inside the building than a visible line. Precision and total co-ordination counts when someone is aiming at the Pentagon and yet wants it to keep operating throughout the attack and recovery.

       The satellite view. It shows the exact trajectory and crash point by a line marked on the grass. Who would ever see it and know what it represented before the crash and it was destroyed almost immediately afterward. However I'm sure they didn't consider that a satellite image would make it onto the Internet and be saved.

       The people inside the building know exactly where they are. They don't need either a line or a GPS. What building do you think these people are in? And how is that line going to help? I seriously don't grasp what you are trying to say. If the plane is not in the right place how will the line help? If you can see the line you can see the building. I can't imagine some situation where having that line would help me guild an airplane to some point.

       Calibration was critical . This shot had to be very very precise .People inside the building needed a hard reference point as well as the attack guidance system did.  They needed to , and did , take out the computers that held the information about 2.2 TRILLION dollars that Donald Rumsfeld had announced on the front page of the newspapers the day before, had been lost or unaccounted for. This attack got rid of the evidence and drowned out the news of the lost trillions. Unless the first news report of the day is to be believed  in which I heard my television report that " Something has happened at the Pentagon. Either a truck has blown up or....," They then held any further  news for a couple of hours. In my opinion that was because the scene needed modification by adding the 'plane parts' and they needed to do that with no one knowing it was being done. Simple . Just move the parts from inside the building towards the lawn and people will think you are just clearing out debris from the center towards the outside of the area.

       I heard on 9/11 that a missile had hit the WTC. And that a small plane had hit. I also heard the truck bomb at the Pentagon site. Here is a possibility, people were reporting what they heard when they heard it and we got stories that were wrong.

No , more likely they wanted to place the documents that pertained to 2.2 trillion missing dollars in the exact line of fire.  The result, I understand was a  bullseye.

      <p>
       So was the line to guide a plane or not?

       No and I have explained to the best of my ability that it was probably a key visual aid during further planning. I'm not an insider. The people in the photo's were and they deserve to be able to respond to your questions concerning the photo''s

       If there was anyone at the site that shouldn't have known what was up it would be very simple to just move something from storage inside the building, near the explosion site  (or wherever) to a place where it would be included as evidence of the plane crashing. During your torrent of questions,let me ask you this one .

       Which one of these is capable of instantly disappearing, an airliner or a missile, Take a look.

       Sorry, how does it make more sense to build that line than to just point out the window or area involved? How about this, can you find some example of someone doing anything like that to aim an airplane/missile? Anyone digging up the grass like that to plane something? I don't see how the line does anything that a line on a map would not do at least as well.

       So how did the line help the missile? The missile would use GSP and not need anything on the ground. And if it did it would use landmarks miles away. A line right outside the Pentagon is utterly useless.

       If someone would make a page with all of this visible at one glance I would appreciate it. I have zero HTML skills.
I don't need it attributed or copied exactly or anything . Just send a link.

       Edit, The  notion put forward  here  would explain how the airliner parts that were not there in the early morning photo got planted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they apparently planned it over at least a 10 month period they would simply walk the plane parts out onto the lawn from inside the hole in the  building after the explosion and to any witness it would look for all the world like they were just clearing out rubble from the affected area when they were actually planting " evidence"
      </p>
      <p>
       I can easily see how the 'engine part ' was carried just a few feet before the person planting it said 'fuck it leave it here', and the photo of the 'evidence' was taken at that point to 'prove' that an airliner crashed there.'

       I don't claim to know for certain what these photos mean, but they were actually featured in
       <em>
        Loose Change
       </em>
       . According to the film, these photos were taken during a Pentagon "training exercise" roughly one year before 9/11. The exercise simulated a Boeing 757 crashing into the Pentagon.
      </p>

       The film goes on to make some point about these photos, but for the life of me I can't remember what it is.

       I assure you that they are originally from a Pentagon page and unshopped. That page was live for an unbelievably long time,  at  least several more years after I fond it . I have had the photo's  archived since at least 2003 The Pentagon personnel should be identifiable and I doubt that they would deny that this is real.

       A pentagon employee pointing to it or moving model pieces  at that location during the planning of the event in the third photo.  or the contingency planning if you are of that opinion.  note the parking lot to the left in the model.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a fourth photo of the  exact location including broken up  model  plane and a car burning that somehow disappeared but I will never un-see it, Since it is gone I didn't mention it. .  I know the attitude will be that I made that one up but it nevertheless did exist. Maybe somehow someone somewhere saved the page in its entirety but I personally didn't have the presence of mind since the site was readily available live at the time and for a few years afterward.

       I don't see him pointing to that part of the building. But even so, how are you connecting that photo to the attack? I would imagine that many things have occurred near the Pentagon over the years. I would imagine that there have been hundreds issues requiring people to point to places near the Pentagon.

       It was after 9/11 and I felt as if I was being led to believe something false. A scam. all I knew of 9/11 had a stink of lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wanting to know more I approached the mighty Internet and I entered the very useful public tool called Google, and journeyed  into the sub-directory called Images. I issued the term "Pentagon" and I ,
      </p>
      <p>
       Alone,
      </p>
      <p>
       Unarmed,
      </p>
      <p>
       Completely unskilled in the ways of the hacker,
      </p>
      <p>
       and seeking only pictures of  the tragedy of 9/11 which I suspected was a fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found the Pentagon itself. Astonishingly, I found it
      </p>
      <p>
       UNGUARDED!!
      </p>
      <p>
       After 9/11!!
      </p>
      <p>
       It had no kind of ,                            warning,security,password,monitoring,challenge of 'who goes there'  Nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Click, You're in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was utterly unguarded and open through Google to anyone who was interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet here they were as if I was their mother and I had caught them  masturbating,  showing me that they had both foreknowledge and pre-planning.  and then  I continued on my look through all pictures that called themselves for what ever reason " Pentagon" and I found a  satellite picture that was of the lawn of the Pentagon with what appears to be a very damning line that mimics in every way a precise  map for the terrorists (sic) to follow with their projectile and to use to align their target.
      </p>
      <p>
       In answer to your question 
 The photographer was probably there to commemorate the big treasonous event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yippee!`We bombed our own country and I helped!

       Everybody do the fascist fugue !!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to imply that this is weak evidence , fine I have piles and piles of evidence just as damning , There is so much in fact that you have to willfully  refuse to be able to understand when you have been attacked, in order to continue to support the government s story. The case is obvious and way over the top obvious. I will continue as long as you like after a little sleep.

       Did you find those images on the Pentagon website? If so, why is that all that meaningful? Guarding the public facing website is not all that important for them.

       I still don't get how you connect those pictures to the attack. Why do you think they have anything at all to do with 9/11?

       That means something very different to me than to you. Piles of evidence that don't mean anything still means nothing. You have pictures of people in a room with a model of the Pentagon. Big deal. You have some line on the lawn which I still can't see how it would do a damn thing to help in planning anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me your point is that you made up your mind and you found evidence to confirm.

       im shocked that a major military building and a symbol of American power would ever think of having things like contingency plans for the event of an attack of some sort.
      </p>
      <p>
       im sure the White House, Capitol hill etc all have the same but i guess there will be no conspiracy until something happens.

       also are we not believing it was a missile now?

       the photos with the men and the model of the Pentagon was taken from a planning session two years before 9-11. The idea was to plan for different attack scenarios to the Pentagon, one of which was of course a low flying jetliner crashing into it.

       I believe they're actually from what
       <em>

       calls a "training exercise" roughly one year before 9/11.

       I saw them in this video at the 9 minute mark... probably from the LC video but this pilot referred to them... maybe it was a training exercise. Thanks for the correction.

       I assure you that it is not. The Pentagon had these images up on 9/11 Condoleeza Rice famously said , the next week that ' no one ever imagined they would fly planes into buildings'
      </p>
      <p>
       Was she uninformed or was she lying? The satellite pictures were found abut the same time and in the same way.

       Yeah this evidence is really strong. Some photos from a training exercise in which men whose job it is to predict what sort of attacks the Pentagon might face, uh, predict what sort of attacks the Pentagon might face.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like they
       <em>
        knew
       </em>
       there was a possibility the Pentagon would be attacked someday, and were doing their jobs to make sure contingencies were in place to deal with such an attack! How evil!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the reason truthers aren't taken seriously. Not because the evidence is lacking (although it is), not because people don't want to uncover the truth (we're globally obsessed with these sorts of conspiracies and would love to uncover one for real), but because most of you are fucking idiots who make up insane, literally insane, stories --
       <em>
        and believe them

       if the pentagon would have said a missile hit the building, then we wouldn't be having this conversation, but since the pentagon said it was a plane, and there is NO evidence of a plane ever being there, then that's where I say "wtf"
