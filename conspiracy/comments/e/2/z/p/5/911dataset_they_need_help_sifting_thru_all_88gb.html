6500 video clips that NIST used in its investigation.  It is important to note that NIST did not voluntarily turn
over the entire Cumulus database to us.  The alleged copyright holders of a small amount of material in the
Cumulus database objected to NIST releasing their materials, and NIST complied with all such requests.  We
are currently engaged in litigation against NIST, and will continue fighting for complete release of these

       Since the release of this Cumulus Archive through FOIAs and subsequent judicial means, it seems evidence has emerged that challenges the NIST report.
       <br/>
       For example: Audible secondary explosions can be heard through: 
sound clips,

       25 down votes? For what reason? People shouldn't examine history? Just let the media tell you "how it is"? Whether you believe the official government tale or not, and even if you don't want to examine these videos personally, it seems ridiculous to vote down something that is merely a release of video documentation of what happened into the hands of the public. People fought for a long time to get this data. The families fought for a long time just to get the phony 911 commission to pretend to do a thorough investigation. And some people still sadly say, "Shame on you for looking at the evidence! I will vote this down." Those of us who are taking the time to review the footage from that day are the people who truly care about humanity.

       pause play rapidly is not as effective as i would like it to be and there are anomalies (double plane images, different angles of the plane hitting the second tower, very bad overlay of airplane images,, shading anomalies) that i have observed through this process alone that i would love to further explore

       Agreed.
There is
       <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2010-10-20/foia-funds-request">
        another release
       </a>
       in the works but litigation needs to go forward with it.
       <br/>
       Blurb:
    Litigation seeking the release of never before seen 9/11 FBI records is currently 
    underway in the federal courts. There is a immediate need for a FOIA attorney to
    assist with the case. The defendants are operating with a nearly unlimited funding
    and have a large body of legal experts working to prevent the release of these records. 
    A public interest FOIA attorney has offered their services at a reduced public interest 
    rate. We need the research communities help to raise the required funds. 
    Release of these requested records may help settle questions surrounding 
    the Pentagon and Shanksville controversies, as well as others. Release of these records
    could also help overcome future claims of release exemption by the FBI for other 9/11
    records requests.
