<p>The US Constitution is a bit more vague, Article 1, Section 8. says &quot;The Congress shall have Power To&quot;. &quot;provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such <strong>Part</strong> of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States. <a href="http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/freedom/constitution/text.html">http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/freedom/constitution/text.html</a> . but no &quot;law&quot; says they actually do just as it says, &quot;The Congress shall <strong>have power to</strong> lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census of enumeration.&quot; Amendment 16 (1913).</p>

<p>But no &quot;law&quot; actually says they do do that. <em>if you can show me a &quot;law&quot; that says that they do please show me.</em> </p>

<p>During the Revolutionary war some new England farmers were put in the stocks for only having fouling pieces <em>(blunderbuss)</em> and not keeping long rifles. (That would subject them to punishment if found by the government <em>(British)</em>.)</p>

<p>More guns in the hands of law abiding citizens results in less violent crime. The &quot;general welfare&quot; of America would improve if the federal government provided that which is clearly stated as something they can provide.   One of the tasks of the federal government is to promote the general welfare isn&#39;t it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m still trying to figure this stuff out. </p>

<p>&quot;A federal jury unanimously found Tommy Cryer not guilty this week on two misdemeanor counts of failure to file. the prosecution dismissed two felony charges of tax evasion prior to trial. <a href="http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007707130321">http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007707130321</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56855">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56855</a> .</p>

<p>&quot;There are three points that are important,&quot; he told WND. &quot;There&#39;s no law making the average working man liable [for income taxes], there&#39;s no law or regulation that allows the IRS to contend that earnings are 100 percent profit received in exchange for nothing, and the right to earn a living through any lawful occupation is a constitutionally protected fundamental right, and it is exempt from taxation.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>but hay, don&#39;t let winning in a Federal court change your mind</strong>, keep paying your taxes! ☺ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In reference to <a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56855">http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=56855</a></p>

<p>A jury finding a man not guilty of failure to file is a far cry from a federal appeals court or the supreme court making a ruling that strikes down centuries of federal law and court decisions, or a declaration that no law exists.  The best I can say about it is that it sounds like jury nulification.  In other words, they looked at the law as explained by the judge in the jury instructions, looked at the evidence against him, and decided that, even though he broke the law, they were going to rule in his favor.  Another possibility is that there simply wasn&#39;t enough evidence against him.  Afterall, why would the prosecutors drop two felony charges prior to trial?  If this guy wasn&#39;t willing to settle, and forced going to court, why would they cut him slack if they had evidence against him?  They wouldn&#39;t.  He is a lawyer and sneakily hid his income and assets.  This guy probably has gold bars burried in the back yard.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t rely on what someone says after they&#39;ve been acquitted to be truth.  The idea that there is no law saying you have to pay taxes on wages is just wrong.  The consitution gives the Congress the power to lay and collect taxes.  In those laws, income is defined as &quot; all income from whatever source derived,&quot; and the first example given is wages.  </p>

<p>This guy comes off as a kook. A persuasive kook, but a kook nonetheless.  He has to know he will ultimately be unsucessful, because appeals will follow. </p>

<p>Numerous federal appeals courts and even the supreme court have, accross the board, labled such arguments as &quot;tax is unconstitutional,&quot;  etc.  as frivolous. That is, they&#39;ve been fought many times before, and they&#39;ve lost many times before.  As much as these people want to beleive it, there is no grounds to say the federal income tax is illegal.  From what I&#39;ve read on this case, it sounds like his reasoning is this:  &quot;I think income only means when I gain something for profit.  I give people my time, which has a value that people give me money for in exchange.  This is an equal exchange, so no profit is made and I don&#39;t have to pay taxes on it.&quot;  This has been argued before and is not a novel argument. The supreme court case he alludes to is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_v._Macomber">Eisner v. Macomber</a>.  In short, the court, in 1920, decided that a stock split did not count as a taxable event.  If you owned 100 shares, and the shares split to 200, you don&#39;t pay taxes on that split, even if it represents the company growing in size and your pro rata share being worth more.  You kept the same share of the company as you had before.  However, when you sell the shares, you will be taxed then, as that is a taxable event.</p>

<p>That case is often used by tax protestors, like your guy there, to argue that income from wages is not taxable, but that isn&#39;t what the case was about at all.  Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisner_v._Macomber#Use_by_anti-tax_activists">this section</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you don&#39;t call Cornell a &quot;rumor mill&quot;</p>

<p>Any guess on who owns this &quot;corporation&quot;?</p>

<p>By the way, is the federal income tax &quot;voluntary&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea which &#39;corporation&#39; you&#39;re talking about, or why you think tax is unconstitutional when you&#39;ve posted the section of the constitution which explicitly authorizes it, or how any of this relates to your claim that the Federal Government &#39;owes&#39; you a gun.   </p>

<p>Experience has shown that if someone has failed to provide a coherent justification of <strong>any</strong> of his statements by the 6th iteration of a discussion, he&#39;s unlikely to provide one by the 60th.   </p>

<p>Have a nice day.   </p>
