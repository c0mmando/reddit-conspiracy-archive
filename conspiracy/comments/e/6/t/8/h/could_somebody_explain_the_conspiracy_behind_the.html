<p>On an actually related note, urbantumbleweed is probably right.  I doubt they would have gone to all of the effort of making satellites without figuring out how to launch animals into space, as well - and didn&#39;t we successfully put monkeys up there?  What about the International Space Station?  That would have to be a hoax, too.  No, I think Bart whats-his-face was just stirring up rabble.  What did you expect from FOX?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it would be easy to figure the whole thing out, but I made a very concerted effort to provide every piece of evidence I could conceivably get to show exactly what&#39;s happening here.  As a whole, the body of evidence I have collected is EXTREMELY incriminating.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not a paranoid circlejerk.  If you were in my shoes, you&#39;d realize just how much of a stake these people have in discrediting me - five months of literally <em>nonstop</em> harassment, even without the surrounding context, based on the postings that have been made with this &quot;ghibmmm&quot; account, is sufficient to show their conflict of interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The theory is that the moon landing is Cold War propaganda.  It&#39;s said the mission was not possible, for many reasons (ie, radiation belts).  It&#39;s said the cameras would not have worked; the temperatures are too extreem for the film.  It is said that much of the evidence of the lunar landing is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32581790/ns/technology_and_science-space">fake</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes">missing</a> (which is odd since it is said to be the greatest achievement ever).  There is the reluctance of the astronauts to answer questions about it, and the oddities in their stories when they do tell it.</p>

<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and there seems to be little to no hard evidence of a lunar landing.  Much of the evidence, such as a mirror left on the moon, could have been planted by a robot.</p>

<p>The lunar landing could be verified.  There should be a flag, along with other items left on the moon.  A picture should be easy enough to acquire.  Oddly, the government has asked that companies and other space agencies not go near the lunar landing site, in order to preserve its state.</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s the basis of the story.  We know there is lots of Cold War propaganda.  Was the lunar landing part of the Cold War propaganda?  That&#39;s definitely a maybe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are hardly conclusive.  I&#39;d like to see good photos from Branson or one of the Google landers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt we could place trash on the moon;  I&#39;m not sure that humans have visited the moon.  Again, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  A lunar landing is among the most extraordinary of claims.  That evidence should be independently sourced.</p>

<p>Regardless, the moon landing did happen in that the effects of the story took us from the modern era of civilization to the post-modern era.  Propaganda or not, it is a major turning even for society.</p>

<p>What do you think of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnR4A4zb8B0">the videos of the massive, high speed, exploding projectiles from the September 11 attacks</a>?  In that case, there are multiple sources of video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What has happened over the years since Apollo is that the public has been force-fed a &quot;this or that&quot; storyline that revolves around one of two options - either yes, they went to the Moon and it is all true, or no, they did not or could not go and instead faked the whole thing. Sadly, the Apollo conspiracy (and there most definitely is a conspiracy) is not nearly as black or white a debate as that. </p>

<p>Yes, they went to the Moon during Apollo, and yes, they lied to you about it as well. The primary reason they were forced to lie was to cover up the evidence that proved the existence of past intelligent extra-terrestrial life that had been discovered in space and on the Moon. </p>

<p>The now-famed &quot;Brookings Report&quot; published in 1961 helps provide some framework behind why this lie (known as the &quot;Dead Moon Dictum&quot;) was established, and during the Apollo era specifically, NASA was deliberately given their own incredibly wide interpretation of Executive Order 10501 and the definition of the term &quot;National Defense&quot; to follow, and NASA&#39;s version of that particular Executive Order forced them to paint a broad &quot;classified&quot; brushstroke over just about anything that could be deemed controversial at all - and certainly forced them to cover-up anything related to the discovery of extra-terrestrial life in space or on the Moon (past or present). </p>

<p>Here is an article that is well worth reading if you are really interested in beginning to explore the idea of the Apollo lies. It focuses primarily on the proof to demonstrate that astronauts Conrad and Bean conducted an entirely covert, off-the-record EVA during their Apollo 12 mission to Statio Cognitium, and it also contains plenty of other verifiable tidbits of evidence that just begin to touch on several other vital facets of the Apollo coverup. Nothing in this article has been debunked, and as you will see, NASA was actually caught red-handed here blatantly admitting/leaking in an official document that they did in fact conduct an EVA during Apollo 12 that for 40 years the public was never told about!

<p>A word of caution - do not expect an understanding of this subject matter to come easily. It is not something you can gain a complex appreciation of by just spending a couple hours looking into it. However, if you are truly willing to devote the time and effort to digging into this with an open (but still honest and skeptical) mind, you will discover that there is plenty of evidence to demonstrate that you are not being told anything close to the &quot;full truth&quot; about what really went on during the Apollo Program. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my most optimistic opinion. They faked the photos of the moon landing - some were edited, some were faked. There are secrets surrounding the moon landings and there was a murder and cover up - I don&#39;t know for sure why. But the idea that we did not go to the moon at all was a very high profile conspiracy - fox even ran the documentary - and there was even an Alex Jones type who was famously punched by Buzz Lightyear - or somebody like that. But anyway the &quot;we faked the moon landings&quot; is probably a red herring. They did something with the moon and it was weird. Check out most uncomfortable public statement in human history: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RcKLAo62Ro">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RcKLAo62Ro</a> just watching it makes me want to loosen my collar. </p>

<p>But aside from that I want to know if the Van Allen radiation belts are a serious enough obstacle. And we&#39;ll soon find out - if we send a manned flight to Mars we can compare the shielding. If we haven&#39;t been lied to then this should be easy right? </p>

<p>I can&#39;t really decide, Soviets having tracking technology isn&#39;t proof we went. As far as I can tell there isn&#39;t really good proof other than, &quot;they wouldn&#39;t be able to get away with it.&quot; Totally unconvincing. It is claimed we went to the moon - there is little evidence to support the claim as far as I can tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That site makes some pretty ridiculous claims:
&quot;However no rocket powered LM was ever ever suspended from this crane. In any case anyone with the slightest gumption knows that it is impossible to control a rocket engine.&quot;</p>

<p>What? The whole point of the crane is to simulate the landing, and the site whines about no real rocket being used? Do they understand the point of simulation?
The second one (It&#39;s impossible to control a rocket engine) is even more insane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s lots of connections between <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGuzPjVsixI">Kubrick and the CIA</a>.  Propaganda was an important reason for the moon landing.  When it lost it&#39;s power, we stopped going to the moon.  Personally I think Kubrick did record a fake moon landing.  Something to be distributed in case things went badly, and there was a very good chance that would happen.  There&#39;s also the popular theory that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJdc8nf1E3A">NAZI rocket scientists</a> were there long before, in contact with extraterrestrials on Earth and the whole moon landing was pure public fluff.  </p>

<p>Apparently there are a whole shitload of color videos from the actual moon land, that was &quot;lost&quot;.</p>
