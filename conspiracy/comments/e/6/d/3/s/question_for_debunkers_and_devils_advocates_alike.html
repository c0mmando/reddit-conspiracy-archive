       Bin Laden was never indicted by name for the 9/11 attacks so he can't be entered onto the most wanted list. He however was indicted for the 1998 embassy attacks which is why he's on the list.

       No. The factual reason is that Bin Laden currently can't be added onto the list. He has been mentioned in Moussaoui's indictment but only as an unindicted unnamed conspirator. The Bin Laden tapes aren't admissible in court because the FBI can't prove that the tapes actually describe a real event. And from a certain viewpoint, he's already on the list so why add more? The original listing plus the increased bounty ($52 million) more than gets the point across.

       Lol. OK your statement indicts the Bush administration, the pentagon, the media - proof that there was a conspiracy to invade Afghanistan. But the major contradiction is that bin Laden was made the scape goat from day one, not Moussaoui. It makes no sense at all and there is no reason to believe you.

       Of all the points 9/11 conspiracy theorists bring up, this one makes the least sense to me.  If the government is capable of pulling off 9/11, how could they not accomplish the relatively trivial task of adding a single freaking sentence to his caution description!

       AFAIK, the reward for his capture was increased to $25 mil after 9/11.

       The most important thing is to confuse the people. Spouting lies on TV is about 1 million times more effective than a court case. A court case can cause trouble because false evidence is vulnerable to rigorous inspection.

       The real question is why the 4 hijacked planes weren't all shot down by US forces, rather than just 1 or 2 - something that would've saved the lives of thousands.
No one actually believes the story about one of the jets going down in a field because of a fight on board, do they? It was shot down probably by an F-16 and that falsified story distributed (even made into a movie) for better public relations.
The President, upon hearing of the hijackings continued to read from a childrens' story book. The "best evidence" against an internal conspiracy is incompetence.

       No, it went down in the field. People always point to how small the debris is for Flight 93 versus other airplane crashes and go "See? See? They don't look alike at all!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, other airplane crashes aren't straight down at 600 mph. Most airplane crashes happen because pilots desperately trying to save the plane fail, not because psychotic terrorists would rather die than be taken prisoner. So they crash more-or-less horizontally, at much lower speeds.

       Wait, which one do you want me to prove? That a vertical crash at 600 mph will obliterate the plane more thoroughly than a near-horizontal crash while the pilot tries to save the plane? Or that pilots try to save planes in distress at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because frankly, if you feel that either is in need of being proved, you're nuts.

       Look, it doesn't take much to prove either. You do accept that planes are designed to land horizontally, right? So logic would dictate that a pilot trying to land a plane in distress would try to land it horizontally, too. Can we consider this one proved?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as for the difference between that and the Flight 93 crash, I think that it would be beneficial to look at what happened to other planes that collided with anything nose-first at high speed. Two obvious examples are the planes that actually hit the towers. They were obliterated. Now, they hit steel, not dirt, but they weren't flying at 600 mph, which does add to the energy of the crash. And you've got various mountain-side crashes over the years, which tend to obliterate planes more than attempted crash-landings of planes in distress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't trying to say you should never ask for proof. I was trying to say these are simple to prove by just thinking logically.

       What did I get wrong, then? Please tell me which point I was incorrect on. Seriously. If you can show me evidence that planes in high speed head-on collisions aren't more damaged than planes that crash during emergency attempts to land, I promise to give it a fair viewing.

       Let's see... Honest answer... We've got a lot of visual evidence that two fully-loaded 767 aircraft crashed into the towers. We've got cellphone records from people on board the planes -- and don't any of you bother with the "you couldn't get cellphone reception on planes in 2001" argument. I accidentally left my cellphone on during a flight to San Diego literally one week before 9/11, and got a call. We've got airplanes that hit with approximately 20 times the amount of energy the towers were designed to withstand. We've got one of the hijackers' luggage. And so on, and so on.

       No, actually, you can't carry on a conversation from a plane. You MIGHT get a phone to ring if you are lucky. But you will not stay in range of one tower for more than a few seconds and the odds of a good handover are practically nil. The odds of flying withing range of a cell signal are also very low, and the odd of doing that consecutively across cells is astronomically low.

       I'm afraid you're wrong on all counts. The main problem with cellphones on planes -- and it's a theoretical one at best -- is that they're more likely to get a good connection to two or more towers at once, and interfere with cellphones on the ground. You'll actually stay in range of a tower for a good long time, because you've got direct line of site to them from up high. People accidentally leave cellphones on in flight all the time, and you can definitely hold a conversation.

       The problem is you know nothing about how mobile networks work. I do. I design nodes in mobile networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an airplane at cruise, you are too far from any tower. You are traveling along a path not covered by towers. You are traveling too fast for handovers to work, and even too fast to get on the mobile network on a single site.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true that cell phones are not "good' for the network because, on approach, you will unsuccessfully try to get on the network in many places along the approach path. But it really isn't that big a deal. The number of transactions handled by HLRs and VLRs dwarfs the "useless" transactions that would be generated if everyone kept their  phone on. Many people do forget to turn their's off, and the mobile network is unaffected.

       I'm reminded of an old joke. A woman walks in on her husband and finds him in bed with another woman, but he insists he's alone. When she points out that she can see the other woman plain as day, he says, "Who you gonna believe? Me or your damn lying eyes?"

       Everyone who flies regularly has heard illicit cellphone conversations on board in mid-flight. They drop connection a lot, their quality isn't good, but to say they're impossible is like, well, denying the presence of the woman in bed with you.

       Actually, nobody has EVER heard a call phone conversation mid-flight. You are far far far too far from any tower at cruise, and inside a metal can. There are only two ways for a call to happen in a jet liner mid flight: It is equipped with a picocell and airphone or satellite service, or it is a VoIP call (some Nokias can do that) and the plane is equipped with wifi and data service.
      </p>

       I'm saying you fly low enough - under 5k for sure and probably around 2k to make a cellular call, and that you do not fly faster than the network can hand over your call from one transceiver to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The calls you are making are not possible from a commercial airliner, except at the last few moments on approach, or the first few moments on takeoff.

       Ah, I see your misunderstanding.  This has worked for me at 7,500 ft, and that was with a GSM phone (which is lower powered and has less range than the analog phones still common in 2001).

       You suggested "a causal relationship between air pressure and radio waves." I corrected you: Since you do not have a pressurized airplane, you cannot fly above the range of cellular service. And, with a prop plane, you fly slow enough that handovers can be reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, I have flown enough in small planes to know that, for a reliable mobile call, you need to descend to a low altitude if you want the call not to disconnect.

       You are a liar and a shill. You have not accidentally had phone calls. At best, on approach or take off your phone may have rung. But you certainly did not have a conversation. Neither did anyone on a 9/11 flight have a conversation on their cell phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your supposed source says crazy shit like “They also were digital phones, and there's a little bit more leeway on those digital phones, so it worked,”
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a big red flag that your "source" is full of shit. In fact, that is the opposite of what is true. IF you had an ancient analog cell phone, you would have a slightly better chance of connecting for slightly longer from an airplane, IF they were in an area with AMPS coverage, but that would be counter-balanced by the slower signaling and call completion times on that network.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what kind of gear was in use at the time. I know about the state of network build-out at the time, and I know there was no fucking way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stories of phone call from the 9/11 planes was bullshit, end to end. And you are propagating that lie.

       You say you have corroboration from a pilot. Unless your pilot pilots an unpressurized prop plane, he ain't making phone calls on terrestrial mobile networks.

       Your linked "source" actually says I am correct: Without a picocell on the plane, none of which existed on planes in 2001, you are SOL for phone calls.

       Why do I keep answering you? You're insulting, closed-minded, and insistent in the face of all logic. Guess I'm just stubborn.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pilot I mentioned is in this very thread. I'm sure if you look, you'll find him. The source I linked talks about the problems of stable connections, sure, but it doesn't support your thesis that a phone call would be literally impossible. Instead, it details why phone calls are
       <em>
        difficult
       </em>
       . There's a world of difference between difficult and impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, on 9/11, some calls got through. Unless you're calling the families of everyone who died on those planes after making calls liars. Why would every family lie?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go ahead, read this:
       <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14789502/">
        MSNBC
       </a>
       . Done? Good. Now tell me every one of those calls was faked or fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       You call me a liar and a shill. I know from personal experience, and from witnessing several times, that phones can sometimes work on planes, with or without the picocell. There are hundreds of news articles available all over the web that talk about the problems airborne cellphones can cause cell towers, but none of them say a call is strictly impossible, and a lot of them say otherwise. Yet somehow, to you, I am a liar and a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, since you're trying to degrade this conversation into insults, here's mine: You are insane, and as a die-hard liberal I wish you fucking nutbag truthers would stay the hell off my side. Bush and his ilk were plenty evil, what with the torture, the suppression of civil rights, and the pointless invasion of Iraq. But you lunatics do your damnedest to render the arguments against Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld completely impotent. You insist on attacking them for phantom ninja bomber bogeymen with magical exploding thermite and the ability to instigate a conspiracy involving the family members of hundreds of their own victims, rather than attacking them for the shit they
       <strong>
        actually did
       </strong>
       . If you dolts spent 1/100th of the energy you spend trying to prove this ridiculous conspiracy bullshit on something useful -- rescinding the "PATRIOT" Act, indictments for Abu Ghraib and Gitmo torture, indictments for Iraqi WMD lies... the list is practically endless -- then you might be able to accomplish something useful. Until that happens, you're just a bunch of sad-sack crazies.

       The government lied about the calls, and solicited lies. "Let's roll" was war propaganda. The cellular calls were part of that myth. So, yes. ALL calls not made on an airphone were fake. ALL of them. Your link does not work, by the way. Odds are, it, like your previous link, would show that I am correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, phones cannot sometimes work on commercial jetliners. Not without a picocell, as the article you pointed to in fact says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, a plane full of cell phones turned on will, occasionally, have all those phones try to enroll in the network. But that isn't "harming" a network. It is useless activity, but all networks survive lots of useless activity. The same thing happens if a lot of phones are in a fringe area. They try to enroll, fail, and retry.

       My very first thought, as expressed in an email to a friend sent probably no more than 30 minutes after the second plane, was that whomever did this was really polite. If I were a terrorist, and my objective was to terrorize, I'd
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       pull off a stunt like that early in the morning, where my victims will have plenty of daylight hours to clean up. I'd do it near the end of the day and the beginning of darkness, so as to be disruptive as possible.

       I intend no disrespect, but in terms of what a large-scale attack

       been like (same method, same tools), 9/11 was a slap in the face.

       I was suspicious about the whole thing from the very start, and ranted about it a lot. I feel absolutely vindicated by all this "9/11 Truth" nonsense.

       The attack was at the end of summer, so offices would be long empty by nightfall.  I guess the attack could have come in the winter, but the towers burning against the empty blue sky made for some particularly chilling imagery, IMO.

       People really like to give a lot of credit to the government. The government is made up of our neighbros for the most part, the guys who get to top levels are involved in much more than public policy, so when anyone (not that it happened here) says the government is behind something, it's a blanket statement and baseless. The simple truth, and it's a truth as far as I'm concerned, is that our massive intelliegence community knew about the attack and let it occur. Plain and simple. We didn't plan, we enabled.

       You're just assuming the government didn't do it. Obviously proving that they did is difficult because we need them to prove who did it. They clearly don't want to (because of a lack of a criminal investigation.) That makes "them" suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       The level of "enabling" was beyond belief. There were so many military exercises on that day that the much more plausible reason would be as cover - and it would allow a conspiracy to operate with less suspicion.

       I definitely get that. And there are enough psychological studies available to prove that even the people involved might not have been... 'involved' but just used during that day. I just think that the government is fairly large, but the information dissemination is rather lacking between departments. There are rivals there just like in the private sector and I'm sure plenty of agencies were left in the dark if it was in fact an entire government coverup.

       One very important discovery was Mohamed Atta's luggage didn't make his flight, and contained lots of material relating to the perpetrators of the attacks, and their backers, which was instrumental for their plot.  The information was used to link the hijackers back to Al Qaeda.  Also Al Qaeda has talked among itself for years about using planes to attack buildings.  There was a security warning issued about that very threat.  The hijackers on the planes have been decisively linked to Al Qaeda.  They had the means, the motive, and the opportunity, and it's all documented.  There is a common misconception that the hijackers were some sort of incredibly-talented spies, when all the evidence points to them being idiots.  Them leaving incriminating evidence lying around is something that shitty terrorists do the world over, and is no cause for concern.  One plane got lost, for crying out loud!  They weren't even decent pilots!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's up to the people who don't believe that story to show
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       as to why it's false.  Think of it like a court of law - the prosecution has made a very compelling argument, and now the defense has to show evidence as to why it's not the case.  Not trusting the government is not enough to forego evidential requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I know this is pointless.  There is no rational reason to believe Al Qaeda wasn't behind the attacks, so people who doubt the official story are doing so irrationally, and it's impossible to rationally debate with an irrational person.  I'll stand back and wait for the usual misunderstood photos and analyses of tiny fragments of the 9/11 story and their accompanying claims that it's enough to topple the entire official story, or the cries that I'm some sort of disinfo agent, or that I'm blind or some other nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       No truther has
       <em>
        EVER
       </em>
       shown any shred of evidence that contradicts the official story in any meaningful fashion.  The official story is supported by reams of evidence.  That should tell you something - oh yeah, let me guess - that there's some awesome conspiracy, as it's impossible for truthers to be wrong on the whole matter.

Do you have evidence that not a single other passenger's baggage was not on that flight?  Because if you don't, your argument is by

       Ha!  I love it!  Truthers down-vote arguments that blow stupid guesses out of the water, but can't even figure out how to counter.  Hilarious.  Again, this is why people laugh at truthers - their arguments are specious, and it almost seems like they know it.  Pathetic.  They don't have a leg to stand on, but seem to love playing "internet rebel hell-bent on discovering the truth", even though they can't be bothered to actually engage in real research.  It's like kids playing dress-up, only truthers should know better.

       Down-voting and not replying is being a pussy.  Seriously.  Man-up, grow some balls, and challenge what you think is fantasy.  I'll be right here, ready and willing to show exactly how far off you are.

       yeah, that's what convinced me, too. nobody could have planted that. that and that passport of atta that somehow made it out of the inferno and was found in the rubble of WTC. then, when they immediately released all the security cam footage of the pentagon attack clearly showing a huge jet disappearing into like a 4 ft hole after completing this amazing corkscrew turn at max speed, completely pulverizing engines and wings, i knew it: the attackers must have been a bunch of mediocre amateur pilots without any experience flying large passenger jets whatsoever.

       Truthers are idiots.  If you do some real investigation work your self you will find that the external hole was in fact the correct size and plenty of airplane debris could be seen including the very dense innards of the turbines that flew even further into the pentagon. I have seen these small holes from the turbines claimed to be the whole impact of the plane.. what a joke.  Seriously get a fucking clue man, you really think your government is competent enough to pull this shit off?  Hundreds if not thousands of people would have had to been involved, you think someone might not like doing such a horrible thing to their own country and might tell their loved ones the truth and come forward with irrefutable evidence, but there is none of that.  It was just some idiotic terrorists going jihad, they wanted to cause fear and distrust and you are fueling them.

       thank god it's not my government. :P  as far as the large-scale conspiracy argument goes: i don't necessarily buy the premise that 100s or 1000s of people need have been involved. All of the alphabet soup institutions (NORAD, FAA, NSA etc) are very hierarchical organizations and having a couple of key people in each might have been sufficient, i.e. Dick Cheney revamping NORAD procedures in the months leading up to 911 in a way that lead to him being the central figure for the emergency response and putting his confidantes in key positions.

       i think you're spot on, but we disagree on the likely nature of who

       are/were.
       <em>
        cui bono

       is a valid question to ask, and without 911 it's hard to see how the PNAC war plans could have been implemented with so little domestic resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       in any case, too many ad hominems for my taste. no need to be such a bully. you really think everybody who does not buy the official story is an idiot and does the terrorists' work for them? what a way to engage in open-minded debate.

       do you also happen to have some good truther-debunking sources on the maneuvre that the pentagon attackers had to fly - all the skeptic sources i've read claim that the official reconstruction of the flight path is almost impossible to pull off with a passenger jet (descending so-and-so many feet while doing a 270° turn and then managing to hit the building instead of just cratering into the ground or sth like that.)

       I did it long ago and no longer have the work, I don't have the time to find some good pictures of the fresh impact and scale and draw on them right now, I'll do it later and reply if I do.  Plenty of reports exist of the plane flying very low to the pentagon, some light poles got taken out by the plane on a freeway on low approach to the pentagon! How would you explain a missile or small drone doing that?  Holograms? lol

       What?  That's not what I'm saying happened.  That's not what anyone is saying.  You seem to have a woefully poor understanding of the rational explanation you seem to hate for no apparent reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hijackers had pilot training, and it's not hard at all to steer a plane that is already in the air.  You could do it.  Anyone could do it, as long as they have eyes, hands, and everything in between.  You've seen video of amateurs flying jumbos in flight simulators, surely.  Heck, the Mythbusters had a go in a simulator, and could even
       <strong>
        land a plane
       </strong>
       by being explained what to do, and they had
       <strong>
        zero training
       </strong>
       . The hijackers were supported by Al Qaeda, as extensive documentation shows.  The skyscrapers were not fire-proof, as they are made of non-magical elements.  To assume anything can be fire-proof is fucking retarded and shows a complete lack of knowledge of fundamental science.  Seriously.  This is shit little kids learn.  The WTC was designed to have decent fire-suppression for dealing with normal office fires, where a paper basket ignites, or a car in the car park catches fire,
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       when a fully-fuelled jet liner smashes into the tower at cruising speed, creating an incredibly-well ventilated fire, fuelled by lots of jet fuel
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       office supplies.  In your world steel is some magical element that never loses strength when heated, and is somehow unbreakable.  The fact the core was crumpled, and that the clean-up operation could remove the core by simply heating it shows your argument is full of shit and wasn't thought out at all.  If what you say is true, the cores would still be there, standing as they were when they were constructed, until they are finally blasted off into interstellar space when the sun explodes in a few billion years.  Your run-on sentence about the Pentagon made no sense.  There was a plane-shaped and plane-sized hole, plane wreckage, countless eye-witness reports claiming it was a passenger plane (compared to the handful of contradictory reports).  May I suggest taking a few breaths, re-reading about this thing called "punctuation" and try writing that again?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the US military fucked up.  You are assuming they are perfect, which is patently untrue.  People make mistakes, but apparently not in your world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       compelling, if you know what it is, which you just demonstrated you don't.  You haven't even bothered to read about what happened.  You clearly haven't even bothered.  That is intellectual laziness, and you just told the world how fucking lazy your brain is.  You have
       <strong>
        faith
       </strong>
       , not
       <strong>
        evidence
       </strong>
       .  There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a difference, you know.  Don't confuse the two, otherwise you will end up looking like a drooling basement-dweller, which you seem to have accomplished rather nicely, and without any help from me.  Bravo, sir!  You are an asset to science; the very poster-boy for arrogance and ignorance.

       .  Truthers expect people proclaiming support for the official story to subject themselves to perpetual bombardment of what truthers consider evidence ("conjecture" to rational people) but as soon as the truthers' flimsy, childish, amateur arguments are shown to be exactly what they are, they all shut the fuck up and scurry back to the basement.

       you are a stupid dumbfuck who thinks that minuscule (or infinite) amounts of jet fuel will melt steel. You are not worth taking seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine how stupid you would have to be to think that... that kerosene (effectively) melts steel. You see cars every day but you still think that steel melts from the heat of hydorcarbons. Nothing from anyone who thinks that hydrocarbons melt steel is worth considering.
      </p>

       The funny thing now is that you now have to say "oh, they didn't melt, they just bent "  i.e. the steel beams never broke.

       The 9/11 plot mechanism no longer worked by late morning on 9/11. Since most people were used to terrorists taking hostages and having a list of demands, they decided to let the terrorists take the plane rather than risk their lives. Once people on Flight 93 realized that they were going to be used as a missle if the terrorists had control of the plane, they started fighting back. It's almost impossible for 4 or 5 people to take control over 25 or 30 people who are fighting for their lives with small hand weapons like razor blades. As a result, the methodology no longer works and future attacks would be thwarted quickly, leading to prisoners who could give up their training grounds, benefactors, etc.

       It's the reason there's an "Al-Qaeda in Iraq" (beyond, you know, us being there) and all those different Al-Qaeda affiliated groups. Al-Qaeda put itself out there as the big, bad American killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the group that can create the biggest terrorist attack becomes the lead dog. Lesser groups sort of fell in behind it and people who want to become terrorists think of joining Al-Qaeda rather than random local group.

       Exactly.  There's another misconception lots of people have - there is no such thing as "Al Qaeda" as the news portrays it; some singular organisation with a lone leader who controls everyone.  It's not like that at all.  Al Qaeda, or "The Base/Foundation" as the CIA christened it, is simply an ideology that some groups subscribe to, and in return get logistical and intelligence support.  Their intelligence &amp; logistics is woefully inadequate, as the funding ability of Al Qaeda is sporadic, due to host governments, foreign pressures, and the incessant hunting of their operatives and supply chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, Al Qaeda benefited massively from the attack - it was a rallying cry to the masses of borderline-fundamentalists who thought attacks of that magnitude were impossible, and who wouldn't want to join an impotent group.  It put OBL's claims in the forefront, and made sure everyone around the world (excluding many in the west who were not exposed to their manifesto) aware of the grievances they claim (ripping of Saudi Arabia of $50bn, the stationing of foreign troops in Islam's holy land, and the consistent persecution of Muslims at the behest of Israel's powerful lobby, to name but a few).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the US government didn't want everyone to know the real reason Al Qaeda-supported groups attacked America (selfish, short-sighted US foreign policy) and instead made up some bullshit excuse ("they hate us for our freedoms") doesn't mean to say the events were not caused by Al Qaeda.  That is specious reasoning, but that should come as no surprise.

       Ok that makes sense...Doesn't really explain why we have seen relatively few attacks since then though.

       No, it went down in the field. People always point to how small the debris is for Flight 93 versus other airplane crashes and go "See? See? They don't look alike at all!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, other airplane crashes aren't straight down at 600 mph. Most airplane crashes happen because pilots desperately trying to save the plane fail, not because psychotic terrorists would rather die than be taken prisoner. So they crash more-or-less horizontally, at much lower speeds.

       You must have really bad luck - over the last 10 years I have travelled in excess of 30 times (return flights) and neither myself or my partner have a single piece of luggage go missing.
