       I posted this in a comment elsewhere, but I really have to ask:
      </p>
      <p>
       As a Jew, I tend to notice more than many when redditors mention Judaism in various contexts. In following
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , I've seen a bunch of posts/comments mentioning Jews taking over the US, or a Jewish shadow government, or w/e.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I don't agree with everything every Jew has ever said (read: Eric Cantor), but I'm forced to ask: What's wrong with my people controlling the US anyway? It's not like we know nothing about politics (Feingold, Franken), law (Ginsburg, Kagan), economics (Krugman, Summers)...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure we're as, if not more qualified to run a "shadow" government that your Christine O'Donnell/Sarah Palin/Intelligent Design proponents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wondering.

       I think the idea of any specific group or sect colluding against the wishes of the general population angers people. I do not think it is because they are Jews, but because they are supposedly 'conspiring' to establish either a new order or authority,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       they are Jews. It could be Mormons, the religious right, even atheists. But when there is a specific group to bestow blame on for unspecified possibilities, it is easy to latch on against that group and establish frustration with it.

      <p>
       IMO, of course.

       Judaism represents less than 2.5% of the population. I can see why they wouldn't want their country controlled by people from a culture that represents that small an amount.

       So explain to me why 12.5% of Americans are black, yet there will be 0 black representatives in the House come January.

      <p>
       Also, why 12.5% of Americans are black, and we have a black president. According to your logic, "they" wouldn't want blacks running government either. However, just as Jews are disproportionately represented in government, blacks are disproportionately NOT represented in Congress.

       actually, all races have being so mixed, that sometimes its hard to tell what someone is.
but if you go to a really far apart and poor city, you'll see that every one looks almost the same.
the only thing that doesn't make a specific mutation a specie its the quantity. 
for example, the aye-aye..

       I'm not arguing. I'm pointing out scientific facts to you. Human race is a construct that does not exist.

       Racism likewise does not mean "racial discrimination". It means discrimination based on characteristics such as skin color, religion, ethnic origin, and so on.

       Because "your people" are a very, very small minority. The republic was set up to be controlled by "the people", not some minuscule minority that has taken control of most government functions through subterfuge, bribery via campaign "donations", outright blackmail and extortion.

       Jew or not any rational human being is against the idea of a shadow government that doesn't represent its people.

       Maybe I should have given you the benefit of the doubt.  It's just tough to do that when on one hand you're promoting the idea that a unelected shadow government is perfectly fine if its Jewish, then only a few sentences later you're inferring that
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       is pro-Palin, who is basically a female George Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I need to point out why a secretive unelected government is bad because it's painfully obvious, but I can understand why you may think that people in this subreddit would support Palin.  The original tea party, circa 2007, talked about many of the things we talk about here - a new 9/11 investigation, abolishing the Federal Reserve, and growing government power with shrinking civil liberties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tea party you see on TV today, is in no way connected to that original tea party.  After Obama won, the beat down and defeated Republican party hijacked the tea party with the idea that it would be easier to take over a legitimate grassroots conservative movement than to start their own.  The original tea party was just as, if not more, opposed to the Republican party than the Democratic party.  That's why Fox News banned Ron Paul from one of their debates and wouldn't allow him to talk in the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll still see a End the Fed or Investigate 9/11 sign occasionally at a tea party rally, but for the most part they have been replaced by anti-gay marriage garbage and obama monkeys.

       That probably depends on what your last name is.  If it doesn't sound Jewish, then change it

       Hey Moogel!
Good for you to ask. Jews don't really believe in any of that rapture stuff - we don't have any of those "revelations" things with the four horsemen of the apocalypse or whatever. From what I understand, "the end" is when the messiah comes, ushering in an age of peace and whatnot. The dead are supposed to rise (which seems like it would overpopulate the world and cause a zombie apocalypse, I know).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr - there's nothing to really be saved from.

       I'd much prefer a government run by a people who have been subjected to numerous injustices, knowing that said government would be more conscious about the effect it has on others lives. That said, I would like my government to be controlled by native americans.

       Ignore those users and posts. There has already been a discussion on how some Redditors are attempting to manipulate popular belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also notice that none of them are going to comment on this thread. If they do it will be to claim their innocence or to be wildly defensive.

       r/conspiracy already called those users on their game.
