    <div class="md"><p>Author Floyd Rudmin writes: “Conspiracy theory” is usually used as a pejorative label, meaning paranoid, nutty, marginal, and certainly untrue. The power of this pejorative is that it discounts a theory by attacking the motivations and mental competence of those who advocate the theory. By labeling an explanation of events “conspiracy theory,” evidence and argument are dismissed because they come from a mentally or morally deficient personality, not because they have been shown to be incorrect. Calling an explanation of events “conspiracy theory” means, in effect, “We don’t like you, and no one should listen to your explanation.”</p>

<p>In earlier eras other pejorative labels, such as “heresy,” “witchery,” and “communism” also worked like this. The charge of “conspiracy theory” is not so severe as these other labels, but in its way is many times worse. Heresy, witchcraft, and communism at least retain some sense of potency. They designate ideas to be feared. “Conspiracy theory” implies that the ideas and their advocates are simple-minded or insane.</p>

<p>All such labels implicitly define a community of orthodox believers and try to banish or shun people who challenge orthodox beliefs. Members of the community who are sympathetic to new thoughts might shy away from the new thoughts and join in the shunning due to fear of being tainted by the pejorative label.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, conspiracy theorists are typically irrational. But if you make statements like that, you are intentionally misleading the listener if you fail to mention that PEOPLE are typically irrational in several ways. </p>

<p>The rest of your post is pretty bunk too. </p>

<p>How many times do you people need to be told that it is impossible for anyone to deny that there is, for example, a large conspiracy of corporations, that will not shy away from ANY measures in order to gain more profit. And that in the current economic system, when someone makes a profit, it usually means someone else losing out in a significant way, including, but certainly not limited to, all future generations on this planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve known and seen this effect for the last decade or so. In part because I looked at a lot of these &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and they had some compelling arguments as to what was going on. But as to be expected with these sorts of thing, the insights were quickly disregarded by most and no analysis or investigation ever takes place. The argument is simply dismissed.</p>

<p>I think it takes a sort of mental brain washing to be able to get that to happen in most people, however. I think that you have to be conditioned to NOT think for yourself and to be compelled to trust certain groups. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like when my grandparents watch the News every night. They truly believe everything that comes through the television is true. EVERYTHING. Including miracle cures for wrinkles, or some floor cleaning product or whatever else they are hocking on TV. They believe it because it comes from the TV. They trust the TV.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like books. People tend to believe EVERYTHING that is published in books merely because they are published. People do not readily believe that anything false would ever be published.</p>

<p>So to those ends it becomes very important for you to think for yourself. To use your own judgment. If something sounds like bullshit, it probably is. And any time someone tries to dissuade your search for truth, you should really be weary of those people. Because like many things that are not true, it doesn&#39;t take someone getting angry that you want to know why 1+1 does not equal 3. It is simply a matter of fact. Indisputible. But for other things, like events and historical accounts of facts in those events, a lot of times the facts reported are bogus, exaggerated or outright lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because at one time everything that came through the television was true. Well not exactly but there was a great deal of truth there. It built up credibility capitol that they are spending now. But slowly the American people are realizing that there is a propaganda machine greater than even the Soviet Union had, working right in the USA.
Television is an extremely powerful medium because you can compress the message into a shorter time frame. 
What is that expression? All power corrupts? It was just a matter of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. And I would like to add that Hollywood is the biggest propaganda-machine the planet has ever seen.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you entirely and avoid big pictures quite a bit myself. I remember seeing The Dark Knight after blazing up a bit of marijuanas. I couldn&#39;t take the entire movie seriously at all because it was like every scene just reeked of propaganda. And I&#39;m not talking necessarily about propaganda to sway public opinion on political matters or toward loving one&#39;s country (although that <em>did</em> occur in The Dark Knight...). I&#39;m talking like &quot;this is the way reality should be&quot; type of propaganda that seeps into your subconscious. Like seeing Harvey Dent&#39;s face in a closeup, completely clean, plastic-like, as if this were the desireable way to look, as if there were a &quot;perfect&quot; image that we should achieve.</p>

<p>This also reminds me of my brother who seems to be trapped entirely in a sort of media-prison that is most definitely filled with propaganda. He will start fights and argue as if he were in a drama himself. Over absolute nothings, minute events in the big picture of my family&#39;s existence. It&#39;s like he learned from all these movies and games that this is the way people act... that there&#39;s one particular flow to the way a conversation goes, for example, and not another... like &quot;ok and now you say your line&quot;, when clearly that isn&#39;t how reality goes.</p>

<p>Do you get what I&#39;m saying? Propaganda dictates more than just belief, for it is through beliefs that decisions are made and actions are taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I get you totally. This is exactly what I mean by &#39;propaganda&#39;.</p>

<p>A good example is also the Steven Seagal films. When I was a teenager I thought some of his first movies were totally cool and he was bad-ass. But when I saw those films again many years later, I realised that the hero (Steven) was actually behaving like a complete asshole and being totally unecessarilly agressibe. He would seriously damage or kill someone just because they had been a little stupid and said something. If someone acted as aggressively IRL people would most certainly not think he was a &#39;hero&#39; but totally shun him.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also very evident in any movie portraying US military hardware, as the military have a say-so on the script and the cutting of the movie otherwise they wont participate. So e.g. they mustn&#39;t show a US soldier behaving badly, shooting a civilian etc. This way alot of people around the world see the US military as &#39;the good guys&#39; because they are always portrayed as such when reality is <em>very</em> different and they are actually the aggressors. Unfortunately Hollywood propaganda is very effective, and works well on a teenage brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out the documentary &quot;South of the Border&quot; if you haven&#39;t seen it. It&#39;s about Hugo Chavez&#39;s rise to power in Venezuala, basically being a super legit politician, a &quot;for the people of the people&quot; Guevara type, and the USA&#39;s attempt at portraying him as a horrid dictator through the media. That is just one example in the documentary, but it&#39;s a good watch. I also noticed throughout that they would include shots of the set, basically showing that they have all this stuff set up to shoot the documentary&#39;s scenes, as if the director was consciously aware of the effect it can have on the subconscious&#39;s beliefs... like sensory belief vs. decided belief. Fuck I&#39;m high.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t seen it but I will now! </p>

<p>Another great example of propaganda is the Men In Black. Around the time before they were released there was a general shift in the population who were starting to actually believe in the Men in Black (the actual real spooks), this from books like the Mothman profecy and shows like the x-files etc. So when they announced they were making Men in Black I was expecting a more serious aproach, and I think alot of other people were too. However, they made a comedy instead carefully crafted to show how silly the idea of real Men in Black is....making a complete joke out of an actually serious thing (read the Mothman profecy it&#39;s very good and genuinely scary/intriequeing or see the film, both highly reccomended but book is of-course better). After the MIB films nobody talked seriously about the real men in black....   </p>

<p>Wether they are a real phenomena or not, Hollywood managed to sway the public in to thinking that most definitely it would be crazy to believe such a thing....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched that the other day, it was amazing.  The portrayal of Hugo Chavez by the MSM is almost laughable once you&#39;ve seen how he is viewed by his people.  The documentary did a lot to change my opinion on socialist/communist styles of government.  When leaders such as Chavez who not only talk about being a man of the people but also lives it, the outcome is beneficial to the whole country.  But the South American&#39;s have a great belief in national sovereignty.  Understanding just because you have national leaders which help guide economic and foreign relations along, the real great national asset is the individual and not based on collective salvation.  Community is encouraged and they are free to act as communities without government oversight.  The same could be said on just about any political structure, the key is for the leaders to be genuine.  In most socialist/communist countries the leaders are far from genuine and its often difficult or impossible to really break the leadership cycle.</p>

<p>Of course this is my interpretation, either way South of the Border is a must watch.  </p>

<p>Stop it. Che Guevara killed a lot of innocent people. I will never understand the hero worship given people like Guevara and Mao. </p>

<p>And I just loooove it when &quot;super legit politicians&quot; make power plays to become president for life. That is so legit, you don&#39;t even have to vote anymore!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re saying is inconsequential and irrelevant. It&#39;s a valid criticism, yes, but has nothing to do with this discussion. </p>

<p>He brought up what a swell guy Guevara was and I don&#39;t think Che deserves to be thought of in a positive light. We can go on and on about people killing other people and for what reason, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the real Guevara was a reckless bourgeois adrenaline-junkie seeking a place in history as a liberator of the oppressed. But this fanatic’s vehicle of “liberation” was Stalinism, as in Josef Stalin, murderer of well over 20 million of his own people. As one of Castro’s top lieutenants, Che helped steer Cuba’s revolutionary regime in a radically repressive direction. Soon after overthrowing Batista, Guevara choreographed the executions of hundreds of Batista officials without any fair trials. He thought nothing of summarily executing even fellow guerrillas suspected of disloyalty and shot one himself with no due process.</p>

<p>Adding to the ridiculousness of the Che cult is that he was virtually a complete failure. As a medical doctor, he never even had a practice. When put in charge of the Cuban economy at the start of Castro’s government, his uncompromising communist diktats ran it completely into the ground, from which it never recovered. Humiliated, and also angry that Castro wasn’t fomenting enough revolution abroad, he then tried to lead such quixotic adventures in Argentina, the Congo, and Bolivia, failing miserably everywhere while sacrificing the lives of scores of naïve, idealistic young followers as deluded pawns in the service of his personality cult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but I never said hero worship of any sort was valid one way or the other. He brought up Che Guevara as being a real &quot;for the people of the people&quot; type and I simply said he was no such thing. People tend to romanticize historical figures and Guevara was no exception. </p>

<p>I am not saying that America doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s share of known liars, hypocrites and murderers in power...hell, most of them have been President at some point in the last 100 years. But he didn&#39;t say anything about how awesome Nixon was, he was talking about Che and that is what I responded to.</p>

<p>I realize you guys have a boner for Che and you probably have a t-shirt lying around or a poster on the wall, but he was an incompetent dick whose only skill in leadership was leading young, idealistic followers to their deaths. Just saying &quot;Oh, well America is soooper evil&quot; doesn&#39;t change that.</p>

<p>Is it better to have one leader that can&#39;t be removed, <em>ever</em>, no matter what he does? You&#39;re making a dangerous assumption; that <em>one</em> man knows and <em>always will know</em> what is best for every single issue facing a nation. That&#39;s near omnipotence and highly improbable to boot. Why doesn&#39;t Chavez just proclaim himself king? Now that Chavez has removed all opposition that&#39;s exactly what he is, but he would never dare say it or wear a crown because it would alienate all the poor ignorant peasants he depends on for support while he lives better than they do. It&#39;s the same song all over again. How many dictatorships have blossomed from this seed? A leader who claims to speak for &quot;the people&quot; comes to power and immediately crushes all opposition and installs himself as ruler for life, then postures as some great hero while he&#39;s rationing your food and putting you in jail for saying things he finds treasonous or &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;...</p>

<p>Anything can be justified, but doing the right thing doesn&#39;t need to be. Just because some psycho kills you and justifies it in the name of &quot;rights&quot; doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s right, it just means he convinced himself that he is. I think murder is an ultimate violation of human rights. Just because a power hungry little man wants to be King and has poor people convinced that everything he does is right, it is easy to justify murder. You can murder someone for having too much property or because he&#39;s a capitalist or just an &quot;enemy of the people&quot;.</p>

<p>Venezuela is a corrupt shithole, and if you think Chavez is a friend of &quot;the people&quot; or that he will make things any better than <em>puntofijismo</em>, you are a fool.</p>

<p>No, you&#39;re wrong. For all it&#39;s flaws and faults, our system at least <em>pretends</em> to have an open debate at the political level and our society is far more tolerant to dissent. Ever say &quot;Fuck the President&quot;? Did you go to jail? Can you imagine the president trying to repeal his term limit so that he can run indefinitely? There would be fucking riots.
The press is free to criticize the government and, for now, the internet is bursting with opinions and self expression.</p>

<p>I have an extraordinary hatred for what the political system has become but part of me thinks it&#39;s possible to change the system from within, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s naive but it is <em>possible</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that it only <em>pretends</em> to have open debate is the problem I&#39;m referring to. With the chipping away of our civil rights of late, do I think there would be a riot if someone went to jail for saying &#39;Fuck the President?&quot; No. I don&#39;t. There have already been things like this that maybe were talked about, but it seems nothing actually gets done with regard to what the people want. Guantanamo bay and the stripping of rights of the prisoners captured without trial under the guise of terrorism, the Patriot Act as a whole are gross violations of citizen&#39;s rights. Maybe you are unaware, mostly because the same corporations that control the government control the media, but there is next to no freedom of speech in this country anymore because security from &#39;terrorism&#39; (which btw has no legally binding definition) is more important than the individual rights this country was supposed to have been founded on. And don&#39;t get me started on the people behind the scenes that remain the power behind the United States government&#39;s policies regardless of the figurehead elected, I&#39;m sorry Selected, every 4 years. </p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t claim to be an expert on Cuban politics, but I would surmise and I&#39;m sure the person I originally responded to would agree that they have a dictatorship. That is the correct answer is it not?  My argument was that if the leader of Cuba is one that has no term limit and therefore is clearly a dictator, that is still a step above what we have which is a dictator that is invisible to most of the masses who are still drawn in to the &#39;two party system&#39; we have that gives the illusion of choice. My point was that at least they know we have a dictatorship, apparently in America it isn&#39;t obvious to everyone yet that no matter which party is &#39;voted&#39; into power, the policies of tightening up civil liberties and expanding unwarranted wars while looting the taxpayers to the benefit of international bankers remains the same and this is by design.</p>

<p>You&#39;re in a conspiracy subreddit. Yes, you can read things your government does in the newspaper. You can also watch Fox News and learn what your government does. That doesn&#39;t mean you should go watch Fox News and believe its slants/biases and every little thing they say on it.

<p>On top of this the very act of taking information you read from any source at all as factual is a faith based action.

<p>Again, debate the facts, try your best not to sling mud at &#39;conspiracy nuts&#39; because that helps no one.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you watched the entire video, you&#39;d see it wasn&#39;t about the corpse but rather the involvement of several prominent figures, but I appreciate your interest none the less.</p>

<p>One thing I must say is that I am a skeptic just like you; I&#39;m very skeptical of whatever is mainstream - I must research it myself before I assume it to be fact.  Within the realm of science there is little room to breath, so fact &amp; fiction is often easier sort.  The link you posted has a tonne of logical, truthful material, but it also contains disinformation.  Like conspiracy material, it&#39;s littered with half-truths, so there isn&#39;t &#39;one source&#39; for truth.  The page is also missing a lot of critical conspiracy material, such as the bilderberg group, club of rome, trilateral commission, federal reserve, numerology, occult, William Cooper, John Lear, Jim Hoffman (and I could keep going).</p>

<p>I listened to 217 and frankly, it&#39;s a gong show.  It does nothing to backup the claims and does everything to attack &#39;truthers&#39; themselves - it&#39;s everything the original thread [Noam Chomsky] is about (psychological discrediting). </p>

<p>I understand that you and I may never see eye to eye, but I can respect your position and I certainly understand.  I myself was once a full blown &#39;skeptic&#39;, discrediting every conspiracy nut with &#39;science&#39; and &#39;fact&#39; (I was a repeater of information, not a consumer).  You are a self proclaimed &#39;skeptic&#39; and you&#39;re in a &#39;conspiracy&#39; reddit, so try not to &#39;troll&#39; for lack of a better term (like an atheist in a religion forum).</p>

<p>I appreciate your response and candor though, being divided yet remaining civil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny you should mention Chomsky&#39;s tendency to falsely generalize as I personally wouldn&#39;t believe everything he says either, but I feel this aspect of his work means something different than what you probably think it does. I think of Chomsky as a gate keeper, either he is purposely misleading or he is simply unaware he is spreading disinformation (at least partially). There is a grain of truth in most everything and it&#39;s up to each individual to discern what is there truth. Also, Kudos for having a civil debate in an often uncivil subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will have to watch this when I get home but I think I&#39;m with you on this OP. </p>

<p>Basically there&#39;s a stigma around conspiracy theories, or hypothesis, where anyone who mentions them gets labeled by the society we live in. </p>

<p>First of all who wants to live by the rules of society instead of being themselves? </p>

<p>Second, I hate how you can easily discuss science, hypothesize freely with your friends about space or history but if you start to do the same about government and new world orders you get labeled. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t see any reason for the labeling. If you just consider the simple truths that organized crime exists in all levels of society because all humans are created equal and there is no such thing as better than someone else or blue blooded nobility. If you only consider this, then it won&#39;t be so outrageous that evil world powers do exist and most of them don&#39;t have any police force to control them. </p>

<p>All we can really do is hypothesize on what they are doing, how and why. </p>

<p>Interesting that you should mention this, because it seems to me that making up statistics is only one of a palette of techniques used to dishonestly support arguments. The statistic I gave above is clearly rhetorical, but what&#39;s more disturbing is the fact that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> seems quite prone to the types of distortions you seem to be decrying: making up &#39;facts&#39; from incomplete evidence, repeating unsupported claims, fixating on obscure details while overlooking the big picture, conveniently leaving out satisfactory explanations, making sweeping claims about so-called illuminati figures, promoting vague insinuations through vivid imagery, making inappropriate comparisons, the list goes on...</p>

<p>My only gripe with, sorry, &quot;conspiracy&quot; theories, is that they bring attention to a dark underlying problem, that few of us can do much about except increase awareness. To me, they feel like living 911 over and over. Each time I end up feeling scared and down; feeling that the powers that be are so powerful. </p>

<p>Now what&#39;s strange about that, is that it sounds like something what the &quot;powers that be&quot; would create to make us think that they are all powerful. Are &quot;they&quot; using our innate curiosity to delve deeper and deeper into &quot;conspiracies&quot; as a tool to deliver their unchanging message?</p>

<p>Their message: Be afraid. We are far more powerful than you. You are alone.</p>

<p>And as Neo said...</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>To conclude, would we be better spending our time investigating ways to to become more personally powerful. Example: how can uncontrollable anxiety be expelled from the body, for good? </p>

<p>&quot;Fear&quot; is their tool to control us; we just need a tool to control our fear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a matter of snobbery.  The entire point of language is standardization, what you wrote isn&#39;t english... it&#39;s english words but that&#39;s it.</p>
