<p>So instead of people seeing Wikileaks as some kinda organization that&#39;s leaking documents to increase accountability, they see it as some kinda radical group of extremists lead by a anti-American rapist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The morons at CNN (can&#39;t remember who it was exactly) were crying about how Assange was being put up in a &quot;mansion&quot; with and &quot;extensive wine collection&quot; and they were pissed that he would still have access to the internet because &quot;that&#39;s how he perpetrated his crimes&quot;. The guy was jailed for the rape allegations, not anything related to Wikileaks. I think this is part of the reason he is in jail - to confuse people into believing that he&#39;s in jail for the leaks (because they can&#39;t actually jail him for that), and discourage others from following in his footsteps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thing is, regardless of where he goes in Europe it&#39;ll be Britain&#39;s decision if he gets extradited, because we&#39;re the original arresting country. </p>

<p>America will probably try and get Assange on espionage charges, but as far as I know that carries a potential death penalty. We won&#39;t extradite him if there&#39;s a danger to his life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Britain arrested Assange on behalf of Sweden (he is not accused of anything in the UK). If Britain extradites him to Sweden and new charges appear from the US, then technically they can extradite him. It would be different if he was accused of something in the UK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not how it works here. If we send him to Sweden then we decide where he goes (if any where) after that. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter where the charges originate, we are the first extradition country, so it&#39;s our decision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not so sure and neither is Assanges legal defence (according to news reports). It would entirely depend on the precise extradition treaty between Sweden and the UK.</p>

<p>Hope you are right.</p>
