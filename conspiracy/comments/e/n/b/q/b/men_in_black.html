       Alright, so this is less of a scary story as it is unexplained and just eerie.
      </p>
      <p>
       My brother was in his early twenties and had a child with this girl that lived about 15 minutes out of town from where we lived. Due to visitation, my brother got to see him every other weekend. At this same time, I was 14 and just had gotten my learner's permit (this is in South Dakota btw, which has a really young driving age). Well one of the times, my mother and brother thought it would be alright to let me drive them to get my nephew, so that is what we did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now note that this evening fell at the end of Fall and just before winter. There was no snow on the ground but the temperature was extremely low and the wind was extremely strong, I mean this was the type of weather that would take the breath from you because its so cold. One would be crazy to stand out in it even if they were dressed for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though there was an interstate that we could have used, my mother thought it would be best to drive on this older highway that runs parallel to the interstate. On our way back, just before we got to our hometown, we noticed something strange. There had seemed to be this black car, fairly new for the time and of decent make (Mercedes perhaps), that was pulled off to the right side of the road, its trunk was open and this odd figure was standing behind it. This would seem like a normal situation except the figure was just standing there as if locked in this position, nothing moving on its body except for this bright white hair covering its face and blowing violently in the strong winds. It was facing towards a field across the road from its car. This person or whatever it was looked so odd... it wasn't holding itself to block from the cold and wind, instead it just stood there, like a manikin with its hands held out in front of it and curled up like it were a dead body with rigor mortis or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shocked, confused, and really curious, my mother and brother tell me to slow down the car so we can get a good look and see if this...thing...needed help. So I slow down and we conspicuously look at this thing, like a family looking at wild animals on a trail or something, and we notice that it's really short, skinny, and frail, like an old woman...and its extremely white hair just seemed so peculiar. We tried to get a good look at its face, but the wind was blowing its hair and covering it like I mentioned...and it didn't even acknowledge us... it just stood there completely still aside from the wind blowing its black clothes and white hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well anyways, we agreed that it was bizarre and decided to drive around and see if we could get another look. This time we happened to look at the field it was facing across the street. I don't know how we could have missed it, but what we saw were these two, quite tall, figures dressed in black trench coats a little way into the field standing about 20 yards away from each other. They too were just standing there, in this blustering cold! But the oddest part of it all was that one of them was flying a black kite. We couldn't make anything out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       After driving by this scene a couple times, car pulled over, trunk open, strange elderly-looking white-haired thing standing by the trunk, and two tall trench-coat donned people flying a black kite. All of this in some of the most unbearable weather that I can remember, and this is South Dakota mind you... We decided it was best to just let it be and go home, we did have a baby with us and he was getting fussy. I now wish we had gotten out, though, because I will never be able to figure out the mystery that was this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you've read this far, does anyone have a clue of what this could have been? After reading the Mothman Prophecies by John Keel, there was a mention of the fabled men in black, and the way it was mentioned made me think of this event. In the book the Men in Black (not the Will Smith kind, but the kind they are based after, and way more creepy) are described as travelling in threes and a short, white-haired person is usually the one leading it...pretty close to what we saw that night. This was probably the most odd event of my life.

       Since Dr. Wickerts has assumed charge of the Swedish UFO
investigation all reports are thoroughly investigated.  I  spoke
to a number of people who had already been  carefully  inter-
viewed by  FOA officials. The notorious Men  In Black have
also been  active  in Scandinavia  for years,  dashing about  in
big black cars and, on occasion, warning civilian  researchers
to  drop  their  investigations. Phantom  photographers have
also turned  up  there, appearing unexpectedly to snap pictures
of witnesses or investigators, then  darting away. There have
to  this  the growing  number  of  stories  of  witnesses who  in- 
nocently stopped to aid what appeared to he a fellow motorist 
in distress,  only  to he suddenly  attacked  by  Men  In  Black 
types who grimly warn them  to keep quiet about something 
they  saw previously.  It is easy  to  conclude  that  driving  can

       Well, that might just have been what they wanted passerby's to see. If you read about it in the Mothman Prophecies there might be some truth to it and it may be their actual M.O. In my opinion, what you saw probably wasn't what was actually there. The kite was probably a U.F.O. and the guys standing there were probably "aliens" or holograms. Too far out there? I've read stranger accounts, though, which is where I get this idea from. Also, someone I trust once recounted a somewhat similar story to me about these 'men in black'. She was waiting to be seated at a restaurant with a huge amount of other people who were all, for some reason, sticking to the walls of the room except for three businessmen who stood in the middle. There were two large ones and small strange-looking one...kind of like what you described...O.K., so they were talking to each other in the middle of the room and strangely it seemed like no one except for her noticed them. I forget exactly what happened but she said it was weird looking at them straight on, but when she looked at them out of the corner of her eye she saw that the two large ones were reptilian-looking humanoids. After that she said, and rightly so, that she was afraid to look at them. So, maybe it was best that you didn't get out of the car and mess with them. She said they seemed malevolent. Anyway, if that stories true, and I believe it is then that suggests that they have cloaking and holographic abilities which might explain what you saw. What part of North Dakota did you live in at the time?
