<p>Something was so drastically different on 9/11 that caused the WTC, a modern building built to withstand a crash from an airliner, to completely collapse into dust while the integrity of the Empire State Building was not affected, 14 people died.</p>

<p>One event liquefies steel and pulverizes a building.  The other barely a dent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wasn&#39;t really one imho, thanks for the stepping stone though. This is a serious question, you don&#39;t have to have any other instances drawn to scale of that of WTC for my question (hence why i used them as reference), a relative ratio to the size of the plane and fuel it was carrying would suffice as a logical comparison of the events.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I&#39;ll also reaffirm my personal beliefs on the subject now; they knew it was coming and let it happen to further their own agenda.</p>

<p>I just look at the science and the physics of how the buildings came down, and it does make sense to me. Building 7 has also been explained too. In fact pretty much all of the popular claims regarding 911 conspiracy have been debunked, demolitions, explosives, missiles at the pentagon.. The truth really is out there if you choose to seek it.</p>

<p>Think about the physics involved and exactly what were talking about here. Fly a fully loaded 767 into a sky scraper, and have it impact 20 floors below the top level (or in that general range). Additionally, have the building not have a retaining inner concrete core due to budgeting issues during construction. Two things can&#39;t be in the same place at the same time, so of course you get a catastrophic explosion of jet fuel on impact, lighting everything else on fire. The steel weakens and bends, and gives way. Now think about the amount of weight involved when considering the 20 floors above the explosion site in this example. Where is that weight going? Especially without a concrete retaining core, that weight is definitely going down. How long will it take? Depends on a myriad of factors, but an educated guess would be &#39;slower than terminal velocity of the structure&#39;.</p>

<p>This example, though only an example, coincides and fits well with what happened on 911.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what happened to the 20 floor &#39;cubes&#39; (for lack of a better word)?  Apparently they fell onto the floors below, causing each to fail successively and create an even larger &#39;top mass&#39; that continued to crush the floors below in a cascading manner.  Yet there was no large top mass seen in the wreckage of the buildings.  Nearly all of the concrete was reduced to powder.  The steel was reduced to small sections, some of which exploded outward with such velocities that they impaled themselves on neighboring buildings.  I might buy a &#39;pancake&#39; expelling some office contents out of windows during a collapse but I find it much harder to imagine that scenario causing the violent expulsion of steel beams.  These are merely a few questions/concerns I have.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve listened to architects and engineers defend the official story and I&#39;ve listened to architects and engineers question it.  It seems that those on the official story side have an attitude of &quot;We&#39;ve explained everything.  It&#39;s in our reports.  We don&#39;t have to answer further questions.  We don&#39;t have to explain discrepancies.  You seem like a traitor/terrorist supporter/anti-Semite/ect. for asking these questions anyway so why don&#39;t you just zip it?&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you are specifically speaking of the group known as <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">The Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth</a>, they have been massively debunked and in my opinion are a hub of misinformation, a conspiracy within themselves. You can scroll through the lists of registered A&amp;E people on that site, and when you attempt to source them, you always come across discrepancies, such as 1) Said person is not actually a professional in their field, but has a PhD in some unrelated field, 2) Said person is not an expert in any field, 3) Said person doesn&#39;t even exist.</p>

<p>As for your other questions, I&#39;ll say those scenarios are completely possible and explainable. But me alone saying that won&#39;t &#39;prove it&#39;, as it were. However, when someone makes a claim of conspiracy, the opus of proving it falls on them to prove it, not for others to disprove it. </p>

<p>Thank you for not directing that last comment on me. My insult-o-meter did begin to rise until I saw the last bit. It felt directed, to be honest. I and many others would not actually say such things. But when I am faced with something that somebody calls a fact, that has actually been disproven and argued to oblivion, that is the point that I begin to get impatient with a conversation. I&#39;m not saying you are doing this. Its things like freefall velocity claims that really grind my gears.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/er4md/history_channel_did_a_great_documentary_a_few/">posted a documentary</a> in r/conspiracy about an hour ago, that looks at both sides of the body of claims pertaining to 9/11. Maybe, check it out, if you have time this Christmas? I have a feeling it will answer some of the questions you have. :)</p>

<p>Upvoted in good spirit and for bringing something to the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just watched the doc...</p>

<p>I have to say that it went like this:   Present (Clearly False) Conspiracy Theory---&gt;Retort with (Clearly True) &quot;Expert Response&quot;.</p>

<p>I enjoyed watching the show and thank you for the link but it seemed VERY one-sided to me.  There were several instances where, instead of relying upon facts, the producers simply implied that to challenge the official story was just too darn insulting to the survivors.  Likewise there was one point where the younger of the two Popular Mechanics spokespeople simply said, &quot;Yeah...the official spokespeople will be coming out with more official evidence in a few months&quot;.  (Apparently this doc is from the 1st half of the last decade).</p>

<p>I thank you for the link and enjoyed the program as a piece of entertainment but it did strike me as a piece of pro-official-story propaganda.  Again, I say that as someone who is not willing to go as far as you are in regards to my opinion of what happened on 9-11, though I may be willing to go further in regards to my opinion as to what <em>may have happened</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I can understand some of their anger. You know, present a physicist with something in physics that is clearly wrong but demonstrates some sort of conspiracy, and he may just get insulted. Especially if half of his country believes in the conspiracy factor.</p>

<p>Emotions really do run high on both ends of this debate. It didn&#39;t feel like a one sided thing to me. It felt to me at the end of it all that it was still an open investigation. Personal preferences, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll try to check that doc out.  </p>

<p>For me there are so many questions and they aren&#39;t all related to engineering.  The thing is...I am not even prepared to say what you said...that the attacks were &#39;allowed to happen&#39;.</p>

<p>Still, the incredible failure of the air-defense system on 9-11 is troubling.  The fact that the Pentagon has anti-aircraft defenses on-site and that they were not utilized is troubling.  Paper docs from the center of the explosions surviving fires that melted steel and then surviving subsequent collapses in time to be held in front of news cameras the day after the event is troubling.  There are just so many troubling questions.  I am not a hardcore &#39;truther&#39;.   I am just someone who was sickened by what happened and thinks that asking questions, however ignorant or tiring they may be, can only serve the purpose of truth in the long run.  </p>

<p>Questions are healthy.  Debate is healthy.  Dismissive comments, insults, and labeling dissenters as insane, ignorant, or traitors is not healthy--and this goes for both sides of an argument.  (Again, this last paragraph is not directed at Dr. House but at people on both sides of this or any argument who seek to belittle and dismiss the other side rather than to debate and possibly enlighten).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats very interesting that they didn&#39;t shoot down the plane when it was known to be heading for the pentagon. I really do wonder why they didn&#39;t. I do know from what I&#39;ve seen that there was a lot of chaos that day. The hijackers had turned off the transponders, and there were hundreds of planes in the air. So, though it is acceptable to postulate that they couldn&#39;t have seen the plane coming for the pentagon at a distance, I do not find it an acceptable excuse that when the plane was surely headed for them, and they saw it coming, they did not engage it, via anti aircraft SAM&#39;s, or some other means because of some reason. Once they saw it visibly and knew it was coming, why was nothing done?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. Perhaps they did not have enough time. However I also must be careful here in rational reasoning to not assume &#39;perhaps they have enough time&#39; means &#39;they really didn&#39;t have enough time&#39;.</p>

<p>I had heard of the paper docs surviving from near the impact site both in the pentagon and in the wtc impacts. I have however, been unable to properly find and source these documents. You would think they would be in a museum being honored somewhere. If they did survive, then that in itself is little short of a miracle - but at the same time, we always have forms of debris, and though most paper would undoubtedly be destroyed in such a massively chaotic event, Its plausible to actually assume that some would be leftover in the resulting debris. That however, is a personal assumption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pointing at the direction of which they fell into. The conspiracy theory claim is that the building fell directly into its own footprint and that is evidence that it was a demolition. In fact, you just debated away that point of the conspiracy theory. Buildings are designed so that if they come down, they come straight down. Of course, you cannot possibly expect a designer to design a 100+ story building to fall directly into its own footprint as a safety precaution of sorts if the structure is to ever fail, but what that designer can do is design a structure that falls <em>towards</em> its own footprint.</p>

With light objects, such as a piece of paper, that force can be wind resistance. With more massive objects then that will not be sufficient.

<p>Furthermore, you are yet to comprehend basic physics.  You apparantly do not share my love of Jenga, so construct yourself a mini skyscraper (design it as you wish) and make it fall straight down.  It doesn&#39;t happen unless you take support out in a very specific &amp; precise manner.</p>

<p>To your puddle of steel video:
Things can remain VERY hot after being covered up with dust/sand/gravel/debris. Jet fuel and other burning things CAN and HAVE melted steel. I have worked on a mining operation before and once when lightning caught a 3 story wood pile on fire the company covered it with sand, and then uncovered 5 years later and the wood piles were still hot and even catching fire. After 5 years the sand had kept it <em>that</em> well insulated. It could easily happen in 6 weeks covered by that amount of material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said the WTC was made of Jenga blocks. However, YOU seem to think so because you keep comparing them! My point is that they are quite different, and they would be regardless of scale. </p>

<p>A Jenga tower falls (and would fall regardless of size) to the side because a frictional force from a lower level pulls it to the SIDE. Also, jenga blocks (for the purposes of this thought experiment) are solid and non-collapsible. They have nowhere to go but to the side.</p>

<p>The WTC, unlike a jenga set, consists of floors. Each floor has walls, a ceiling and a floor. It is (mostly) hollow, and is thus able to collapse into itself. This is how when a force is applied from above, it is able to collapse into itself and allow it to fall DOWNWARD. </p>

My comparison above  used physics in a very basic manner you pretty much just ignored it, remained close-minded and stuck to your guns. </p>

<p>I just want to leave you with the idea that perhaps you seriously, seriously need to consider the fact that the floors on a skyscraper are effectively hollow. A better comparison instead of a Jenga set is a house of cards. If a lower level weakened and buckled, each level above would exert a downward force and collapse downwards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>huh? No, he had a degree in biology and <em>electrical</em> engineering. I&#39;m not even up to his arguments but you must admit he is <em>not</em> an expert on building collapses...or anything remotely related to it. With that in mind, nothing he says carries any more weight than if you said it yourself. Find an actual expert that agrees with you and we can go from there.</p>

<p>Address that first. As for his arguments:</p>

<p>The &quot;squibs&quot; <em>could</em> have been the floors above collapsing and sending debris out through the path of least resistance. This would be through the broken windows, which is why they shot out in little puffs. Of course it <em>could</em> have been explosives. Because by looking at the video you can&#39;t reasonably prove one over the other, those cancel each other out.  </p>

<p>&quot;No convincing and detailed account&quot; - that&#39;s subjective. It may have been massively convincing and very detailed for some people, obviously not for others. That&#39;s not an argument but he focused
on that for a while so I included it.</p>

<p>&quot;Physical evidence destroyed illegally&quot; - Not familiar with that, which law was broken? I have a feeling you&#39;re going to cite something about the need to keep evidence from a crime, but that&#39;s
for the courts to determine if the suspect before them played a part in it. Suppose they kept the whole damn building, would it make the case against the people that orchestrated the attack any
stronger? Do you suppose a conversation in court going something like &quot;I&#39;ll now direct your attention to the steel beam, listed exibit 12552A, as proof that the defendant attacked the WTC.&quot; ??</p>

<p>&quot;Destroying the evidence preventing investigation&quot; - Imagine, just for a moment, that the attack played out according to the popular story. No evil government or explosives, just exactly by
the story the evil media is putting out.....would anything have been done differently? I&#39;ll answer it for you: Nope. It would have been cleaned up and recycled just the same. So where&#39;s the
special circumstance where them doing &lt;X&gt; automatically leans towards a conspiracy? If you want to get at a legit conspiracy wouldn&#39;t it usually start with someone acting abnormal? </p>

<p>Reference to TWA 800 - Yes, because there was a mystery. Millions of people watched what happened to the towers. There was no mystery to solve. I&#39;m sure a few structural engineers would have liked
to see a few pieces to maybe figure out what they could do differently, but at the moment this video isn&#39;t showing anybody acting strange nor is there a departure from potocol.</p>

<p>&quot;Core should not have collapsed&quot; - Yet the only thing cited is his own opinion. I&#39;d like to see more info on that statement. Should not have collapsed based on having a certain load, weakening
due to heat to some extent, forces of what amount? You can&#39;t simply say &quot;there were metal beams, so it shouldn&#39;t have collapsed!&quot; </p>

<p>I guess that&#39;s the end...wow. I honestly thought there would be some kind of fact in here. Take a moment and really look at each of the arguments. They&#39;re all &quot;here&#39;s something I think is strange so it shouldn&#39;t have happened.&quot; Not a single equation, formula or even rough math. WHERE IS THE ACTUAL SCIENCE?</p>

<p>There was a lot of confusion that day. </p>

<p>However, the FDNY gave up on building 7 and let it burn for hours. They were expecting it to collapse for many hours before it finally did. Various reports went out to news organizations that building 7 was going to collapse. Now, take a statement like that and pass it through various hands before reaching a reporter in front of a camera. The phrase goes from &quot;will collapse, is collapsing&quot; to &quot;has collapsed&quot; rather easily.</p>

<p>And on top of that, building 7 did have a minor collapse before the major one, which was also reported on.</p>

<p>This has been explained quite well, even on youtube, which apparently is a legitimate source to cite from. Its in a video on the internet, therefore... Its true...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct.  Kinetic energy is mass(m) times velocity(v)<sup>2</sup> / 2.</p>

<p>B25 Take Off Weight: 15,200 kg
B25 Cruise Speed: 102 m/s
(15,200 * 102<sup>2</sup> J) / 2 = 79 mJ</p>

<p>767 Take Off Weight: 180,000 kG
767 Cruise Speed: 236 m/s
(180,000 * 236<sup>2)</sup> / 2 = 500 mJ</p>

<p>Or a bit over 6 times the kinetic energy.  In any event, though the impact of the aircraft did do significant damage to weight-bearing columns, and the weight-bearing skin of the Twin Towers, the collapse was ultimately caused by the wide-spread fires created by the rapid spreading of fuel.  As a normal building fire spreads, fuel is exhausted in other parts.  Thus, the building is able to transfer loads.  In the WTC, this was not possible since the crash immediately ignited fires throughout the structure.  The same was not true in the Empire State Building crash, as the aircraft carried significantly less fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what happened to the 20 floor &#39;cubes&#39; (for lack of a better word)?  Apparently they fell onto the floors below, causing each to fail successively and create an even larger &#39;top mass&#39; that continued to crush the floors below in a cascading manner.  Yet there was no large top mass seen in the wreckage of the buildings.  Nearly all of the concrete was reduced to powder.  The steel was reduced to small sections, some of which exploded outward with such velocities that they impaled themselves on neighboring buildings.  I might buy a &#39;pancake&#39; expelling some office contents out of windows during a collapse but I find it much harder to imagine that scenario causing the violent expulsion of steel beams.  These are merely a few questions/concerns I have.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve listened to architects and engineers defend the official story and I&#39;ve listened to architects and engineers question it.  It seems that those on the official story side have an attitude of &quot;We&#39;ve explained everything.  It&#39;s in our reports.  We don&#39;t have to answer further questions.  We don&#39;t have to explain discrepancies.  You seem like a traitor/terrorist supporter/anti-Semite/ect. for asking these questions anyway so why don&#39;t you just zip it?&quot;.

<p>There was a lot of confusion that day. </p>

<p>However, the FDNY gave up on building 7 and let it burn for hours. They were expecting it to collapse for many hours before it finally did. Various reports went out to news organizations that building 7 was going to collapse. Now, take a statement like that and pass it through various hands before reaching a reporter in front of a camera. The phrase goes from &quot;will collapse, is collapsing&quot; to &quot;has collapsed&quot; rather easily.</p>

<p>And on top of that, building 7 did have a minor collapse before the major one, which was also reported on.</p>

<p>This has been explained quite well, even on youtube, which apparently is a legitimate source to cite from. Its in a video on the internet, therefore... Its true...?</p>

My comparison above  used physics in a very basic manner you pretty much just ignored it, remained close-minded and stuck to your guns. </p>

<p>I just want to leave you with the idea that perhaps you seriously, seriously need to consider the fact that the floors on a skyscraper are effectively hollow. A better comparison instead of a Jenga set is a house of cards. If a lower level weakened and buckled, each level above would exert a downward force and collapse downwards.</p>
