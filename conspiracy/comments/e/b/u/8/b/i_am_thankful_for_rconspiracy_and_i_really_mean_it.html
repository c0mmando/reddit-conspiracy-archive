I am not extreme into &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot; but when they couldn&#39;t answer my questions or have intelligent input into the issues I was talking about they simply belittled me and grouped me with the extreme &quot;THE MOON IS HOLLOW&quot; theories. I really just want to thank everyone here for being open minded and respectful towards other members and their views. The main issue with the world is the fact that honor, respect, and honesty mean nothing these days and those are the main virtues of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.

<p>Yes, stolen staplers and tax incompetence are technically both &quot;white collar&quot; crimes. Dang, you got me.
Insider trading through IS conspiracy in most cases.</p>

<p>You actually said &quot;I can&#39;t think of too many white collar crimes that don&#39;t involve some level of conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>As this is patently false, I see that you&#39;ve given up defending it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you need to find yourself a girlfriend.</p>

<p>Virtually every white collar crime you see reported by the news involves conspiracy of some kind.</p>

<p>Now you might have called up your lawyer uncle after hearing this so you could get a list of inane, unremarkable white collar crimes that go unreported because they have no bearing on anyone other than the individuals involved (stationary theft, tax incompetence, driving the corporate car to disneyland) to &quot;win&quot; at the internet, but that doesn&#39;t change what&#39;s being argued here.</p>

<p>Conspiracy is a daily occurrence and dictates our news, our lives &amp; our politics more than any other criminal activity. Nearly ever major news event we&#39;ve seen has been the product of conspiracy - from those who conspired to destroy the WTC to those who conspired to lie the the US and the world about WMDs to those who conspired to give housing loans to low earners to those who conspired to cut costs on gulf oil drills, or those who conspired to torture prisoners...</p>

<p>(that&#39;s the world politics section of the paper... the rest is more about those who conspired to inside trade, or those who conspired to cover up corporate practices in soda factories etc)</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;re passionate about the important things (asserting you&#39;re &quot;right&quot; over the internet) but there are bigger things going on in the world, and most of them involve conspiracy.</p>

<p>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have more important things to do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clearly also very important to undermine some of the biggest stories we&#39;ve seen by ALSO mentioning that billy the assistant junior manager steals staplers from the stationary cupboard without co-conspirator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am okay with conspiracy theories, as long as they are theories I will listen with an open mind. The only time people deserve to be belittled is when they talk about conspiracy theories as if they are supported facts (they arent).  There does exist motivation for 9/11 to be an inside job, is this a supported fact though? no! should you be treated poorly for wanting to talk about the possibility? No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this info is what i consider basic and critical to gaining a more appropriate, accurate, and effective knowledge-base, for every American Individual--though it can&#39;t hurt for non-Americans to know it, too...this is the knowledge and fact base of a conspiracy...</p>

<hr/>

<p>the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT <em>is</em> a CORP, as is your STATE GOV a CORP, as well as your municipality...(you might do well to look into the defintions of &quot;de jure,&quot; and de facto,&quot; as relates to government and governance...)</p>

<p>your SS&quot; (if you&#39;re in the US, a slightly different named # in other &quot;western,&quot; so-called Free World nations) <em>is</em> a &quot;warehousing/inventory&quot; number, whether you, me, or anyone likes that fact or not--it&#39;s the way it is...</p>

<p>see <a href="/r/CommonLaw/">/r/CommonLaw/</a> subreddit for more informations --&gt;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw/comments/8ttp9/introduction_and_overview_to_the_common_law/">http://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw/comments/8ttp9/introduction_and_overview_to_the_common_law/</a></p>

<p>basically, events stemming from circumstances involved in the Civil War initiated a fundamental change in our Organic form of Self Governance, one in which the Federal CORPGOV took a stronger, <em>far</em> more tyrannical role...this was cemented by events and conditions in the early decades--the entire first 50 years, really--of the 1900&#39;s, beginning with the establishment of the FEDRES banking SYSTEM, and the complete re-organization of our government--h3ll, our very <em>Society</em>, through the &quot;legal&quot;/justice SYSTEM revamp from Common Law basis to Admiralty/Maritime Law in the 1930&#39;s...a good hint at the Truth here--though almost every lawyer will tell you what i&#39;m saying is either a direct lie, or a perversion of the Truth--is that FED court will not allow any &quot;precedent&quot; prior to 1938, the first year the revamping was completely emplaced...that FED SYSTEM has finally trickled down to effect even our local municipal &quot;courts&quot;--and it took most of 40-60 years for that trickling down to so effect, as it had to infiltrate court-by-&quot;court,&quot; judge-by-&quot;judge,&quot; lawyer-by-&quot;lawyer&quot;...</p>

<p>the 13th and 14th amendments have their stories as part of the subversion of our Organic system of Self-Governance to this CORP ran one, as does the 16th, the perversions of the General Welfare and Commerce clauses of the Constitution...several other &quot;changes&quot; do, as well, including the 16th, and the alteration of our very Constitution in small, yet <em>very</em> significant ways...</p>

<p>the point here, and how this all connects to <a href="/r/Conspiracy/">/r/Conspiracy/</a>, btw, is that for several decades the American People have been lied to, deceived, misdirected and manipulated to hide most of the facts here, and tricked into what the Supreme Court calls &quot;willful acquiescience&quot;--our alleged SYSTEM of consent, from which it is <em>extremely</em> difficult to opt-out of without dire consequences, not the least of which is that the SYSTEM, itself, may just begin to, openly <em>and</em> covertly, treat you as an &quot;enemy of the STATE&quot;...many end up dead or imprisoned, though there are success stories...</p>

<p>more to that point is that <em>all</em> of the so-called &quot;Free World&quot;, or Western World, operates in the same, deceitful, manipulated manner, &quot;controlled&quot; by hidden, manipulative individuals and groups to emplace a SYSTEM known as the New World Order--Global Governance...</p>

<p>the &quot;hostile-takeovers&quot; going on around the world, right now--some will be successful, some will not be, or so it will <em>appear</em>--are the end-result of the above limited description of our recent history...though not the EndGame--not <em>quite</em>...</p>

<p>now, i may have been too lite on my narrative in places, and maybe not as &quot;spot-on&quot; in what little detail i&#39;ve made attempt to describe--and i <em>am</em> very close to the actuality of &quot;what&#39;s really gone on&quot;--<strong><em>i highly recommend</em></strong> <strong>perusing the above two Common Law links, as there are more fully fleshed out histories and expositions and essays...so many it will seem over-whelming, and will certainly take more than a day, or even a week or a month, to adequately digest...before that adequate digestion takes place, though, i believe you will find evidence aplenty of the long-lived plans and efforts at our current &quot;hostile-takeover&quot;...and you will be</strong> <strong><em>p1ssed off</em></strong>, <strong>too, and ready to do something to correct &quot;what&#39;s really going on&quot;...</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>facts...found in historical and &quot;legal&quot; reference, at government and academic sites, as well as books and literature, from your local or larger, farther away (ie, Library of Congress) library, book store, or a source for older, out of print books...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>slavery wasn&#39;t the issue--it was a tool for manipulating public opinion during that period, and to sow division, as well...the <em>real</em> issues were, amazingly similar to today, economics and political power in the matter of the States having hierarchy over the Federal government--and the Federal government deciding to overturn that, and, thereby, placing the Individual <em>flatly</em> on the bottom of the &quot;pyramid,&quot; in contrast to the Framers&#39; Intent, which was the People&#39;s Sovereignty (which is from where &quot;Authority&quot; derives), then the States, then the Federal government...the events of the early 1900&#39;s cemented that deal, by the &quot;New Deal&quot;...</p>

<p>i&#39;m as against slavery as you, i imagine--and i am somewhat offended that you seem to imply that i may be for it...slavery was a fact of the times, and many, even among those who <em>participated</em> in it, did not agree with it...it, like the FRN and the FEDRES, of today, was the way things worked, whether one liked that fact, or not...de facto...</p>

<p>if you <em>really</em> know what Freedom is, then you would understand, too, how the changes to our Courts and system of Law were <em>not</em> in the interests of the individual...</p>

<p>as for your find at supreme.justia.com, all that legalese is gobbledy-gook (my tip-o-the-hat nod to turkey-day, here) to me, and i reckon it is so for a reason--and that is so no Self-reasoning man may easily comprehend it, which is in absolute contrast to the intended Nature of our Organic system of Law and Justice...i am certainly unclear as to whether that &quot;precedence&quot; was actually an allowed precedence, or simply in the case, amongst others...i&#39;d imagine one might place pretty much anything in a brief, or filing--it&#39;s whether or not it is allowed to &quot;stand&quot; that is the issue...of course, i am <em>no</em> lawyer...</p>

<p>i am, however, a Self-Owned man, with reasoning ability, and Self-Responsibility, as well...i make attempt to do my own due diligence, and i ask the same of you--or anyone...</p>

<p>as i&#39;ve suggested, peruse the links in my other comment, follow the topics as far as you can, or are willing...</p>

<p>i will continue to look into your cite, above, as well, and see what i can ascertain as to it&#39;s meaning...</p>

<p>peace...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree with the person that &quot;Lubs&quot; Batman. I feel like most of the people in this sub-reddit are pretty good about accepting other peoples views unless they come here to call everyone crazy.</p>

<p>As to the questions they wouldn&#39;t answer if I said anything about 9/11 or what the mainstream media told us about the event they would just deny everything or if I brought up the JFK assassination they&#39;d just say &quot;Well I can tell you who did it and his name is Lee Harvey Oswald&quot;. I just  want to know when questioning anything the mainstream media says became being a tinfoil-hatting crazy person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Granted, they are closed minded, and you sir are open minded. However, do not be soo easily swayed one way or the other. Investigate claims made my conspiracy theorists. Often times, it turns up bunk. I&#39;m not saying JFK or 9/11 was not a conspiracy, but there is a LOT of mis-information out there. A lot. Always be open. Be open to finding the real truth, not just the truth you want to believe in.</p>

<p>Stay strong, brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Btw, they are calling you names, because they can&#39;t argue with you and really don&#39;t know anything more about it than what they are told, they have never looked into it, and probably never will unless you bring it to them, show them the proof, and it may cause them to look into it a little more. I have convinced many people this way.. Start slowly, and build up. Start with the Operation Northwoods article on Wikipedia, and explain to them how Hitler got his money, don&#39;t show them Alex Jones stuff right away as he gets too passionate at times, instead have them watch The Money Masters, it&#39;s free on google video. These instances are all documented and admitted facts, and cannot be disputed just as much as Manson having his followers commit the Tate murders cannot.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope my suggestions are helpful to you.</p>

<p>I posted a thread in conspiracy countering a few claims made about WTC7. After 10 comments I had:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 People calling me a troll</li>
<li>One guy saying I valued faith more than science selectively</li>
<li>One link to an unrelated youtube video, after I&#39;d made a polite request to keep it to the issues discussed in the thread. and I mean literally, a youtube link as a comment, No context, no explanation, just one youtube link. My reply, using an original quoted verfiable source was downvote while this guys youtube link is +3.</li>
<li>Downvotes on <em>all</em> of my comments (even the gone-out-of-my-way-not-to-come-accross-as-an-arsehole perfect etiquette ones) with no rebuttal or recourse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Honour, Respect and Honesty mean fuck all for the majority of <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a>. Honour? well I think dismissing my argument as a troll doesn&#39;t honour me very well. Respect? you don&#39;t downvote well written answers without giving a reason. No respect here. Honesty? blatantly using cropped quotes, selective sources, random youtube videos. No honesty there.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not saying everyone is like this but I&#39;d say a good 3 out of 4 are. I&#39;ve had several wonderful discussions on <a href="/r/conspiracy/">/r/conspiracy/</a> so I&#39;m not gonna let a bad apple spoil the bunch.</p>

<p>&quot;and nice vendetta against me.&quot; - Not yet.</p>

<p>&quot;what actual evidence do you have for the WTC7 &#39;implosion&#39;?&quot; Government sanctioned or other? </p>

<p>&quot;&#39;Free fall&#39; / collapsed in 6 seconds&quot; I counted 9 seconds, but that is still within freefall/near freefall speeds.</p>

<p>&quot;No damage to the building&quot; There was damage, but every photo I&#39;ve seen shows superficial damage. None show catastrophic foundation damage.</p>

<p>&quot;Isolated fires&quot; Yup. 2 floors. Lots of smoke</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;pull it&quot; Not one reasonable explaination I&#39;ve heard.</p>

<p>&quot;BBC early collapse&quot; Hilarious evidence. (evidence and proof are not same)</p>

<p>&quot;other buildings with fires havent collapsed&quot; Nope, not this one. They have collapsed, but not at near freefall after a couple hours.</p>

<p>&quot;most people claim one of these points as irrefutable proof of a controlled demolition&quot; Not me. I consider it evidence and the trail of evidence leads to foreknowledge if not active participation on the part of the state. Terrorists of 9/11 had NORAD stand down. Terrorists since have tried to set their cock on fire. I&#39;m not calling you a troll, I&#39;m saying you&#39;re naive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way to high-jack. I didn&#39;t propose a theory. I pointed out a flawed argument. You then hopped in with a sweeping generalization with no evidence. I couldn&#39;t care less what you&#39;ll &quot;accept&quot; as truth does not depend on you. You got a point to make? Make it and back it up. Are you saying all conspiracies are untrue?

<p>Actually, I don&#39;t think many people think about anything enough to know why they are regarded as &quot;preposterous&quot;.</p>

<p>I think that once people see that something has been declared a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; by media they respect, they will dismiss it as preposterous without any kind of proof whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re shamelessly shifting the argument.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t say &quot;most white collar crimes were conspiracies&quot;.</p>

<p>You actually said &quot;I can&#39;t think of too many white collar crimes that don&#39;t involve some level of conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>As this is patently false, I see that you&#39;ve given up defending it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t understand what i&#39;m &quot;getting at&quot; then you&#39;re not reading. It&#39;s all there. Conspiracy happens on a daily basis. Conspiracy is responsible - OPENLY - for some of the largest news stories of our time.</p>
