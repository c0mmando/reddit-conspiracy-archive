       Little background, my parents love fox news and everything about it, it is the end all to be all of news, and everytime i try and explain an opposite viewpoint or another way of looking at what is being reported on fox news they always say, You think these guys are wrong, you think they just make this stuff up what is it all a conspiracy! (fuck yeah it is!!!  the news is not the news anymore, its controled entertainment)
      </p>
      <p>
       I cant take it anymore, i need solid proof that everything they are being feed through the TV (Fox News Especially, and other news shows as well) is utter propoganda and just plain skewed news!  I beg you, please post some links!!!!  I cant take it anymore!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank You :)
      </p>

       EDIT: I Even posted this as a non-karma submission.  I just want to win this debate against my parents once an for-all!
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: Damn, you guys are amazing!!!  I really am impressed...for so called conspiracy theorists(hahaha, like the MSM media portrays you guys as) you guys are really coming through, and being sensible about it!  Thanks for all the responses...i was really pissed off earlier and for good reason, i hate being wrong, and i like to be prepared before i go into a debate..i feel with your help i have now been brought up to speed and can deal with this in a better light!  Thank You All!

       they'll never believe anything that isn't published by the MSM, so any evidence you find is, by nature, tainted and unverified.  the only ones they will believe are the ones they already trust.  good luck cracking that egg.

       A little late but I've been thinking about this since I saw your post and I found the website I was looking for about corporate media ownership. It's better than the chart I showed earlier:

       . Even if this won't convince your parents, these are good resources to have (:

       seriously if you want some very good documented evidence get a copy of a documentary film called "The Corporation". There is solid and verifiable proof in that movie of Fox lawyers stating that they don't care about news and that "the news is what we say it is" or something to that effect.

       I can see the value in portraying instances or events from a distance or with a certain amount of skepticism..i guess when i approach it, its like confrontational, or a how do you not see what i see.  I think thats what discourages me the most, i always thought they were the smartest people ever, but now its like, man, can you not see through the spin, or the unbalanced approach to portray the news (especially in a certain light)...granted you have to give the news companies their props, they are very good at what they do, but when you study the ins and outs of controled news agenda its easy to spot...and elaborate on...thanks for your response...i will approach the next run in with a little cynicism or from a more distant position.

       I know, that is the thing, i am looking for simple yet obvious examples of how the Main Stream meadia has changed over the years...like the story about the original H1N1 flu back in '78 i believe when cbs did a hit piece on the vacinations and how unsafe they were, the backlash that caused almost put an entire industry out of biz....if that same story ran today, man there would be an uproar about how unsafe and untested that vaccine is!  These are the small but obvious documentaries i am looking for that arent around anymore!  Thanks for your reply.

       I feel your pain.  I don't know what to say about that.  My parents become irate and demand that it be turned off when I've shown some things to them.  They feel pain and they don't know what to do about it.  I can see it charging up in their bodies and their shoulders stiffen.  They don't want to know but its certainly noble to try to reach out.  In the end statistically they will have their money stolen from them somehow by the time that this is all resolved.  Its difficult for me to know that my family will lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in short order and they won't have the consolation to say that they were really living beforehand.  I'm not sure that I can handle the burden of seeing them wiped out and then needing to support them, but today the market is high and they are clueless.

       Does it have something to do with age?  I mean, do you not have enough energy when you get older to fight???  Im just at a loss, there is no fight left...for instance, heres an example..."when you get older your not going to have any social security", or "these democrats are going to run this country into the ground" or "billy oreilly is always right"...its like the facts and logic are just gone, its all just random musings.

       All of this shit that we are experiencing is from years of things being this way.  My brother just died on a motorcycle on Monday.  He was only 19 and he didn't really have an understanding of the consequences.  For your parents the consequences of watching television all of the time is that they lost the ability to discern noise from information.  Now the country is being stolen out from underneath us and it is just another sound byte to them.  There is no wisdom with that damn box only slavery.

       Sad, but true.  It is just another reminder that whatever is said on tv they think has to be true and there is nothing they can do about it...when in fact there is something they can do about...i know i can do something about it by calling my representatives or researching and getting to the root cause of what is happening or talking to my friends and neighbors about what has to be done to change the direction of things.  My future is just as important as theirs!
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it comes down to another thing, what is their generation going to be known for, laying down and not standing up for what this country was founded on...can they not handle freedom anymore, have they done their fair share to keep this country alive and well...maybe but in the last 10 or so years (i feel) the deterioration of this countries freedoms and progress has been so set back and is in such dire danger of collapsing it just irks me that there is not fight left!

This is just one arm of the shadow world government and the most obvious on the surface. It's like blaming the Backstreet Boys for ruining the music industry while ignoring the record execs, managers, publicists and choreographers that work with them (I know, that was a sucky example but it's early and that was the first thing that came to my head :P).

       They will remember the toppling of the statue of Saddam in Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ahmed Chalabi, international financial thug and imbezzeler  was Bush's friend and  sole informant  to the 'fact' that  Iraq had WMD's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chalabi  and his followers had been promised the  leadership of Iraq in return for their cooperation in discovering the WMD's  and reporting them to the Bush administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the statue of Saddam fell on worldwide television,  Chalabi and his followers were made to look like a vast crowd of Iraqi's Cheering at the event . They were soon identified by those of us on the  internetz as Chalabi and his  fellow thugs and the fraud is now widely known. That is one example of what you need and it will come in part from their own memory of the event which was pretty important at the time.The other pictures of the scene tell a different story than the television news did.
 If you need better sources I'm sure they're out there .

       It really digs into the whole media manipulation of democratic societies, and although it is dated (and long), the evidence and examples are great. I doubt whether anyone totally addicted to Faux news will believe any of it, but it is great to be grounded in some facts for your own sake.

       heu buddy, i've been trying for years to make people see that.  i've come to the conclusion that Jesus's words are truth.  Some have eyes yet do not see.  If you read the bible a little bit you will see it tells of those who do not believe in God are automatically with Satan, and satan blinds them from the truth.  Basic rules of engagement I now see.....
of course you can't really tell em that, since they will likely stomp on your words and spite you.  the best you can do is accept them, love them regardless .. pray for them.  peace.
God luck,

       I never before realized that being an atheist automatically makes me a satanist. I just thought it meant I didnt believe in sky monsters, and didnt need an unseen crutch to get through life. Learn something new everyday.

It's like blaming the Backstreet Boys for ruining the music industry while ignoring the record execs, managers, publicists and choreographers that work with them (I know, that was a sucky example but it's early and that was the first thing that came to my head :P).
