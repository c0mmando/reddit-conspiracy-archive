<blockquote>
<p>Jonathan Jay Pollard (born August 7, 1954 in Galveston, Texas) is a former civilian intelligence analyst who was convicted of spying for Israel. He received a life sentence in 1987.</p>

<p>Israel granted Pollard citizenship in 1995, while publicly denying, until 1998, that he was an Israeli spy. Israeli activist groups, as well as high-profile Israeli politicians, have lobbied for his release. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has voiced particularly strong support for Pollard, visiting the convicted spy in prison in 2002.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Julian Paul Assange (born 3 July 1971) is an Australian publisher, journalist, software developer and Internet activist. He is the spokesperson and editor in chief for WikiLeaks, a whistleblower website and conduit for news leaks. Assange has worked as a computer programmer and was a hacker during his youth. He has lived in several countries, and has made public appearances in many parts of the world to speak about freedom of the press, censorship, and investigative journalism .</p>

<p>Assange founded the WikiLeaks website in 2006 and serves on its advisory board. He has published material about extrajudicial killings in Kenya, toxic waste dumping in Africa, Church of Scientology manuals, Guantanamo Bay procedures, and banks such as Kaupthing and Julius Baer. In 2010, he published classified details about American involvement in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. On 28 November 2010, WikiLeaks and its five media partners began publishing secret US diplomatic cables. The White House has called Assange&#39;s release of the diplomatic cables &quot;reckless and dangerous&quot;.</p>

<p>For his work with WikiLeaks, Assange has received public condemnation and calls for his execution as well as glowing praise and accolades. He received a number of awards and nominations, including the 2009 Amnesty International Media Award for publishing material about extrajudicial killings in Kenya and Readers&#39; Choice for Time magazine&#39;s 2010 Person of the Year.</p>

<p>Assange is currently wanted for questioning in Sweden regarding alleged sexual offences, and was arrested in London, England on 7 December 2010. He is currently on bail and under house arrest in England pending an extradition hearing. Assange has denied the allegations and claimed that they are politically motivated.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNA-2_StDRU">Mike Huckabee, Dec 5, 2010, on Chanukah and Israel part 2 of 2</a></p>

<p>mike huckabee stuck to a familiar script.</p>

<p>as you watch the speech, pay attention to this list of </p>

<p><a href="http://australiansforpalestine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tip_report.pdf">25 rules for effective communication</a></p>

<p>and see how many of these rules mike huckabee adheres to.</p>

<p>mike huckabee says that god gave them the land of isreal. the crowd cheers wildly. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hefIti-uFUo">the young man in this video also says god gave land to him. he also says &#39;we killed jesus and we are proud&#39;. who is we? how prevalent is this attitude?</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GF6GzfhHJ4">they allow their young children to behave like this, throwing rocks at old ladies as soldiers look on. where do children get such ideas?</a></p>

<p>once christians understand that mike huckabee is merely parroting <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Frank_Luntz">frank luntz</a> propaganda, </p>

<p>christians should ask &quot;will the real mike huckabee please stand up?&quot; </p>

<p>is mike huckabee <em>with</em> the patriotic american christians or <em>against</em> them?</p>

<p>remember in 2008 when barack obama won in the iowa caucuses on the democratic side?</p>

<p>mike huckabee was the guy who won on the republican side in iowa, but john mccain eventually won the GOP nomination.</p>

<p>mike huckabee is on the short list of names to watch in 2012. he has already demonstrated that he can win in iowa, and he has been on TV more lately, so he has wider name and face recognition.</p>

<p>we see he is sucking up to israeli interests early and often.</p>

<p>we might see something like a huckabee-palin ticket in 2012.</p>

<p>multi reddit for all candidates in the 2012 iowa caucus potus race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i basically agree with you.... that the amount of spotlight on assange is ridiculous in perspective of &quot;justice&quot; compared to other politicians and organizations.  yet. isn&#39;t it a bit laughable to consider mike huckabee or sarah palin as viable candidates? they are far too polarizing.</p>
