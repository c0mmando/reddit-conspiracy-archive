       Let's have one thread contain all the conspiracy claims surrounding the collapse of the buildings on 9/11. Let us ignore the Pentagon for now, and consider it unlikely that the government/forces would unwittingly stage an attack on the Pentagon right around the time that the Twin Towers were attacked. The point being, if the government/forces brought down the towers, then they were also behind the attack on the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       With those assumptions aside [for the purposes of this thread], let us focus on what brought down the 3 buildings in NYC.

       Building 7 collapsed into its own footprint, buckling inward at first. At least one video has someone in authority referring to a decision to "pull" that building. The BBC reported on the collapse before it happened. This is all the evidence you need to prove that at least one building was brought down on purpose. If one building was brought down on purpose, it was pre-wired to go down. If one building was pre-wired to go down, and the other two also collapsed into their own footprints, demolition-style, then we have a reasonable doubt as to the official story. This much is entirely non-controversial, and frankly, is the only case you need to make. All the rest is extra.

       The owner of the building and the firefighter he was talking to? yea, neither of them are in the demolition industry. They meant "pulling out". Even people in the demolition industry don't call it pull. Do you really think the firefighters were in on this, when hundreds of there friends died? Did you not listen to the full tape and how distraught the firefighter was?
      </p>
      <p>
       BBC was in on the conspiracy too? Or did they report that it was going to collapse and someone incorrectly said that it had collapse? But really, the BBC was in on it too?

       I don't know which English YOU speak, but Occam's razor, that sure doesn't sound like he meant to say "pull out," but for some reason instead said, "pull it," and then simply, "pull." And you're more right than you know - Silverstein isn't in the demolition industry.

       Yes.  Just look at what you are proposing - that your hypothesis rests solely upon the interpretation of a single word spoken in an interview.  That is not how science works.  Occam's Razor suggests he
       <strong>
        did
       </strong>
       mean to say "pull out" instead of "pull", as the first doesn't require a massive conspiracy, devoid of evidence, to make any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unworthy of response?  Hardly.  You just can't counter it.  Your whole argument relies on misinterpreting evidence to suit your preconceived ideas, not actually accurately and objectively appraising evidence.

       I can counter it, and I would if I didn't understand how people like you argue. See, first you go off and ask for proof. When somebody offers  something you don't like, you either go microscopic and argue semantics, like you are doing now, or you throw up an orgy of tangents (in this case trying to make it look like I think that the BBC and the brave firefighters who risked their lives on that day were in on the EVIL PLOT) and hope that I take the bait. If I do, you will simply go through whatever I offer, find the weakest link from among every point that I've very considerately taken the time to address for you, and laser in on that as if that were the lone point that this whole argument relies on. And if you can cast doubt on that weakest link, it makes it look like my "proof" (which means nothing anyway, proof is by its very nature subjective) is fallacious. By this time, we're three iterations down and everybody has forgotten about my original point (the admitted - and filmed! - decision by Silverstein to demolish the building in order to contain the fire better and the statistically significant prevalence of psychic ability among BBC anchors) and you no longer have to address it.
      </p>

       And I'm sorry, but you fail Occam's razor.

       Occam's razor suggests that the most simple explanation is the correct one.  Well, 19 terrorists hijacking planes is a lot more simple than a conspiracy involving thousands of people across the world all maintaining perfect silence for nearly 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silverstein didn't admit to demolishing the building.  I don't know why you claim he did, as there is no evidence to back up that claim.  Occam's razor suggests he simply meant "pull out", as in the effort to save the building, not "pull" as in to demolish a building by pulling it to the ground using steel cables (which is what "pull" means in the demolition business - it has nothing to do with explosives, and there were certainly no cables attached to the building, as it is impossible to demolish a building that size and of that construction using cables, and have it collapse.  It would topple over).  Oh, and also tell me why Larry Silverstein would
       <strong>
        tell the world about the conspiracy
       </strong>
       ??  Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of the whole damned thing?  Wouldn't actual investigative journalists picked up on that and blown the story wide open?  In your weird world it's only internet freedom fighters who are capable of that, apparently.  How delusional can you get?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the BBC footage, well, video delays and incorrect reports will make some strange TV.  Do you even remember what the news was like on that day?  Every single news station around the world was flooded with incorrect news reports, people claiming things happening that simply weren't.  Using that as evidence is intellectually dishonest, as it's anything but evidence.  As it is, that is not evidence of anything.  Again, Occam's Razor is on
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       side on this one.  A TV company screwing up is a lot simpler an explanation than said conspiracy, that now seems to involve the hundreds of workers at BBC News as well!
      </p>
      <p>
       No truther has ever offered any actual evidence to support their claims,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       show how the official story is not true.  Not one.  Seriously, it's all just conjecture that can easily be explained away by far less complicated, lengthy, and illogical explanations than your conspiracy hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems you have no idea what Occam's Razor suggests.  It is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The principle of Occam's Razor recommends selecting the competing hypothesis that makes the fewest new assumptions (aka postulates, entities). It is also important that the two hypotheses be equal in other respects; for instance, they must both sufficiently explain available data in the first place. It is in this sense that Occam's razor is usually understood.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Read that.  Now read it again.  Now read what you have been writing.  Now feel embarrassed.  Now try to make up an excuse how a conspiracy of
       <strong>
        thousands
       </strong>
       of people is less complicated than a terrorist plot involving no more than 50 people.  Good fucking luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's you who has a problem with Occam's razor, and you just demonstrated that
       <em>
        like a boss
       </em>
       .  Thanks!

       I talked with Occam today and he agrees that you and your friends are trolling and I really should stop feeding you. You're not interested in actually settling anything, all you want is to "win."

       So you can't even refute any of my points?  What "catchphrase" is that?  Occam's razor?  It's merely a name given perfectly logical behaviour - namely
       <strong>
        not jumping to complex conclusions when far simpler ones exist
       </strong>
       .  Is "evidence" a catchphrase too?  Idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should I believe you?  You can't even be bothered to get any evidence to support your
       <strong>
        faith
       </strong>
       .  That's the attitude that makes people laugh at truthers.  9/11 has become a religion for you; you are incapable and unwilling to even entertain the idea that it wasn't a conspiracy, and that has relegated you to the realms of the terminally irrational.  You are like a Christian screaming that they
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       Jesus is the son of God, but you can't prove a damned thing yet you want some sort of free pass and skip all that pesky "evidence" stuff, and simply
       <strong>
        demand
       </strong>
       people believe you.  There is no rational way you could reach the conclusions you have, which is endemic in the 9/11 truth movement.  It's intrinsically irrational, fueled by paranoia, arrogance, and a lack of objectivity.  You use the same techniques as young Earth creationists, for fuck's sake.  That should tell you something about the tenability of your position!
      </p>
      <p>
       You've not offered anything of value, just conjecture that you insist people must believe as fact, and then get all pissy like an 8-year-old girl when people point out you have nothing.

       The post implicates the BBC. That's hilarious. The poster is so delusional
they think the media was in on it. The idea that the firefighter was also in cahoots is priceless. He probably knew more than a dozen people who died, he had men in building 7, which they had thoroughly evacuated of employees by then, and they had no water pressure and a defeated man power to fight agaisnt the fire. What else is someone going to do? Leave his men in there for no reason but to die? No, he wanted to pull his men out and do so at the blessing of the owner so that the city isn't liable. The owner could care less about the building, he was covered. Perhaps the owner knew the guy on the phone wasn't in the building, in which case saying pulling out may not make much sense, so he just said pull it, the it could refer to anything, but considering that he doesn't know demolition, and the last people who would be demoing buildings are the firefighters, then I'm inclined to think the it means the operation or rescue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, why would the firefighters or the owner keep it secret? So what if they demolished the building? It was beyond repair, moreso than the bankers trust building, and a fire that could not be contained. No one would blame them, because no one died in the collapse of that building.

       Why does a plane need to go straight into the building for it to not be an inside job? Don't just back up and say you weren't implying that, I'm curious as to why that observation, if it is actually accurate, is suspect.

       It's simple really, I'm not going to click a link and search for evidence for your broad claim that it was an inside job. It's like demanding an atheist to read the bible to show that god doesn't exist, it's unnessesary and a waste of time. The onus is on

       And points 1 and 2 could not have been determined by the terrrorists as well? If a journalist can figure out how to bring the building down, I'm sure someone who wants to do just that would figure it out too.

       They were not both exact, because they were measure by the impact zones. Assuming a margin of error, and how it is more difficult to hit a narrow target dead on without last moment adjustments, then it may even be less likely that it was coincidental, and more likely realistic.

       Here is some more food for thought. If you were piloting a plane, you may think your wings may miss the building unless you tilt the plane. It's hard to tell from a pilot's vantage point. Also consider that your "evidence" consists of an edited-rendered picture of the 2nd tower and a completely unsupported paintshop picture of the first impact zone. Really?

       My quietness is concession? That's desperate. Sorry if I didn't give this thread my undivided attention. As for an agenda, rofl. So typical and egotistical to think any contrary opinions to your own are due to some covert agenda being carried out by hundreds of debunkers. Seriously, if I was a part of a conspiracy, I'd blow the whistle and cash in.

       A picture created without any evidence to corroborate it is useless. I tried looking for the original photos that they used on the page but couldn't find it. The methodology to create the images has to be public in order to verify the accuracy of the representative image. Someone would have done a lot if work to get an accurate image, so they should have posted it.

       You seem to think that these planes weren't flown remotely by humans, but rather by machine. No human can fly a plane, joystick or cockpit, to hit a precise degree. Your implication from the claim that two exact crash formations were intentional, then it had to have been guided by a computer. Consider that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If engineers actually calculated that 30 degrees would cause the necessary damage to carry out the plan, then there seems to be a clear science on how to make the towers collapse. We can't even agree on what temperature fire needs to be to eventually render a beam unstable in this design, yet someone figured out the exact plane angle and explosives needed. Any engineer worth his salt would point out the impossibility of this task. No one would design such an elaborate demolition with such a high chance of failure. Explosives are 
the only fool proof and known/proven way to intentionally bring a building down, so creating a hugely sophisticated program to navigate the planes to accurately hit the buildings at a certain angle sounds like a giant waste of time. Just fly the damn thing into the building and set the explosives off. Btw what's the point of waiting for the buildings to "collapse", and why go against intuition and bring down the 2nd building first.

       I didn't realize you posted so recently, perhaps my editfor the quote makes a bit more sense. Perhaps you missed the point that there was never a case that a large modern passenger jet hit a very tall high rise, so why would someone intent on bringing a building down hedge their bet that a plane was capable of bringing a building down? You wouldn't, meaning they would have had adequate explosives, and the angle of the plane is meaningless rabble.

       You're the one going around saying they "pulled" WTC 7 as if that's proof of a conspiracy when you don't even know what "pulled" means... Not what was actually intended, which was to evacuate the building, but the actual demolition definition of pulling a building. You're wasting your own time making arguments you don't even know the meaning of. That's golden. You're just what they want: An ignorant mouthpiece for the movement.

       If anyone cares to hear my story, and glean from it what they may, here goes.
I was on the ferry from Harborside, Jersey city when the first plane hit, and the explosion was like an enormous 'wump'. I wasn't looking up, but at my palm pilot, and didn't hear a plane flying, but I wasn't really paying attention anyway. We were halfway across teh water at this time, and by the time we reached the port, people were pretty hysterical. A black woman was crying and said a helicopter hit the building, but I knew that couldn't be the case unless it was one of those military 'huey's' with the twin rotors. I honestly thought it was a bomb and tried to call the rest of my coworkers who worked on the 58th floor of tower 2, but, everything was busy.
I figured I wouldn't be allowed into my building, so I went to my girlfriends apartment which was 2 blocks from the towers right on the water. When I reached her front door, I heard the second explosion. But now my senses were prepared, hearing screams, and sirens, but I still never heard the second plane. What I'm trying to say is, even being that close, I could still be swayed by any story, except that when I got up to my GF's apartment, we immediately sat in front of the TV to watch what was literally happening outside of her window. I actually heard a reporter say "Could it be another pilot error" and I wanted to mega face palm, I mean at this point, without even speaking to a person, I knew we were under attack somehow.
My GF and I didn't really know what to do, so we made coffee and tried to get what we could from the TV. Not long later, we heard another explosion, I thought at the time the biggest yet, since I was inside at this time, and then a series of more "whump" like explosions, and then a a pile of dust that enveloped her whole apartment building. When the dust cleared, I told my GF to pack what she could, we were getting out of there.
 little while later, we were outside and running back towards teh ferry and hopefully to my car on the other side. Luckily, right outside her apartment, ferrys were lined up to take people out, you just had to climb oer the guard rails and jump to the decks. As we were making our way, we hear another whump, and I turned to see the top of tower 1 tilt, then fall, slowly now in my memory, and pancake, just like it was reported. I never heard more than thde initial explosion, but just heavy, loud slammings as each floor hit the next. I was spared being covered in that dust pile as well, since we were behind her building heading to the water.
Sorry about my grammar or whatever, and I thought I was over this, but apparently not, since my eyes are filled with tears and I really can't have this at work.

       Man, that's brutal story. I can't imagine how fucking crazy it was in NYC that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in elementary school when it happened, and it wasn't until I became an adult that I could really think about how it must have felt to be able to comprehend the events of that day. However, how it must have felt to have been there, no fucking idea. It's really something a lot of people don't experience emotionally because it happened so far away and we don't know anyone who was really affected. When I think about how I may talk about the collapse of the towers and such, such discussion may sound horrendously barbaric for those who lost friends that day.

       They can easily be explained by the massive amounts of high-pressure air, and incredible forces, that were caused by the pancaking floors.  If it wasn't the air, please explain how all the air in the towers (about 90-95% of the total volume) escaped without leaving a trace.  And if it wasn't the forces involved, please show how all the forces experienced by the towers somehow only managed to affect things vertically  The witnessed phenomenon doesn't imply

       Quickly is relative.  Motion requires force.  High-speed motion of massive objects requires considerable force.  The high-speed change in direction of massive objects, along with the explosion of them, requires force.  How are you accounting for that force?  Specifically, show me the math.

       That is a big ol' mess of conjecture devoid of substantiating evidence.  The floors didn't pancake?  What happened to them?  We can see in the video that they pancaked.  And air pressure can indeed disintegrate things, and rather violently.  These are well-known physical effects.

       Two massive skyscrapers fell.  You don't think that contains a lot of force?  Really?  You haven't even shown any evidence of explosives, and already you're asking

       Friction (from air) can cause objects to disintegrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Floors did pancake, how can you even remotely suggest they didn't? There would still be a building standing there if the floors didn't pancake.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not know the material of those objects. It could have been one large sheet of dry wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't use pseudo math to make your point. With unsophisticated cameras, poor quality, and 1 angle, you cannot actually verify the speeds of any of the falling objects that are in the OP's links.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to conclude, pancaking floors causing pressure wave of air to propel objects in a horizontal manner would occur. Lastly, one instance of an object that appeared to break apart in one poor quality video does not mean it was a massive object (and not just a desk) that contained explosives that were detonated without an electrical charge. What is more likely, is that a weak section of the building that was violently ripped off the side of the building because of the forces involved in a collapse, was crumbled and weak, and the friction of air caused it to disintegrate.

       Replace "many" with "one". Dust blooms billowing off pieces that are moving through the air do happen. Coat a brittle cracker with dust, break it in half, and observe the pieces fly with the dust flying off it.

       Edit: Rereading part two, it also sounds like a topic for another thread. Simply put, the building wasn't already collapsing. The explosives were detonated in a progressive fashion, in an attempt to make it seem natural. Regardless, that is not related to the high-speed and massive exploding projectiles.

       Your claim was "that explosives were used to bring down the towers".
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The only relevant implication of a claim that a projectile traveled at unusually high speeds is the claim that it was propelled by an explosive force. Your first link made the assumption that there is no other way for a projectile to achieve high speeds (if it in fact did) other than to be propelled by man-made explosive forces.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The only relevant implication of a claim that a projectile (one) exploded due to explosives, would be the claim that explosives were used and it decided to detonate without an electrical charge. Your second link made the assumption that falling debris does not break a part as it falls, shortly after its violent tearing from the original structure.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So considering #2 has nothing to do with what actually caused the collapse of the tower, but was a single projectile that may have broken up in mid air, or, falsely concluded as having been blown up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, let us focus on #1 claim, and that is that explosives were used because projectiles allegedly traveling at high horizontal speeds could only be attained had man-made explosives propelled it. Therefore, we can assume that if explosives did in fact cause the collapse of the tower, then we should see an explosion where the collapse began. We don't.

       My claim is simply that massive high-speed projectiles were videotaped by many sources exploding in the air.  That implies that explosives were present.  I showed you a video tape of a massive projectile exploding.  There are many more.  Air did not cause this as another poster implies.  Simply breaking up does not explain the change in direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The presence of massive high speed projectiles that were exploding implies simply that massive parts of the tower were exploding.  It's on film for the world to see.  You are not disputing it.  If you want to discuss your assumptions on another thread, go for it.  But, per your rules, this thread is not for discussing your assumptions; lets discuss the massive, high-speed, exploding projectiles here.

      <p>
       You made many assumptions here, and they are too odd for me to want to bother with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the existence of massive high-speed projectiles exploding is evidence that there was explosives able to break up massive parts of the building.

       You cannot deduce from a single video, from your second link, that there was an explosion inside that object that split the object into more than one piece, because it may not have been a single object, nor can you tell the difference between speed changes and direction from the perspective of one angle. Air is friction, and it will cause weak objects to disintegrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the one making assumptions that they had to be man-made explosives for a projectile to break a part.  There wasn't any explosion. Do you see any red, fire, sparks, anything that resembles an explosion in that sequence shot of that one projectile splitting up? You are the one making assumptions, I'm not. I am offering equally valid baseless claims that require no explosives to be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if a projectile did explode due to man-made explosives, it doesn't mean that it was massive nor a strong object. It could have been a flying desk, we wouldn't know because it was 1 camera and it was zoomed up.

       Where is your evidence that it was steel?
Where is your evidence that it was travelling 60mph? You cannot determine that from 1 angle. In addition, why can't it not travel 60mph? With all the bending, pancaking, destruction going on, why can't an object be propelled in a horizontal manner. Take a pencil, put it on a table with either point facing upwards, apply pressure, observe snap and the ridiculous speed it does so.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot distinguish speed and direction changes from 1 perspective.

      <p>
       You cannot determine that it was from man-made explosives because the quality is shitty and it is indistinguishable from an object (which if it were steel/concrete, could have been weakened from the collapse) disintegrating due to air friction.

       Massive high-speed projectiles were videotaped by many sources exploding in the air?  Maybe it was a massive  piece of pie, that was exploding in the air.  Point is, it was massive, and it exploded.  You can't deny that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of your post fails to mention the massive exploding projectiles that were traveling at very high speeds.

       It didn't explode. It disintegrated. Where in any of the videos do you see an object exploding? I cannot see it. I am denying the existence of an explosion anywhere in any of the footages I've seen, because they're is no evidence, none, zip, nadda, that it wasn't simply disintegration.

        Look at this picture for a second

       .  There are many of those comet like projectiles that are smoking.  Why are they smoking?  What's energy source is causing that?  What caused the concrete to disintegrate?
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't the case of walls falling down.  This is massive explosion of a building.  Gravity isn't the energy at work here;  It takes force to project these objects.  It takes energy to make them smoke.  All the potential energy in the building was converted to real energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom right most falling objects are huge steel beams, that are smoking.  What do you think causes that?  Them simply falling off the building?

       Just to clear up what that arrow is pointing to:  That is air escaping at the sky lobby.  It escaped there because the local elevators all terminate there, and when the floors above pancaked, the compressed air followed the path of least resistance, which lead it down to the sky lobbies.  That air then escaped out down the corridor of the sky lobby and out of the window, which is what one would expect to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know the beams are smoking?  How do you know that's not dust?  We know there was a shit-tonne of dust at the scene of the collapse, which is to be expected when a building collapses.  You have to show how it's not dust, and you have to show where the dust went (and where it subsequently re-appeared from), as we
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       there was massive amounts of dust, as the surrounding area was caked in
       <strong>
        feet
       </strong>
       of the stuff in some places.  By your logic the dust that was in the tower disappeared before the building collapsed, then steel beams defied the laws of physics and chemistry and caught fire, smoking on the way down, and then when they hit all that fire suddenly turned back into dust.  You fail at science.
      </p>
      <p>
       How you can say it's an explosion is beyond me.  There is no evidence to say that
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Your interpretation is based on flawed assumptions devoid of substantiating evidence.

       Sorry to break the rules so quickly, but
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUB4j0n2UDU">
        here is a video

       that explains what actually constitutes evidence.  Anything less is conjecture, and
       <em>

       If you have a problem with what I posted, you have a problem with the scientific method, and are engaging in
       <strong>
        religion

       <strong>
        objective investigation

       "Open minded" doesn't mean "believe what you want".  You think you are being open-minded, but you are being closed-minded, by the very virtue of not wanting to learn anything that contradicts your preconceived ideas of what happened on 9/11.
      </p>

       No, that's what

        I'm prolific because I like a good debate, and truthers are ridiculously-easy pickings, due to the intrinsically-irrational nature of their position
       </li>
       <li>
        I'm focussed on
        <strong>
         rational thinking
        </strong>
        , not supporting any particular viewpoint or opinion.  You should be, too, as that's what grown-ups do.  Normal people want to find the truth, not just support their preconceptions of the world.  If truthers had solid evidence, I'd be the biggest truther out there.  But they don't, so I'm not.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       "Hard" evidence is what normal people simply call "evidence", and is required to assume anything.  You skipped that and leapt straight to belief, which means you have supplanted evidence with
       <strong>
        faith
       </strong>
       , and made a religion.  Congratulations.

       You seem to not know what those words mean.  I don't have faith - everything I believe about 9/11 is backed up by evidence.  How is supporting rational thinking supporting a viewpoint?  Your argument lacks logic and consistency.  The information the government provided can be independently verified.  That's what the scientific method is.  The official story stands up to scrutiny - whereas truthers' various hypotheses are based on paranoia and conjecture.  You are ignoring proper science and paying attention to guesswork.  That is faith.  It's like creationism - they try to claims science is somehow flawed, and then demand to be taken seriously when they make stuff up to explain what they want to believe.  That is not how rational adults work.  It's funny you're using a computer, which could only exist because of the scientific method, to tell me how the scientific method doesn't work.  Oh, it's delicious.

       Science has very little to do with why the WTC buildings came down?  Ha!  Context?  Yes - that context is called
       <strong>
        science
       </strong>
       .  The details are not suspicious, as they have been thoroughly explained.  Whether you have the education to know a sound argument when you see one is not a problem with the facts, but a problem with your lackluster education.

       This is the sort of thing that bugs the shit out of me about truthers. For them, anyone who points out that there's no evidence of controlled demolition is instantly a right-wing, Bush-loving fanatic or a paid shill.

       Let's get something very, very straight, here: Most people, regardless of politics, reject the truther claims. I'm a liberal, meaning I live in the reality-based community, because reality has a well-known liberal bias.

       No, no. I don't think he actually IS Tucker Carlson.

       And I'm not a "truther," bro. I just can't stand Tucker Carlson.

         Sounds like a good topic for another thread.

         One wouldn't want to do that, yet it seems unavoidable. It's something that simply happened, regardless of intent.

       Edit: Rereading part two, it also sounds like a topic for another thread. Simply put, the building wasn't already collapsing. The explosives were detonated in a progressive fashion, in an attempt to make it seem natural. Regardless, that is not related to the high-speed and massive exploding projectiles.

       Yes.  Just look at what you are proposing - that your hypothesis rests solely upon the interpretation of a single word spoken in an interview.  That is not how science works.  Occam's Razor suggests he
       <strong>
        did
       </strong>
       mean to say "pull out" instead of "pull", as the first doesn't require a massive conspiracy, devoid of evidence, to make any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unworthy of response?  Hardly.  You just can't counter it.  Your whole argument relies on misinterpreting evidence to suit your preconceived ideas, not actually accurately and objectively appraising evidence.

       The post implicates the BBC. That's hilarious. The poster is so delusional
they think the media was in on it. The idea that the firefighter was also in cahoots is priceless. He probably knew more than a dozen people who died, he had men in building 7, which they had thoroughly evacuated of employees by then, and they had no water pressure and a defeated man power to fight agaisnt the fire. What else is someone going to do? Leave his men in there for no reason but to die? No, he wanted to pull his men out and do so at the blessing of the owner so that the city isn't liable. The owner could care less about the building, he was covered. Perhaps the owner knew the guy on the phone wasn't in the building, in which case saying pulling out may not make much sense, so he just said pull it, the it could refer to anything, but considering that he doesn't know demolition, and the last people who would be demoing buildings are the firefighters, then I'm inclined to think the it means the operation or rescue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, why would the firefighters or the owner keep it secret? So what if they demolished the building? It was beyond repair, moreso than the bankers trust building, and a fire that could not be contained. No one would blame them, because no one died in the collapse of that building.

       Intent is tangential to the point at hand. All you requested was evidence of claims. You are misdirecting again. I find your tactics... disappointingly predictable.

       You're the one going around saying they "pulled" WTC 7 as if that's proof of a conspiracy when you don't even know what "pulled" means... Not what was actually intended, which was to evacuate the building, but the actual demolition definition of pulling a building. You're wasting your own time making arguments you don't even know the meaning of. That's golden. You're just what they want: An ignorant mouthpiece for the movement. You couldn't even be bothered to do some independent research to answer my simple request last week.

       So how does a spelling error on my part prove you aren't an idiot?
