Has it worked regarding the &quot;war on drugs&quot;?  That depends on your definition of &quot;work&quot;; I&#39;m sure the DEA thinks prohibition works great, but that&#39;s because it pays their bills...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with this is if they are going to ban Four Lokos for sending students to the ER, they should be banning ALL alcoholic drinks that have alcohol and energy drinks in them. I&#39;m completely against that, but they can&#39;t get rid of one and not the other. There&#39;s a bar in my town called Bomb Bar, and the back bar is lined with various alcohols and various flavors of energy drinks. How the hell can they justify getting rid of Four Lokos but not address all the other drinks that combine alcohol and energy drinks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the main issue is the taste-to-alcohol ratio, if you get my meaning. What I&#39;m trying to say is that most malt alcohol beverages with a similar alcohol content (in the 10-12% range) have a much stronger taste and are therefore harder to drink. Four Loko, from what I&#39;ve heard, basically tastes like soda. This makes it easier for less experienced drinkers (ie your typical over-confident frat boy/girl) to go overboard.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, people are going to binge drink and put themselves into the hospital no matter what they&#39;re drinking. But this drink in particular makes it easier for someone who doesn&#39;t know their limits to get alcohol poisoning. At least that&#39;s how it looks to me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except it isn&#39;t company B, it&#39;s an outcry from thousands of citizens, and they aren&#39;t using lobbyists. And there isn&#39;t a competitor to caffeine drinks, there&#39;s just other versions of alcohol (and caffeine drinks were already a tiny, tiny, tiny section of the alcohol business anyway, and if it was a competitor to Four Loko then there&#39;s more money to be made from making your own caffeine drink and promoting it with your larger company). And there is no Mr. C. </p>

<p>So, while you&#39;re describing how bans happen often in this country&#39;s history, there&#39;s basically nothing you&#39;re saying makes any sense in this situation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the ban on 4loko is ridiculous. I have mixed feelings on the drink itself, I think they are kind of gross, but they are really cheap and get you drunk.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy that they&#39;re acting like it&#39;s 4lokos fault that kids are staying up and drinking more. &quot;They give you energy, keeping you up allowing you to drink more than you should blahhh blah blah...&quot; acting as if 4loko were gone, then people wouldn&#39;t drink irresponsibly. I&#39;ve honestly never blacked out from a 4loko, and TONS of people in my area drink them, and I never see anyone any more drunk from them than the people who are drinking beer or liquor</p>

<p>next step they&#39;re not going to let people buy Red Bull and vodka together</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who can &quot;handle their shit&quot; and has not blacked out since I was fourteen years old, I wound up in jail randomly after drinking three, Four Loko&#39;s, two Guinness&#39;s, half a bottle of Vermouth, half a bottle of Grand Marnier and three bud lights.</p>

<p>This would be a normal night of drinking for me, but the buzz a Four Loko gave me, was not normal. It was awful. Good riddance, but as other users are stating, prohibition won&#39;t work.</p>

I am trying to find a link for a damn statistic, but if the news covered all of those hospitalizations we would be banning all alcohol too...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. 4lokos beverages are dangerous not only because of its highly concentrated caffeine and alchohol content, but also because of its affordability. For under 8 dollars one could get completely trashed off a 4loko. It falls under the category of a dangerous substance, IMO. I do not believe it is for economic reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that they should! It is ridiculous that because a small part of the population can&#39;t show self restraint with a substance that the rest of the population has to pay the price. Unfortunately this has always been the case and always will be. Prohibition, TSA, Marijuana... Its called being a responsible adult. Ugh.</p>
