       Personally I don't care how bad it is for us, prohibition wont work to prevent it's use.  Did it work for alcohol?  Has it worked regarding the "war on drugs"?  That depends on your definition of "work"; I'm sure the DEA thinks prohibition works great, but that's because it pays their bills...

       My problem with this is if they are going to ban Four Lokos for sending students to the ER, they should be banning ALL alcoholic drinks that have alcohol and energy drinks in them. I'm completely against that, but they can't get rid of one and not the other. There's a bar in my town called Bomb Bar, and the back bar is lined with various alcohols and various flavors of energy drinks. How the hell can they justify getting rid of Four Lokos but not address all the other drinks that combine alcohol and energy drinks?

       I think the main issue is the taste-to-alcohol ratio, if you get my meaning. What I'm trying to say is that most malt alcohol beverages with a similar alcohol content (in the 10-12% range) have a much stronger taste and are therefore harder to drink. Four Loko, from what I've heard, basically tastes like soda. This makes it easier for less experienced drinkers (ie your typical over-confident frat boy/girl) to go overboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes down to it, people are going to binge drink and put themselves into the hospital no matter what they're drinking. But this drink in particular makes it easier for someone who doesn't know their limits to get alcohol poisoning. At least that's how it looks to me

       As someone who has had a four loko, i gotta say, as fruity as it is you can easily taste how strong it is.  My 2 cents.

       You really need to go taste one... They do not "trick" you in any way. The taste of alcohol is VERY obvious, and behind the taste of alcohol is ble.

       This does not taste good, people abuse it like they would shots. Not for the taste, but for the results.

       Except it isn't company B, it's an outcry from thousands of citizens, and they aren't using lobbyists. And there isn't a competitor to caffeine drinks, there's just other versions of alcohol (and caffeine drinks were already a tiny, tiny, tiny section of the alcohol business anyway, and if it was a competitor to Four Loko then there's more money to be made from making your own caffeine drink and promoting it with your larger company). And there is no Mr. C.
      </p>

       So, while you're describing how bans happen often in this country's history, there's basically nothing you're saying makes any sense in this situation.

       We have a history of demonizing alcohol and other enjoyable things in this country, so it is really easy for the media to jump the gun when it comes to drinking since the basics of outrage are already there.

       I think the ban on 4loko is ridiculous. I have mixed feelings on the drink itself, I think they are kind of gross, but they are really cheap and get you drunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's crazy that they're acting like it's 4lokos fault that kids are staying up and drinking more. "They give you energy, keeping you up allowing you to drink more than you should blahhh blah blah..." acting as if 4loko were gone, then people wouldn't drink irresponsibly. I've honestly never blacked out from a 4loko, and TONS of people in my area drink them, and I never see anyone any more drunk from them than the people who are drinking beer or liquor

       Alcopop has had many incarnations. It is aimed mainly at the younger generation. This particular incarnation is pretty sinister in that it is sized to encourage excess 2 servings in a non resealable package? Mixing caffeine and alcohol for wired drunks seriously?

       Lawsuit in a can, the ban is a favor to Phusion. They will reformulate and re-brand don't worry.

       The ban is going to be on "caffeinated alcoholic beverages" so I don't think a re-brand will save them. They should just put massive amounts of B vitamins in their alcoholic beverages, like a 5-hour energy.

       I don't think that they should! It is ridiculous that because a small part of the population can't show self restraint with a substance that the rest of the population has to pay the price. Unfortunately this has always been the case and always will be. Prohibition, TSA, Marijuana... Its called being a responsible adult. Ugh.

       Anheiser Busch (not looking up spelling) bought sparks for millions then months later a SF DA threatened law suiting so they changed the formula. The original sparks people get to count their money and the big biz is stuck with some problem beverage.  Conspiracy doubtful.

       As someone who can "handle their shit" and has not blacked out since I was fourteen years old, I wound up in jail randomly after drinking three, Four Loko's, two Guinness's, half a bottle of Vermouth, half a bottle of Grand Marnier and three bud lights.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be a normal night of drinking for me, but the buzz a Four Loko gave me, was not normal. It was awful. Good riddance, but as other users are stating, prohibition won't work.

       Nope. 4lokos beverages are dangerous not only because of its highly concentrated caffeine and alchohol content, but also because of its affordability. For under 8 dollars one could get completely trashed off a 4loko. It falls under the category of a dangerous substance, IMO. I do not believe it is for economic reasons.

       I really think this whole banning thing is a self promotion.

       Four Loko are instigating the ban themselves to make the brand seem more edgy.

       I don't think that they should! It is ridiculous that because a small part of the population can't show self restraint with a substance that the rest of the population has to pay the price. Unfortunately this has always been the case and always will be. Prohibition, TSA, Marijuana... Its called being a responsible adult. Ugh.

       So they're also out to outlaw micro-brews? These big businesses don't have to worry about a small-time Phusions drink company cutting into business. There's a recession going on, alcohol sales are at their highest.
