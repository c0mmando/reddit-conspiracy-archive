       President Kennedy summed it up pretty nicely:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed." - RIP JFK

       You can see it everyday, we're getting closer and closer, It's going to be horrible and it's going to be amazing. The conspiracy started from the beginning, Jesus and other's were used and abused to manipulate the people of course .
      </p>
      <p>
       A bloodline from ancient Egypt is most likely the cause for this and everything "bad". They're behind 9/11, JFK, Global Banking, and The social manipulation of people. This social Manipulation has lead us to the cancer that we are today. They work through the things like CIA, Governments, and Major Corporations. Most people consider them Devil worshipers -pentagrams and symbology are all over, from landmarks to tv shows....they're main goal/belief is a one world gov/currency/religion. The religion they want is for everyone to believe  that everyone can become gods with an understanding of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Naming names and getting a little crazier....
People have traced these bloodlines and come to the conclusion Prince Williams will be crowned king somehow and that he may actually be a clone of some sorts - most likely in 2015 but something will happen around the 2012 London Olympics were he'll rise up.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the world will have most likely been through Banking disaster, War,  nukes, the people will submit to the new world order as it looks like a champion will be leading it. The UNs agenda 21 will set the guidelines of what the world should be. Of course this grand deception will involve ufos, aliens, and new technology as it will need to be very convincing. ( summing all this up in a couple paragraphs...not the best)
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked for 5 year through this stuff...... for 4 years I hated most people for being "sheep". I finally found the answer that Jesus, Budda, and others were talking about in the last year though. It's very simple, Your here to live your life for others. Become Ego-less, live fearless, place no judgment on others, love thyself and love others no matter what they do or have done. God is Love. This is simply what they do not want you to know, they want you to keep fighting the republican, keep being racist, keep buying the most expensive cars - they want you distracted from yourself and the truth.  Love to all!

       Where basically since the beginning of "Creation", we (humanity), with the aide of an inter-dimensional troll named Lucifer, have been given the opportunity to learn about free will and see how our choices eventually manifest into our current suck-ass state of affairs we refer to as "reality".

       So when you see all this gnarly Orwellian/ surveillance state creeping up on one side, chaos and riots and other outrageous morally questionable weirdness in the name of security and safety on the other side, and a poisonous, shitty, distracting environment all over the place, people generally not being excellent to each other, ect. 
It is just a bunch of smoke and mirrors obscuring the serpent guarding the world tree.

       With fertility levels dropping in both men and women, they'll be left to pick who gets to reproduce through IVF and who does not. Since everyone in the Western world is getting fat, they'll blame obesity for it, which will be partly accurate, but an incomplete story (as is the case with just about anything they tell you).

       World states, authorities, companies and special interest groups will commit crimes in order to profit and continue their survival. And will use political puppets to keep them from getting punished.

       Most wars are based on lies, instigated on populations via manipulation of emotions like patriotism, fear and xenophobia, and their goal is profit from weapons sales, strategic power grabs, mpopualion control and weapons research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secret societies, hidden groups, fraternities, all those might use old traditions and symbolic ceremonials to entice members and give them a cohesiveness based on 'feeling above everyone else' but in the end it's just clubs and groups keeping to maintain old blood lines and 'convenient' people in power. Always, it's the money.

       There is no 'They Vs. Us'. There are many groups fighting for power all the time. Alliances, treachery, simulation are tools in the daily war. There is no single group that 'did 9/11'.

       ... and where is the unbroken chain of evidence supporting it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many conspiracy theories, unfortunately, rely on broken chains of evidence, which renders them conjecture at most.  Without an unbroken chain, no action can be taken against any theory, and no one can be expected to believe in it without wanting to.  Nothing is proven with broken chains of evidence.

       So apparently at least 3 people seem to think evidential support of something they claim to be true is unnecessary.  Unless you hold a conspiracy theory as some sort of religious doctrine, it must have evidence in support of it for rational people to believe it.  That's why courts rely on evidence, and not just baseless conjecture.
