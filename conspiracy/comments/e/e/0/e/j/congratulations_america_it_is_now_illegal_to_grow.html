        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the passing of the Senate Bill 510 &quot;Food Safety and Modernization Act&quot; the American people take one step closer to being completely dependent on the system; a system that may collapse at any time. Under this it would make it illegal for individuals to grow their own gardens and save heirloom seeds. For those who don&#39;t know, heirloom seeds are natural crop seeds which can be saved from a previous harvest and replanted for the next growing season. </p>

<p>Monsanto essentially has a monopoly on genetically modified seeds. The difference between the Monsanto seeds and natural heirloom seeds is that the genetically modified seeds cannot be fruitfully replanted. You cannot save the seeds from a GM harvest and replant them because the seeds are genetically modified to be &quot;duds.&quot;</p>

<p>So there you have it America. Don&#39;t believe me? look it up yourself. Today November 30, 2010 this bill passed the senate 73-25. It must now go back to the House to be rectified and then onto the Presidents desk. </p>

<p>Under this bill it will essentially make it illegal for the American people to be self sufficient. We now live in a country that is in a state of total and absolute tyranny. </p>

<p>EDIT: Many of you have asked exactly which parts of this bill support the statement made above</p>

<p>follow this link and read for yourself: <a href="http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/4548062-sb-510-a-food-safety-bill-or-something-else-entirely">http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/4548062-sb-510-a-food-safety-bill-or-something-else-entirely</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said profit.  You are talking about gross income.  As far as I know, a company&#39;s &quot;income&quot; as the government sees it is profit, meaning net, not gross.  Companies don&#39;t get taxed on money paid out to employees, supplies, or rent.  Those things are not considered part of the company&#39;s income.</p>

<p>You are attacking me about the wrong numbers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not na√Øve about the plight of farmers.  Nor am I speaking hypothetically.  I grew up in farmland, in very, very rural Wisconsin.  The farmers I knew were either poor or worked secondary jobs to be middle class.  I remember my friends&#39; families dumping their milk in protest to rGBH.  I guarantee you that not a single one of those farms brought in six figures of profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. So you are reading the bill in conjunction with FDA views. I can see where seeds are being covered, however I am still missing how heirloom seeds are being covered in an individual household. </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to understand how this bill would stop one from being able to grow their own garden at home and use the seeds from that garden for planting later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the bill addresses that specifically, but in 2009 one of the source listed by the FDA as &quot;sources of contamination&quot; was seed cleaning equipment. This is the equipment used to collect to the seeds from the plant material so the farmer can collect and then save what is now classified as Organic or Heirloom seed for the next year. I think the fear is that with seed cleaners being wiped out and even prosecuted such as Steve Hixon ( <a href="http://aidindia.org/main/content/view/758/355/">http://aidindia.org/main/content/view/758/355/</a> ).When seed cleaners get wiped out, that means all clean seed production ends and all we have left are the hybrid seeds that have patents and laws regarding their usage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at what Monsanto did to India.  They claimed their GM seeds would produce higher yields of cotton per harvest.  And be resistant to a worms and diseases.  Because they claimed this they were able to QUADRUPLE the price for the cotton seed.  Because of this the farmers had to take out large loans in order to afford the seed.  When it came time to harvest what happened?  A large percentage of the crop either got the worms or produced much lesser yields than the organic seeds.  </p>

<p>Throwing Indian farmers into debt because they couldn&#39;t save some of the GM seeds to try and replant without having to go buy more seeds due to them being 1 generational seeds.  In India there are only two ways to get out of debt, sell your land or commit suicide.</p>

<p>Wash, rinse, repeat.  The point of all this is the people who have all the power DONT do this for the interest of the consumer.  99% of the corporation(s) command pyramid could really want to help you, but that top 1% control the overall agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, in counter point this bill seems to give more oversight capability to the Govt in regards to irresponsible food growers / distributors. The legalese of the bill involving personal food growth involves &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; over the growth / sale of tainted foods. In other words, don&#39;t poison your friends and family and your self-sustainment plans will be G2G. I plan to read the full bill outside of work, but my skimming has found no evidence that this bill will enact over reaching powers to your own garden. The most likely genesis for the hyperbole about our stolen gardening liberties could likely be found on a Monsanto employees computer as they are more negatively affected by this bills passage than you or I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The real reasons for doing this are not to prevent people from having gardens. It&#39;s to allow Monsanto and other seed patent holders (yes they exist) to totally monopolize the source of our food. Farmers don&#39;t have to buy seed each year, as they can save seed from their crops. Monsanto has seeds that produce plants that do not produce viable seeds - this means that farmers must buy seed each growing season. This bill makes it illegal for farmers to use natural processes to grow food.</p>

<p>the bill states explicitly that the produce standards ``shall not apply to produce that is produced by an individual for personal consumption.&#39;&#39; There is also an exemption for small farmers, small facilities, as they sell their products at roadside stands, farmers markets, places such as those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>|state of total and absolute tyranny</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about what you are talking about now, but Monsanto has sued for ages for farmers <em>reusing</em> GM seeds and has been succesful. Before &quot;duds&quot; existed, if a farmer kept the seed, cleaned it, sold it, traded it, or in any way made it appear that they intended to reuse it without having permission from Monsanto they would be sued. There is nothing wrong with that... Monsanto designed those seeds like any other product and own a copyright on them. Monsanto licenses these guys to use the seeds but not keep offspring, and they guys who violate that are breaking the law. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t use Monsanto seeds. If you don&#39;t like it get pissed off at Monsanto, get pissed off at their lobyists, and get pissed off at the politicians that let the lobyists effect their decisions. But saying things like we live in a state of total and absolute tyranny is idiotic, even under the assumption that this one law is tyrannical. </p>

<p>When they move to outlaw guns, while it&#39;s wrong and I disagree with it, I don&#39;t shout from rooftops that the government wants burgalers to rape my kids and they are all a bunch of satan worshipers that want to shit in my well-water. </p>

<p>For a moment, try to give a clear and concise argument while not taking it to the extreme where people stop listening to you. If all you want is to rile up the people who already agree with you, then mission accomplished but that doesnt solve a damn thing. You&#39;ve probably changed the opinion of 0 people. Speaking as someone who is on the fence and hasn&#39;t made a decision on the subject for lack of details (but who is leaning in your direction because i&#39;ve heard so many things about monsanto and I just met you) all you&#39;ve done is annoyed me.</p>

<p>You might as well go into <a href="/r/guns">/r/guns</a> and shout, GUNS RULE! PEOPLE WHO TRY TO TAKE MY GUNS AWAY SUCK! YEEEEEAAAAAAAAAH!</p>

<p>I think tonight i&#39;ll use your method with my wife. She makes this god awful noise to scratch her throat, &quot;CCCCCCCCCCCOIIIIIIIIIII!&quot;. When she does it, instead of asking her to stop, i&#39;m going to jump up, tear my shirt off, scream tyrant in her face. Run into the kids room and yell that Mommy is evil to the core, every cell in her body is hellbent on holding us back. Then I will delete her from facebook, get a lawyer, and hit the gym.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The intention is obvious.  During WWII the government wanted people to produce food, as much as possible so they associated patriotism, Americanism and high morals with having a garden.  Now they want us to not grow food so they have passed legislation which shades it with grey and associates it with criminality.</p>

<p>The government and military knows that we will soon be hungry so instead of employing the Bernaysian psychologists to encourage us to grow food they are working against us.  For example; They could create a commercial which shows a man in his backyard working his barbecue and he throws some onions on and his friend says, &quot;Wow those smell delicious.  I can&#39;t wait to eat those while watching the game&quot; and he says &quot;Made them myself&quot; and then wifey comes in and says &quot;I did it&quot; and then the other wifey says &quot;Wow I want to see your garden&quot;.  And you know what about ten thousand people would go buy some seed packets later that week.</p>

<p>but noes they want us to fucking starve on while waiting for our food coupons to buy Monsanto produce.</p>

<p>They want us to be all fucked up and desperate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>many laws pass that end up being thrown out for being unconstitutional. IF the troublesome wording of this bill makes it to the final form AND is signed into law, it will be eventually thrown out.</p>

When things like this occur its time to start asking some real tough questions about one&#39;s place in society, and those whom call themselves &quot;Authorities&quot;.

<p>No, it&#39;s tinfoil-hat nonsense.   </p>

<p>The FSMA has been discussed in detail several times on Reddit. tl;dr - No ban on owning seeds. No ban on home gardens. No WTO food-police in silent black helicopters.   </p>

<p>And yet, every few days someone posts a link to one of the tinfoil-hat sites, and a whole new panic starts.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t.  The effect isn&#39;t as widespread as claimed in the title but the ramifications are clear.</p>

<p>Monsanto, et al, wants to control all food production.  The way they are going to do that is by making it illegal to grow any food other than food derived from Monsanto products.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not yet at the point being suggested by the article, but clearly, we&#39;re well on our way.</p>

<p>If you want to oppose the FSMA, fine, go ahead, but argue against what&#39;s actually in it.   </p>

<p>This tinfoil-hat nonsense just makes opponents look like dicks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said profit.  You are talking about gross income.  As far as I know, a company&#39;s &quot;income&quot; as the government sees it is profit, meaning net, not gross.  Companies don&#39;t get taxed on money paid out to employees, supplies, or rent.  Those things are not considered part of the company&#39;s income.</p>

<p>You are attacking me about the wrong numbers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not na√Øve about the plight of farmers.  Nor am I speaking hypothetically.  I grew up in farmland, in very, very rural Wisconsin.  The farmers I knew were either poor or worked secondary jobs to be middle class.  I remember my friends&#39; families dumping their milk in protest to rGBH.  I guarantee you that not a single one of those farms brought in six figures of profit.</p>
