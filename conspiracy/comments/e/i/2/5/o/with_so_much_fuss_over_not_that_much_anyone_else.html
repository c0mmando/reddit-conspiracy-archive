    <div class="md"><p>Assange&#39;s arrest has nothing to do with what information wikileaks has - I&#39;d say it has to do with him playing their game and expecting to become a martyr for it.

I think you overestimate the importance of these &quot;leaks&quot;.  What has been exposed?

<p>He will face no serious repercussions for this.  A few years in minimum security prison at worst.  Compare that to a decade of torture for being in the wrong country at the wrong time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well it would legitimize US policy as they are coming from US embassies, whehter you believe them or not is irrelevant, the fact of the matter is that mainstream media is losing the battle to inform people of the news.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;mainstream media is losing the battle to inform people of the news&quot;</p>

<p>Are you saying that the MSM actually wants to inform people of how the world functions?  And Saddam was stockpiling WMD&#39;s.</p>

<p>&quot;no longer are people ready to accept the propaganda line they want evidence&quot;</p>

<p>I could not disagree more.  Americans are, by and large, stuck in a confirmation bias loop.  They want to hear what reinforces their views.  For example if those views involve government economic intervention being inherently evil, they&#39;ll cite anything as evidence in support of that (I&#39;ve heard conservative talk radio decry the need for the presentation of social security numbers to get school lunches within a minute of decrying illegal immigrants getting social benefits <em>and</em> government social spending).  Political discourse in America lacks anything resembling logic.  I still hear &quot;even though Obama has done virtually nothing progressive, he&#39;s good and Republicans are bad (DERP!).</p>

<p>&quot;wikileaks has given them some good insightful communications&quot;</p>

<p>Like what?  What was in there that an informed observer didn&#39;t already know <em>and</em> that wasn&#39;t just gossip about some political figure&#39;s personal proclivities?</p>

<p>All Arab allies have taken great care to avoid public perception of working with the US (except small. regionally unimportant Gulf States) because of the unrest it causes in nationalist and Islamist portions of the population.  Revealing that Saudi Arabia takes a stronger stance against Iran than the US (if its even true) is great for the US&#39;s public image but terrible for Saudi Arabia&#39;s.

<p>You do realize that the wikileaks are not the most classified documents.  Only very few people have access to such documents, if they even exist.  It&#39;s a good chance that lots of these non-congressional policies have no paper record, or a very small paper record.  </p>

<p>Never the less, they discuss the authorization of torture, but I&#39;m not sure as to the extent of the discussion.  If they were trying to really avoid punishment with fake leaks, they&#39;d say &quot;we approved waterboarding&quot;. Duh.  We know that. </p>

<p>Only 800 of the 250,000 documents have been released.  The truth is, they aren&#39;t really covering it.  They cover it with generalities and are discussing the guys sex crime allegations more than the wikileaks themselves.   Remember when Assange walked out on an MSM interview because of this?</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t do it, it just means they don&#39;t publicize it.  And yes, it most likely is true that Saudi Arabia favors the US more than Iran, because more money is made through the USA.  Also, Saudi&#39;s are Sunni&#39;s while Iran is Shi&#39;a.  THose to factions have been at war for years.</p>

<p>Iran dropping the dollar is a more recent thing, which explains why we&#39;re after them in the first place.  I believe they discussed dropping it in &#39;06, but I&#39;m not sure if they actually did drop the dollar. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, there&#39;s a difference between what&#39;s reported and what has a paper trail.  In this case, the paper trail is small.  There are diplomatic cables between embassies.  These aren&#39;t the most classified of documents.  </p>

<p>Right, nor are they the most damaging.  All that is in them is old news.</p>

<p>&quot;They&#39;re deflecting our anger onto useless things.&quot;</p>

<p>We disagree then.  My view is similar, but I think Wikileaks <em>itself</em> is directing our anger towards useless/old things.  If Wikileaks has really damaging stuff to release, why hasn&#39;t it?  What are they waiting for?</p>

<p>The leaks bolster the US/Israel case for war because it suggests they have allies in that cause in the Middle East.  there has been no substantive discussion (as far as I know) of the fact that Saudi interests in damage to Iran likely has nothing to do with fear of Iranian nuclear ambitions, but rather with Saudi local economic and geopolitical objectives.</p>

<p>&quot;we&#39;ll support the side that generates us the most money.&quot;</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the wrong way to look at this particular conflict.  Saudi Arabia has nearly always been a US client state.  Iran was until the revolution which removed US influence from its government.  Any state in the region that we don&#39;t heavily influence is our enemy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think agree largely that the wikileaks were not that revolutionary.  Anyone outside of the MSM knew most of the stuff from the leaks.</p>

<p>PErsonally, I don&#39;t think Wikileaks has any mal-intent themselves.  If the documents were specifically leaked to enhance US&#39;s image, they wouldn&#39;t really need cooperate with wikileaks.  Personally, there&#39;s no way private Manning could have gotten all of those documents himself.  It could be a plot from the CIA higher-ups, or he could have had a few collaborators who he&#39;s done a good job of protecting.  There are lots of possibilities and I don&#39;t see much evidence that will let me draw the conclusion one way or another.  </p>

<p>Correct, I agree with you here, but I guess you&#39;re generalizing my statement from &quot;money&quot; to &quot;influence&quot; which is fine and probably more accurate.  Never the less, countries in the M.E. haven&#39;t gotten along for years and we&#39;ve also provided weapons, funds, etc. to such groups and what not in the past. </p>

<p>But anyways, I don&#39;t see much in the Wikileaks that increases our justification for going to war with Iran.  </p>

<p>I find it so interesting that the CIA&#39;s origins, from the OSS; whereby they incorporated the SS officers/agents/researchers into the OSS via operation paperclip (resulting in becoming the CIA) and thusly assimilating their knowledge, procedures and effective ethos into their DNA. Resulting in the fascification of America over the subsequent decades (with such lovely CIA ops as the Mai Lai Massacre (with the help of CIA ops such as the runner-up Bush VP nominee, Tom Ridge)) would end up being the Mossads bitch.</p>

<p>The march of the American government toward its current cusp of tyranny is not something that sprouted up in the last ten years through the overt and blatant rape by the MIC - but has been a steady march of imperialists since at least 1946.</p>

<p>It is just that now, we are seeing the full fruits of their craft built upon the foundations of intelligence philosophy which had become perverted and evil when the quest for dark knowledge brought the SS into the OSS.</p>

<p>Too many participants in the company were too willing to step across a line when given the free will and insane funding that was made available.</p>

<p>Since 1963 though, they have occupied the other branches - which started with appointments and ended up with the company director moving to VP, President and installing his spawn as executive as well. </p>

<p>(with a brief interlude given to the AR dem who was rewarded for turning a blind eye to company smuggling channels through his state)</p>

<p>Now though, the handler&#39;s handlers wanted a chance, and the hand-off was quite bold. Bring the economy to the brink in order to ensure that we were all too busy fretting about our own fiscal security to have the time and attention to raise questions on what just happened to us - the largest heist in daylight occurring, not just out in the open - but being advertised and praised right before our eyes.</p>

<p>With the reigns of power going from the strong arm to the underwriters directly - the final pieces are being put in place - while still a few years to go - the case for and framework of global fiscal control has been erected.</p>

<p>One more step to go. Perhaps a scapegoat company, who&#39;s utterly extreme greed will be used as the premise for tighter control and oversight of all financial policy and regulation on a global scale would be needed. An organizations bonus and payment structures to be leaked to the world at one time to show just how horrifically swindled everyone had been at the hands of one company - resulting in deeper and deeper control being handed to a &quot;not-for-profit&quot; quasi private organization like the Fed.</p>

<p>Take a company like, say, Goldman Sachs or perhaps BofA (as GS is far too profitable and way way too close to the Fed) and hold them up as an example.</p>

<p>Crash the economy of the users of this institution to eliminate their wealth and assets - resetting their worth - and resetting the value of work.</p>

<p>A whole new global setup for debt slavery is strengthened.</p>

<p>&lt;/mouthful&gt;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly confused and perhaps someone here can explain.  Why is Reddit glorifying Assange for releasing this info, yet retaining 98% of the info.  If he is truly going for open government, why not just release all the info he has and let us decide what&#39;s important?</p>

<p>Do we really want this no name deciding what to release?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is all of Reddit retarded? US secret information was released by indiscriminately dumping everything Bradley Manning could get his hands on, and you can&#39;t think of anything that would hurt the US?
Troop positions, informant names/titles, weapons capabilities, shift times, training procedures, etc., etc., etc. 
If America attacks Iran do you think they will wait until right before to come up with invasion plans? What if invasion procedures are leaked right before we need to go to war?
I understand that most people are too thick to see how privileged communication leaks can damage the US, but other military leaks should be obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;mainstream media is losing the battle to inform people of the news&quot;</p>

<p>Are you saying that the MSM actually wants to inform people of how the world functions?  And Saddam was stockpiling WMD&#39;s.</p>

<p>&quot;no longer are people ready to accept the propaganda line they want evidence&quot;</p>

<p>I could not disagree more.  Americans are, by and large, stuck in a confirmation bias loop.  They want to hear what reinforces their views.  For example if those views involve government economic intervention being inherently evil, they&#39;ll cite anything as evidence in support of that (I&#39;ve heard conservative talk radio decry the need for the presentation of social security numbers to get school lunches within a minute of decrying illegal immigrants getting social benefits <em>and</em> government social spending).  Political discourse in America lacks anything resembling logic.  I still hear &quot;even though Obama has done virtually nothing progressive, he&#39;s good and Republicans are bad (DERP!).</p>

<p>&quot;wikileaks has given them some good insightful communications&quot;</p>

<p>Like what?  What was in there that an informed observer didn&#39;t already know <em>and</em> that wasn&#39;t just gossip about some political figure&#39;s personal proclivities?</p>
