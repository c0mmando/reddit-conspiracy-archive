    <div class="md"><p>It was obvious he was going to be denied bail.  He&#39;s wanted for a serious crime, is not a British National, is known to move from country to country and refused initially to give a British address when asked by the court.  Further, a few of the people who offered sureties for him didn&#39;t even know him; why would he care if they lost money?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Mr Assange&#39;s first accuser made no immediate attempt to contact the authorities. It was only when she was contacted by the second accuser four days later that the pair decided to go to the police.</p>

<p>Instead the first woman arranged a &quot;crayfish party&quot; – a traditional Swedish summer get-together – for the following evening in honour of the WikiLeaks founder in her flat. In an entry on the woman&#39;s Twitter account, which she later tried to erase, Mr Assange&#39;s first accuser described her joy at hosting a party for the world&#39;s most famous cyber activist. &quot;Sitting outside nearly freezing with the world&#39;s coolest people,&quot; she wrote. &quot;It&#39;s pretty amazing.&quot;</p>

<p>Catlin observed that both Ardin and Sofia Wilén, the second accuser, sent SMS messages and tweets boasting of their conquests following the alleged &quot;rapes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the case of Ardin it is clear that she has thrown a party in Assange&#39;s honour at her flat after the &#39;crime&#39; and tweeted to her followers that she is with the &#39;the world’s coolest smartest people, it’s amazing!&#39;&quot; he wrote.</p>

<p>&quot;The exact content of Wilén’s mobile phone texts is not yet known but their bragging and exculpatory character has been confirmed by Swedish prosecutors. Niether Wilén’s nor Ardin’s texts complain of rape,&quot; Catlin said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please provide a citation over what precisely he is wanted for in Sweden that does not ultimately come from the mouth of Assange&#39;s lawyer.  As far as I am aware, he is wanted on suspicion of &quot;rape and sexual molestation&quot;.  As the BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11937110">points out</a> (hardly the biggest pro-government source on the planet):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the charges is that he had unprotected sex with a woman, identified only as Miss A, when she insisted he use a condom.</p>

<p>Another is that he had unprotected sex with another woman, Miss W, while she was asleep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The AOL News story has been circulating freely over the past week claiming that Ny stated that he is not wanted for rape, but for &quot;sex by surprise&quot;, whatever that is.  Having read the AOL story itself, Ny doesn&#39;t directly speak to AOL News, but the claim comes from Assange&#39;s lawyer.  Hardly an unbiased actor here.</p>

<p>Further, if he really is only wanted for &quot;sex by surprise&quot; which, AFAIK, only carries a small fine, then lucky you, your prayers have been answered!  Under The Extradition Act 2003, Sections 10 and 64, the District Judge has to decide whether the supposed crime is an extraditable offence.  Does a crime involving only punishment of a fine fit this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, please provide a citation for any of this.  &quot;Continuing after the condom broke, despite her protestations&quot; is the very model of rape in the Anglo-American legal tradition.  I&#39;d be surprised if Assange wasn&#39;t being accused of rape in Sweden, if that&#39;s the accusation.  Sweden&#39;s legal system isn&#39;t that alien to those of us used to common law.</p>

<p>&quot; Den 18:e november häktas Julian Assange i sin frånvaro för ett fall av olaga tvång den 13-14 augusti i Stockholm, sexuellt ofredande den 13-14 augusti i Stockholm, sexuellt ofredande den 18 augusti eller dagarna däromkring i Stockholm, sexuellt ofredande den 16-17 augusti i Enköping och våldtäkt den 17 augusti i Enköping. I samband med beslut om häktning, beslutar man att också efterlysa Assange internationellt.
  Häktningen överklagas till Svea hovrätt som avslår överklagan. Hovrätten justerar dock brottsrubriceringarna. Ett fall av sexuellt ofredande underkänns och tas bort samtidigt som hovrätten graderar ned misstankegraden för våldtäkt till ett mindre grovt brott.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Police contacted Mr Stephens [Assange&#39;s solicitor] on Monday night [6th Dec - 2 days ago!] after receiving a European arrest warrant from the Swedish authorities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before leaving Sweden Mr. Assange asked to be interviewed by the prosecution on several occasions in relation to the allegations, staying over a month in Stockholm, at considerable expense and despite many engagements elsewhere, in order to clear his name.&quot;</p>

It is apparent now that a faction of those in power have compromised. The world&#39;s politics are reduced to sweetheart deals.

<p>It seems his extradition to Sweden (if it happens) will help his cause.  At the moment it&#39;s really easy for the US to extradite from the UK, but Sweden doesn&#39;t have a similarly close agreement.  It leaves me wondering if the rape charges were part of a cleaver political game Assanges set up himself to protect himself from the US government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be so sure about that. </p>

<p>I understand that the role of the magistrate in this case is not to review the charges, it is to review the legality of the arrest and extradition warrants. If these are in order there may not be a lot m&#39;lord can do about it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my armchair lawyer input:</p>

<p>Firstly, DAE remember a case a few years back when a group of protestors broke into an air base and damaged some BAE Hawk jets, and the judge acquitted them after accepting their plea they were acting to prevent human rights abuses elsewhere in the world? I can&#39;t find the story at the mo, if anyone else can find a link that would be great. </p>

<p>Secondly the Gary McKinnon case while not necessarily a great analogy does show that extradition from the UK is not always so simple; you can’t be extradited if there is a risk you will not get a fair trial or be otherwise harmed. </p>

<p>No doubt JA&#39;s legal team are exploring all this. </p>

<p>I suspect at least though that the temporary confinement, based on allegations that would never have confined anyone else, will somehow turn into a deportation to the U.S. to face quiet charges. </p>

<p>Hell, these days perhaps a little enhanced interrogation might be in order. No geek pussy bitch would stand up to that right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had read this in several articles here in Australia.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a website clearly stating it; <a href="http://www.cepprobation.org/default.asp?page_id=85">Link</a></p>

<p>Bail</p>

<p>Bail is notoriously difficult to obtain for any foreigner charged with an offence of any gravity. Concerns over whether the person would return if released on bail, coupled with the difficulty of establishing and checking the credentials of a detained foreigner, means that the judicial process is weighted against a release on bail. In the rare cases where bail is granted, the person is often told they must remain in that country until the case comes to court. Their passport may be held and they might have to sign on regularly at a local police station. Often, in these circumstances the person finds it extremely difficult to obtain work and pay for accommodation, and, is generally ineligible for any local social security provision.</p>

<p>Side stepping on rule breaking? Do you have some kind of persecution complex? Don&#39;t you realise that a topic can be explained to you without the intent to obfuscate another? It&#39;s not like you can change the message once you&#39;ve posted it, anyway. I was simply saying that you shouldn&#39;t go where you&#39;re not wanted.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, an unwanted opinion. Again, you&#39;re stating an opinion in a way that isn&#39;t wanted where you&#39;re doing it. So why not find a forum better suited for you? That&#39;s a serious question, by the way.</p>

<p>A community is held together by its rules, so yes, excuse me if I care about the reddit community. But that&#39;s not really why I bring it up.

    <div class="md"><p>What we&#39;re seeing is US politicians trying to avoid embarrassment by shooting the messenger in an attempt to stifle the message.  And the world is horrified to see how quickly the US government can overlook Democratic ideals such as rule-of-law and free speech in their attempts to shut-down Wikileaks.  Likewise, the speed with which major corporations (Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, Amazon, etc.) and even world governments (Australia) are bowing to US pressure indicates their loyalty to US leadership above that of their citizens and customers. </p>

<p>But even as you watch this unfold, you can do something!  Run a <a href="http://www.torproject.org/">TOR relay</a> now to protect free speech on the internet.   And please consider <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/eginf/want_to_help_ensure_democracy_but_dont_know_what/">some of these alternatives</a>.  If you value democracy, then help preserve it, NOW! </p>

<p>The effort to shut down Wikileaks intensified dramatically after JA announced the next release would be bank documents. It seems more likely the US is putting pressure on other governments at the bequest of major corporations rather than the other way around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>International law is as much a fallacy as Intergalactic law. There is no such thing as either.</p>

<p>There are International agreements which can influence the laws of nations. They are however neither global agreements or global laws as there is no global governing body with the jurisdiction to enforce them.</p>

<p>International merely means between two (or more) nations. If you look at the word components of inter-nation-al it becomes more clear. International agreements literally sit &quot;between&quot; nations until such time as both parties implement them in local law.</p>

<p>Now, whether Assange is consider a political prisoner depends on your opinion. My opinion is that he is. Whether he is legally considered a political prisoner depends on what laws are implemented under the jurisdiction you are in.</p>

<p>So called International Law is only relevant to those who are under the same agreement between nations and have implement those &quot;guidelines&quot;. The ironic things are International agreements is that they are usually formed under duress (trade agreements, etc.) which should invalidate them under the law proper.</p>

<p>In the end it all really just comes down to duress whether it be by military means, trade embargos, or whatever means are used. Humanity functions by much more primal and primitive means than we care to do admit and this is what is really being hidden. The foul nature of humanity that can manifest at the national level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, there is nothing wrong with the Swedish judiciary system, it just treats allegations of sex-crime rather seriously. If there is a conspiracy in this then I think it has to do with the women whom Assange allegedly wronged. However there are no real evidence except the claims from the two women - unfortunately this is almost always the case in rape-charges. I think Assange will be extradited to Sweden where he will be questioned. I do not think he will be convicted of anything.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m being a bit too snide. Hearing all of this bullshit about &quot;surprise sex&quot; and &quot;broken condom&quot; laws will do that to you.

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, can I first say Assange /= Wikileaks. Even if he is imprisoned that won&#39;t stop WikiLeaks.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There might be some legitmacy to these charges, which again does not mean that WikiLeaks isn&#39;t exposing important things that need to be known.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s doubtful that InterPol would have issued this warrant if it were anybody but Assange.</p></li>
<li><p>The newspaper that was initially reporting on this in Sweden was also the same one who was looking to get Assange working as a monthly columnist for them. That way he could work away whilst being protected by some of the strongest press freedom laws in the world. To say they&#39;ve been cagey about the details in the case is something of an understatement.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In conclusion: It&#39;s possible that Assange is guilty of actual rape here. Not technicality &quot;condom broke but he carried on&quot; rape, as in &quot;held a woman down after she asked him to stop because he wasn&#39;t wearing a condom&quot; and &quot;had sex with someone while they were asleep&quot; rape. Again, I said it&#39;s possible and we should assume innocence until proven otherwise but I just want to say that just because someone does important work, it doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t also be a horrible human being. Also, I think that Naomi Klein sums up the whole case best</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange is just an obtainable head that the USG can cut off to show people not to fuck with the USofA. He didn&#39;t leak documents, someone else who can&#39;t be or at least hasn&#39;t been caught leaked them. Wikileaks is a journalism web site. It may not be what we traditionally think of when we think of journalism, but it&#39;s a news source. If the BBC or some other forign news station had discovered and published this information on their own, the US wouldn&#39;t call for their destruction. 
I believe that tje only reason the US is (alledgely) going after Assange is because he is someone they can take down easily.  I guess thats the real American way.</p>
