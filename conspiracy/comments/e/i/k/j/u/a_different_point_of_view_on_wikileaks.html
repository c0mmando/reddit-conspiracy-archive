        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, I want to clarify that I don&#39;t want to be thrown into the increasing polarity that is being created in this country as a reaction to news events. Saying that alone probably puts me more towards the liberal/left side of the equation. Either way please read this with a grain of salt, I&#39;m not claiming to be any kind of expert I just have a sentiment to express that I haven&#39;t really found here on reddit or much of anywhere. </p>

<p>I am very open to the idea that the world is being manipulated. Well, not the world specifically, but that we, the masses (specifically America) are being manipulated by the illusion of importance and issue created by the media. These issues are instrumental not only in the control of the population but also in the creation of ideologies that seem to result naturally from our own observance. Issues are put forth, we make a decision based on our own experience as to how we feel about them, and we then come to conclusions about how the issue should be viewed and should be solved. In this day of mass media, globalism, and dualism I don&#39;t think that any issue can be looked at in such a way. The main tool for this manipulation, as I see it, isn&#39;t simply the process of putting forth an issue and fueling two opposite reactions; the main tool is omitting information all together. It is one thing to find where you stand on hot issues such as health-care, gay rights, the economy and so on by examining the issues by collecting various points of view on the topics and coming up with your own conclusion. It is entirely another thing to exclude such information from the public&#39;s eyes and ears and this is the most powerful thing that any control-establishing entity can do.</p>

<p>This is exactly why I am very weary of Wikileaks. Not specifically because it is exposing the ruthlessness and hypocrisy of government but because it is being talked about and becoming another one of these hot issues. If wikileaks was a true threat to the government (or our handlers however you define them) then they would purposefully omit wikileaks from the public ear and eye. It wouldn&#39;t be an issue because no one would be talking about it beyond the internet itself. It would be confined to the realm of conspiracy and speculation. Commenters would be exclusively found in blogs, books, articles, youtube videos, reddit but I would not expect them to show up on formats that require little attention span and little examination like every single news channel is doing. Wikileaks is on the cover of times. It is a major issue on CNN, NBC, even FOX. Why? Perhaps at this point you&#39;ve read what I am saying and come to the conclusion that though I am making a &quot;decent&quot; argument I am wrong simply because of the format in which wikileaks functions; the internet. </p>

<p>Had the documents been released via a book, the attention of the media wouldn&#39;t be necessary because they could easily downplay the issues and downplay the significance of the information but because of the way that wikileaks and the cables work this information cannot be subdued and removed and therefore they must deal with it.  This is where I find myself diverging. It is this very element that is at risk here; the emergence of information through the internet in an unfiltered and unstoppable manner.  This is what I think is really going to be under attack. As Wikileaks becomes more and more problematic; perhaps a death or two as a result of exposed information; perhaps anger between two countries because of things one leader said about another, or whatever the results could be, one thing will come under fire; not wikileaks but what wikileaks represents through the means by which it exists; the freedom of the web.
If you don&#39;t believe me watch what happens as a result of today&#39;s 4chan and other &quot;hacker-terrorist websites&quot; that are taking on corporations.  Another question this brings up for me is whether the internet-kill switch was being implemented prior to these major leaks as a premeditation of their effects, or whether both the internet-kill and wikileaks were both premeditated to make both of them necessary to each other. </p>

<p>Think about it.</p>

<p>Take care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brilliant article - not enough people are questioning the existence and intent of Wikileaks.  This all may be just evidence that the governments/handlers have learned to use Social Media in order to spread their agenda.  It goes without saying that we shouldn&#39;t blindly accept the content just because it was &#39;leaked&#39;.  Disinformation has been used by governments/spies for a long time. note; the latest info to be &#39;leaked&#39; involves ufos.  Ask yourself what would it take for the average person to <strong>really</strong> believe in the existence of ufos and how would this be useful to the powers that be. For a reference, look up the Ronald Reagan ufo speech where he discusses the &#39;possibility of Earth uniting against a threat by &quot;a power from outer space.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly..I think the UFO thing is a total distraction. This whole wikileaks thing is really making me upset, especially with the Truth Movement. Shouldn&#39;t we be questioning EVERYTHING and it doesn&#39;t seem like that is happening here. The movement isn&#39;t really standing by its&#39; standards in regards to the idea of questioning everything. We don&#39;t know who this guy is and we defiantly don&#39;t know if we can trust him or his sources and the reason why this is happening.  </p>

<p>Either way though information is getting out there, and some of that information is very important stuff..but that doesn&#39;t mean people shouldn&#39;t be concerned on WHY and HOW this information is getting released. </p>

<p>It really is all massive confusion at this point..and I think I will be staying on top of the fence on this issue and stand back to see what happens. I don&#39;t believe the man should be in jail though, I believe if he is in jail that it is going to get closer and closer to the US Governments (criminal element inside the Government) crackdown. This is the first time I really don&#39;t know what to think...yet. It&#39;s still to early to jump on the bandwagon with Assange..because he still is just a stranger in the street to us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and the whole UFO thing is very strange. This is making me see Wikileaks as a real asset to the government. What better way to sway the public than to make them think they&#39;ve discovered something secret? This was the exact sentiment I started to uncover when linking together new age occultism as it went along with mind control/disinfo/counter-cultural socialism (something I&#39;ll have to save for another post). </p>

<p>Think about the possibility of fabricated documents being released. Perhaps a document purposefully sent with the intention of later being &quot;uncovered&quot; by the internet &quot;rebellion&quot; only to reinforce a anti-American ideology that leads towards self destruction of the American government/defense and economy which would then follow in the downfall of other established governments and countries and economies throughout the world that are dependent on the US. This would inevitably lead to a very important power shift and a necessary and new dependence on these powers which would also be masked through coops and rebellions to establish &quot;new governments&quot; in these governments which then unite under one extremely mobile shadow government; extremely mobile because these rebellions would create a sense that the good guys had won.  I think the best way to conceptualize how this all works is to watch a mobster movie and imagine that a similar mentality exists except with much higher levels of power, influence, and secrecy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great  article man. I am also weary of Wikileaks..I believe that if he was such a threat, and this wasn&#39;t a controlled opposition the CIA would have taken this dude out the second he stepped on the scene. He has to many CIA Connections for me to brush off..I don&#39;t know.. I am still on the fence. Just because he is being obtained right now doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t work, or is an informant for the CIA, and the CIA does do work worldwide. I think I am going down the route of him being some type of Patsy in a sense. A way and an excuse for the US Government to begin their final crackdown, specifically dealing the Internet, and massive censorship of information that is being displayed to the public via the Cyber Security Act.</p>

<p>You can read in the Patriot Act, the definition of a Domestic Terrorist..it&#39;s extremely vague but comes down to basically anyone who alters the thought of the public. So under the US Patriot Act, anyone who would spread this information in the US and be a US Citizen could be labeled a Domestic Terrorist under the US Patriot Act. I think they are ready to start implementing that because of recent up-rise. Certain Movements are beginning to grab some serious ground in the US and let&#39;s just say those Movements are not FOR or SUPPORTING the Current Gestapo that is in place.</p>

<p>They know they can&#39;t just come out and start cracking down seriously on these Movements..they need an excuse and a reason. This could be their reason. I don&#39;t know man but I loved your article. Great Job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the way I see it, wikileaks could just be making people believe that they are &quot;exposing&quot; the worst things the gov is doing but in reality it&#39;s just a fraction of the whole thing, so now ppl are like yeah they killed a few civilians, but they are sorry, move along.

<p>With all of the &quot;hacker-terrorists&quot; downloading the insurance file, how do we know that the file itself doesn&#39;t contain a virus or something along those lines that would aide in the internet-kill switch?</p>

<p>Assange dies, the code is released. Everyone opens it expecting awesome information, turns out they killed the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This particular playing of the &quot;what if&quot; game shouldn&#39;t be discounted. The assumptions may be but the playing of the game shouldn&#39;t be simply because the implications involved, if such a thing were true, would elude to a larger than life picture of corruption and manipulation being used than the word government can even articulate. Furthermore, the very lack of alternative ideas involving Wikileaks should be of some concern to you simply in knowing that every issue is a multilayer ever-unfolding concept that requires multiple interpretations. This, you might argue, could be a sign of my own paranoia or skepticism, but I assure you that me posting such a thing isn&#39;t a strive towards something as simple as sensationalism or self-assurance. </p>

<p>I am posting this because I am personally interested in this topic and similar temptations of thought. I am using the forum of Reddit to get a mixed yet fairly directed idea through response to such a statement so that I can further my own understanding of such things and attempt to avoid reinforcing my own preconceived judgments about an issue so I can create decisions based closer to the &quot;truth&quot; involved in the matter. It is, in a way, a matter of survival in this time and day. </p>

<p>But, nevertheless, I must admit that I am a CIA disinformation agent attempting to sway the minds of at least 19 (as of this moment) people. Yeah we&#39;re that thorough. You&#39;re all fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and as mrsnakers pointed out above, what I have seen so far of the wikileaks content seems pretty tame.  there is no mention of anything that could really affect the us govt in terms of legalities (eg abuse of political prisoners) or public opinion. When I first heard of wikileaks I expected the cables might touch upon such issues as HAARP, CIA mind control ops (eg project monarch/bluebird), political intervention in the third world, &#39;health&#39; experiments on the poor and vulnerable.  But instead all i&#39;ve come across are some derogatory comments re foreign leaders/politicians.  This information is more embarrassing than inflamatory and not particularly dangerous for the us govt particularly if the elites of most countries are in cahouts as many suspect.  They should call it wikigossip.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad to see that not all of reddit is in aw of the substance released by Wikileaks. I admit, though, the more I try to prevent the inevitable subjugation of my peer’s and my mind, the more I realize that either A.

<p>I&#39;ve just been shaking my head at the entire situation. I never realized how quick people are to jump on board with something without even really looking into who this dude is or anything..they just see &quot;WIkileaks to leak thousands of classified War Documents..&quot; and they are automatically jumping right on board.

    <div class="md"><p>This post isn&#39;t really clear as he takes a long time to make any point. The mainstream media publishes these leaks because its the biggest leak since the Pentagon files. Its a big news story and it makes money. </p>

<p>Mrsnakers seems to assume that the US Gov is omnipotent and that Wikileaks is a grave threat to it. This is not true, the US Gov is fallible, and Wikileaks is only a threat to its CURRENT political &amp; military leaders. This is nothing more then good journalism, and political leaders getting scared and trying to cover up their mistakes. This is not a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...ok so basically what your saying is that the Mainstream media refuses to not cover tons of major news stories that could potentially make them truck loads of cash (Besides the billions they are receiving behind the doors like with GE and MSNBC)..but they decide to run this..</p>

<p>Did we not learn anything from this quote..
&quot;The Central Intelligence Agency owns everyone of any significance in the major media.&quot; --William Colby former CIA Director.</p>

<p>Would the mainstream media publish any information that is going against the very same people who own them without an agenda? If we go off of that quote, I wouldn&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think anyone here is saying that WikiLeaks isn&#39;t a potential threat to anyone in our Government. It&#39;s who the blame is being placed on.</p>

<p>If you look at the first wave of released documents, for the most part, and what was ran on the mainstream news was all blame being placed on the Military and about Military War Crimes, and also tons of Foreign Leaders &quot;pressuring the US&quot; to start wars, (ex. Saudi Arabia pressuring US to attack IRAN). Do we ever read anything in these documents about the Elite? No. </p>

<p>The second wave is going to deal with a Major US Bank. Well let&#39;s just say that comes out and the big us bank (probably bank of America based on past interviews with Assange)..if Bank of America (or another bank) falls..the money they currently hold goes somewhere..I am guessing the Federal Reserve..I could be wrong about that, but I am pretty sure that&#39;s where the holdings would go. If that is the case..well haha..the feds would profit majorly off the release of those documents.</p>

<p>Also the second wave will deal with UFOs...yeah nothing much to say about that except another major distraction from the shadow government that is running this country..I mean do you really think a revolution will start over our Government hiding information about fucking aliens? I think not.</p>

<p>I think what people have to do now, is look at who will profit or gain from the release of these documents. Again, we are not saying any of this is 100% true, as you can tell we are just discussing the possibility of it being so, and sadly I think it is going down the right track.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to remember a few things about life and hold them close. One of these things is that truth is hidden and only requires observance of self and environment to uncover. What you end up uncovering is that truth isn&#39;t tangible, it is in the moment, and it is fleeting. The only thing that fully articulates the existence of truth is analogy. That being said some of the truths I&#39;ve discovered are that the majority of the world outside, as seen through a filter, is an illusion. You should act as the filter and the world outside should always be questioned. Doing this should inevitably lead to questioning yourself and a rearrangement of your own desires in order to bring about a more enlightened you. Keep questioning everything but don&#39;t be nagged by paranoia or controlled by disappointment and always find a time and place to get away from the theoretical and just feel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is far from what I&#39;m assuming. I am basically saying that because wikileaks isn&#39;t a threat to the government that I believe it is being used instrumentally by the government to fuel this sort of cyber rebellion. I believe this rebellion is being controlled and that the real government infultrated a lot of these anti-american mentalities long time ago with disinformation and using a puppet government as a false target. To follow this sort of train of thought you need to already have accepted that the media/government/corporations are specifically using the news to create a division in America for a divide and conquer sort of atmosphere that has been exponentially increased since 9-11. I am not suggesting that the government is infallible and I believe that the incopentence in a puppet government is actually being encouraged and that all politicians are basically illusions of choice. If this was simply good journalism it wouldn&#39;t be in the news because the news is concerned with bad biased purposefully deceptive stories and coverage. Not many people realize that each news company is literally sold stories and are forced to spin them in a certain way for the advantage of a much larger interests.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, how else can you explain why every news channel (at least in my country) carries the exact same news every day, mostly non-newsworthy material with a tendency towards a combination of sex and violence (social conditioning-this needs its own post) peppered with celebrity &#39;news&#39;.  There is virtually no point in viewing the news except to be aware of what they are currently trying to sell.  I believe that wikileaks has an agenda to undermine public opinion in the world&#39;s govts (esp america) and that when opinion is at rock bottom and we are at a state of martial law, mass protests, strikes etc, the &#39;cavalry&#39; will turn up to save the day, ie New World Order.  except they will be the exact same people who are running the show right now, they will just have more powers; powers that we will have given them.  A good reference for this is Ayn Rand - Atlas Shrugged.</p>

<p>“I’m constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud.” - Assange</p>

<p>You believe someone that says stuff like that. No real evidence of 9/11 being an inside job? wow, yeah he is all about breaking government secrecy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the points in your post are valid.</p>

<p>However, look at the speed at which everything is moving. It&#39;s too fast. Five years ago, everything you mentioned would be possible, even easy to orchestrate. Not anymore.</p>

<p>Follow the twitter accounts of Anon and the LOIC and Op Payback etc... it really is a Hivemind and that can&#39;t be controlled.</p>

<p>I think that a lot of things have been happening coincidentally but the real life version of it is how it&#39;s being played out. There&#39;s no conspiracy about WikiLeaks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but why do you say there is no &quot;Conspiracy&quot; behind WikiLeaks? I understand that Assange is not the only person that is behind Wikileaks, we know that. But he is the face. </p>

<p>Should we just drop everything and follow him because of what is happening? I think that is what we are trying to get across.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i work for a company that uses cloud searches and social media to track and influence customer opinion - it can and does happen very quickly - i&#39;m not saying I can guarantee there is or is not a wikileaks conspiracy, just that we should be open to every possibility.  to my mind this is a form of marketing and it would not be too hard to predict how people would react to certain situations.  We have 2 full-time people working in this area.  The governments could have hundreds-thousands monitoring/manipulating social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything released makes sense though. Everyone is looking for the excuse to side with the gov&#39;t (which is natural) but for once in our lives we&#39;re being given cold hard fact; we&#39;re not used to it. </p>

<p>What we are used to is the tricks by gov&#39;t, which is what we are expecting from WikiLeaks. But the thing is, if it&#39;s a trick, the gov&#39;t is still definitely the bad side of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand exactly. It isn&#39;t me searching for an excuse to side with the government. I would rather us take a different route than blindly believing these cables simply because they were stolen. This could be complete bullshit altogether or the information leaked could be in a demographic of some kind that has a pattern involved in it allowing it to create a stir, justify it as true, and motivate people to respond to it through a conjured version of the truth.</p>

<p>If there was evidence of world wide mind control specifically used by the CIA and plans for the dismemberment of the United States or some large conspiracy I would think that this stuff is more legit simply because it seems to be working completely counter to what I would expect the shadow government to desire. The fact that I can still see the outline of this as a useful tool of manipulation makes me question its use in common language and everyday thought.</p>

The path to understanding yourself is a road that requires a lot of studying of the outside world which should then be related to the inner world.
