    <div class="md"><p>Was this Johnny_Cash&#39;s last post? </p>

<p>Chomsky is a member of the Global Jewish Nation and he has been protecting the Jewish Hive over revelations of Jewish guilt for perpetrating 911. He&#39;s been saying, &quot;911 isn&#39;t important, let&#39;s forget it.&quot; to distract the crowd -- but the crowd has run off in a different direction and he is scurrying to get in front of the crowd to make it look like he&#39;s leading. Chomsky is going the standard &quot;fallback&quot; route, pioneered by fellow Jew Michael Moore: Blame it on Bush. You will NOT hear Chomsky telling the truth about 911, that his fellow Jews perpetrated the attacks because, quite frankly, there is going to be fearful retribution for Jewish treachery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re right: It wasn&#39;t Bush or the U.S. Postal Service that did 911.
Only the Jews have the organizational penetration, fanaticism, cultic cohesion and casual approach to mass murder to pull off 911, which they did. There is a Jew -- not on every page -- but in every paragraph, each with the means, motive and opportunity to enable this horrendous crime.
Y&#39;all are busted. Deadbang. The Mavi Mara showed that Jews can lie against broad daylight facts and do so concertedly, to the point of delusion. Well, Toby Keith and his size 12 cowboy boots are no delusion and you Jews are gonna have one up your ass if you don&#39;t start packing your bags for Alpha Centauri.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This isn&#39;t about Johnny&#39;s blunt abrasive manner IMO. It is about shutting down the information that he exposed.</p>

<p>Like I said this isn&#39;t a call for blood, it is a call for truth. Jews that commit crimes should not be able to hide behind the Holocaust narrative. PNAC may have been the greatest conspiracy ever perpetrated against the USA. Jews do have excessive influence and there needs to be reform.</p>

<p>As someone previously wrote,</p>

<p>&quot;The Muslims are not the enemy. They don’t extort usury through the Federal Reserve; they aren’t manufacturing population-reducing vaccines and GMO seeds; they didn’t devise our abortion laws (about fifty million dead); they didn’t bail out the banks; they didn’t create the Department of Homeland Security and impose the PATRIOT Act; they aren’t wiretapping our private conversations or scanning us at the airport; they didn’t impose godless Communism on several countries and cause the death of millions of innocent people; they haven’t instituted the draconian healthcare laws; they have not orchestrated the nation’s economic crashes; they have not deindustrialized the nation and outsourced so many jobs; they haven’t wiped out the middle class by passing trade laws like NAFTA; and they haven’t foreclosed on thousands of homes; they are not the reason thousands of people live in tent cities; they haven’t developed depleted uranium weapons. Instead of worrying about a mosque, consider what’s going on behind the closed doors at the Federal Reserve, the Pentagon, the Senate and House chambers, the CFR, the State Department, the UN or dozens of other places. The Muslims didn’t instigate the attacks on the USS Liberty or the USS Cole and they didn’t orchestrate the highly organized attack in Manhattan on 9/11.&quot;</p>
