<p>Note that the vote totals for the people alleged to be government shills - Facehammer, Herkimer, jcm267, etc. - are consistently higher than the vote totals for other users.  This is because they have to compensate for all the downvotes they&#39;re getting, and make it seem like they have valid criticisms.</p>

<p>Think about it, if you wanna troll, go to people who are passionate about a given topic and stir the pot a little.  The same type of people would go into <a href="/r/Apple">/r/Apple</a> or <a href="/r/Bible">/r/Bible</a> to troll there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  Facehammer in particular has spent months following me:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/cm786/facehammer_is_a_troll_in_the_worst_possible_sense/">http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/cm786/facehammer_is_a_troll_in_the_worst_possible_sense/</a></p>

<p>and the real dead giveaway is that none of them ever respond to my messages <em>unless</em> I write something critical of the government.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also notice that in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dwwac/why_am_i_getting_thinly_veiled_threats_from_the/">this thread</a>, there&#39;s a great deal of evidence I linked to, including other sources confirming the &quot;professional affiliations&quot; of jcm267, Herkimer, and so on.  Believe me, &quot;government shilling&quot; is the only thing they&#39;re doing.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also notice I linked to Alex Jones, of all people, specifically calling out Herkimer for being a shill on <em>Digg</em> (as Herkimer56), well before I even came along and did all this stuff on reddit.   </p>

<p>You&#39;ll <em>also</em> notice that the accounts are all named similarly - as if the person registering the accounts was straining himself to come up with good names - Herk<strong>imer</strong> and Einst<strong>imer</strong>, and then <strong>Not</strong>TheFather, <strong>No</strong>Libertarian, <strong>No</strong>Librarian, <strong>Not</strong>COINTELPROAgent, <strong>No</strong>derp, etc..  See the pattern?  Here&#39;s a screenshot of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, in case it changes:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Fr9SI.png">http://i.imgur.com/Fr9SI.png</a> (vimprobable2 browser)</p>

<p>Most of them came out of the woodwork when I spent 5 days glued to my computer, reexamining historical evidence for the &quot;Holocaust&quot; on reddit (evidence not of my choosing, by the way).  Then they all swarmed.  They&#39;re also all moderators of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, and all of their submissions, almost without exception, are pro-government, anti-&quot;conspiracy theory.&quot;  This is far beyond the point where it could reasonably be considered a &quot;coincidence&quot; or &quot;mistake.&quot;  This is intentional disinformation, beyond a doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ghibmmm,
We&#39;ve explained this before. r/friends shows you the comments and submissions of people you tagged as friends. That&#39;s how I often get involved with these discussions outside of r/conspiracy. HOWEVER, I&#39;m a regular in this subreddit so I noticed it in the new submissions list independently of r/friends (namely because I don&#39;t have Facehammer friend-tagged). So either people saw it in r/conspiracy or in r/friends. Equifinality in this case means it doesn&#39;t particularly matter how we got here.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#39;t see why do we need to post another link to our subreddit? Off the top of my head, we don&#39;t link to most of these discussions, just major ones if need be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never sent you any threads you moron. Yeah you were an asshole. Remember when I deleted the comments about your &quot;book&quot; and you were still going on. Even after I warned you that I was about to post everything, you were still an asshole about it. The reason why I posted your book again is because you&#39;re an asshole!</p>
