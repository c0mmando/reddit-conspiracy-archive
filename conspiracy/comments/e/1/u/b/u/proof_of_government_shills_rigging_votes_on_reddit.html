       Note that the vote totals for the people alleged to be government shills - Facehammer, Herkimer, jcm267, etc. - are consistently higher than the vote totals for other users.  This is because they have to compensate for all the downvotes they're getting, and make it seem like they have valid criticisms.

       I think it's more likely that these guys are just trolls rather than government agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, if you wanna troll, go to people who are passionate about a given topic and stir the pot a little.  The same type of people would go into
       <a href="/r/Apple">
        /r/Apple
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/Bible">
        /r/Bible
       </a>
       to troll there.

       Nope.  Facehammer in particular has spent months following me:
      </p>

       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/cm786/facehammer_is_a_troll_in_the_worst_possible_sense/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and the real dead giveaway is that none of them ever respond to my messages
       <em>
        unless
       </em>
       I write something critical of the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll also notice that in
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dwwac/why_am_i_getting_thinly_veiled_threats_from_the/">
        this thread
       </a>
       , there's a great deal of evidence I linked to, including other sources confirming the "professional affiliations" of jcm267, Herkimer, and so on.  Believe me, "government shilling" is the only thing they're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll also notice I linked to Alex Jones, of all people, specifically calling out Herkimer for being a shill on
       <em>
        Digg
       </em>
       (as Herkimer56), well before I even came along and did all this stuff on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       notice that the accounts are all named similarly - as if the person registering the accounts was straining himself to come up with good names - Herk

       and Einst

       derp, etc..  See the pattern?  Here's a screenshot of
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       , in case it changes:

      </p>
      <p>
       Most of them came out of the woodwork when I spent 5 days glued to my computer, reexamining historical evidence for the "Holocaust" on reddit (evidence not of my choosing, by the way).  Then they all swarmed.  They're also all moderators of
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       , and all of their submissions, almost without exception, are pro-government, anti-"conspiracy theory."  This is far beyond the point where it could reasonably be considered a "coincidence" or "mistake."  This is intentional disinformation, beyond a doubt.

       OK, we admit it. You caught us. We are all government field agents, paid to follow you around and stir dissent against seditious opinions and unharmonious individuals.

       Too bad you couldn't keep your punk mouth shut and keep your head down. Agents will shortly collect you for re-education. Do not resist arrest. You will only make it harder on yourself.

        Think about it, if you wanna troll, go to people who are passionate about a given topic and stir the pot a little. The same type of people would go into
        <a href="/r/Apple">
         /r/Apple

        or
        <a href="/r/Bible">

       When are you going to stop fanning these flames? You keep bringing this up over and over across multiple accounts (ghibmmm, secretghibmmm, and ultrasecretghibmm) and not letting it die.

       Just take a look around this thread - jcm267, Facehammer, Herkimer, tzvika613 - they managed to find their way in here, even though I didn't make this post with my regular account.  They didn't even make a post in their
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard">
        ridiculous little subreddit
       </a>
       about it, either - they just followed each other in a totally different way:

       Ghibmmm,
We've explained this before. r/friends shows you the comments and submissions of people you tagged as friends. That's how I often get involved with these discussions outside of r/conspiracy. HOWEVER, I'm a regular in this subreddit so I noticed it in the new submissions list independently of r/friends (namely because I don't have Facehammer friend-tagged). So either people saw it in r/conspiracy or in r/friends. Equifinality in this case means it doesn't particularly matter how we got here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't see why do we need to post another link to our subreddit? Off the top of my head, we don't link to most of these discussions, just major ones if need be.

       You really do have some mental issues that need to be sorted out, ghibmmm. Please seek the help of a licensed psychiatrist. You can overcome your illness with therapy, medication, and dedication. I'm rooting for you!

       Your admittedly a troll, and you're causing problems for someone who you say has mental issues... That'd make you not a bit fucked up, how? Your comment has some pretty sick criticism no matter how you look at it.
