    <div class="md"><p>Given the large questions about future climate and weather consistancy try shooting for something temperate.   If it gets warmer, okay, if it gets colder maybe that&#39;s okay too.  </p>

<p>Tsunami protection means living higher than your expected wave height.  &gt; 500 ft and you should be good against most tsunami, 1000-2000 ft if you really want to be safe. </p>

<p>A good bunker will be proof against all but the largest earthquakes.   And a good Tipi is proof against even the largest quakes.   </p>

<p>For bad winters it is more about stores and heat.  With the right plan the Inuit thrive in weather that kills most everything.    10 ft of hay bale insulation goes a long way towards not caring much about the winter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Nicaragua.  I lived there for a year.  Its very poor but the country should be very rich.  Once you get your solar panels into the country its nice.  The chickens eat nutritious bugs all day long and then you just throw them some grain here and there.  The Japanese came and fished out the waters over five years ago and now the fish are coming back so it is surprising people.  You can get 10.5 months of wind and solar energy each year and then 1.5 months of diesel or grid energy.</p>

<p>There is rule of law there definitely and the people know what a civil war looks like.  They don&#39;t like that shit at all.  They are very non-lethal although they like to box as a national pastime.  Its definitely easy to avoid it.  You have to watch people stealing your stuff so you always need physical barriers and also a person watching things.  So its a place to have a family.</p>

<p>When you buy land you will need to do things like take two sets of pictures with date of your property and have attorneys sign them.  Then you plant a row of trees as the property line and then it becomes very difficult for someone to say that they were there or do something like move the fence.  There is rule of law there so you just have to be creative.</p>

<p>Every mechanic doubles as a black smith and they ghetto rig the buses to stay running forever.  These are hardcore survival skills.  People will cram into an old school bus and it is all pretty jolly and happy.  I like the Nicaraguan bus system more than anywhere.  At the end of the day it is very difficult to starve in Nicaragua.  Get your fruit trees going, banana tree/bushes start rocking it in two years and then you will have a serious banana problem.  Raising chickens is ridiculously easy.  Beans and rice should be very obtainable in an emergency with your silver coins.</p>

<p>Also you are allowed to carry a machete on the street.  I fucking love it!  Guns are legal although you need a permit which is fairly easy to get.  Its very capitalistic there but with a parasitical government that mainly controls things through imports.  That is why you just roll up on a yacht with all of your shit.  They will never be able to stop that.  Recurring taxes are very minimal there.  Basically it is a land of opportunity if you can have a community of competent people around you.  Also there is some tourism there so that can be very easy money.</p>

<p>There is very little bad types of malaria and dengue since it is so dry.  The mosquitoes are very manageable there and they are likely much worse in parts of the US South than there.</p>

<p>There is an island called Ometepe inside of a lake.  This is the ultimate retreat, although it is geologically active. </p>

<p>Also, use of computer for government is very weak there.  Score.  Land ownership is determined the old fashion way, with the deed.  That is super awesome.  So you, your attorney and the county guy will know what is up.  You can go to Costa Rica and return every three months with zero problem.  That is called being a perpetual tourist or PT in some Sovereign circles.</p>

<p>I think that it is pretty sweet really.  The only thing that I was missing last time was a special lady.  With that it is surely perfect.  Also the Nicaraguans are a better than average looking breed so it is not difficult to find a super attractive woman although getting all the smarts in there as well will trouble you.  I&#39;ve met some very nice ladies with education from the capital city of Managua and I can guarantee that you won&#39;t want to live there so that it is difficult.  The main city people tend to look down on the more friendly country folk and they would find that kind of a life to be lesser.  Keep in mind that I have a computer science degree so I&#39;m not a hardened country bumpkin.  Its not really that rough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh and the earthquakes.  It is likely that in the next earthquake everything will get all fucked up.  That is the downside to a truly libertarian country like Nicaragua.  As for me I would use plenty of rebar and a solid foundation before I put my entire family under the walls.  In an earthquake the sheer forces topple the walls with ease.  I like Nicaragua because I could build things as good as I wanted to.  Its much cheaper to get things done in that respect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree with your point about the women...   I married one.  :-)</p>

<p>We have looked at Nica and Costa Rica as possible living places in the coming years.  I am concerned about the geological activity there as far as long term survival is concerned.  Ometepe is, from what my wife says, great, but a little more &quot;country&quot; than the rest of the surrounding area (especially Managua). Also, the lake that surrounds Ometepe has <strong>sharks</strong>.  (!)</p>
