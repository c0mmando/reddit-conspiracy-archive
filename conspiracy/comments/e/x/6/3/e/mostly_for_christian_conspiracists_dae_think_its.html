        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unn1TX6y6hk">Here</a> is a video putting a theory out there that the Bible has many coincidences with other religious books. Christians think it is because the Devil (which God created) was allowed to do so. I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s also possible (either in conjunction with the Christian explanation or not), that it really is just a blueprint of civilization that certain people either made up or were somehow given and continue to follow these &quot;directions&quot; to the letter. Is it possible that the Christianity we know today is actually a corrupted reverse version of events? </p>

<p>I actually pondered something for days which the laid out pretty well. Why is it that so many people that history paints as very talented (people I immediately thought of were Mozart and George Washington) have almost history themselves? We have no real clue as to who they were. Like, why is it these &quot;great and famous&quot; innovators have almost no background info and thus have an air of secrecy that makes it easy to idolize them? Was this done on purpose? It is providence? It is old, white men with lots of money and free time who have done this with history books and such? Or is it a result of the general population&#39;s lack of interest and therefore lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>One verse that comes to mind is Hosea 4:6 which says :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the Bible is really being used (by either manipulating an already present text -which is probably more accurate- or by creating a text that coincides with the beliefs and myths/stories of other religions), then why have such bits of wisdom and in there? If the Bible is just a regurgitation of different religious beliefs, did these people who &quot;made&quot; up the Bible think no one would read it and thus everyone would fall to the traps of human desire and pleasure? What I don&#39;t get is that this new &quot;fall from grace&quot; is written in the Bible for the &quot;last days&quot; in 2 Timothy 3:1-5.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>

<p>2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>

<p>3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>

<p>4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>

<p>5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is even more confusing is that this verse comes from Paul, one of the most untrusted people by skeptic Christians and one of the most beloved by most of Christian &quot;society&quot; (for lack of a better word).</p>

<p>I personally am curious of Paul&#39;s story. It seems way too good to be true. I have this idea that he infiltrated the Church, posing as a great leader all of a sudden with his inspirational story, only then to undermine the other religious leaders at the time, who had a longer period in faith and who superseded Paul in many aspects of belief.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kinda just spitballing here so if the previous few paragraphs seems somewhat incoherent, excuse me for that. This all seems to be way over my head, almost as if it is too simple to comprehend. I guess this is much more of a calm rant post then a real opportunity to find some answer. Sorry for the mindfuck I just gave anyone who actually read all this.</p>

<p>Edit: I was perusing the &quot;tubez of you&quot; guys and found this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZEfjg7N9lc&amp;feature=related">video</a> which gives a viewpoint on this topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>erm, that&#39;s actually a fact. The bible was completely rewritten by the roman empire to help them control an increasingly unrestful population because of religious conflicts. Before that it was mostly a losely related set of gospels and folklore. They edited the fuck out of it, added some bits and sparkles to please as many people as they could, then shipped it off as the holy truth. </p>

<p>Those same stories and folklore also appear in many other religions because they&#39;re FUCKING STORIES that traveled by word of mouth throughout europe and asia.</p>

<p>They had these scandinavian barbarians, let&#39;s put something in there for them, like the name of Adam and Eve (Askur and Embla in Asatru religion). How about these germanic tribes? They always celebrate some winter-solstice holiday in late december... lets just say that&#39;s when jesus was born, OK!</p>

<p>Historical fucking fact</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are partially correct.  Rome corrupted the traditions as best they could when Christianity became the nationally mandated religion, but the scriptures were not revised.  The textus receptus is the most authenticated document on the planet.   The Septuagint translation of the Hebrew text was in black and white in 300BC, and guess what - its a perfect match to the Qumran documents.  Hey, believe what you want to - I dont really care one way or the other.  But in this case, you are misinformed of the facts.  </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t this actually lend credence to the position that at least some of the stories in the bible are based on historical truth? Being that people used word of mouth to pass down knowledge and history before writing was invented...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>King James cherry picked the Bible to make it more appealing to his reign and then claimed divine inspiration...so yeah.  </p>

<p>The church itself has actively added and removed &quot;gospels&quot; to suit their goals...so yeah.  They kept anything out that would indicate that they were not needed for someone to have a relationship with God, though Jesus held that position.</p>

<p>The Romans rewrote the bible to their liking. St. Paul was not one of the 12 apostles so there is argument the he never met Jesus but still had a hand in rewriting the bible.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Among the critics of Paul the Apostle was Thomas Jefferson who wrote that Paul was the &quot;first corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my problem with him. He wasn&#39;t chosen in the way that the more renowned leaders were. There was no way to actually corroborate his story other than himself and two of his own loyal personal guards sent by the High Priest in Jerusalem. I suppose many look to him because he was such a terrible guy who ultimately turned good but I don&#39;t know, something still seems sketchy. Like that verse in which Paul confronts the Athenians about their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_God">&quot;Unknown God&quot;</a>. He doesn&#39;t know who they are worshiping yet automatically insists it is the God of the Bible. So he literally just interjected Christian doctrine into the belief system of another group of people without verifying and even asking what or who they were worshiping. </p>

<p>I used to place Paul in the same category as Jerry Falwell, a silver-tounged and effective mis-leader.  </p>

<p>But now I place him in the same category as Freud, Roger Waters, Shakespeare or Lincoln.  Highly intelligent, talented and passionate, with very complex and even conflicting motivations, and a conquerer.  He is an expression of humanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a Christian, and I find no greater acknowledgment of, and defense against the NWO than the Bible.  It was my waking up that brought me back to the Torah, the Word, and the Messiah.  Its whats further down the rabbit hole.  I agree with you, too much emphasis is placed on Paul as an independent doctrine, rather than making his teaching a subjective part of Christ&#39;s Kingdom Gospel.  Yes, the NWO will use the Bible - for example when Satan tempted Christ, he quoted scripture out of context.  The idea here is, and always has been deception.  For believers, like myself, its a constant battle against deception, as well as our own subjectivity.  We are living in the last days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the coincidences you note here have been seen before, and ascribed to different causes. One of the most prominent is Carl Jung&#39;s idea of archetypes, that these stories reoccur throughout the world and across history because they are echoes of some shared subconscious.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s some cabal pulling the strings here. Even if there is some new world order or illuminati thing going on now, I doubt their roots go that far back. People and organizations just can&#39;t hold things together for that long. I for one wouldn&#39;t make any sacrifices for the benefit of someone 2000 years in the future.</p>

<p>Anyway, the political background behind the different elements of the bible is actually quite well known. There are a lot of intelligent christians out there who actually research this. My mother is one of them. It goes all the way back to the original Hebrew canons. Various books were edited, selected or tossed out based on the aims of whoever was powerful enough to do it at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I remember that from my AP Lit class in high school (it&#39;s just about the only thing I liked and probably why I can still recall my teacher talking about it). Something about a Hero&#39;s Journey where a protagonist goes on a quest to find something or rescue someone, he is met with unbeatable odds yet someone how manages to overcome them but either a) sacrificing himself for or b) defeating the obstacle in some unusual manner but it is (for obvious reasons) almost never both together. However, in the Bible Jesus is able to do both, so while engaged in an archetype himself, JC is essentially the epitome of archetypes because death was his victory. Very mindboggling.</p>

<p>But back to Jung, I came to the somewhat same through a long process of logic (Which I seriously don&#39;t want to do again), that god is just the collective subconscious of spirits in unison, similar to the &#39;Providence&#39; that the Founding Fathers (who aren&#39;t exactly innocent in the secret society realm) spoke of. So my conclusion, in relation to Revelation, is that the Devil (or whoever) will use this &quot;God in us but is not us&quot; theory and turn it on it&#39;s head to confuse people and deceive them into believing that because a part of God is in them, that they are actually God&#39;s themselves. </p>

<p>However, on the same note, I have come to another conclusion (yeah, hearing so many voices isn&#39;t very normal) that what if Joseph Smith was right. What if the &quot;God&quot; we know was just another person in a previous life (reincarnation) and somehow or another, for a lack of a better term, &quot;leveled up&quot; in this Matrix of the Universe. What if he was a human who reached a higher form of consciousness, who then died and magically inherited his own planet? (It sounds crazy but just go with it) What if Smith, in his shenanigans, was partially accurate? There are billions and billions of planets in the vast expanse of the Universe to make this possible so why not? Not to mention that previous civilizations had many gods so either a) the Devil was deceiving them or b) they knew stuff about spirituality that we don&#39;t know (perhaps knowing that there were many gods). They had to have known something because the Mayans essentially predicted shifts in universal human consciousness, just like Buddhists have (also note how the is symbolism of the Bible which coincides with other religious beliefs (like the Greeks and Romans, which they were conquered by) so either a) it was put there by God and twisted by humans or b) the Devil preempted God and used these symbols in previous civilizations) The God of the Bible says he is specifically the God of Israel. So isn&#39;t is possible that there are really <em>other</em> gods over other nations or peoples? That perhaps He is the one god who beat all the other ones to the punch?</p>

<p>Sorry for the question dump. I don&#39;t expect you to answer all these inquires, I just needed a place to dump them (which it looks like it should have been r/philosophy instead of r/conspiracy. Too late. :D )</p>

<p>Oh and about this:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What if &quot;evil spirits&quot; (e.g. The Devil) are influencing people to do what he/they (e.g, Legion) wants? Would not what those people did be in line with his goals despite all this time and thus all those multiple actions come to a singular conclusion?</p>

<p>Edit: Can you recommend any research/books done by your mother? I really would like to know more about the political background of people who manipulated Biblical records.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now we&#39;re running into semantic problems, so let&#39;s compare the People&#39;s Temple (pretty clearly a cult) to the Methodists (pretty clearly a religion).</p>

<p>Size is one obvious distinction, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s truly definitive.</p>

<p>Instead, consider the actions and attitudes of the followers.  The PT separated themselves from the rest of society.  They wanted only to achieve their own goals.  Many of them considered themselves specially chosen.  They felt exempt from the same rules that applied to the rest of society.  The group rose and fell with a charismatic, authoritarian (even despotic) personality.</p>

<p>Methodists on the other hand, are rather the opposite of these.</p>

<p>For me I think, the truly defining cult characteristic is the degree to which the cult seeks to separate themselves from society.  Also they tend to be crazy.  Of course, the rational response to an absurd world is crazy...</p>
