       Just a Serious Question that needs to be answered....who else better to answer this question, than the guys and girls over at r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is one of the best inventions ever in Human History, and in the last 5-10 years has proven to be a PRICELESS commodity and expand our thoughts on communicating, growing and exploring.  I just think NO ONE man or woman or government or corporation should have the sole power to control it or limit it use...what say you r/conspiracy???
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: This is, by no means, giving this idea any credibility!!!  Thanks to j0phus for pointing this out.  The Internet is fine just like this, and should stay the way it is and also still have no outside influence from governments or corporations imho.

       I realized this 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I quit my job as an audio engineer (working in advertising-yuck), and enrolled in law school, which seemed to me to be the place where I could best contribute to protecting the potential of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things have gotten worse more quickly than I anticipated (legally, in terms of changes to the law, US Supreme Court decisions, etc). I'm not sure where I'm going when I'm done– but this is the one of the most exciting times to be a human being. The possible futures are so clearly visible yet so different from each-other.

       I agree, and those who used to be the gatekeepers and beneficiaries of information distribution are feeling severely threatened right now.  It's not unreasonable to think they may be thinking of ways to eliminate this threat, and the most obvious way to do so would be to somehow cast the free-flow of information over the web as a "security risk" that must be curtailed.

       It seems the general public is being targeted with products that mainly revolve around social media and limiting access. Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube are prime examples of the incoming information holocaust. In my opinion these new products are turning information technology into entertainment technology aka propaganda.

       I think there's even more to these "social media" websites than simple "infotainment" - someone who had access to all that information could generate a very clear behavioral profile for people: who their friends are, what they like and don't like, how and where they spend their time, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       someone would want that information... I don't think one needs to exercise much imagination to figure that one out.

       No, the Internet has not leveled the playing field. What the Internet has done above all else is allow the easy access to credulous information which confirms the biases that people already hold. As even the most absurd ideas have their own niches on the Internet, people are less inclined to have their beliefs challenged.

       On your assertion of credulous information, the same could be said of fox news, or the Roman Catholic Church, or even Stock Market Valuations...i think it is up to the individual what he or she deems to be their biases or opinions or beliefs.  This should hold true for religion, politics or basically anything else in the world.  Information is out there and opinions as well, it is not up to you to decide what information is right or wrong, good or bad, false or true...it is up to the individual and ultimately the community at large to move one way or the other.

       Odds are if you watch fox news then you probably wont stray all that far from foxnews.com. I can't imagine a typical fox news viewer coming across zeitgeist or David Icke and actually giving it the time of day. As Toploader said, people wont go out of their way to have their beliefs challenged.

       I'm going to assume that we are talking about corruption and secret plans to profit at the expense of the public. With that being the case, I highly doubt there would be any plans to abolish the Internet as it would equally benefit these people as well. While it could be used to transmit truthful information it is equally capable of transmitting incorrect information. Truth, in reality, is determined by having the best story or at least the one that sticks with the recipient.
      </p>
      <p>
       If nothing else, they would also realize the attention span of the average Internet user is minimal at best - myself included - and that any damaging information could be easily distracted with porn, chat or free shipping with purchase of $50 or more.

       The internet is supposed to "interperet censorship as damage and so route around it", I say we let the internet do its job. We seem to just stop at arguing, few people put "the bits to the metal" and just go on to use the internet in defiance of those who'd say no.
