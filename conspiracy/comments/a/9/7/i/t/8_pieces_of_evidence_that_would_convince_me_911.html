       This is not to say that these things would necessarily exist, but that their existence would convince me.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The existence of remote-controlled, Boeing 767 drones.
       </strong>
       These would have had to have been designed, tested and built. There should be photographs of the drones, test footage, and probably one or more prototypes. Where are the plans, engineering details, feasibility study results?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Someone alive today who was supposedly on AA Flight 77 or any of the other flights.
       </strong>
       If a cruise missile hit The Pentagon, then the people who supposedly got on AA Flight 77 should still be alive today. There are ticket records and  Airline personnel records showing who was to be on that airplane, but if a missile hit The Pentagon where is the airplane and where are the people? The same could be said for the two that hit the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Video footage of a cruise missile hitting The Pentagon.
       </strong>
       No video footage of the DC attack has been shown, but this would convince me.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Audio or video of the President or his staff discussing the attacks.
       </strong>
       While they could have not used the recording devices used for most Presidential meetings or it could be a lie that all the President’s communications are recorded, audio of any of the hundreds of hours of discussion and planning that would have had to go into such an operation would convince me.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The wiring and demolition plans for the Twin Towers.
       </strong>
       There had never yet been a controlled demolition on the scale of the Twin Towers. The tallest building destroyed by controlled demolition was the Hudson’s Department store in Detroit, MI at 439 ft tall, or roughly one third the size of the WTC. For that, a 21 man crew needed three months to investigate the complex and four months to complete preparations for the implosion design and a 12 person loading crew took twenty four days to place 4,118 separate charges in 1,100 locations on columns on nine levels of the complex. The WTC would have been several orders of magnitude more complex, so where are the structural studies, wiring plans and demolition plans?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Video or photographs of the demolition work.
       </strong>
       Surveillance  footage of trucks bringing in equipment, works hauling it up elevators, tearing out walls to get to support beams or workers installing demolition charges and wiring would convince me.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Written military orders to launch a missile.
       </strong>
       Whichever unit launched the missile at The Pentagon, the actual launch orders would have had to have proceeded down the chain of command from the President to the specialists who would actually press the launch button and monitor its flight. It is reasonable to think that a colonel, major, captain or lieutenant would want orders in writing before ordering his troops to launch an attack on an American, civilian target.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Written operation plans or authorizations.
       </strong>
       An operation this size would have required advanced, highly detailed planning. Someone would have had to order the construction of remote controlled dummy aircraft and authorized the money to build them. Someone would have had to authorize the purchase of the miles of detonation wire, detonators and explosive materials for the building. An operation on this scale should have produced thousands of pages of written plans and guidelines and copies would have had to have been distributed to the people involved in the planning, financing and execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as I start seeing evidence like this, I might believe that 9/11 was an inside job orchestrated by the US Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Quick Note
       </strong>
       Did you guys miss the point? This the evidence that would convince ME. This is what I require. Me. Me. Me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has nothing to do with anything else than what would convince me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, it's pretty specific evidence. But again, until I see evidence of this caliber, I'm not buying into any conspiracy. That is how evidence works. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and what I'm asking for isn't even extraordinary. It's basic evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, these are not straw men or things that are "impossible." These are pieces of evidence, that, if presented would convince me. That is it. That is all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until I see evidence of this type, however impossible, you will not convince me. Plainly and simply this is what would convince ME!

       Most of your requested evidence is based on a singular unlikely theory requiring the perpetrators to be downright fucking stupid...one of many possible 'inside job' scenarios...possibly the least likely for a few items on your list.  Like much of the conspiracy subreddit, you've exceeded your thinking capacity.

       The ridiculous part is thinking we need some sort of permission to poke around.  We already have so many lies uncovered, the motivation for the lie - certainly, incriminating documents would likely seal the case, but nobody involved would have been stupid enough to leave a paper trail.

       People in the truth movement are not spurred on so much by evidence of a conspiracy, but by the lack of evidence to back up the official story. I began to question the whole affair as soon as the video came in from Pennsylvania and I saw only a small crater and a complete lack of wreckage at the supposed crash scene. Indeed, there was wreckage, but it was strewn over several miles. There is no way to explain how the aircraft could have broken up in mid-air and left such wreckage that has never been seen at any other crash site. So I’m a skeptic and I will try to explain my own position on all of your questions.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        There has been work done by the US military in developing remote control for large aircraft and that has been confirmed by the military’s own documents. That such devices were used is speculation however. There are a lot of people who take great pains to invent explanations and then insist that those are reality. I like to stick to the facts and deal with those exclusively.
       </li>
       <li>
        That is a sticky issue. Indeed, what happened to those people? We do have transcripts of cell-phone calls from aboard the aircraft but with the technology of the day those calls were impossible because signal loss took place above 1000 ft. None of the aircraft could have been below 1000ft at any time during their flights or they would have lost flight control. So we know that these records are impossible and that during the period following the time of hijacking until impact we can not account for the passengers.
       </li>
       <li>
        Not only the Pentagon, but the whole of the area around it is under continuous video surveillance.  So, with so much record, why is it that only 5 frames of video were released, and that only after strong public demand? If the official story is accurate the powers-that-be should have been as eager for that footage to be shown as that of the aircraft hitting the towers.
       </li>
       <li>
        I do not believe that GW Bush had anything to do with the whole affair. That is the principle behind deniability. It has been said that it would be impossible to keep such an affair secret given how many people had to be involved. To that I agree, if one supposes that all of those people are US citizens. I think it more likely that a small cabal in the US had knowledge, but that the vast majority are likely to be found in Saudi Arabia or other more secretive and oppressive countries.
       </li>
       <li>
        This is, I think, the wrong question. A good operation does not leave documentation behind. And, just how good a job does someone need to do if the object is to fake a disaster rather than do a good job in which no one gets hurt and property damage is minimized?
       </li>
       <li>
        Again, the wrong question but the right direction.
       </li>
       <li>
        This is a supposition that it was a missile. Given the footage that was released, many people jumped to that conclusion. No investigation was done so we have no answer because we can’t ask the right question.
       </li>
       <li>
        Saudi Arabia would be likely, as would Israel. Both have a special relationship with the arms industry so both are suspect.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Once again, the problem we have is lack of evidence and an unwillingness to release what evidence there is. It should be noted that more money was spent investigating Bill Clinton, for an act that harmed no one, than was spent to investigate 9/11. That investigation was a fait accompli.

       remote controlled airplanes? just ask Dov Zakheim, former undersecretary of defense.
in 2001 Dov was CEO of SPS International, part of System Planning Corporation, a defense contractor majoring in electronic warfare technologies, including remote-controlled aircraft systems, and the notorious Flight Termination System (FTS) technology that could hijack even a hijacked plane and land or crash it wherever.

       Planes are not very dense, and so break and scatter rather then make a big smoking hole.

       Re-reading my comment I see where I generated confusion. And I'm usually the one complaining about poor communication. Slap me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, the 757 is not a very large aircraft. But, we are asked to believe that this light aircraft, which has been proven capable of penetrating the steel exterior of the towers, would leave only a tiny crater. And if, as you said, it could have been a full throttle impact there is no way for me to buy that hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a full throttle impact we should expect to see debris radiating out from the impact site. That is not to be seen. Instead we have a long trail of debis leading to the crater and very little beyond. On a day where so many atypical events occured this atypical crash is my smoking gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this makes sense. I'm hung over after yesterday's Grey Cup game.

       I'm no expert, but steel exterior? not thin concrete and glass?
      </p>
      <p>
       The outside of the building is almost certainly engineered to limit weight, and thus use non-dense materials, just like the plane, no?

       Your point makes sense though, yes.

       This is where it gets interesting. A standard construction uses a steel frame and the exterior is hung from that. Because of their hieght the Twin Towers had to be constructed very differently in order to give maximum strength while allowing maximum sway due to wind.

       Each of the twin-towers can be thought of as being 2 seperate buildings. A central core of steel and concrete housed the stairs, elevators, ducting and other conduits. The exterior was a free-standing steel structure composed of prefab sections. Between these two structures were strung the steel floor joists. The joists had freedom of movement in order to allow for sway without pitching the floors up and down with every gust of wind. (I hope that this description makes sense). Where wieght was saved was in the floor joists. Most of the weight of the building went towards maintaining structural integrity rather than supporting floors. So, we are asked to believe that these lightweight floor joists could collapse and bring down the actual load-bearing structures. Even if the exterior had collapsed as we are asked to believe, the central core of the buildings should have remained standing. Those buildings had always behaved exactly as the designer had intended, until 9/11 when every built-in safeguard supposedly failed.

       What?  Why would they still be alive?  You'd think if it was planned, they would have taken care of this.

      <p>
       HAHAHA!!!  Could you imagine!  A plane hit the Pentagon.  Oh, by the way, the people on that were on that plane are all here.  Oops!  Our mistake.  Seriously?  This is your complaint?

       Why do you need this if you believe that the Twin Towers fell directly within its footing WITHOUT demolition charges?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your complaint is self-contradictory.  It could have been a much simpler operation than you think.

       Do you even know how buildings are built?  There's no need to tear out walls.  Besides, every time a new company moves into an area, they move all the walls and everything else around.

       It did not fall "directly within its footing", but it did fall mostly down. What a surprise, it fell down and not sideways.

      <p>
       No, they need to tear out all of the protection around the support structures. Non-bearing walls are not relevant, of course those are easily moved. To take down buildings they need shaped charges right against the metal, not a few inches away.

       Go out buy the game Jenga. Build yourself a little tower. Pull out a block and then blow gently on the opposite side to simulate wind. Note which way it sways and falls over? Sideways.
       <br/>
       A building with a chunk the side of an exploded 757 taken out of it should fall towards the the missing section which is the weakest. Not directly down. If you watch the video of the second collapse the radio tower thingy ontop stays vertical the whole way down until it's lost in the smoke.

       NP.  thanks for the note.  Your the first person that has thanked me in a very very long time.  It made my day!   I have a lot of questions about why no one was negligent even after blatantly lying to the commission and withholding information.  There is a whole investigation that will never take place because no one cares about who really fucked up.  No one blames the pentagon, no one blame the FBI or CIA.  It makes me depressed if I think about it.  We're happy about blaming terrorists or creating CD stories though.  :(   No one questions the billions we spend on keeping us "safe".

       So we have the lateral energy from the collision. Then the weakness of that side that was hit. Then we have the question of the rigidity of the floor structures (those hit and/or heated by the fire and those not) compared to the strength of the connections of the floor to the core. And somehow you think your intuition of what should happen is relevant.

       You brought up excellent points and in the same way don't refute me either.
      </p>
      <p>
       You refer to my intuition and state some vague nonsense. I liked your comment about the "lateral energy of the collision." If you are as knowledgeable as you sound then you would know that that energy was pretty much used up on impact and the fireball of the explosive aftermath. It would have long vanished by the time the tower came down well over an hour later. Just saying that puts you on a bad footing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're correct in saying the side is weak and you have to question the rigidity of all the surrounding floors as steel when heated to the temperature of burning jet fuel and all the other flammable office clutter does get soft. You also have to question the steel core on the side which the plane hit and was burning as well. The plane hit going roughly 450-500Km/h. That made it a projectile which would have penetrated to the core of the building. I think it even came out the other side a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel when it gets hotter loses it's rigidity, (Also gets harder and more brittle the colder it gets FYI)  and becomes malleable and flexible. Physics and not just my intuition says that there should be a point where, due to the heating of the steel and it's loss of rigidity in a localized point, would tilt towards the weak spot and then "let go" especially with that large of a load weighing down upon it. Even if some of the plane had penetrated all the way through the larger point of the impact would still be a weak spot that would cause it to "tilt over"
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment about the radio tower is relevant because it's a pretty tall straight structure that is mounted to the roof of the building. Before it vanishes into the smoke it tilts may a few degrees. Any sort of tilt of the upper sturcture's collapse would be indicated by it as it would act as a sort of protracter(sp?) yet it stays pretty vertical indicating it isn't falling over to the side as it would be expected.

      <p>
       If you are going to criticize then first understand the science, then understand the claim you criticize. Energy is not "used up". Second, I did not claim that the lateral impact was significant, I said it was not. I listed it as one of several relevant factors to consider. When done you will see, as I said, that the energy from gravity pointing down overwhelms any of the other factors.

      <p>
       No, that is just intuition. You need to model the full system to know what will happen. You are imagining the floor tilting and that somehow this should make the whole building tilt. But the tilt was not large, it was just enough to snap all of the joints holding the floor to the central core. Now the whole floor drops and hits the floor below. And the floor below is more rigid, so the stress is equalized rather than "tilting". And then we drop to the floor below and now we have pretty much equal stress and the thing drops down.

      <p>
       Again, I don't expect it to tilt all that much. It is not going to tilt any more than the floor below, it just may show it a bit more. But mostly what we have is things falling straight down because the force on them is gravity and the support joints have broken.

       I waited three days because i debated actually drawing things up along with the formulas but then i realized something. You think you're right, I think I'm right, we both refuse to see the other's point and will continue to do so,  so WTF is the point.... That is all.

       Is that above that pretty drop-ceiling in almost all modern office buildings there is no gypsum. You can see beams and columns directly. They should be sprayed with fire retardant, but that is easily chipped away. A broom, dustpan and vacuum is all that is needed to hide the evidence for a few days until

       So we would need to see transponder data, radar data, ATC tapes proving this.   If it was an inside job, they would do this, but then we would need evidence of this, and the subsequent cover up.

       I love how you claim to know whats going on, and try to turn the argument around, but you, like many others don't even know some of the most basic facts. A post ago you were claiming all 8 boxes were missing, yet it's been known for almost 8 years that HALF of them were found. Of course "details" like that escape you, but you are so sure of all this other stuff that happened.

       My suggestion to you, and people like you (uneducated on the subjects they pretend to know all about), is to read up on what you are actually talking about, instead of just parroting the rest of the herd you are running with. The fact that you were upvoted more than 5 times for inaccurate information is proof of this herd I am talking about. Your just as big of a sheep as all the idiots out there watching fox news who just believe what they hear, and stop short of doing any personal research.

       I would never ask you to explain what happened on 9/11/01. Albeit amusing and imaginative, I don't have the time or patience to indulge in the full recollection of your thoughts on that day. I was merely pointing out that if you
       <em>
        do not
       </em>
       know what you are talking about, maybe you shouldn't be speaking so condescendingly to others about said subject. Like you did with the black boxes. Spouting something like it's fact, but obviously not checking your facts. In your reply there was just more of these same tired out arguments that are not true, really driving home my point about you being uninformed.

       Not sure what you referring to. Again, I haven't asked you any questions, and don't remember requesting your personal opinion about anything, at any point in time. This isn't a debate or argument we are doing. You were posting bad information, it got upvoted, I felt the need to correct you, you replied back with a bunch of default truther talking points, and then I called you retarded. In this reply I am just reiterating the retardation... still not asking any questions.

       Maybe you should start with reading about what
       <em>
        supposedly
       </em>
       happened that day and going from there. The  I would recommend rereading your truther sources, because you aren't even quoting those right. You seem to have no valuable information whatsoever, but just outdated talking points that you saw in a youtube video 5 years ago. Don't talk about investigation and mystery solving until you've at least read some of the basics on both sides, or continue to look like a moron. It's people like you, PeterPandemic, Phazon, and many others that make the truther movement look retarded. I read the thoughts and posts here because I like to stay informed, and am a skeptic. When people compare all truthers and conspiracy theorists to the retarded crazy whack job stereotype, it's because of people like you. Stereotypes always have a little truth to them, and you are a perfect example.

       Get off your pedestal, haven't asked you for anything, and never would. I only replied to you in the first place because wrong information got upvoted 5 times.

       yeah, i have to join the critiques of most of the people who have already commented.  you have conceived of a single, very narrow fact pattern that would constitute an "inside job," but the chances are that what actually happened was far more nuanced.

       in other words, you won't find these things because they presuppose 9/11 was planned, orchestrated, and carried out by the American government.  the far more likely scenario, and the one supported by mountains of evidence, is that the government, with foreknowledge, consciously and purposely allowed 9/11 to be carried out by terrorist organizations so that they could capitalize on the terror it caused and justify their plans, long in the making, to occupy Afghanistan and Iraq.

       For my own part, I'm content to believe the controlled demolition of the world trade center and the impact of something other than a plane into the Pentagon without speculating about the agents behind it. The evidence I have available gives me no information regarding the who, or the why.

       Isn't this entire post just setting up multiple straw men, and then knocking them down to smear the 9/11 Truth people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Serious researchers of 9/11 raise questions about the events and point at the gaping holes in the US gov'ts "conspiracy theory" about the attacks -- they don't state that cruise missiles were used to attack the Pentagon or advocate the straw men set up in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really had to chuckle about wanting written plans and authorizations. Wow! We can't even get very much documentation that Bush lied his way into war against Iraq -- we have to rely on the British gov't for that. But somehow on this supposedly much more secret and much more dastardly conspiracy, there are supposed to be all this documentation lying around? What color is the sky in your world?

       You seem to have an attitude that the world owes you something (be it some convincing).  Nobody will ever convince you, you have to convince yourself.  If you make your daily judgments on information spoon fed to you (which is what you're asking for, spoon fed information) you will never make up your own mind - it's already been made up for you.

       Excellent post.  We haven't seen anything approaching this in the way of evidence from truthers.  Most conspiracies (controlled demolition, missiles, remote planes, fake passengers) all require thousands if not tens of thousands of people to pull off, you would think some concrete evidence of this would come out after 8 years.

       How about you tell me how many people you think it took.  That is to wire 3 buildings for demolition (the 3 largest buildings ever demolished_, shoot down a plane, fire a missile at the pentagon (presumably plant explosives as well), crash a plane in the ocean, orchestrate a media disinformation campaign starting on 9/11 and continuing till today, invent and implement remote control technology for boeing aricraft (while covering up its existence still to this day), creating nano thermite and suppressing its existence etc.  I would put the number of people to simply rig the towers for demolition at 100 as an absolute minimum, (remember estimates of the explosive required are in the 100s of tonnes) that is not to speak of adjacent operations, such as tower security, maintenance and office workers not seeing anything, or being in on it.  So give me your scenario and tell me how many people you think would be in on it.

       You are answering a question with another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked YOU, because I DON"T KNOW "how many people, how much time", and moreover,
       <em>
        I am nowhere required to answer any crackpot OCT supporter with some half-thought-through question
       </em>
       .

       See, I'm not the one putting out actual numbers.
       <strong>
        You are
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Truthers are saying things that obey the laws of physics as we understand them, as well as asking for a new, unbiased investigation, and the OCT supporters are saying things like, "Well, the plane
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have fit in there (Pentagon)."
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, if it had no engines or tail section, the damage
       <em>
        would have
       </em>
       looked like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the plane had
       <strong>
        two
       </strong>
       big motherfucking engines, and all they found was some pieces from a (smaller) engine than the types built for 757/767 aircraft.

       @Cynice, We are asking questions.  YOU are the one throwing around numbers. Thermate/thermite was found in the dust of the Towers, where it had no business being.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU tell US what it's doing there.  We're pretty sure, according to controlled demo/laws of physics, that the stuff was involved in the CD of the Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like YOU to give us ONE OTHER REASON for those residues to be found in the dust, OK?

       That is the heart of your problem right there.  People who understand physics far better than you do not support your ideas, and have no trouble accepting the 'official story'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you can not envision an alternate scenario or even speculate as to one I think says a lot.  The real reason you're not going to forward a hypothesis is because you know other have tried and been laughed out of the room.  (Typically because estimates of people involved get into the thousands) The new marching orders for truthers is not to answer questions about your theory, (or give specifics, or even mention an alternate theory) but to deviate and re frame the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll tell you this the official story of 9/11 requires about 30 people and about 1 million dollars, period.  How many does yours require?

       This is never going to happen, unless a criteria similar to the OP;s is ever met.  At this point the new investigation cry is the TM's bumper sticker slogan.  I would have loved to have NYCANN succeed and have thruthers have their theories cross examined, it would have been on of the most entertaining things ever.

      <p>
       I understand you have no theory, but your posts betray you.  You appear to think thermite was used to demo the towers...that's one theory.  You think flight 77 didn't hit the pentagon.  That's two theories.  So why is it such a stretch to try and speculate as to what would be logistically required in these two instances?  If these are things that you believe over the official story then construct a narrative with the available evidence and go from there.  Trust me, I've seen many try to concoct an alternate time line/scenario; they all become hideously complex and end up involving innumerable people, in both execution and subsequent cover up.   Like I said before the official story, 30 people 1 million dollars.  The average truther theory 5000+ people, trillions of dollars and constantly growing.

       Lets conservatively estimate 1000 perpetrators (demo crews, media plants, high profile politicians, intelligence officers, foreign nationals etc).  How much would be paid in 'hush money' alone?  1 million per person, 2,5,10 million?  Keep in mind these are people who one would assume are already realitivly wealthy, so there would have to be some sort of incentive.  Then consider the operational budget, tens of thousands of lbs of explosives (if one supposes nano thermite it has been estimated at thousands of $ per lb to produce),  new undetectable detonation mechanisms, media campaigns of disinfo, ongoing information suppression, monitoring of people who know the truth etc.  I say trillions because its pretty common around here for people to talk about Cheney's mission 2.3 trillion in the same breath as financing 9/11, and when you look at how far reaching the conspiracy would have to go, the money starts adding up pretty quick.

       How about you tell me how many people you think it took.  That is to wire 3 buildings for demolition (the 3 largest buildings ever demolished_, shoot down a plane, fire a missile at the pentagon (presumably plant explosives as well), crash a plane in the ocean, orchestrate a media disinformation campaign starting on 9/11 and continuing till today, invent and implement remote control technology for boeing aricraft (while covering up its existence still to this day), creating nano thermite and suppressing its existence etc.  I would put the number of people to simply rig the towers for demolition at 100 as an absolute minimum, (remember estimates of the explosive required are in the 100s of tonnes) that is not to speak of adjacent operations, such as tower security, maintenance and office workers not seeing anything, or being in on it.  So give me your scenario and tell me how many people you think would be in on it.

       Go out buy the game Jenga. Build yourself a little tower. Pull out a block and then blow gently on the opposite side to simulate wind. Note which way it sways and falls over? Sideways.
       <br/>
       A building with a chunk the side of an exploded 757 taken out of it should fall towards the the missing section which is the weakest. Not directly down. If you watch the video of the second collapse the radio tower thingy ontop stays vertical the whole way down until it's lost in the smoke.
