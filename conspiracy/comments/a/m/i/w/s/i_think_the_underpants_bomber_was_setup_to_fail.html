        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Something smells in Denmark.  It appears that every reasonable effort was made to ensure that the panty-bomber was caught.  All that failed - either through sheer incompetence or because someone intentionally let him through.  The failsafe seems to have been that his bomb was a dud.  Obviously, someone wanted the patsy captured and his method exposed - no mystery explosion which could take months or years to get to the bottom of - if ever.</p>

<p>Why?  Someone wants all eyes on airplanes, on this particular method and on passengers from this particular place (Yemen), or others like it.</p>

<p>To what end?  As the great eye of Sauron concentrates elsewhere, opportunity opens where it&#39;s mighty gaze has been averted. From a supposed ally country, by boat or across border, and in some non-personally carried package.</p>

<p>Has it all been a grand distraction?  Are we due a mega strike which will surely set us on the path to permanent martial law?</p>

<p>Who stands to benefit?</p>

<p>If I am not on a no--fly list and there is no other reasonable concern, then these scans should be illegal. One patsy and complete systemic intelligence failure should not trump my inalienable rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree, the argument against this is that since there is no requirement that you fly, you are doing it voluntarily, and that since you know exactly what you will encounter before boarding there is no violation of the Fourth Amendment.  Because they are very clear about what it is they are doing and you make the choice to do it, it is not infringing your rights.</p>

<p>Personally I think that is BS and a justification for unnecessary governmental intrusion.</p>

There really seems to be something fishy about this entire affair and I don&#39;t understand why people are just lying there and taking it without asking a few more necessary questions. It&#39;s not just the sheeple either, but the academics I hear on national public radio, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is strange.  The video has yet to be released, likely never will.  Or has it? correct me if I missed it.  </p>

<p>Kurt Haskell&#39;s wife described another man who stood up and calmly video taped the entire thing.  How does that happen?  That does give credence to the &quot;meant to fail&quot; thing because IF he is part of things, then how would they expect to get that footage if it had been destroyed?  Doesn&#39;t make sense.  As far as we know that guy hasn&#39;t been picked up.</p>

<p>Also the guy who never left Detroit, arrested on &quot;immigration charges&quot;.....whats up with him?  No details, no nothing.... they&#39;re just hoping for the next distraction from the entertainment world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea - I wondered that too. If you want to take down a plane, go to the bathroom, blow off the tail section of the plane. Plane goes down, go kaboom. But if you want to scare people, do it in the open, and get caught. What about the Indian guy that escorted him to the gate, and got him on the plane without a passport? What about the guy filming the entire incident? What about all of the forewarnings that were sent to the US? The friggin dudes father went to tell us even. Something shifty is happening, and I&#39;m not liking it.</p>

<p>On December 24th one company in particular traded a HUGE amount of stock, thousands of percentage points above normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any strategy that involves pulling out lighters/matches out of your pocket to light a bomb on your boots/under your cock is clearly set up to fail. No &#39;terrorist&#39; could possibly be so stupid to have that kind of plan, if they&#39;re smart enough to get to the point of detonation in the first place.</p>

<p>And compiled with all the other gigantic question marks and condemning evidence that&#39;s been provided, this Xmas bomber business reeks of 3rd party meddling.</p>
