I don&#39;t think Conde Nast wants anything to do with 911 truthers since it adheres to the official story whenever it&#39;s mentioned in its magazines.  They are afraid of losing advertisers or subscribers and want to maintain a poltically correct image.  I would expect comments and posts to start disappearing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The canned response is the anti-spam is killing off your posts.  I don&#39;t believe that, though, and have (in other subreddits) found posts blacklisted by moderators.  Log out and then if your posts suddenly vanish then you&#39;re being blacklisted.   Oh, but again you&#39;re supposed to think that it is the anti-spam filter.   Yes, the same anti-spam filter that has had the same exact &quot;bug&quot; for the last three years and mysteriously never seems to be fixed.  Wonder why...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I hate to speculate, but I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that many of these alt reddits are owned by one of the larger conspiracy communities on the net (as in their moderators are the same ones running these reddits) Observe your reddit submissions carefully because if they are a competitor to that site it just goes into a black hole.  In fact our own alt news site has nearly given up on submitting interesting content to /conspiracy &amp; /ufo. Sometimes we&#39;ll use a url shortening tool to make it through but with everything compromised it&#39;s hard to maintain interest.  Thanks for bringing this to light.  </p>

There is only IBM, and ITT, and AT&amp;T, and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide, and Exxon. Those *are* the nations of the world today. What do you think the Russians talk about in their councils of state, Karl Marx? They get out their linear programming charts, statistical decision theories, minimax solutions, and compute the price-cost probabilities of their transactions and investments, just like we do. </p>

<p>We no longer live in a world of nations and ideologies, Mr. ghibmmm. The world is a college of corporations, inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business. The world is a business, Mr. ghibmmm. It has been since man crawled out of the slime. And our children will live, ghibmmm, to see that . . . perfect world . . . in which there&#39;s no war or famine, oppression or brutality. One vast and ecumenical holding company, for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock. All necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused. And I have chosen you, ghibmmm, to preach this evangel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus christ. The conspiracy sub is full of a bunch of ignorant twats. The immediate upvote/downvote is a well documented issue that occurs to comments and submissions all over reddit. I have on multiple occasions seen my comments downvoted in milliseconds, only to have it regulate itself in a very short manner. BTW, sometimes the servers don&#39;t all synchronize at once, and you will get false readings on the votes of submission. But that is probably the evil corporate overlords suppressing your freedom of speech, and keeping the truth out.</p>

<p>I subscribed to this reddit to see some interesting conversation, but it is a hilarious Alex Jones circle-jerk, where every day something terrible is being plotted upon the people, and the end is nigh. </p>

<p>You guys leave me in stitches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As anybody with an iota of curiosity about this issue would already know, reddit reports comment points with a random &quot;fudge factor&quot;, to confuse people attempting to reverse engineer Reddit&#39;s existing botnet filters.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t affect your total karma, it&#39;s just an instantaneous effect.</p>

<p>This is not a conspiracy theory; it&#39;s a fact attested by Reddit, in various help threads over time.</p>
