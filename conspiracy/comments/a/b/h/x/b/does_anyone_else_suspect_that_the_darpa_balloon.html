       DARPA is holding the balloon event to see how many people will think that it's a conspiracy on their part to measure the American Citizen's ability to respond to Martial Law.

       It's certainly possible that this could be a test of our communications capabilities, but it seems like it'd be easier for them to just shut down communications if what Everson says will happen actually does. Some will still find a way, but it would certainly reduce our ability to coordinate and mobilize.

       Shutting down communications is difficult to do completely and it has the downside of too many businesses coming to a hault.  If they shut down every major fiber link and satellite then we will effectively be a third world nation in a short matter of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see this being possible unless we are looking at the US ripping itself to pieces and massive pillaging including massive stealing of copper wires from homes and businesses, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end why would they want to destroy
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       framework that is controlled by elaborate mechanisms that we are just now beginning to understand in any kind of mass?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, in a scenario like that we will be right back to people using radios and sneakernet to get information around.  Then you are back to how well the people can communicate on the fly anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       In better times I would say that this could be a very nice way for our military to help train the common people to be more resilient in a disaster or under an attack.  However, given the current way of things I also now suspect that this is a capabilities assessment of our ability to resist and coordinate troop locations and UAV locations.

       I'm sure it's not quite that clear cut, but rather provides a larger frame of understanding of the hubs in which information is shared, how people organize ad-hoc, where they recruit spotters, what kind of communication methods they use, how much of it is encrypted, how easily people share data about their location or the location of others for a monetary reward... list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the study behind the challenge may be valid for all of these factors. Obviously this data can then be used for containing or countering a perceived threat, but the majority of people conducting the challenge and collecting the data probably play no part in it. They're just doing their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words this doesn't need a conspiracy to happen or a plan to be in place, but the data it provides will be undeniably powerful in both the right and the wrong hands with regards to domestic grassroots organization efforts by citizens.

       I suspect it is a study to understand the role that social networking sites and sites such as Reddit play in facilitating communication focusing on locale specific information and to understand the how leaderless teams of people self organize spontaneously and cooperatively to focus on common goals. In this case, using red balloons allows the researchers to do broad internet searches for citations mentioning 'red balloon" and use that to understand the origin of these spontaneous networks and how they develop into problem solving mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think red balloons could easily be a metaphor for troop deployment event for the purpose of disarming the American public, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be important for the military to be able to selectively shut down the important avenues of communication that develop spontaneously on the Internet without shutting down the entire net and hurting business and the economy in general.

       I really don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am reasonably certain that sooner or later there will be a throwdown over the Internet, so I sure wouldn't be shocked if DARPA were surveying it now in a military sense. It's a world-changing phenomenon and frankly most of the starched suits completely missed the ball, it's all catch-up now and everything's already in place, sucks for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Net makes many people of all nations into a cooperative interconnected network, indiscriminately provides access to the power that is information, and undermines the power of virtually all authorities. It should be considered a precious (and at-risk) civil resource regardless of whether some government happens to be eyeing it at any given moment, because the battles over it have only begun. They know that, so should we. I sure hope we beat the bad guys to the law books, that would be a major step in the right direction to protect it against power-mongering.

       It would be nice if we (as in all people) were all on the same side and stood free and clear to maximize the Internet's potential in society, benefiting all rather than the privileged few, but history tells more shining tales with some very ugly endings. It wouldn't surprise me much.

       You do realize that if the US government really wanted to they could shut off internet access to 95+ percent of people within half an hour...right?

       You can wax poetical about the freeing power of the internet all you want, but the bottom line is that the internet means nothing if you can't access it, and access to it in the United States is controlled by a fairly small number of massive corporations.

       That's the thing; if they do (shut off the Net I mean) that will just bring everything to the surface, it would be utter mayhem, it's a very short term solution with very heavy consequences, and they'd just be damaging themselves. Imagine what people would do, even people who would otherwise play along with any game plan the govt came up with. They
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       'shut it all down', but from governmental, economic and national standpoints that seems abysmally stupid, it's too late for that now. In 1996, maybe; today there would be chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more worried about who will pass the laws pertinent to the Net, because while dead interwebs and civil mayhem could be a damaging one-off, bad laws will fuck us for generations.
