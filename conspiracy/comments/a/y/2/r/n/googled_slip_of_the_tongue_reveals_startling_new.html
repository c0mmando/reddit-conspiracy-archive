        Norman Dodd's frank testimony
       </a>
       on the power of banks and tax-exempt foundations is already a must-see for any serious student of conspiracy, but while watching it again recently, I noticed that Dodd accidentally dropped the name of the bank president he worked for, so naturally I was curious what google might turn up on him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Dodd's statements, he doesn't name the specific bank he was employed at, but he does say that it was a Morgan bank, and then lets slip the name of its president (@9m12s) when recounting his own words in a meeting with the man. The name was "Mr. Cochran."

       Your name is fitting......the startling part is you don't give a fuck enough to do anything about it.  You like being a bitch.  You think its just A-OK!!  Fine by you right?  Well, I take my life seriously. I understand when I am getting fucked.  You should take your existence seriously....grow some balls and use your fucking brain.  See the world jerking at a stead pace bump, bump, bump.......you've grown quite accustomed to it, getting it up the ass, born in a world where you cannot possibly hope to find any of this information out on ground level.  They don't want you to know any of this.

       Quit the self-righteous old man bullshit, cursing the youth of today. You're preaching to the converted, buddy - the only point I was making is that it shouldn't be surprising that this guy was a member of Skull &amp; Bones, or that Dodd's testimony actually stands up to scrutiny. It's not a huge revelation. Now get those panties untangled.

       This is ridiculous. Goat's point is that anyone who's "startled" by this is naive. Are you "startled" to understand that you're "getting fucked" by elites? If so then you're not very with it.

       But what does that have to do with today? A banker Bonesman died 80 years ago... what does that have to do with Norman Dodd?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure he could be a relative but this is a tenuous connection.

      <p>
       If you can find the name of the
       <em>

       Cochran bank president, and then discover that he is a member of Skull and Bones, then maybe you'd have something.

       One of the key points we are intuitively aware of but still have to prove is the connection between secret societies and the banking cartel, It's not anything to just make wild claims about secret societies trying to implement this or that - its about facts and evidence linking the two together.
