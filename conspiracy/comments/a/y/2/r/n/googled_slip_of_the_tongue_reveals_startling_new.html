        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYCBfmIcHM">Norman Dodd&#39;s frank testimony</a> on the power of banks and tax-exempt foundations is already a must-see for any serious student of conspiracy, but while watching it again recently, I noticed that Dodd accidentally dropped the name of the bank president he worked for, so naturally I was curious what google might turn up on him.</p>

<p>In Dodd&#39;s statements, he doesn&#39;t name the specific bank he was employed at, but he does say that it was a Morgan bank, and then lets slip the name of its president (@9m12s) when recounting his own words in a meeting with the man. The name was &quot;Mr. Cochran.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, after a little bit of investigative armchair journalism, I&#39;m pleased to submit to the readers of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> yet another connected dot in the massive web of evidence for innumerable crimes against humanity perpetrated by the banking elite, the Yale obituary for <strong><a href="http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1925_1952/1936-37.pdf">JP Morgan partner and confirmed member of Skull &amp; Bones</a></strong>, Thomas Cochran (pp. 63-64):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like Sha?  I love being a slave!  It&#39;s like, way cool right?  </p>

<p>Your name is fitting......the startling part is you don&#39;t give a fuck enough to do anything about it.  You like being a bitch.  You think its just A-OK!!  Fine by you right?  Well, I take my life seriously. I understand when I am getting fucked.  You should take your existence seriously....grow some balls and use your fucking brain.  See the world jerking at a stead pace bump, bump, bump.......you&#39;ve grown quite accustomed to it, getting it up the ass, born in a world where you cannot possibly hope to find any of this information out on ground level.  They don&#39;t want you to know any of this.</p>

<p>They&#39;re effort to change education has culminated itself in your response.  The product of a now &quot;meh&quot; world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What??</p>

<p>Quit the self-righteous old man bullshit, cursing the youth of today. You&#39;re preaching to the converted, buddy - the only point I was making is that it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that this guy was a member of Skull &amp; Bones, or that Dodd&#39;s testimony actually stands up to scrutiny. It&#39;s not a huge revelation. Now get those panties untangled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is ridiculous. Goat&#39;s point is that anyone who&#39;s &quot;startled&quot; by this is naive. Are you &quot;startled&quot; to understand that you&#39;re &quot;getting fucked&quot; by elites? If so then you&#39;re not very with it.</p>

<p>But what does that have to do with today? A banker Bonesman died 80 years ago... what does that have to do with Norman Dodd?</p>

<p>Sure he could be a relative but this is a tenuous connection.</p>

<p>If you can find the name of the <em>current</em> Cochran bank president, and then discover that he is a member of Skull and Bones, then maybe you&#39;d have something. </p>

<p>Because what you have posted here is not &quot;startling&quot; whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the key points we are intuitively aware of but still have to prove is the connection between secret societies and the banking cartel, It&#39;s not anything to just make wild claims about secret societies trying to implement this or that - its about facts and evidence linking the two together. </p>
