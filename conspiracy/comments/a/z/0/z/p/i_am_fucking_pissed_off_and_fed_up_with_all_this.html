       Is the USA and the rest of the world just going to keep going down the shitter? Even if the unwashed masses woke up right now what could we really do? The more I learn the more angry I get and the more hopeless it all seems.  How do you guys and gals deal with it? To say that I am depressed since 'waking up' is an understatement.

       I've been at this for something like 7 years.  Eventually I just let go and stopped caring as much.  The reason why is :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        i realized there's only so much i can do
       </li>
       <li>
        its up to the masses
       </li>
       <li>
        the masses will eventually get up to speed
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Don't fret too much over it.  Everything is as it should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, mind what news sources you read.  Some of them, like alex jones, will have you on the edge of your seat all the fucking time.

       Too much time on the edge of your seat can make you a nervous wreck (or raving lunatic).  What ends up happening is you go deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole while everyone else stays "ok" - a bad disconnection from society.

       You know what? You're right. While being on the edge of your seat from time to time can be exhilarating, "all the fucking time" is a problem.

       It is worth your time to get out and pretend things aren't FUBAR.  Try and live 'normally' a little bit and enjoy your time.  You only get one chance at it.  Make the most of things while you're here.

       im leaving at the end of the month to mexico. I am buying a chunk of land from my friend, and building a self sustained home in paradise (hopefully making a little community) 
give me quality farm fresh organic food, a sturdy house, power, and most of all, the internet.
then i retire, at 28.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not kidding.

       plus the freedom from the corruption in our everyday lives. no politicians getting to get annoyed with, and no religion going all up in yo face.
peace out

       Mexico is pretty dangerous these days, and becoming more so.  Being isolated in a nice home in an urban war zone also has its issues.
      </p>

       Don't get me wrong. I've thought of doing the same thing.  I'm just not sure Mexico won't have some real issues in the near future . . .

       Doing something similar in nothern Ontario. Colder climate but you get the bonus of being in a much safer country. Also if climate continues to change N. Ontario is going to be a much better location for anything self-sustaining. There are also grants you can receive in Canada from doing something like this, money back from using solar panels, set yourself up as a non-profit, run educational tours to show others what's possible etc.

       Someone said that the America people don't move until they are shoved. You can imagine the event which shoves the masses into a realization they're being fucked and that they want to do something about it.  The problems will take care of themselves. You won't be able to do anything until the masses are shove. So, don't worry about it so much.

       Yeah, you get depressed sometimes... Especially after the thrill of "waking up" fades. The good news is, those moments WILL become fewer and further between. You're going to go through a lot of ups and downs though, regardless of experience! It's hard not to feel a little isolated at times. It just seems like most people either don't care, or think you're nuts, or.. both lol. I say, fuck those people! I like staring at my computer screen for obscene amounts of time, combing through HOURS of "documents" and "documentaries;" trying to separate actual research from disinformation and FEAR!!

       ...It's something to do in between bong rips anyway XD
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a deep breath my young jedi... Solace is in the acceptance that those who awaken do so at THEIR OWN pace and of THEIR OWN volition. All you can do is be there to guide and inspire those who will wake long after you.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...If all that doesn't help, try good weed and Alan Watts. Works for me!

       LoL! Eh, it's not for everybody :) Definitely download some Watts though. His anecdotes and philosophical candor always bring me back to center. Although, Mr. Watts isn't for everybody either! Best of luck!

       I cultivated my despair, disappointment and anger into overall disgust and contempt for the average human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I feel that the average human being invites and deserves every oppression that is dealt out to them.

       I stopped worrying about others' freedoms and well-being and just started focusing on my own.  Money == real freedom (freedom of choice, freedom of movement, influence, health, etc) is basically the conclusion I've come to, which of course is going to not go over well with a lot of people, but then again- that's
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Selfish?  Maybe, but trying to "wake up" others only makes you look like a nut more times than not, doesn't work (they have to come to their own conclusions), and can be a bit arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the whole notion that the world's "going down the shitter"- well, compared to what?  Perhaps we overblow the present situation and paint the past with a bit rosier picture than is warranted?  That's the way I tend to think these days.  I do think there are lots of reasons to be optimistic today- the internet, for one.

       Everybody goes through a rough time when first waking up. It's not easy realizing most everthing you have heard and been told is a lie. You will go through a lot of emotion at first anger, depression and feeling hopeless. Just remember the truth shall set you free. Concentrate on what is most important to you, wake other people up and stay informed.

       Cheer up.  Conspiracies are just for fun.  They're only possible in the same way that it is possible that you are actually a brain floating in a vat of liquid in a laboratory.  It might help to read a book about something many people have verified by experiment, like a science book.  For example, QED by Feynman is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy culture is kind of misguided.  Stories can become popular only because we don't know that something horrible didn't happen or because they make the world simpler.  A much better way to organize information is to do experiments and spread info that anybody can verify.  Imagine that the whole world is a brain but only one seven billionth of it is being used.  There's a lot of potential, and finding a way to organize it is an important problem with many solutions.
