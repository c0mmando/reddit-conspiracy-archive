<li>its up to the masses</li>
<li>the masses will eventually get up to speed</li>

give me quality farm fresh organic food, a sturdy house, power, and most of all, the internet.
then i retire, at 28.</p>

<p>I am not kidding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you get depressed sometimes... Especially after the thrill of &quot;waking up&quot; fades. The good news is, those moments WILL become fewer and further between. You&#39;re going to go through a lot of ups and downs though, regardless of experience! It&#39;s hard not to feel a little isolated at times. It just seems like most people either don&#39;t care, or think you&#39;re nuts, or.. both lol. I say, fuck those people! I like staring at my computer screen for obscene amounts of time, combing through HOURS of &quot;documents&quot; and &quot;documentaries;&quot; trying to separate actual research from disinformation and FEAR!! </p>

<p>...It&#39;s something to do in between bong rips anyway XD</p>

<p>Take a deep breath my young jedi... Solace is in the acceptance that those who awaken do so at THEIR OWN pace and of THEIR OWN volition. All you can do is be there to guide and inspire those who will wake long after you. </p>

<p>...If all that doesn&#39;t help, try good weed and Alan Watts. Works for me!</p>

<p>&quot;Running away from fear is fear; fighting pain is pain; trying to be brave is being scared. If the mind is in pain, the mind is pain. The thinker has no other form than his thought.&quot; - Alan Watts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped worrying about others&#39; freedoms and well-being and just started focusing on my own.  Money == real freedom (freedom of choice, freedom of movement, influence, health, etc) is basically the conclusion I&#39;ve come to, which of course is going to not go over well with a lot of people, but then again- that&#39;s <em>their</em> choice. </p>

<p>Selfish?  Maybe, but trying to &quot;wake up&quot; others only makes you look like a nut more times than not, doesn&#39;t work (they have to come to their own conclusions), and can be a bit arrogant.  </p>

<p>And the whole notion that the world&#39;s &quot;going down the shitter&quot;- well, compared to what?  Perhaps we overblow the present situation and paint the past with a bit rosier picture than is warranted?  That&#39;s the way I tend to think these days.  I do think there are lots of reasons to be optimistic today- the internet, for one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheer up.  Conspiracies are just for fun.  They&#39;re only possible in the same way that it is possible that you are actually a brain floating in a vat of liquid in a laboratory.  It might help to read a book about something many people have verified by experiment, like a science book.  For example, QED by Feynman is good.  </p>

<p>The conspiracy culture is kind of misguided.  Stories can become popular only because we don&#39;t know that something horrible didn&#39;t happen or because they make the world simpler.  A much better way to organize information is to do experiments and spread info that anybody can verify.  Imagine that the whole world is a brain but only one seven billionth of it is being used.  There&#39;s a lot of potential, and finding a way to organize it is an important problem with many solutions.</p>
