    <div class="md"><p>Preposterous!  Why would Israel attack Iran?  It&#39;s suicide, not because Israel couldn&#39;t win a war with Iran, but because it would cause the entire world to take a single unified stance against Israel.  For what reason could Israel justify such a war crime?  </p>

<p>Israel would cease to exist as a nation within a few decades of such a stupid and arrogant move.</p>

<p>The world is used to the big, mighty USA pushing it&#39;s weight around.  I am sure that Israel <em>wants desperately</em> for the USA to engage Iran in a hot war, so that Israel could get it&#39;s geopolitical goals met without tarnishing it&#39;s image or pushing world Islam into a holy war against it.</p>

<p>But doing it itself?  Preposterous!</p>

<p>Well not everything that North Korea did was illegal, does that make their program pre 2003 legal?  I just fail to see how it makes much of a difference.  Actions are what the world is trying to manage not whether or not they sign a document. </p>

<p>Or not as North Korea and Iran have done.  Just because you sign a treaty doesn&#39;t make it all better.  You actually have to intend to follow the guidelines.   India is in the same boat as Israel, they have weapons and haven&#39;t signed the treaty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok let me be clear on this. they already accepted those demand and smoe countries such as Russia, China and even France ( until  they were told to stick to the plan ). The ultimate goal is  to crush Iran, to punish them. At this point Iran could accept any demands made by the US and promise them to give each and every  Americans a blow job every morning for the next 10 years, either way they will get punished until somebody on either side does something stupid and then Oh LOWDY LOWD! Iran will be crushed and put to it knee, at least that&#39;s the idea behind it, as we&#39;ve seen in Iraq and Afghanistan things don&#39;t always go as planned.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all just nonsense and stage-play to discredit and sap power from the Vatican, who has always been the single only political force on earth powerful enough to get in the way of the Kabbalists.  As an aside, the Kabbalists sacred numbers are sixes and their sacred symbol embodies three sixes (six lines, six sided hexagram, six triangles).  The bible discusses this, as these dark religions existed when the bible was written.  These two forces have been in a dance of conflict throughout all of human history, like yin and yang.  The church, out in the open, against the occult, hidden in darkness (before the Catholic church held the position of defender of humanity, ancient Israel and Judaism did, but it also carried within it the very thing that it fought against and eventually fell into witchcraft, idolatry and kabbalism, giving birth to Christianity as it&#39;s antithesis - the Torrah is all about this conflict between those who followed Mosaic law - the ten commandments - and those who fell into worship of Baal, Moloch, Remphan and so forth.  The time of Solomon is particularly interesting).  Things have become more confused.  The bible discusses those who claim to be Jewish, but are not and this is a direct reference to people who claim to be god&#39;s chosen defenders of humanity who follow mosaic law, but are in actuality practicing demonology, sorcery and the Kaballa.  If you ask an average Jew, today, you are likely to get a strange answer about what Judaism is, with respect to the laws of Moses and the Kaballa.  Everyone is confused about it.</p>

<p>If you want proof that the Vatican is not behind this, then go spread rumors about Catholic priests and watch as nothing happens and your nonsense is not censored.  Then, try to do the same thing about Israel, the Kabbalah and Freemasonry and watch how quickly your words get censored.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to see who is trying to harm whom, and who controls the media and has the power of censorship.  It&#39;s done from darkness.</p>

<p>Throughout history, up until Vatican II (after WWII, when the Vatican was successfully infiltrated by masons), the Vatican held the position that fraternizing with masonic religions or any other form of Kabbalah (considered demonic worship and witchcraft by the Vatican) was heretical and grounds for excommunications from the church.  This fight between the holy roman empire and kabbalism occasionally erupted into hot wars;  The Spanish Inquisition was an attempt to vet out the kabbalists as were the Boston witch trials and many other unfortunate events in history, all cases of Christians going mad with fear and the Vatican attempting to purge the underworld.</p>

<p>Your claim that the Vatican is secretly in control of freemasonry, judaism and the other kabbalistic religions (there are many) is pure contradiction.  Why would the church excommunicate what they are controlling?  Why would they allow bad press about itself, yet censor bad press about this thing that they control that they excommunicate?</p>

<p>How are you able to hold this contradiction in your mind?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a ton of information out there, but you have to be patient, because there is a lot of garbage and disinformation as well.</p>

<p>A quick search yielded many different results, but I found <a href="http://www.fixedearth.com/kabbala%20IV.htm">this</a> page that contains some pretty accurate information, in my opinion, as well as citations.  It has a bit of religious bias to it, but most everything on this topic is charged that way.  It&#39;s difficult to find truly dispassionate research about the history of kaballa.</p>

<p>I suggest these searches to get you started at researching the history of the vatican and the kaballa;  attempting to search directly for &quot;kabbala vatican&quot; will simply yield a bunch of nonsense about Jesus being a kabbalist and christian kabbala and other rubbish.  Try these instead:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;vatican masonic&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;masonic kabbala&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;vatican excommunicated kabbala&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;spanish inquisition kabbala&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;boston witch kabbala&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A lot to sort through.  But if you read enough, you will begin to put the pieces together of this, mightiest and most secret, of all human mysteries.  Often, you can substitute &quot;masonic&quot; for kabbala while searching with interesting effect.  Freemasonry is totally kabbala based, so the terms are almost synonyms. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The primary symbols of freemasony and the star of david are clearly visual synonyms - although it is not really clear what the relationship is between the hexagram and kabbalah. I like your interpretation [If I understand correctly] that emphasizes the continuity of mosaic tradition into the christian - intriguingly demonstrated by the adoption of many of the books of the torrah into the christian old testament. The torrah and the bible are then considered to be the written history of a series of revolts by religious leaders (moses, jesus etc) against small unseen occult groups (pharaoh / the money lenders) attempting/ or having already fulfilled their claims on power. Thanks for taking the time for providing the links - I will make google my friend.</p>
