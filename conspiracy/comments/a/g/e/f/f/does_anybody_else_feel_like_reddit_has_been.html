       I forgot, this is r/conspiracy, you not only don't need evidence for claims, you see the lack of evidence as proof. So the fact that the link says nothing about his being a Zionist shows he is a Zionist. Just like my lack of evidence for your being a Zionist disinfo agents shows you are a Zionist disinfo agent.

       Eh?
Plenty of Jews were and have been opposed to the Zionist movement. The Haredi were against early modern Zionism but have been somewhat willing to work with Israeli authorities in recent years. On the other side of the spectrum, Reform Jews strongly rejected Zionism until after World War II primarily because they didn't consider themselves in exile.

       You don't get it, they called him a "Zionist"
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       they wanted to call him a "dirty Jew". But the latter is not a publicly acceptable term anymore, but they are free to attack someone for being a Zionist.

       So accusations of Zionism in your book are now equivalent to racist antisemitism? Jesus, you're a piece of work.

      <p>
       Edit:  Just for clarity.  Zionism is a repugnant, even evil, political philosophy.  Jewishness is an accident of birth or religious choice at worst.  And before you get on any hobby-horse however small, I'd say the same thing about being English (which I am) or CofE (which I try to forget I am).  Zionism would be equivalent to being a member of the BNP.

       Ah, that is your lie. Zionism is not intolerance, no more that wearing a "Go England" t-shirt is intolerance. Zionism is a movement that supports the existence of a Jewish state, just like there are over a dozen Muslim states and so many Christian states and such. Somehow having a single Jewish state is so terrible, but the existence of a Serbian or Albanian state is fine.

       What you say may've been true historically, but once the Zionist movement sanctioned violence, assassinated Yitzhak Rabin and became polluted with extreme right wing Mosaic law fundamentalist nationalists it lost any claim to representing either the Jewish people or a valid political perspective.

       The Zionist movement did not assassinate Rabin. Rabin, and his family and followers were and are Zionists. You seem to have taken the tact of finding one bad person in a group and calling the whole group that thing. But, not every group, just Zionists.

      <p>
       Or how about this, you stop using the term Zionist to only mean that particular group. You stop demanding that everyone who supports the existence of a Jewish state is the vile evil you claim when it is only that small fringe group. Zionism, as it was defined is still quite valid, you are just engaged in a propaganda effort to change the meaning of the term and then attacking people for holding views they don't have. Can I attack you as a Brit because I object to the BND and the BND represents all Brits?

       No, the empty attack claim of "Zionist", when the only evidence is that someone is Jewish (or, more precisely, has a Jewish name or family), is anti-Semitism.

       i downvoted this because the whole notion is vauge, and this post has been up for 7 hours with nobody contributing even an opinion as to what "compromised" even means in this context.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you mean "compromised" by vauge posts with little to no actual content, and a lack of particpation by the person who attempted to start the discussion.  i would say reddit is totally compromised.

       Given that the main pipes at all the major telcos globally have been spliced and monitored, wouldn't it be safer to assume that the entire internet has been "compromised". I mean if we are going to go down that rabbit hole, have you ever considered that the internet itself is a darpa creation and after intial military use was first rolled out in universities, the source of so many dissidents?
      </p>
      <p>
       And really, if you were worried about active monitoring of the "consensus reality", wouldn't you be far more concerned about google and facebook, who have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to capitulate to government requests at the expense of personal privacy?

       But then I up voted you because I kind of agree with your observation.  Reddit seems to have been 'politicised'.  But certainly not nearly as bad as Digg.  I was on there down voting comments on global warming fearmongers and there were a lot of them.  When I clicked down, the vote registered as up, like for about fifty comments.  Then when I started upping the AGW skeptics, they immmediately registered as down.  Digg is totally owned by the PTB.

       Considering that half of Americans think Jesus is coming to swoop them up on a spaceship and another half thinks it's okay to pay the government to shoot them for not paying them (taxation) .. I would venture to say that humanity itself is compromised if not completely batshit insane.

       If reddit and other sites like it, where people freely reveal their most controversial opinions, aren't monitored by the government... then they're not doing a very good job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I value privacy.  But judging just from the kind of surveillance that we know the government does, they're missing out on a lot of information if these sites aren't included in their monitoring.

       In the more mainstream subreddits, there's actually a ton of Israeli-paid users spamming all kinds of stuff. Every time the account is acknowledged as such, though, they just create a new one.

       It's kind of gotten to be a problem. They're way worse than regular trolls. The

       bring the disinfo agents on!  Assuredly there was a time when reddit went WAY to the douche side, and I spent most of my time on Digg (seriously), now it's coming back a bit, as long as there are real people on here it's worthwhile, and hopefully enough intelligent mfuckas to implant a few truther RFIDs in

       Watching is fine: if they are participating then that is a worry. It's been suggested they might become active in some forums internationally, in some perverted effort to warp public perception towards a certain agenda. If that's true they might want to consider how that would be the most dangerous use of their time. That sort of activity generates the exactly the outcome they don't want, as the natural evolution of ideas gets suppressed by their own stupidities and clumsiness and builds to a point they then can't manage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than treat symptoms and attempt to force natural perceptions they might want to do some real work instead and consider that if such stupidity occurred in the finance industry, where else has similar risk been created?

       Do I think reddit and other social networking sites are monitored for certain topics (discussions of terrorism/inciting violence/threats against people)?  Likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think government agents post 'disinfo' and subvert discussion?  No.
