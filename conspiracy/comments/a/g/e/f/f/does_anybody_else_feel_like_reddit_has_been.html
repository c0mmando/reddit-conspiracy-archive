Plenty of Jews were and have been opposed to the Zionist movement. The Haredi were against early modern Zionism but have been somewhat willing to work with Israeli authorities in recent years. On the other side of the spectrum, Reform Jews strongly rejected Zionism until after World War II primarily because they didn&#39;t consider themselves in exile.</p>

<p>And, yet, there have been so many attempt to exterminate the Jews. But somehow you can only find time to criticize the self-defense.</p>

<p>It sure is lucky, then, that the Arab nationalism of Fatah and Islamic supremacy of Hamas is around to protect us all, right?</p>

<p>Ah, that is your lie. Zionism is not intolerance, no more that wearing a &quot;Go England&quot; t-shirt is intolerance. Zionism is a movement that supports the existence of a Jewish state, just like there are over a dozen Muslim states and so many Christian states and such. Somehow having a single Jewish state is so terrible, but the existence of a Serbian or Albanian state is fine. </p>

<p>So what should the Zionists have done in the 10&#39;s and 20&#39;s in the face of Arab violence? Why do you call the Zionists such nasty things and not the Arabs?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>assassinated Yitzhak Rabin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Zionist movement did not assassinate Rabin. Rabin, and his family and followers were and are Zionists. You seem to have taken the tact of finding one bad person in a group and calling the whole group that thing. But, not every group, just Zionists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and became polluted with extreme right wing Mosaic law fundamentalist nationalists it lost any claim to representing either the Jewish people or a valid political perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or how about this, you stop using the term Zionist to only mean that particular group. You stop demanding that everyone who supports the existence of a Jewish state is the vile evil you claim when it is only that small fringe group. Zionism, as it was defined is still quite valid, you are just engaged in a propaganda effort to change the meaning of the term and then attacking people for holding views they don&#39;t have. Can I attack you as a Brit because I object to the BND and the BND represents all Brits?</p>

I mean if we are going to go down that rabbit hole, have you ever considered that the internet itself is a darpa creation and after intial military use was first rolled out in universities, the source of so many dissidents? </p>

<p>And really, if you were worried about active monitoring of the &quot;consensus reality&quot;, wouldn&#39;t you be far more concerned about google and facebook, who have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to capitulate to government requests at the expense of personal privacy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If reddit and other sites like it, where people freely reveal their most controversial opinions, aren&#39;t monitored by the government... then they&#39;re not doing a very good job.</p>

<p>Of course I value privacy.  But judging just from the kind of surveillance that we know the government does, they&#39;re missing out on a lot of information if these sites aren&#39;t included in their monitoring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the more mainstream subreddits, there&#39;s actually a ton of Israeli-paid users spamming all kinds of stuff. Every time the account is acknowledged as such, though, they just create a new one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of gotten to be a problem. They&#39;re way worse than regular trolls. The <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> subreddits get it the worst, imo.</p>

Assuredly there was a time when reddit went WAY to the douche side, and I spent most of my time on Digg (seriously), now it&#39;s coming back a bit, as long as there are real people on here it&#39;s worthwhile, and hopefully enough intelligent mfuckas to implant a few truther RFIDs in</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching is fine: if they are participating then that is a worry. It&#39;s been suggested they might become active in some forums internationally, in some perverted effort to warp public perception towards a certain agenda. If that&#39;s true they might want to consider how that would be the most dangerous use of their time. That sort of activity generates the exactly the outcome they don&#39;t want, as the natural evolution of ideas gets suppressed by their own stupidities and clumsiness and builds to a point they then can&#39;t manage.</p>

<p>Rather than treat symptoms and attempt to force natural perceptions they might want to do some real work instead and consider that if such stupidity occurred in the finance industry, where else has similar risk been created?</p>
