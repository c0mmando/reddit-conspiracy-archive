    <div class="md"><p>Right-wing? Left-wing?</p>

<p>Both wings are attached to the same <a href="http://www.scottishrite-ec.org/eagle4.jpg">double-headed eagle</a>, Gravity13.</p>

<p>Both parties in the US are controlled by the Globalist Elite who have a One World Government agenda.</p>

<p>Please stop being so hysterical. We&#39;re not all &quot;right wing fucking retards&quot; because someone dared to challenge your global warming beliefs.</p>

<p>ProTip: The Club of Rome, a globalist think tank, published documents in the 1970&#39;s that suggested that for a world government to be established, a global enemy must be found. And they concluded that the ideal global enemy is mankind itself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The common enemy of humanity is man.</p>

<p>In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Members of the Club of Rome include Al Gore, Ted Turner, Henry Kissinger, Tony Blair, David Rockefeller and Bill Clinton.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html">http://www.green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html</a></p>

<p>Given their stated agenda to politicize the issues of mankind&#39;s impact on the environment to further global governance... we have a right to be skeptical of the propaganda surrounding these issues.</p>

<p>Please read and learn the background of the globalist agenda...</p>

<p>or, you know, continue to throw a massive fucking hissy fit and call everyone who disagrees with you a &quot;fucking retard&quot;. Either way is cool.</p>

<p>What beliefs are those? All I did was challenge the validity of your conspiracy - I did not make any assessment at all about whether or not global warming were true, backed up, or not. <strong>For all you know, I don&#39;t even support global warming.</strong></p>

<p>Instead, I simply asked you guys how you could refute an entire mound of science based on this skimpy, questionable, hacked email information. And almost the entire reddit&#39;s reply to me was that I didn&#39;t like my sacred global warming beliefs questioned, that I was acting religiously and in denial.</p>

<p>Head. </p>

<p>Desk. </p>

<p>You guys really don&#39;t see how fucking retarded you are, do you? You aren&#39;t questioning my beliefs, <em>I&#39;m questioning yours.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps &quot;beliefs&quot; was a poor choice of words, and you make a good point in that this small group of scientists fudging data does not invalidate all the work of climate change scientists worldwide. I tried to point out to you that this single incident is not the reason that people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are &quot;deniers&quot;. There is a long history of conspiracy theorists claiming that global warming is a tool of the globalist conspiracy, and I pointed you to Club of Rome documents as a key evidence of this. I hope you actually read it some day.</p>

<p>Half of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> actually believes in AGW, while some of us think it&#39;s a (shock!) <em>conspiracy</em>. But we don&#39;t generally call each other &quot;fucking retarded&quot; in this subreddit. Maybe we should start doing that? Would it help our arguments? Hmm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yhea, &#39;they&#39; don&#39;t like stuff like that around here (having their beliefs challenged).  In general the conspiracy theory mind is based on a small set of assumptions (beliefs) that they believe are infallible.  eg: 9/11 was an inside jarb, global warming is a scam (to enslave us all apparently), the nwo wants to kill us all (seemingly contrary to them wanting to enslave us), vaccines cause autisim, moon landing faked etc.  Any evidence supporting these claims (regardless of the veracity of the source) is upvoted and cheered on and reposted weekly, whilst evidence to the contrary is downvoted, and downplayed and people advancing it scorned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have side issues and core issues to the &quot;Restore the Republic&quot; movement (which I am a small part of). Core issues are 9-11 and the Fed Reserve, as these are both means of a non-democraticallly elected form of oppressive deceit and direct control over Americans. Side issues are the use of things like carbon laws, universal healthcare, hate laws and UN Security Council participation which could allow the existing powers-that-be (Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Warburgs, Morgans and all other owners of the World Bank) an even more pervasive control/influence/domination then they already exert.</p>

<p>But see, there&#39;s another element to this. All these discussion sites are trolled by the executive arms of the powers-that-be--they&#39;re trolled by FBI and NorthCom spooks, and occasionaly, a gifted writer or headline researcher will mysteriously die or disappear. Hunter S. Thompson and Bill Cooper to name 2. And as this happens you start feeling &quot;hunted&quot;--you realize there&#39;s big money on the table, and big money has ways of quieting whistle-blowers: away goes the carrot and out comes the stick.</p>

<p>So you lose your sense of humor. And so the posts you see on this reddit, as well as the comments, are offered practically like drive-by shootings. But consider this: what we&#39;re talking about on r/conspiracy are serious universal issues, if not issues which the mainstream media and congress both take egregious steps to lie about and ignore. Nothing on this reddit is sugarcoated. But it&#39;s also one of the smaller reddits--it doesn&#39;t even have a default tab at the top of the site. Therefore, if you want the nicer stuff with all the smarmy humor, go to the &quot;pics&quot;, &quot;wtf&quot;, &quot;ffffuuu&quot; or even regular &quot;politics&quot;. This one&#39;s for heavy-hitters.</p>
