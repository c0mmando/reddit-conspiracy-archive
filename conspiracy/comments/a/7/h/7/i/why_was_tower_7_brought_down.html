       I think its quite clear to anyone who has researched the issue that WTC 7's collapse has the most evidence and least likely plausible 'mainstream' story.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't understand is why it would be brought down.  Assuming that 9/11 was about false flag terrorism....Why blow up a third building when 'they' didn't need to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't say "because the SEC and CIA had offices there".  Ok, thats fine and dandy, but why
       <em>
        specifically
       </em>
       and who did it?

       The most plausible theories I've heard are that WTC7 housed the command center for the operation and that the SEC files for several ongoing investigations into high end securities fraud were there.

       But are you saying the Military Industrial Complex/Government/Cigarette Smoking Man/Dick Cheney was also doing a favor to some Wall Street companies the same day as false flag terrorism?

       Theres something weird going on here.  I think something

       "They" get their terrorist act, why push their luck by blowing up a relatively insignificant (in the public eye) building?

      </p>
      <p>
       Serious question, but including the money that came back on the building insurance, how much would it cost to organise, implement and keep a false flag attack like 9/11 a "secret"?

       I don't think any of us can comprehend how much money it costs, but then again, just operating the military for one day is probably hundreds of millions of not billions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how much it costs to 'schedule' a bunch of War Games that the Air Force/Army/Navy would be participating in, but I'm sure its not cheap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keeping it a 'secret' seems a lot easier now that we've seen what happened.  Regardless of how much or how little the Government 'caused' 9/11 to happen vs. letting it happen, keeping it a secret seems the easy part now.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have plenty of witnesses saying contrary things to the official story, yet the news just doesn't care.

       Well if we consider that $2.3 trillion in the context of the "military cannot account for 25 percent of what it spends" then that's a quarter of their budget? After 9/11, Bush then added "my 2003 budget calls for more than $48 billion in new defense spending".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm agreeing with you that we can never know how much the Government/Defense department 'caused' 9/11 to happen vs. letting it happen, but I'm just saying that the money to pull it off (and the monetary benefits after) are all available for it.

       I think if one asks the question:

       Who are the people that control the Military Industrial Complex, government, Wall Street and the mainstream media?
      </p>
      <p>
       the answer will lead one to understand the "why" as well as understanding the only people they were "doing a favor" for was themselves.

       It was built at the same time by the same contractors. I can't imagine WTC7 being one of the few 70's era buildings not to be filled with asbestos, but then again, it's just a theory I've heard. It's not like I have any sources.

       Hrm, maybe I can research this a bit more.  I'm sure its not a 'secret' if it was Asbestos filled.  But then you gotta ask why that one, and not the other towers...?

       Maybe it was just to add to the destruction and perceived random chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the same question can be applied to Flight 93: why take down a random plane in Pennsylvania?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well everything destroyed, every event adds to the overall tragedy and perceived enormity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oooor
      </p>
      <p>
       perhaps before hand, this whole thing is being plotted out, and someone is like, "If one building collapses, isn't it likely other buildings in the area also collapse?" And so to make it seem like other building are also just falling down as a result of the two towers falling, they purposefully demolished one they had access too.
      </p>
      <p>
       oooor
      </p>
      <p>
       And less likely, but humorous, maybe they just over ordered on explosives, and were like fuck, we gotta use 'em all ... I mean we paid for 'em ... so they decided to bring down an entire other building

       Flight 93 might have been shot down in order to create the story about the passengers who sacrificed themselves to prevent their plane from being used as a weapon.  It gave us the "Let's roll" tagline, reportedly said by one of the passengers leading the heroic assault on the evil muslims that hate us for our freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the WTC attack and Pentagon attack actually happened as per the official story and there was no conspiracy, I can see the administration realizing that covering up the shooting down of flight 93 - even though if they had admitted to shooting it down, they would have gotten away with it because shooting it down would be the rational thing to do - was a good idea from a propaganda point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       If flight 93 was the only cover-up that day I would be a very happy person.

       Perhaps 93 was shot down because the passengers had regained control. That would seem to fit in with the rest of the evidence quite well.

       I don't think its just for random chaos.  Having WTC 7 brought down was barely visible in the public's eye.  No one (allegedly) died, its almost never brought up on the news, and many people don't know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to the image of the Twin Towers falling, and the Pentagon being blown up, I don't really see the point of having 'terrorists' (real or imagined) blow up another building 600 feet away once everyone was evacuated.

       The best theory I've heard is that the IRS had an office there which was responsible for investigating securities frauds, corporate fraud, Enron, etc., etc., and since all their prosecutorial records were lost, the IRS had to settle these lawsuits in terms extremely favorable to the naughty companies, or abandon these investigations altogether.  So there was a lot of $$ for corporations involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: actually to correct, the IRS investigation I know about involved tax fraud, naturally.  I dunno what else the IRS might have been investing (as opposed to SEC investigations.)

       Debunkers argue that the flight path was in the "opposite" direction of NY and headed towards DC. It's actually a long way from being in the "opposite" direction but if you look at a map of the flight path it was definitely headed more towards DC than NY. Note that I'm not saying WTC7 could not have been the intended target. It still seems to me to be a distinct possibility, especially considering in the last few minutes it did change direction more towards NY.

       You have a few things wrong, or rather, Popular Mechanics does.  The NIST's
       <em>
        FINAL
       </em>
       findings (which were released after the often quoted Popular Mechanics article was published) found that the physical damage it received  DID NOT contribute to the collapse.   The final report is quite adamant that fire and fire alone was the cause of the collapse.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "it could cause a vertical progression of collapse so that the entire section comes down."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Except I don't believe it was a versicle collapse of the columns at all.  Pretty sure this was in the NIST report.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Second, a fifth-floor fire burned for up to 7 hours.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Absolutely untrue.  I've read the report, it clearly states that there was only a enough fuel in each section of the building to fuel it for 30 minutes
       <em>
        tops
       </em>
       .  This was also shown to be a VERY liberal estimate of how long a fire could burn in a section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The report clearly talks about the fires jumping and never burning for more than a few hours in one place at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Popular Mechanics article has a lot of its facts wrong and quoted an initial version of the report that later was contradicted in the final version.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, I really
       <em>
        honestly
       </em>
       appreciate your thoughtful reply.  Most people either agree or tell me I'm an idiot without any reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who has researched this issue though, please keep an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as I have said in my original post, I believe WTC 7's collapse is orthogonal to the "911 was an Inside Job!" debate.  Because as I said, even
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       we presume that to be true, it doesn't give a motive for why someone would engineer WTC 7 to go down.

       The WTC 7 thing was really weird.  Perhaps there was going to be a third plane or a truck bomb later in the day and somehow that got compromised so they just blew it up anyway.

       No one, debris from towers 1 and 2 impacted WTC 7, and that is what started the fires.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you will, but there was a lot of structural damage to WTC 7 hours before it fell.

       SEC reports that implicated very powerful and rich men were stored in WTC7.

       Also, the cost of removing the asbestos from Silverstein's properties would have cost an immense amount of money.

       It was built at the same time by the same contractors. I can't imagine WTC7 being one of the few 70's era buildings not to be filled with asbestos, but then again, it's just a theory I've heard. It's not like I have any sources.
