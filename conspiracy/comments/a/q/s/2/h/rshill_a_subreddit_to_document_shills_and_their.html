    <div class="md"><p>I was also banned from the shills subreddit. He sent me a PM saying I was banned... it was the first I had ever heard of the subreddit. I unsubscribed from this <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> months ago, and <em>rarely</em> post here. Most recently I posted here because Xander messaged me and wanted me to read something. Was reading about the goings ons today since I got banned from a subreddit I had never heard of, figured I&#39;d come see what was going on.</p>

<p>I completely agree, this Enki guy reminds me of Peter_Pandemic and his army of aliases. Even if it&#39;s not him, it is the exact same attitude and presentation. I wouldn&#39;t even bother replying or talking to him, he is so far out there that he is either not worth listening too, or a troll himself.</p>

<p>His only criteria for a shill seems to be anyone that doesn&#39;t completely agree with his bullshit. I imagine it&#39;s just some kid, living in the basement, and looking for that sub culture to make him feel important about his life and the world around him. It is all so typical. Life sucks, believe in made up stuff that no one else does, and on top of that pretend it makes you smarter and better. Another self important, delusional truther. (not taking a shot at all CT&#39;ers, just the nuts like Enki).</p>

<p>It&#39;s stuff like this that made me stop reading this subreddit. The handful of vocal conspiracy tards ruin it for everyone else, and make this not a place for discussion, but just a big circlejerk. No one here is changing the world or fighting any real battles like they think in their heads, it&#39;s just idiots posting imaginary information on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably cognitive dissonance with a dash of paranoid schizophrenia.  It seems every few months this happens.  Its funny because I rarely even post, and when I do, I will almost always source my opinion.  I have my voting history public, and I rarely downvote comments.  I submit on topic stories yet I&#39;m a &#39;shill&#39; because I don&#39;t sucumb to group think.  When ever I press for proof or even examples of me being shill/disinfo/centcom etc none are ever given.

<p>But the lack of proof ever being given is what makes these threads forgettable. Something set off the OP and he&#39;s not really telling. Without proof of us being shills, the regulars likely ignore this feeling &quot;oh yeah, we knew this whole time&quot; and just go on with their posting.</p>

<p>Nothing substantial changes out of this outburst of social drama because it&#39;s not really about us but about reminding other members of the conspiracy subreddit to be wary of outsiders, an integral part of their identity.

    <div class="md"><p>Going by Turner&#39;s conceptualizing of it, there are four stages to social dramas.</p>

<p>First, relations within the group have to break down which could easily happen in a big tent movement such as conspiracy theorists. People have different interests, views on something integral to the group such as 9/11. The every-day strategy for dealing with this is to blame it on disinfo or external factors, but that eventually fails. So the next act is try to remove people at odds with the perception of the movement and its well-being. </p>

<p>This is what they&#39;re trying with the subreddit nonsense. But there are two possible outcomes. Either the group returns to the old status quo by not heeding the subreddit or they acknowledge that ostracization and removal is necessary and new arrangements are made such as the continuation of the subreddit. Either way, the exercise serves to assert the identity of the members.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing as conspiracies often border on and become established folklore, what is a factual conspiracy? </p>

<p>Often conspiracy theories target entities such as big corporations. Take price-fixing for example. People will assert that this is a conspiracy when in fact price-fixing improves profits, an acknowledged goal for businesses and thus fulfilling the structural role we as a society expect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am saying, it is not outlandish to consider that a group of people would &quot;conspire&quot; for control, even on a global level. Price-fixing is not really something I would call a conspiracy, more like a strategy. </p>

<p>I would think that a clandestine coup d&#39;état would not be something that could be written off as an impossibility. Or the coined &quot;false flag&quot; to enter a war. I hold these possibilities open not because I contain some information the rest of the world does not. I would be more surprised to learn that these things were NOT being attempted. But in the chance you DO have some incriminating information... what do you do? Will shouting that buildings don&#39;t fall at free-fall speed really help?</p>

<p>There is only one &quot;conspiracy&quot; that I have no doubt is true. The media is too centered to really be effective for its needed purposes, and the ownership structure has conflicts of interest abound. We are not getting the full story on anything, and they know it and like it that way.</p>

<p>First point, that was my nice way of introducing myself to a community I would like to participate in. Obviously you have no interest in welcoming me, and feel the need to be confrontational. Good luck getting ANYONE to listen to you with an attitude like that.</p>

<p>Second point, I know what shill means, but here it appears as if it is being used as anyone who does not believe in the group&#39;s consensus. It seems like the point of having a forum like this is for some healthy debate and sharing of information. I am simply stumped as to why people who are &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; for lack of a better term would start a blacklist. Kind of goes against the spirit of the whole thing... there is no proof that the accused are anything other than people with a different opinion. I relish those people, because otherwise I lose my footing with reality and become plain paranoid.</p>

<p>I apologize for invading your space. Not really feeling like participating anymore. THAT is how I will help myself, avoiding jerks.</p>

<p>And you&#39;ve ascertained this how? Have you gone back and read 8 months of comment history from Herkimer, cyince, matts2, and NotTheFather? If not, you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Yes, this is the point. Not <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/arhu8/rconspiracy_where_if_you_actually_believe_in_a/c0j0nve">psycho-analyzing and attacking people</a> who post links with information the above stated users have to attack as part of their jobs.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><a href="http://reddit.com/r/shill">/r/shill</a> is not a blacklist, it&#39;s a forum to ascertain who is shilling on reddit. Any shills are thus blocked from that subreddit. These identified shills, however, can still post as much as they like in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but now they&#39;ll be disclosed as shills.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Go to <a href="/r/shill">/r/shill</a> to assess the proof.</p>

<p>No apology necessary.</p>

<p>So because one person tells you to buy a dictionary, now you don&#39;t feel like participating?! Yeah, that&#39;s plausible...</p>

<p>Great point, Hugh. And I am careful about this. I disagree with people all the time in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>... But there are people that actually <em>care</em> about the content, and don&#39;t resort to character attacks and citing things off fact sheets supplied to them by whomever they are &quot;working&quot; for.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I had two encounters with seemingly legit <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users, they were treated with dignity, respect, and thus I answered their questions.</p>

<p>The shills on the other hand, I will not engage them in a fact fight, because they don&#39;t care. I can spit fact after fact, evidence after evidence, but it will never convince them. The reason we are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is because these ideas rely on a preponderance of evidence and &quot;connecting the dots&quot;, not easily reproducable, testable, and proven scientific research. There is ALWAYS an angle to argue against conspiracies, and they will just keep arguing without considering ANY of the evidence you provide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanted to let you know I am not trying to be petty by hitting some arrow to spite you. </p>

<p>Even though my first impression of you was that you were rude and abrupt, I can understand now why you would be sensitive. You obviously are very passionate about informing people of the dangers that are lurking in our collective apathy. I am sure having some random person like me come in and play devil&#39;s advocate for someone you don&#39;t see eye-to-eye with or feel may be a paid disinformation agent would inspire mockery and disdain. </p>

<p>I have encountered this kind of staunch opposition as well, of people who lack the consideration to listen. I, like you, have a pet cause. I worry that people who are aware of various &quot;conspiracies&quot; discredit THEMSELVES by not staying focused on the more plausible issues. As soon as demonic rituals are brought up, it makes any mention of Bilderbergs or Trilaterals seem like a childish fantasy. If we are really interested in spreading information, we need to work just like these other well-oiled propaganda machines and refine our messages.</p>

<p>I do admire your commitment to outing potential shills, but I worry it does little to stop them. Instead, a focused and repeated message will win more hearts and minds. Fire with fire.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see why. Trilaterals and Bilderbergs are well-documented (not like the rituals aren&#39;t, but whatever).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course it won&#39;t <em>stop</em> them. It will just frustrate them minimally, and maybe alert a few legitimate users that this is going on.</p>

<p>Be well Hugh! Thanks for the detailed replies.</p>
