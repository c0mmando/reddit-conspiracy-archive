        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now I think r/conspiracy is awesome but the only things holding it back is the distrust, misconception and criticism that seems to be all too prevalent here.</p>

<p>We could do a million things to ameliorate this. We could all learn to accept criticism a little better, even be gracious about it.</p>

<p>We could allow actual debate, down voting without offering some kind of response should be frowned upon.</p>

<p>We&#39;re a pretty diverse crowd here and it&#39;s time we started working together together to ram the truth into the ears and eyes of those who would see it and use it to the cut the throats of those who would hide it.</p>

<p>The wool is pulled over all our eyes, we only think we have answers, really all we have is the unanswered questions. This world of conspiracies only makes up a tiny fragment of an all pervading illusion, you could call it a veil that clouds our judgment or a curtain that prevents us from seeing inside ourselves, much less inside the outer reaches of consciousness....</p>

<p>Who can say otherwise? Who can prove me wrong without ever having been wrong?</p>

<p>I think 9/11 was some kind of inside job, I think the US gov is sitting on top of alien technology,, that Jews own a disproportionate amount of MSM... i even think it&#39;s more than possible that an ancient cult created/infiltrated all major religions so well and so long ago that we don&#39;t even have a clue about a way of life that was originally our birth right.</p>

<p>Considering all the books burnt or otherwise lost, and all the information being held under lock and key and all the cultures that have been destroyed, languages and entire ways of life... with all that in mind you would think we could all at least try and learn from one another. Well thats enough of my rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>eye witness testimony.... or how about this, I&#39;ve known a few professional people in various fields, one a doctor who not only follows the conspiracy world, but is adamant that aliens exist and are among us.
 He is an exceptionally smart man who has received death threats and is now in hiding. Formally being a surgeon who did autopsies.</p>

<p>I know another guy who&#39;s job it is to run into collapsing buildings and prevent them from collapsing, he told me that in his training a teacher told the whole class that the official story of 9/11 was total bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve even received death threats on the day of a massive protest i helped organize, 3 other organizers all received death threats the same day. We were protesting the SPP or security prosperity partnership of north america. At the protests we saw agents taking pictures of our faces... it&#39;s all very crazy.... the proof is in the pudding.</p>

Why post a story from the NY Times, about a verifiable conspiracy, with a verifiable connection to the CIA, and then just make up a headline and flip the facts. The sad thing is it&#39;s the number 4 story on r/conspiracy at the moment. This is how we end up parroting stupid euphemisms at each other about kool-aid and tin foil hats, instead of informing each other and uncovering the conspiratorial nature of most evey aspect of our collective lives. </p>

I don&#39;t think there is any bias here against <em>jews</em>, however. I think you&#39;ll find just as much distaste for actions of the christian right.

    <div class="md"><p>As far as r/conspiracy goes I see what you are saying. I could reference the recent story about bible verse references on weapons, however that appeared on the main I think. There in lies the problem really. It&#39;s very much understood that Christian groups operate with-in the US government, and because of this, people don&#39;t seem to think it belongs in r/conspiracy. This is what I&#39;m saying, somehow the word conspiracy now means something that is unverifiable and outlandish, when really it&#39;s how every government operates, by conspiracy. </p>

<p>Agreed 100%</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure thats the best attitude.  Think to the many religions that have tried to &#39;ram the truth down your throat&#39;.  Does it make you more eager to listen to them or less?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>really all we have is the unanswered questions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I respectfully disagree.  We all have a shared frame of reference for observing the world, and from that we can have evidence that supports a theory of the truth.</p>

<p>What would help in relating to the mainstream, is a careful separation between our opinions and our facts.</p>

<p>I <em>know</em> there is evidence the government lied about 9/11.  Check my comment history if you want pages of evidence on why WTC 7 didn&#39;t fall due to damage from the twin towers or from fire.</p>

<p>That however, doesn&#39;t give me evidence that the government/CIA/mossad actually orchestrated the attacks.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> its likely that they did to some extent, but thats not even really a theory, just one possibility.</p>

<p>When we start blending what we think and what we know together, it destroys our credibility as a whole.  It allows detractors to point to something that we don&#39;t have evidence for, and use it as proof our whole argument is flawed.  </p>

<p>Instead, when we present a clear distinction between facts based on evidence and opinion, we actually share knowledge and illuminate truth.  </p>

<p>True, but doesn&#39;t mean evidence doesn&#39;t exist.  I guess each of us has to decide if we&#39;re here to shoot the shit and bitch about possibly real (or possibly imagined) conspiracies, or if we&#39;re going to work with what little knowledge we have, and attempt to gather more knowledge in order to spread the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good luck with the trying to convince a mostly atheist internet culture that religions of the world each have their own little bits and pieces that all seem to have similar symbolical themes, those being your world trees/crosses, sacred geometry/platonic solids, your dragons/serpents, zodiac, pyramids, obelisks, eyeballs and winged discs. 
Then there&#39;s the whole thing with unidentified flying stuff in the &quot;other&quot; books of the bible, Hindu vimanas, and even murals in Thai Buddhist temples of people appearing in &quot;portals&quot; in the sky watching the chaos below the world tree. 
Heck even Warcraft 3 main story is about fighting over a fecken world tree. The world tree which can be interpreted as the period of time around 2012 when it is all lined up forming a cross in the sky, allowing energies from the galactic leyline to possibly jack our shit up. (as if that is not what is going on right now since the 80&#39;s)</p>

<p>This of course is not my interpretation, but of E.J. Clark and B. Alexander Agnew that has already done the work of trying to piece together a singular story of the &quot;creation&quot; and cyclical cataclysmic events.</p>

<p>The same symbols and archetypes appear everywhere in modern media, movies, anime, video games, commercials, ect. Also, in literature, called &quot;the Hero&#39;s cycle&quot;, which seems to be a microcosm of the same fecking story told over and over, rehashed and recycled countless times for no reason at all apparently, subliminally drilled into your fucking skull throughout your entire existence because, to make it simple, they are just stories/symbols that have no scientific significance whatsoever and are not worth your time to even bother looking at because everything involving religion or anything ancient is old worthless crap manufactured solely for evil manipulators&#39; gain and that for no scientific reason is constantly shown to you every day but means nothing at all because it is just some boring religious stuff about made up phantom sky patriarchs. No doubt out to obfuscate the efforts of our glorious final arbiter of truth and wisdom that is science! (I&#39;ll probably be burned at the stake for making fun of atheist&#39;s scientific zealotry, but you have to have moderation! damn trans humanist cyborgs, which would be pretty fucking cool I must say.)</p>

<p>Then again symbols only have value if you apply meaning to them, but honestly why would so many ancient cultures bother with making them in the first place? 
Just those silly Aztecs, Olmecs, Mayans, Christians, Muslims, Jews, Gentiles, Freemasons, Rosicrucians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Nordics, Celtics, and other ancient peoples out there, that gathered together one day and decided: &quot;hey we are going to troll the entire modern scientific community thousands of years in the future with our obscure ancient texts and symbols causing a great stirring of the cauldron. One monolithic concerted effort to crush science of course, that is all, nothing else to see here, back to your human sacrifices and star charts.&quot; /PsychoRANT</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I would not say I&#39;m an atheist, and I haven&#39;t seen Jesus camp but I generally know what it is about. I&#39;m sure I would be throwing up at some point while watching it.</p>

<p>The way I see it, I am a part of the universe able to consciously alter other parts of the universe, even by simple observation. The ability of creation is an inherent feature of this existence.</p>

<p>The idea of a singular master creator, is not unlike a fractal. Something simple (like a tetrahedron) that can spawn infinite complexity. A symphony of voices divided up from the one, like some sort of large explosion. To make it even more weird, atoms are 99.9% empty space, so what is solid anyway? </p>

<p>If you look at cymatics, it seems to be the best example of the ancient world &quot;leaking&quot; into the world of science. Where the higher the frequency you apply to the material the more complex of a pattern you get, with sacred geometries/platonic solids included. So based on that there has to be unfathomably high frequencies resonating in space/time to generate all the complexity we see on a daily basis, creating divisions, standing waves, in empty space.</p>
