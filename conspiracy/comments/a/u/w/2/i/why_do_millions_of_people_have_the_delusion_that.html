       I don't believe faith will be the end of it but religion. The devotion which religion breeds. Lack of logical thinking opens way to gullibility and doing as the government says without question.

       WOW.  Way to make this an attack on religion.  Responsible faith doesn't ignore reality or pawn off responsibility on imaginary creatures.  The tendency to do that is a human flaw, not in inherent downfall of faith in general - many people with religious faith have also accomplished amazing feats of generosity and achievement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather say that we as a society have become so accustomed to  handouts and easy wealth that it's easier to eat our Cheetos in front of American Idol and assume our government is gonna make it all better than to take responsibility for our own laziness.  The brainwashing involved here is not restricted to religion - and making such a limp attempt to divert the blame is more likely to add to the mess, thank you very much.

       It's the path of least resistance that has been setup for them.  The people are groomed from birth to accept all this.  The real thinkers, the non-conformists become outcasts or get ridiculed.  The system is being taught to maintain mediocrity and dependence.  People don't realize that their thoughts are not their own but implanted there through mass media while their TV lulls them to sleep.

       I think you should rephrase these types of sentences, and not use words that imply forceful changing of someone's thoughts. That's wrong.. Rather you should try to show that it's people's willful ignorance and misinformation that are the cause, which is both accurate and not unnecessarily alarmist.

       People like to believe in "saviors" cause it's been brainwashed into them at birth.  They think some white knight will come out of the woodwork, spend a day and his valuable time and come save people he doesn't know who are part of the problem till they become part of the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       People fail to realize that no one will save them.  People must save themselves.  Yes, believe it or not, you have to be your own Jesus.  The dumbest of the dumb will call this blasphemy cause you just might be considering yourself god or God[which is quite absurd anyways].  Either way, no mythical creature sitting in the sky who noticed the tire marks on your soiled skivvies is going to break sweat over you or the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       So these idiots will sit idly by, as life passes them by, they will sit and cry, and still ask why, but will they ever try...?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a god, he'd be disgusted by the compliance and the lack of self respect people have that collectively give them the shit hole that they live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's much deeper than this, but I think I'll just leave it shallow and short and get the usual flames, but at the end of the day most of us know what must be done.  Fear is a great ally to have though...

       That's interesting. If you refuse to buy Apple products Steve Jobs won't come to your door and stick a gun in your face. However, if you ultimately refuse to pay collectively half of your income to corrupt politicians (taxation) you are thrown in prison at the threat of gun point. It seems to me the government is the slave master and the slaves keep each other down.

       In my opinion left unchecked by government, companies would grossly pollute the water and air, charge me to drive on their roads, charge me whatever they wanted for gas, create false shortages of food, control the media to scare me into getting swine flu vaccines.

       The largest polluter of US soil is the US military bases. You are being forced to pay for roads through forced taxation. The government already creates false shortages of food through farm subsidies that pay farmers not to grow certain produce. The government already dictates the media wavelength via the FCC. One main purpose of the government is to scare the public about Bin Laden, the climate, and anthrax and presents themselves as your savior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your argument is a logical fallacy. You are saying that since people can be bad we need to give people a monopoly on the use of force (government) over other people.

       Without government there would be no way to end the FED. You might argue that the government created the FED, not true they only allowed this power to be taken from the government. Without government the FED would exist on its own.

       Well, we have these things called society and the rule of law. Laws are passed by those few hundred people, and the majority adheres to them because of the aforementioned things.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you break the law, you suffer the consequences unless you can convince a large enough number of people the law is wrong, who will then seek to shed the law by electing different leaders, protest, and other avenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society and laws are arbitrary constructs that we adhere to for the sake of community, because in most cases the benefits of cooperation outweigh the benefits of isolation
