    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always thought this point rather interesting.  I remember being in 6th grade and listening to Bill Hicks say something along the lines of:</p>

<p>&quot;What will happen to the arms industry when we realize we&#39;re all one?! HAHA! It&#39;ll ruin the economy!  The economy that&#39;s FAKE anyway!&quot;  </p>

<p>I thought &quot;<em>hmmm...what does he mean by</em> fake..&quot; and slowly my descent down the rabbit hole began.  The realization that the economy is just a collective delusion we all agree to believe is real is a pretty big mind fuck for an 8th grader. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>some people go their whole life without realizing these things, a lot of these people are pretty bright educated individuals with a piece of paper proving their intelligence and everything.</p>

<p>The culture war is complete bullshit but so many people buy into it even people on the &quot;right side&quot; of things. Atheists blame religion, Feminists blame men, Democrats blame Republicans, Liberals blame FOX, tea baggers blame socialism, socialists blame capitalism, but nobody wants to look in the mirror and take responsibility for themselves and question the beliefs they hold dearly. It seems very few people know what the roots of our problems are even though they&#39;re right there in front of us.  </p>

Also, as we get older and things continue to change ever so slowly, it gives the younger generations more time to accept the situation we are all in.  The bottom line is that most of us in the U.S. are not desperate enough to do anything meaningful about it, other than maybe write our representatives in government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically, it is &quot;legal&quot; counterfeiting. The Federal Reserve system creates money out of thin air. Imagine if you could simply type your own balance into your bank account. You would be arrested and thrown into prison. However, when the banks that comprise the Federal Reserve system do this the media calls it quantitative easing or the setting of interest rates. They also use fractional reserve banking in which they loan out many times more money than they actually have on their account balance sheet. They create this fiat money which is loaned out and must be paid back at interest. It is a system where the nation can never get out of debt and the central banks eventually hold sway over all tangible assets. </p>

<p>Also, when you have time I highly reccomend you watch that entire video. It will better explain how the system works as it is created by professional economists. The Federal Reserve system is complicated by design to keep people from questioning it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The money in your wallet is Federal Reserve notes. The &quot;Federal&quot; Reserve is comprised of twelve regional privately owned banks and numerous other private US banks. The production of the currency is farmed out to the Department of the Treasury. The Federal Reserve creates credit expansion of which these physical notes are one part of. In counterfeiting I mean the ability to create at will a money supply/credit expansion which the public is forced to use. </p>

<p>There is supposedly gold plated tungsten floating around. Is that the counterfeiting they are referring to or that paper currency itself is a comparison of a counterfeit gold.</p>

<p>Or are they printing a separate money system that they are trading amongst themselves.</p>
