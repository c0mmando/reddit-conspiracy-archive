       Upvoted because I agree with you.....but at the same time, spend a few minutes over at Democratic Underground.  What was the domain of the Hope &amp; Change Kool-Aid drinkers just a few months ago now shows a high percentage of commenters believing our country has been taken over by corporate-fascists, that Obama is an industry shill and should be impeached, Ron Paul was right all along, a 3rd party in 2012 is our only option, etc. etc. etc.

       Hmm...valid point.  I do however tend to consider
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       to be more populated by "the masses" based on the kinds of postings that I'm used to seeing there (a lot of stuff reflecting the mainstream media message of the day, more or less).
      </p>
      <p>
       I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       this is going on elsewhere as well, but it's harder to tell, because I don't pay as much attention to other "barometers".

       My pleasure (ignore the "shilltard" comment- you do this subreddit a great service by asking the questions and challenging bullshit).  These are the top stories that grabbed my attention- usually stuff like this doesn't see the light of day there, and as of now these are in the top 15:

       I don't know if you remember this little exchange you and I had a little while ago, but I'll remind you, just for fun :) :

      <p>
       Anyway, I really do get the sense that this is a trend that will continue to intensify, and in fact it seems to be on an exponential curve.  I'm not going to go as far as to say that I see a full blown revolution in the making, but I think we're in for something at least akin to what happened in the 60s.  It should be interesting to see what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       I'd also like to point out that:
      </p>
      <p>
       (a)  This has been a general trend over the past few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b)  Today's top posting aren't just about the supreme court ruling, but touch on a broad range of "conspiracy" topics (even though, admittedly, many of the postings use that ruling as a springboard into such discussions).

       Shilltard? I'm asking for a thread or two since I don't frequent the subreddit in question so I have no idea what to expect as far as posting behavior. The bulk of current postings are about the SCOTUS decision which probably has to do with it being a hot emotional topic.

       There WILL be changes, but it's up to us as a whole what those changes will be.  We are at a crossroads for the destiny of the human race, it's up to us which path we take.  That's what 2012 is all about, it's the point at which humans as a whole need to decide which direction our species takes.  The "powers that be" want to keep us in constant fear, because that is what is needed for the nwo.  On the opposite end of the spectrum we could also create a "uptopia".  Realistically, we will probably land somewhere in the middle, but it's completely up to us!  The choice is love or fear.  Fear will create the nwo, love will create a uptopia.  The uninformed will be mislead to the fear, so it is up to those of us that are awake to spread the love.  There really is a war going on, good vs. evil.  If we don't fight the war we lose by default.  Spread the message of love if you want a good world for the generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't wait for 2012!  The next couple years leading up to 2012 will be the deciding time, so don't just wait for 2012, start spreading love now if you want humanity to have a chance.  All species must go through this test to enter the greater community, but it's been said we are behind.  If we want a chance to survive this test we must spread the love and forget the fear.  Think of our future generations, they would be slaves to the nwo, so we MUST defeat it because they don't deserve that.  You need to realize you've been "programmed" to not believe people like me, but just listen to your heart.  LOVE or fear?  Which do you choose?
