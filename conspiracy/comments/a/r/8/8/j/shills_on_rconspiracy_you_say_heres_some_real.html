<p>Since 2005, schools and political party organizations in the People&#39;s Republic of China are recruiting paid-per-comment bloggers countering unfavorable information on websites, bulletin boards, and other internet-accessible sources; they are collectively known as the 50 Cent Party.</p>

<p>In August 2006, a science journalist for the Wall Street Journal revealed that a YouTube video, &quot;Al Gore&#39;s Penguin Army&quot;, which was claimed to be an amateur work, in fact came from the computers of DCI Group, a Washington, D.C.-based PR firm whose client list includes ExxonMobil and General Motors.</p>

<p>Scientologists have a long history of shilling on the Internet. One only has to take a quick look at the Amazon reviews for Dianetics to see this in action:</p>

<p>Case Study: Office of Strategic Influence</p>

<p>The Office of Strategic Influence, or OSI, was planned as a center for the creation of U.S. propaganda materials, for the stated purpose of misleading enemy forces or their civilian populations for &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot; in 2001. It may surprise some that propaganda is a part of a modern wartime strategy but despite a public outcry which shut it down, it resurfaced under another name .</p>

<p>&quot;And then there was the office of strategic influence. [...] I went down that next day and said fine, if you want to savage this thing fine I&#39;ll give you the corpse. There&#39;s the name. You can have the name, but I&#39;m gonna keep doing every single thing that needs to be done and I have.&quot;</p>

<p>The Jewish Internet Defense Force (JIDF) is a pro-Israel advocacy organization which &quot;shares news and information to members and supporters through email, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Myspace, Digg, and other popular areas of the web. It also seeks out, exposes, and reports online material which is against the Terms of Service of internet companies.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, the JIDF shares links to pro-palestinian or anti-israel groups, forums, news articles and videos, and then engages in mass reporting, downvotes, complaints and threats to the site hosting the material. </p>

<p>I see this type of thing from time to time on my local papers website.  There have been a few controversial building projects in my city and the consensus in the comment sections (and IRL) is overwhelmingly negative.  As you reade you suddenly get a conspicuions a block comments that are written at a high level praising the developer and the key council people, while minimizing complaints.  Its a problem that people should be aware of, its not going to stop, so its up to us as readers and consumers of information to be literate in the tools of deception.  </p>

<p>how is that being a shill?  This doesn&#39;t seem any different than say the AANCP or political campaigns in general.  People are encouraged to advocate, that&#39;s true with many movements as well.  Doesn&#39;t sound like they are getting paid or are being covert about their intentions.</p>

<p>Good list for the most part though.  I believe the Iran government has also set up something similar but I can&#39;t find a decent article to back that up.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t need to raise the prices.  They pay a flat fee, and the additional sales gained from observant Jews pay that back and then plenty more.  If it wasn&#39;t profitable, why would the companies do it?</p>

<p>Yeah they do know.  If the food has a kosher-certification stamp, it&#39;s kosher.  If it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s not.  Simple.</p>

In 1970 he came out with a super-sensational article charging that Orthodox rabbis had turned the kosher labeling business into a multi-million dollar racket. He said that absolutely nothing which does not contain meat or a meat by-product needs a kosher label. He quotes Mrs. Weiss-Rosmarin, &quot;the greatest rabbinical authority,&quot; as testifying that no soft drink, Coca-Cola, nor any other drink needs kosher approval. Again, ONLY MEAT and items containing MEAT by-products need Kosher approval.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, you&#39;re just crazy.  Your citations come from crazy sites whose logic doesn&#39;t make any sense (food producers pay for kosher certification... therefore there&#39;s a kosher tax?  only Orthodox Jews eat kosher food?  Bullshit!)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s horrible, horrible logic.  If it&#39;s not profitable, why the fuck would the companies do it?</p>

<p>Let me deconstruct this for you.  A tax is money that one is forced to pay to the government.  Kosher is the Jewish dietary standard, eaten by Jews of all kinds (<em>all</em> Orthodox Jews keep kosher, plus <em>many</em> non-Orthodox Jews) and some Gentiles (American Muslims often buy kosher goods where strict halal is not available due to overlap in the religious regulations), who do so for health reasons (real or believed) or because they think that kosher food is more ethical (certain kosher standards now actually require ecological sustainability and things like that).  When a company pays a kosher-certification fee, they pay it voluntarily in order to increase their customer base and they make the money back thereby.  Therefore, the fees are not a tax.  Also, the government does not force kosher compliance (even in Israel).  Therefore, there is no kosher tax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, it&#39;s not passed on because if it had to be, obtaining kosher certification in the first place would be uneconomical.  Why do something that costs you money if it doesn&#39;t pay for itself without having to pass on the cost?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s wrong to say &quot;Jews are the problem&quot; because not all Jews know about the problem or give a fuck about it. Most people couldn&#39;t be bothered to inform themselves on any matter, much less ones that could get one ridiculed, threatened, imprisoned or shot.</p>

<p>Jews, like everyone else, are fallible and corruptable people. Just like Christianity, their religion is based off of lies stolen from other ancient cultures, with virtually no evidence to back it up. The Torah was not written when they say it was and neither was the new testament.</p>

<p>That said, some jews are just as misguided as the retard televangelists you see asking for money because he has the power to heal, while others might be as evil minded as hitler himself.</p>

<p>The mayor of my city is Jewish, he is corrupt, people have seen him snort cocaine and he makes shady deals by which the sole benefactors are him and his close knit circle of friends. He is the exact type of person that would normally be villified or even lynched, but since he is Jewish hardly anyone speaks out against his actions.</p>
