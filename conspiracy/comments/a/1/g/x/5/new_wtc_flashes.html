    <div class="md"><p>Yes, of course it was shown on television eight years ago.. However this clip was definitely one that was hardly replayed as it is the clip that features the reporter comparing it to a demolition (coincidentally) as the sequence of mysterious flashes can be seen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake, on a scale of casualties it definitely was not the most massive, I was just trying to emphasize on how truly upsetting it is that so many lives were lost and much foul play is evident and yet you still have to dismiss something like this due to its quality.

<p>I can make out what you&#39;re talking about if I try hard enough. But are you a demo expert? Are you a structural engineer? Are you a video analysis expert? Or are you really just repeating what some of these <em>professionals</em> who want answers have said?

    <div class="md"><p>Look; if you fly a jet airliner into a building, that building might collapse (without any additional assistance). </p>

<p>This is a totally reasonable assumption, so without any hard evidence to the contrary you have to accept that. Just accept it.</p>

<p>If you are suspicious about the official story, or you think there are things about 9/11 that don&#39;t add up, maybe you just feel that you haven&#39;t been properly presented with all the information that you need to have closure about this incident. Then focus your time and effort on the parts of 9/11 that are less plausible.</p>

<p><em>Airliner + Building + Collapse = plausible</em></p>

<p>Without solid evidence to that contrary there will never be a consensus about an alternative theory to an event that <em>already has</em> a plausible explanation. This is  simply because plausible is already believable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if there was a building that didn&#39;t have an aeroplane fly into it - then that would be suspicious. That&#39;s my point.</p>

<p>No one is going to listen to conspiracies about 3&amp;4 because they saw aeroplanes fly into them, then they fell down. It&#39;s an open and shut case (unless you come up with concrete evidence) as extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>

<p>I know, you made this clear earlier, you arent understanding my point that the buildings were designed to take the hit from the planes and the official story is that the building collapsed due to fire, not from the plane impact.   You need to stay current on this stuff.  The whole &quot;big shiny plane hit big shiny building fall down go boom&quot; theory has been debunked 10000x.</p>

<p>If wtc7 and the penagon were fake, youre suggesting that wtc 1 &amp; 2 werent?   How bout this, they flew planes into them, AND they placed demo charges in all 3 towers.  I know, its such a stretch from your original hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what I&#39;m saying is; Buildings 1 &amp; 2 clearly fell down due to having their structural integrity removed due to circumstances related directly to the aeroplanes hitting them. End of story. </p>

<p>There is no way to avoid this obvious conclusion unless you bring forward compelling evidence. The video that started this thread is <em>so far</em> from being evidence at all (let alone compelling evidence) that it simply fuels the fire of nutjob conspiracy that drowns out any real questions.</p>

<p>To answer your question: 1&amp;2 weren&#39;t &quot;fake&quot;, no. No way. You don&#39;t need demo charges. Why? If terrorists are going to attack you, then you don&#39;t need to &quot;help&quot; them, just let them get on with it. The towers didn&#39;t need to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>7, I think is suspicious, so I think that careful questions need to be asked, but they can&#39;t be asked )and never get answered even when someone tries) because you simply get the reply: &quot;Stop being such a crazy conspiracy theorist&quot;.</p>

<p>Looking at 7, in this case its the fire theory that seems implausible, so you need to look at other options. It looks like a demo job, plus the testimony of people on the ground and the infamous &quot;We decided to pull it&quot; comment, raise all these questions that simple don&#39;t get answered...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fire <em>was a direct cause of the impacts</em>. The planes hit, there was a fire, the structure collapsed. If the planes didn&#39;t hit then there was no fire. The planes caused the fire, the fire caused the collapse - how ever you want to term it - the planes where the catalyst for the collapse. Nit picking wont help.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how anyone could even doubt that that&#39;s a possibility - and a reasonable one at that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What some people call &quot;nit-picking&quot; others call &quot;facts&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, the buildings easily absorbed the impact, it was the fire from the jet fuel that brought down the towers (the official story).</p>

<p>Now try to wrap your head around this fact:</p>

<p>Fires have raged in steel buildings for far longer than a few hours, and they never fell.  Some burned for over 24 hours straight and were of inferior construction compared to wtc1 &amp; 2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Solid evidence is not hard to come across when you consider the way in which modern steel framed structures are built, again I am no professional but it doesn&#39;t take a ton of ingenuity to realize how impossible it is for a building to fall apart like that, that fast, and that effectively. </p>

<p>I highly highly doubt you can refute that 
THIS -  - Destruction  proceeds through the path of greatest resistance at nearly free-fall acceleration.
OCCURRED</p>

<p>AND THIS - Asymmetrical collapse which follows the path of least resistance (laws of conservation of momentum would cause a falling, intact, from the point of plane impact, to the side most damaged by the fires).
DID NOT.</p>

<p>Not to mention the 956 Architects and Engineers that stand on my side of the argument. </p>
