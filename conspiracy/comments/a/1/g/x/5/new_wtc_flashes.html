       Its definitely outrageous that people compare this to any other conspiracy theory considering 3,000 innocent lives were lost, and the mass documentation of the event with modern television cameras proves (obviously

       I agree with that 100%, it is as if the 3000 people didn't die to some debunkers.  Now that would be a conspiracy worth sniveling at like a government hack.

       There's honestly too much digital artifacting to determine anything conclusively, and whether it's just debris or not. So, as far as this being 'new' information, I don't know, considering it was shown on television 8 years ago.

       Yes, of course it was shown on television eight years ago.. However this clip was definitely one that was hardly replayed as it is the clip that features the reporter comparing it to a demolition (coincidentally) as the sequence of mysterious flashes can be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as analyzing it goes, I'm obviously no professional but there are  only two possibilities it could be debris reflecting sunlight and it could in fact be charges.

       Ah. I will say that I didn't have sound on for the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wish the quality were a lot clearer. Something historic like that, I'd think there'd be a cleaner archive somewhere. (Didn't archive.org have a stream of all the broadcasts at the time? Check it out; I'm not sure if this one would be there, but I can't see why not.)

       They are faint, but they are there.  Look at the ABC logo on the bottom right of the video.  The flashes appear to go in a downward diagonal path.  Just like a demo charge on a building.

       I see what you're talking about... it was probably windows being blown out / dust coming out of windows due to internal collapse... the interior of the building most likely began collapsing before the exterior.

       My mistake, on a scale of casualties it definitely was not the most massive, I was just trying to emphasize on how truly upsetting it is that so many lives were lost and much foul play is evident and yet you still have to dismiss something like this due to its quality. Not to mention that in its low quality, you can still clearly see whatever the fuck those little sequences are.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is very interesting that you in fact worked and lived down there. I apologize for my assumptions, like I said its just disappointing when you negatively dismiss the post cause its on you tube when you can in fact see what I'm pointing out.

       I can make out what you're talking about if I try hard enough. But are you a demo expert? Are you a structural engineer? Are you a video analysis expert? Or are you really just repeating what some of these
       <em>
        professionals
       </em>
       who want answers have said? I guess what I'm asking is, what qualification do you have to make such an absolute statement, when it could be a plethora of things aside from nanothermite.

       And as for the flashes in question: try this: defocus your eyes for a bit while your watching that video - you'll see a shitload of flashes and pops all over the frame... Even in the middle of the fucking sky. Does that mean they planted the bombs in the clouds, too? OMG! Terrorists have attacked our imaginations!

       Pardon me, but I would argue that respect and consideration for the event would demand that one hold analyses to a higher standard of quality than this...

       Honestly, there's enough good evidence in support of the controlled demolition hypothesis already that you don't need to waste time and energy obsessing over what-might-be-explosion-flashes-but-probably-just-video-artificing details.

       Look; if you fly a jet airliner into a building, that building might collapse (without any additional assistance).

       This is a totally reasonable assumption, so without any hard evidence to the contrary you have to accept that. Just accept it.

       If you are suspicious about the official story, or you think there are things about 9/11 that don't add up, maybe you just feel that you haven't been properly presented with all the information that you need to have closure about this incident. Then focus your time and effort on the parts of 9/11 that are less plausible.

       <em>
        Airliner + Building + Collapse = plausible
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Without solid evidence to that contrary there will never be a consensus about an alternative theory to an event that
       <em>
        already has
       </em>
       a plausible explanation. This is  simply because plausible is already believable.

       So? Does that change the premise that if you fly a large aircraft into a building (any building), then that building may plausibly fall down? No.

       Well okay then; Using physics: If you fly a large aircraft into a building (any building), then that building may plausibly fall down.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, if there was a building that didn't have an aeroplane fly into it - then that would be suspicious. That's my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is going to listen to conspiracies about 3&amp;4 because they saw aeroplanes fly into them, then they fell down. It's an open and shut case (unless you come up with concrete evidence) as extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

       7 on the other hand is another story - but real questions about 7 (and the Pentagon) are simple washed out by the shear lunacy that conspiracy theorists cover the entire days events with.

       I know, you made this clear earlier, you arent understanding my point that the buildings were designed to take the hit from the planes and the official story is that the building collapsed due to fire, not from the plane impact.   You need to stay current on this stuff.  The whole "big shiny plane hit big shiny building fall down go boom" theory has been debunked 10000x.

       If wtc7 and the penagon were fake, youre suggesting that wtc 1 &amp; 2 werent?   How bout this, they flew planes into them, AND they placed demo charges in all 3 towers.  I know, its such a stretch from your original hypothesis.

       No, what I'm saying is; Buildings 1 &amp; 2 clearly fell down due to having their structural integrity removed due to circumstances related directly to the aeroplanes hitting them. End of story.

       There is no way to avoid this obvious conclusion unless you bring forward compelling evidence. The video that started this thread is
       <em>
        so far
       </em>
       from being evidence at all (let alone compelling evidence) that it simply fuels the fire of nutjob conspiracy that drowns out any real questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question: 1&amp;2 weren't "fake", no. No way. You don't need demo charges. Why? If terrorists are going to attack you, then you don't need to "help" them, just let them get on with it. The towers didn't need to fall to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       7, I think is suspicious, so I think that careful questions need to be asked, but they can't be asked )and never get answered even when someone tries) because you simply get the reply: "Stop being such a crazy conspiracy theorist".
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at 7, in this case its the fire theory that seems implausible, so you need to look at other options. It looks like a demo job, plus the testimony of people on the ground and the infamous "We decided to pull it" comment, raise all these questions that simple don't get answered...

       youre alone on this b/c the govt says it was due to weakening steel structure due to fire, not impact.  Thats where the physics comes in.  All that steel can absorb a 757 no problem.

       The fire
       <em>
        was a direct cause of the impacts
       </em>
       . The planes hit, there was a fire, the structure collapsed. If the planes didn't hit then there was no fire. The planes caused the fire, the fire caused the collapse - how ever you want to term it - the planes where the catalyst for the collapse. Nit picking wont help.

      <p>
       I don't see how anyone could even doubt that that's a possibility - and a reasonable one at that.

       Yes, the buildings easily absorbed the impact, it was the fire from the jet fuel that brought down the towers (the official story).

       Fires have raged in steel buildings for far longer than a few hours, and they never fell.  Some burned for over 24 hours straight and were of inferior construction compared to wtc1 &amp; 2.

       Solid evidence is not hard to come across when you consider the way in which modern steel framed structures are built, again I am no professional but it doesn't take a ton of ingenuity to realize how impossible it is for a building to fall apart like that, that fast, and that effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly highly doubt you can refute that 
THIS -  - Destruction  proceeds through the path of greatest resistance at nearly free-fall acceleration.
OCCURRED
      </p>
      <p>
       AND THIS - Asymmetrical collapse which follows the path of least resistance (laws of conservation of momentum would cause a falling, intact, from the point of plane impact, to the side most damaged by the fires).
DID NOT.

      <p>
       Not to mention the 956 Architects and Engineers that stand on my side of the argument.
