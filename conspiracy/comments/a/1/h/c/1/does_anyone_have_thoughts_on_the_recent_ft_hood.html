    <div class="md"><p>I leave that one to the people involved in the manufacturing process, trying my best to stick to facts without making strong emotionally charged claims in either direction.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that the shooting was a manufactured event but it&#39;s obvious it will be milked unscrupulously for political agenda, just like 911 was media controlled and milked regardless of who orchestrated the event.</p>

<p>Just like it&#39;s wrong to benefit from the market of stolen merchandise, maybe we should look at terror profiteering. We can then hold those who use disasters of any kind to ride their pet ponies responsible for creation of an economy that has obvious incentives for terror.</p>

<p>Soldiers at Fort Hood don&#39;t carry weapons unless they are doing training exercises.&quot;</p>

<p>Why are those two sentences back to back? Is the article trying to imply there could not have been any other shooters because no one there routinely carries weapons?! ....didn&#39;t stop our suspect did it?

<blockquote>
<p>One of the Web posts that authorities reviewed is a blog that equates suicide bombers with a soldier throwing himself on a grenade to save the lives of his comrades.</p>

<p>“To say that this soldier committed suicide is inappropriate. Its more appropriate to say he is a brave hero that sacrificed his life for a more noble cause,” said the Internet posting. “Scholars have paralled (sic) this to suicide bombers whose intention, by sacrificing their lives, is to help save Muslims by killing enemy soldiers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems interesting time line wise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Fort Hood, Maria Treviño, who works on the post at Carl R. Darnall Medical Center, said she was on the phone with a woman who was at the readiness center when the shots erupted. Treviño said she heard screaming and gunshots before she hung up to get help.</p>

<p>“They just started screaming, ‘Don&#39;t let him in, don&#39;t let him in, they&#39;re shooting at us,&#39; ” she said. “I pray they didn&#39;t get hurt. It was horrible. We&#39;re still scared over here.” </p>

<p>Treviño said that soon after the call, bloodied victims began arriving at the hospital, which was on lockdown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The muslim probably did it, but i find it amazing that a doctor and &#39;other&#39; were that precise and well trained... they train therapists to shoot that well?</p>

<p>Also this...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a1fln/presidents_clinton_bush_and_obama_all_pushed/">http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a1fln/presidents_clinton_bush_and_obama_all_pushed/</a></p>

<p>When Obama made that education speech yesterday, i remembered researching pre-9/11 events, but i was more wrapped up in Bush&#39;s words in the speech than the fact that he was giving an education speech.  I cross checked education and saw that Obama made that education speech yesterday in Wisconsin, and Clinton was also making education agenda speeches and moves up until the uss cole was bombed.  There may be others.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it seems as if they are making a speech about something, but it is saying two things at the same time... basic words to the common folk and a code to those who run the world.  I find it unreal that these education agendas are followed by attacks against military targets.</p>

<p>There is a big health care vote and Obama is making a speech about education that is nearly the same speech with different antedotes obviously, that Bush made in the week before 9/11 at those barbeques.  The story Obama tells about his kids in school mirrors the almost off hand education remarks by Bush on 9/10/01 in Florida.  Maybe Obama doesn&#39;t even know he is sending the signals with his speech.  Weird, nonetheless.  Terrible tragedy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my searches and connecting dots at the time of the VT massacre it wouldn&#39;t surprise me a bit that Seung-Hui Cho was a modern MK-Ultra unit. Between his Junior and Senior year at Westfield HS, (Chantilly, VA,  2003) the Bilderbergers were meeting at the Marriott-Westfields 1/2 mile away across the same industrial park that includes the new National Reconnaissance Office HQ campus. (see the three places in a triangle here...) <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=38.880042,-77.458205&amp;amp;spn=0.016437,0.027595&amp;amp;z=15">http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=38.880042,-77.458205&amp;amp;spn=0.016437,0.027595&amp;amp;z=15</a>
(The NRO is the same organization that had the 9/11/01 terrorist exercise planned, is largely CIA and has a large black-budget.) 
Now I&#39;m reading that Nidal Malik Hasan also grew up in the DC area and also graduated from Virginia Tech. Weird thing is; despite the college&#39;s protests, the military says Hasan graduated two years later and was NOT enrolled in the ROTC. (Shouldn&#39;t the military have their facts straight on this?) Was he missing for two years? <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_fort_hood_shooting_suspect">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_fort_hood_shooting_suspect</a>
Was/is Hasan MK-Ultra? Our own suicide bomber of sorts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big question is now that everyone is focused sharply on all the hooplah around Ft Hood, what&#39;s the rest of the Gov&#39;t doing? Every damn time something like this happens, they find themselves on the verge of passing some seriously fucked flawed legislation none of them have read, half of them have co-sponsored will undoubtedly violate multiple laws already on the books... I expect something sinister afoot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Very interesting. Thanks for the link. Apparently, he also decided to wear religious clothing that day, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, surveillance video showed he was wearing religious attire rather than typical civilian or medical clothing. Strickland said that was unusual and she asked him about it, but he replied that he did that sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I leave that one to the people involved in the manufacturing process, trying my best to stick to facts without making strong emotionally charged claims in either direction.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that the shooting was a manufactured event but it&#39;s obvious it will be milked unscrupulously for political agenda, just like 911 was media controlled and milked regardless of who orchestrated the event.</p>

<p>Just like it&#39;s wrong to benefit from the market of stolen merchandise, maybe we should look at terror profiteering. We can then hold those who use disasters of any kind to ride their pet ponies responsible for creation of an economy that has obvious incentives for terror.</p>
