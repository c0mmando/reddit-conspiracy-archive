There is obviously a lot posted about what people see as the coming  of a new world order or one world governement, but I can&#39;t seem to figure out why that is necessarily a bad thing.  </p>

<p>It would seem to me from the outside that a single government would alleviate many of the conflicts we often find ourselves in as a species and allow us to join together as humans instead of citizens of this or that group (be it country, race, religion or linguistic grouping).  It would get rid of petty nationalism and the notion that our (rather invisible) borders are somehow important.  I&#39;m not saying it would be peace on earth, but I don&#39;t really see the major downside, which makes me think I&#39;m missing something.  </p>

<p>I feel like a need a primer on why it would be a bad idea and I figured you were the most qualified people to come to.  Teach me reddit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think money is?  It&#39;s power.  Why do people try to get rich?  Because having lots of money generally equates to having lots of power.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess in the formation of the idea that was in my head it&#39;s not an autonomous governement directing everything, but more of a guiding hand working with smaller governments much like a federal &amp; state model.  There is autonomy in the lower governements, but it would be easier to stop many of the problems we currently encounter in relating to other people.  Do you think it has to be a top down authoritarian model?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The authoritarian model would be the only way they could accomplish total world order, at least in my opinion. Most of the world is too heavily armed and too radicalized for any other option to work.</p>

<p>If everyone was as passive as the residents of these United States, then I am sure a more &#39;guiding hand approach&#39; could work. I mean, there was close to 80% of the population against Bush, and currently around 50% against Obama, and still nobody does anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ideology of world government has been around a while, but the beginning of the push didn&#39;t really start until the creation of the UN in 1945.  It is absolutely quintessential that you understand the motive of forming a one world government: the globalist elites that want to implement a one world government are obsessed with the power of dominating other human beings.  </p>

<p>A lot of good minded liberal people lack the basic understanding of the tendency of human beings to dominate other human beings. It should be considered the norm instead of the exception. Anyone that has studied any history is immediately bombarded with killing, war, rape, destruction, death, sickness, and torture. Because of this cognitive dissonance, these liberal types are convinced by monopoly men like George Soros that more government is necessary because capitalism is the real source of evil, which is pure double think because this larger central government will still be run by the same corporations and capitalists like George Soros.  The U.S. government is a tool of massive corporations that want to destroy all competition in the market.  A tyrannical world government would certainly be the best tool to guarantee that these obsessive power freaks maintain their power.  </p>

<p>The one world goverment is being sold under the premise that the third world countries need aid.  The sick joke of that is that global organizations like the IMF, the UN, and the World Bank have been financially screwing over developing countries in Latin America, Africa, and South East Asia by putting them into permanent debt. That&#39;s the British style of economic slavery:  Create wars amongst the barbarians and collect the debt.</p>

<p>From the Grand Chessboard by known imperialist and adviser to President Obama, Zbigniew Brzezinksi:</p>

<p>&quot;To put it in a terminology that harkens back to the more brutal age of ancient empires, the three grand imperatives of imperial geostrategy are to prevent collusion and maintain security dependence among the vassals, to keep tributaries pliant and protected, and to keep the barbarians from coming together.&quot; (p.40)</p>

<p>&quot;In the long run, global politics are bound to become increasingly uncongenial to the concentration of hegemonic power in the hands of a single state. Hence, America is not only the first, as well as the only, truly global superpower, but it is also likely to be the very last.&quot; (p.209)</p>

Oh, yeah.... try and get that to fly. &#39;&#39;We are all the same&#39;&#39; is a very charming phrase but I will never group myself with certain elements of society. We are animals on a rock. No amount of verbal conjecture will erase that fact.    We are supposed to be fighting locally, like every other species. Governmental and financial leaders have no rules for the most part. They are active organized anarchists. We deserve the same freedom.    I would rather have barbarians with swords and arrows than white phosphorus and depleted uranium. Big government is a scam from top to bottom. No good will ever come from its existence. Fuck thinking Globally. Act Locally.

I always liked the more creative and adventurous types. Its like mental macrame.  You seem to have a bit too much anger though.

    <div class="md"><p>We see in so many SciFi flicks that take place in the future, the planet under a 1 world Gov&#39;t. Now I&#39;ve been against this for ages now, as I&#39;ve always considered myself an AMERICAN 1st and a TERRAN 2nd. Cause as a nation we have our problems ( like any country ), yet we have had certain freedoms that most take for granted and most of the world wishes they had. We have had the ability to speak freely and OPENLY. To express ourselves without fear of retribution, as long as your freedom doesn&#39;t infringe upon someone else&#39;s freedom. These freedoms are being taken away without our consent.       </p>

<p>Yet the way that this new 1 world gov&#39;t is being implemented plans to remove all freedoms and dictate how everyone is ALLOWED to live. Seeing a world gov&#39;t in fiction overlooks the fact that it is already in effect and has been for awhile. But to be living thru the initial implementation of it is going to be a hard &amp; ugly for those that lived without it. Are you comfortable with the fact that a chip will be implanted in your body to monitor every facet of your existence? If you were born well after the implementation of this, it would seem normal. But not to those that have it forced upon them. It&#39;s like the kids of today that don&#39;t know what it was like to NOT have a cellphone. How did people live without computers everywhere and cable tv. When you are born after the fact, it is hard to question life without it.       </p>

<p>As time goes on and I think more and more upon the subject I realize I am not against a 1 world gov&#39;t. Yet those that are bringing it to fruitition have a certain agenda that doesn&#39;t allow freedom as we have known it. And how they plan to force it down everyone&#39;s throat is only to their profit and benefit. While the majority have to suffer and endure cause they were told they must. It&#39;s as if we are all 5 years old and the parents that be, believe they know best.        </p>

<p>Let me ask you this...... How would you feel if someone told you that you aren&#39;t allow to have children cause you have some flawed DNA? What would you do if you were told you aren&#39;t allowed to excel beyond a certain point in society ( like a forced caste system )? What would you do if you couldn&#39;t express your true feelings for fear of incarceration?       </p>

<p>What we see in SciFi future senarios portrays a viewpoint well after the fact and after the dust has settled and all the kinks worked out ( well enough of the kinks ). But being born after the fact imparts a certain level of normalcy. Living thru the transition can be hard to swallow. Especially when the majorities interest are easily discarded, and only a few benefit. When 227 families own nearly 50% of the planet, how much of a say do you think you can have when it interferes with their wants and wishes?        </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been saying for over 25 years now........ &quot;I was born 1000 years to early, or 1000 years too late&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a lot of people who really can&#39;t think clearly, anymore. They&#39;ve been deceived for too long--offered too many &quot;red herrings&quot;, not enough study about what&#39;s ideal for a human society and how human beings can and should go about acheiving such--mentally, physically and spiritually. So you just have one big disorderly mob, and the NWO comes in and says, in essence, &quot;Y&#39;all are useless as far as thinking beings, but WE certainly do have some use for you as unthinking beings.&quot; And that&#39;s where you get the control, the oppression, the injustices and the destruction of all freedom. </p>

<p>I think--in my own observations of history--there have been these &quot;key moments&quot; when you&#39;ve had a lot of people getting more aware about some things all at the same time, and there have been opportunities for them to do &quot;a quantum leap&quot; as a society in their dignity, court system, legislation, persona in international comities, trade, technology, etc. All these things--they all come together in a nexus from time to time, and that was sort-of the renaissance, and sort of the birth of Protestantism, and sort-of the American Revolution. </p>

<p>Now, that&#39;s how human beings naturally are--total auto-determination. Where you get the &quot;unnaturalness&quot; is you have people in odd positions of power who know THEIR power will be lessened if the rest of humanity collectively &quot;jumps&quot; in its quality of human associations, its understanding of nature. So, these few powerful ne&#39;er-do-wells seek to throw a wrench in the gears--and for the past 100 years or so, every wrench they&#39;ve thrown has worked. The Fed Reserve. WWI. WWII. Military-industrial complex, Bretton Woods, CIA--all for oil and the empire it brings. </p>

<p>So now a philosophical question opens up, and that philosophical question is &quot;do you destroy the oppressors while destroying oppression?&quot;, or is it the oppression, itself, you focus on systematically removing? And this really would be a paradigm shift if people, collectively, agreed on &quot;destroying oppression without destroying the oppressors, for they, too, are human&quot;. That would be an enlightenment--and you could have just about any sort of government constructed afterwards which would, in essence, be both &quot;paternal&quot; and &quot;benevolent&quot;. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t see people collectively deciding that. Instead, I see them deciding to &quot;string the bastards up by their necks&quot;--and so we are actually hedging-up to an age of mass anarchy, mass mutinies, mass secession. Just global-scale ruin; exchanging one group of power-players for another group, then repeat 1000 times over.</p>

<p>Think differently? Well, fine, then you try to change things so that there isn&#39;t mass anarchy. Meanwhile, the NWO will do their best to consolidate earthly power, sometimes through subtle deception, sometimes through not-so-subtle deception (and eventually through bootheel-grinding-into-your-face totalitarianism--eventually, the NWO military leaders will tell the NWO bankers to take a hike). But I can&#39;t tell people this. I&#39;ve seen the writing on the wall for 20 years, now, but every time I&#39;ve said anything to anyone I get branded a conspiracy theorist, a lunatic--an apocalyptic religious fanatic. What they never admit is I&#39;m a very ugly mirror for all their ugliness. But like I said, if you can do better, do it.</p>

<p>Isaac Asimov wrote &quot;Foundation&quot; back in the 1950&#39;s because of these very ideas. in his opinion, a maintained encyclopedia of modern knowledge could very well stave off much of the coming chaos and loss of technology that follows a crumbling empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a complicated issue.  A world government would be good in some ways but dangerous in others.  The problem is that a world government would be most likely unelected, unaccountable and sociopathic.  Right idea, wrong species.</p>

<p>However, that being said, I would rather see totalitarian world government than global nuclear war.  At least the totalitarian world government would eventually collapse and people would be free again afterwards, instead of extinct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One government for the world is in my eyes inevitable. What worries me though, is that we&#39;ll have a world government before we as a species reach a point of liberty and understanding and mutual respect to benefit from this government.</p>

<p>Our current political and economical systems still lack a lot of sense, and are still plagued with power hungry business interests that fail to see the value in wellbeing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no calling for socialism, but more humanism. I&#39;d like to see a ground-up political system with true local representation, but with directly elected representatives that meet on a global scape.</p>

<p>The current direction is Big Brother. In my opinion, this will not lead to greater wellbeing of our species. Going global isn&#39;t bad, if the people in every country are equally represented. If we would shift our focus from control to support, then I&#39;m all for global governance. If the government supplies a platform for local initiatives, then why not?</p>

<p>If the government decides to put financial gain of a few before global wellbeing, then we ought to try to convince them of the idea of equality.</p>

<p>My fight is one of politeness, kindness and awareness. I hope many would join me in my peaceful march.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if we were all peaceful monkeys, and not run by a relatively small group of sociopaths, I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with world government.</p>

<p>if we could ensure that people that <em>don&#39;t</em> believe in <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Zombie_Jesus">Zombie Carpenters</a> or <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/God">invisible men</a> could be in charge of the administration of such a government, I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with world government. </p>

<p>See, any first-year political science student understands that Government is merely a monopoly on the use of force (military, police, taxes, etc.). many people who feel government should exist are wary of having one all-encompassing government that all other governments answer to. </p>

<p>but none of the above is really valid. we&#39;ve had one-world government for ages. we all have one set of laws (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/ucc.table.html">Uniform Commercial Code</a>) for a very very long time, and as such, have been under one government for just as long. </p>

<p>who writes and maintains UCC again?</p>

<p><a href="http://inpursuitofhappiness.wordpress.com/2007/06/21/the-vatican-runs-the-world/">These guys do</a>. it&#39;s based on Canon Law</p>

<p>at least for me, this is why I oppose the current world government. an organization responsible for more suffering and genocide than anyone in history is in charge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess in the formation of the idea that was in my head it&#39;s not an autonomous governement directing everything, but more of a guiding hand working with smaller governments much like a federal &amp; state model.  There is autonomy in the lower governements, but it would be easier to stop many of the problems we currently encounter in relating to other people.  Do you think it has to be a top down authoritarian model?</p>
