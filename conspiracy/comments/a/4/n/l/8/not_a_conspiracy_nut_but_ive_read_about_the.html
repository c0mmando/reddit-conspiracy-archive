    <div class="md"><p>I read the labels, I still don&#39;t see the problem from a medical POV.</p>

<p>All drugs have labels explaining possible side effects in a small number of cases, that&#39;s what makes them so special.  If every tin had a label telling you of all the health risks possible from ingesting or smoking the plastic lining, or every car showed what % of owners suffered injury in a car crash, you&#39;d see how dangerous it is to be alive.</p>

<p>The only reason the vaccine conspiracies get so much traction is because people don&#39;t understand science/medicine, so there&#39;s a great deal of &quot;fear of the unknown&quot; happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting, I was talking to my sons friends and they didn&#39;t know at one time it was illegal to wire tap, enter and search a car or home without a warrant. My dad used to tell me about similar issues. </p>

<p>Each and every generation that is born after changes in the laws never knew what the freedoms before theirs were. They never realized those freedoms existed and were surprised to find that out. In their generation they will probably see the most loss of freedoms and liberties and what will their children have left? I guess at some point in time there will be very few freedoms and that is what that generation will accept as &quot;normal&quot; in order to keep things best for America?</p>

<p>Every freedom lost is huge no matter how small or insignificant the freedom or liberty lost is. They begin to add up and it becomes easier and easier to talk people or scare them into giving up more. Where do you draw the line? </p>

<p>The attitude &quot;As long as I don&#39;t do anything wrong I&#39;ll be ok&quot; no longer applies. There are now so many laws people are getting arrested for things we don&#39;t even know about, it&#39;s a mess and no one seems to care anymore about the innocent being locked up. So basically it&#39;s over for America , too late to do anything about it.</p>

<p>Why would they do that? Historically, population decline through plagues strengthened the position of the individual vs. institutions. Poor countries would lose cheap labour, their main comparative advantage. Rich countries would lose GDP and their investments in their population (education and infrastructure) would become less useful, and they would lose legitimacy.</p>

<p>Not to mention that vaccines always attract those who are completely paranoid about everything that&#39;s government-mandated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really see why. As long as you have a global economy a global government will be necessary in some form. With a smaller population there will only be less conflicts and more resources to go around, so if anything is slightly relaxes the need for one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my research,the current argument for this and their agenda and etc:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resources - The people in charge (PIC), who ever they are, want all of the worlds resources to themselves. After the population decrease the PIC now have vast amounts of land, clean air, etc. The rest of the people will continue living their lives and providing for the PIC.</li>
<li>Population Concentration - Pretty much have all of the population will be relocated into cities. This makes it easier for them to control you and also makes all the other available land available for the PIC to enjoy. There is also some thought on this area about freeway construction and new freeway walls being installed everything. The purpose is to provide for transportation from city to city but also so no one can go anywhere else.</li>
<li>Global Warming - This is being used to push in carbon tax across all countries being paid to the world government. The current scientific view being that the current <strong>climate change</strong> is normal and &quot;global warming&quot; is the scary word that implies we are involved and causing it. This also causes a confusion with pollution. Of course pumping toxic gases into the air is bad for. So people who are against pollution now feel against global warming.</li>
<li>20% Left - This is apparently the magic number for how many people would need to be alive in order to provide income for the PIC and maintain their lifestyle. </li>
</ul>

<p>You are listing off what rich and poor countries would lose. It doesn&#39;t matter. Why would these people care about that? Their main agenda is control and continuation of lifestyle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any one able to do that stuff wouldn&#39;t need to do it, because they would already be able to get everything they want right now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Population Concentration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With a lower population it&#39;s easier to get away, because there is less military personnel, and it&#39;s more difficult to control a sparse population. Concentrating in cities is not possible because they likely are open graveyards by that time, and even when fully populated they need a constant flux of food and goods that needs to come from somewhere. Who&#39;s gonna maintain these freeways, anyway?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The current scientific view being that the current climate change is normal and &quot;global warming&quot; is the scary word that implies we are involved and causing it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The current scientific view is that we indeed are involved (except a few shills and professional contrarians).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their main agenda is control and continuation of lifestyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the main consequences of an 80% dieoff would be chaos. Chaos is never in the interest of the ones in power.</p>

<p>It all sounds like the wishful thinking of someone who has problems and finds comfort that someone, somewhere is controlling everything and that all the stuff that happens is <em>intentional</em> and has a <em>purpose</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me add one more to that list then:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eugenics - &quot;Eugenics is the study and practice of selective breeding applied to humans, with the aim of improving the species.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>This being used to push for the one master race (think Hitler) or the like. Eugenics is a good cover though because it uses as its most founding principal the theory of evolution. The people who think evolution is a conspiracy usually mean they think evolution is being pushed in order to sway public opinion in the favor of eugenics and thus a sound moral backing to their policy.</p>

<p>Then there is a lot of arguments out there using spirituality as a guide when deciding their agenda. I do not have much experience in this yet though.</p>

<p>You also missed the part where I talk about freeways. The current US freeway system was designed by the military in order to facilitate deployment of troops of equipment to all parts of the country in times of war. </p>

<p>The essential government operations and a population will still exist. They will be the ones providing for the PIC.</p>

<p>There will be chaos but it will be controlled. The government will offer the solution and everyone will watch it on the media and then go running. </p>

<p>Tell me, how are we involved in climate change?</p>

<p>Well, you obviously have internal documents that are a bit more detailed.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s not unusual. Historically, most planned road systems kept that in mind.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An 80% dieoff rate is not a solution. Maybe in the US a lot of people will go running if their tv tells them to :) Elsewhere, not so much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell me, how are we involved in climate change?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fossil fuels have been burned at accelerating rates starting in the 19th century, thereby turning millions of years old carbon into carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, bringing it to unusually high levels beyond the absorptive capacity of the ecosystem. The greenhouse effect set in motion a positive feedback (lessening albedo etc.) that continues to have effect stronger than the normal solar spot cycles in influencing the temperature.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the help of another redditor I&#39;m going to be compiling a long piece of work that finally reveals the full agenda and post it on here, this is a brief outline of the future. </p>

<p>We have unknowingly been manipulated and fed propaganda for the coming of this event in 2012.</p>

<p>When the major event to happen at the 2012 Olympics is unveiled, people will be in such a shock and state of denial that society as we know it will just break-down.</p>

<p>Ridicule all you want now, but when the first of these events comes to pass you&#39;ll know it is the truth and what you will need to do to prepare.</p>

<p>Unknowingly, we&#39;ve been living under a massive psy-op that&#39;s made us believe that Bible prophecy isn&#39;t true, (but it is), this has mostly been done by the way of the Roman Catholic CULT giving us their ridiculous and false version of the Bible, in order to make us think it&#39;s a silly fictional book, when it isn&#39;t. Almost all Christians aren&#39;t following a proper and literal interpretation of the Bible (which is what you must do and is the reason we have been told to not do this by our enemies). It&#39;s not very hard if you read Daniel and Revelations to work out whether Bible prophecy is true or not and the evidence shows that it indeed is completely accurate. (<em>For those with wisdom and understanding</em> Psalms 110-118 also unlocks the period of the Tribulation, which is 2011-2018 plus the coming war of 2010 that precedes this.)</p>

<p>Make no mistake there will be no Rapture, this is a false Roman Catholic doctrine that will deceive many when it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>You may not believe these things are true now, but once they begin you&#39;ll understand the truth and what you have to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>2010</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be three Muslim/Arab states that will either make war with or be seen to pose a threat to Israel and under the Popes advice the U.N. will form a world government in order to destroy these countries.</p>

<ul>
<li>2011</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pope will sign a Peace Treaty with Israel and be seen by Israel as the coming Messiah that&#39;s saved them from destruction. This will mark the beginning of the Tribulation and the last 7 years on Earth and the first year of False Peace.</p>

<p>The Bible tells us &quot;Satan is a Liar&quot; and &quot;Satan Deceived the whole world&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEXZfiDC2Ns">The truth about &#39;Aliens&#39; and &#39;Reptilians&#39;, MUST SEE</a></p>

<ul>
<li>2012 - 2nd year of False Peace</li>
</ul>

<p>The coming Alien Invasion at the Opening Ceremony of the London &#39;New Jerusalem&#39; <a href="http://i32.tinypic.com/xf3l9v.jpg">ZION 2012</a> Games of the XXX Olympiad.</p>

<p>XXX = </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Porn</p></li>
<li><p>Kisses on a letter, e-mail or greetings card</p></li>
<li><p>xXx movie with Vin Diesel</p></li>
<li><p>X is the 24th letter of the English alphabet. 2+4/2+4/2+4 = 666.</p></li>
<li><p>‘Britain’s Got Talent’ or ‘America’s Got Talent’ (the three judges consist of 2 males and 1 female, this represents the father, mother and son of the false Trinity)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When the aliens are revealed, people will break-down in a state of shock. When they will then believe and do and they&#39;ll be convinced mankind the Bible is nonsense and that we are &#39;free from the enslavement of God&#39; and can now break all the 10 commandments. People will participate in public orgies and blood sacrifices to idols.</p>

<p>The Olympics originated in Ancient Greece where the athletes performed nude, this acts as further programming in people&#39;s subconscious for this event.</p>

<p>The 5 rings of the Olympics represent the 5 Beasts of Bible. Think Lord of the Rings, 1 ring to rule them all or one master that rules them all and we even see how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Sauron">Sauron</a> is represented by the Eye of Sauron, the all-seeing eye.</p>

<p>The 5 rings in the New Age beliefs represent the 5 &quot;ages&quot; of the Earth and then they say we&#39;re entering a &quot;New Age&quot;. They teach that the previous Age was of Pisces and we are moving into the New Age of Aquarius (never mind that these New Age wackos never provide any proof for this).</p>

<p>The Olympic torch represents Lucifer the light-bearer, &quot;Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classical Greece was an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich.&quot;</p>

<p>Hitler spread disinformation about a Jewish Banker Conspiracy to the German people so he could get them to go along with his plan.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you see that they hate the Jews, they always blame the Jews. Why? Because they can&#39;t stand that they keep the commandments of God.</p>

<p>This will also mark the beginning of their &#39;New Order of the Ages&#39; where the False Prophet (Obama) will cause everyone to worship the &#39;New Age Trinity&#39; of the Father (The Pope, {Osiris}), the Mother (The Queen, {Isis} who&#39;s Diamond Jubilee is in 2012) and the Son (Prince William, {Horus} will be the false returned messiah, who will celebrate his 30th Birthday on the same day as the opening of the 30th Olympics. This is also why <a href="http://jubilee2012.50webs.com/william.jpg">this picture was taken of him holding the lamb</a>. More mind-programming for this event.)</p>

<p>The emblem for these games is a blue solar logo (the “Bright Sun”).</p>

<p>The sun will be at a new solar maximum at this time because of the approximately 11 year solar cycle. The last time it was at it&#39;s solar maximum was on 9/11/01. This is when they perform there big sacrificial rituals. </p>

<p>They are telling us to expect big solar flares in 2012 scorching the earth. The problem though is that sunspots have seen a record period of inactivity, this is because this world is nearing at it&#39;s end.</p>

<p>The Bible however says however in Revelation 13:13-14</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And he (the False Prophet, which is Obama) performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. And deceived them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast (the Pope); saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve identified &quot;the image of the beast&quot; as the all-seeing eye. I believe the above passage speaks of <a href="http://darkotix.dreamhosters.com/illuminati-jayz.jpg">Obama getting everyone to do this to the Pope</a>.</p>

<p>Back to the Blue Sun Logo of the Olympics, I believe this is also in reference to God&#39;s blue law. This refers to God&#39;s day of rest on the sabbath, the last day of the week. In true occult fashion, Satan does everything the opposite of God, I believe this Blue Sun, refers to the Pope enforcing his own blue law, that will refer to the first day of the week Sunday and will be a day devoted to sun worship.</p>

<p>The Pope will take all our belongings and distribute them evenly across the world in a false act of peace.</p>

<p>Prophesy in Psalm 112 for 2012</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>2013 - 3rd Year of False Peace</li>
</ul>

<p>Prophecy in Psalm 113 for 2013</p>

<p>7 : He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
8 : That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
9 : He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. </p>

6 : Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
7 : Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; </p>

<p>At this point the Bible tells us all these things will have taken place too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Third Temple is rebuilt in Jerusalem.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rise of Babylon (the occult mystery religion beliefs, that originated in Babylon).</p></li>
<li><p>The Rise of the false one-world religion.</p></li>

<li><p>The Seven Trumpet Judgments.</p></li>
<li><p>Midway point of 2014/2015 - The Abomination that cause Desolation</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Prophesy in Psalm 115 for 2015</p>

<p>4 : Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men&#39;s hands.
5 : They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
6 : They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
7 : They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
8 : They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. </p>

<p>The Bible tells us the Midpoint sees</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Death and Resurrection of the Two Witnesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Destruction of the One World Church.</p></li>
<li><p>The death and resurrection of Antichrist.</p></li>
<li><p>Antichrist defiles the temple and proclaims himself God.</p></li>
<li><p>The Mark of the Beast begins.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jewish Remnant flees to the desert.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The final 3 1/2 years (2015-2018) will see -</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 7 Bowl Judgments</p></li>
<li><p>Martyrdom of Jews and Believers</p></li>
<li><p>Babylon is destroyed</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>A bit of further info -</p>

<p>Did you know the golden ratio (phi) = sin 666º + cos (6x6x6)º</p>

<p>666 is also,</p>

<p>The sum of the first 36 natural numbers, and thus a triangular number. Since 36 is both square and triangular, it&#39;s also a doubly triangular number.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the sum of the squares of the first seven primes: 666 = 2² +3² +5² +7² +11² +13² +17²</p>

<p>It&#39;s sum and difference of the first three 6th powers: 666 = 1<sup>6</sup> - 2<sup>6</sup> + 3<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>It is also equal to the sum of its digits plus the cubes of its digits:</p>

<p>666 = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6³ + 6³ + 6³.</p>

<p>666 is related to (6² + n²) in the following interesting ways:</p>

<p>666 = (6 + 6 + 6) · (6² + 1²)</p>

<p>666 = 6! · (6² + 1²) / (6² + 2²)</p>

<p>There are exactly two ways to insert &#39;+&#39; signs into the sequence 123456789 to make the sum 666, and exactly one way for the sequence 987654321:</p>

<p>666 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 567 + 89 = 123 + 456 + 78 + 9</p>

<p>666 = 9 + 87 + 6 + 543 + 21</p>

<p>666 = 1³ + 2³ + 3³ + 4³ + 5³ + 6³ + 5³ + 4³ + 3³ + 2³ + 1³</p>

<p>A standard function in number theory is phi(n), which is the number of integers smaller than n and relatively prime to n. Remarkably,</p>

<p>phi(666) = 6·6·6.</p>

<p>The sum of the first 144 digits of Pi = 666 Now this in itself is amazing, but to top it off 144 just so happens to also be a number in the Fibonacci Sequence!</p>

<p>In addition, 666 degrees is 54 degrees short of a complete second circle and when dividing the 360 degrees of a circle by 54 degrees you get 6.66... The other side of a 54 degree angle in a right angle is 36 degrees and 36 divided by 54 is .666.</p>

<p>Phi appears throughout creation, and in every physical proportion of the human body.</p>

<p><a href="http://goldennumber.net/life.htm">http://goldennumber.net/life.htm</a></p>

<p>Surely this is proof of a creator.</p>

<p>Daniel 11:21</p>

<p>he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries</p>

<p>Notice how they don&#39;t stop telling us in the MSM how they are doing this or that in the name of peace.</p>

<p>Justice will eventually be had on the immensley rich thieving corporations!</p>

<p>Revelation 18:11</p>

<p>And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more.</p>

<p>We have discovered that these Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Murdochs, Greenspans etc.. aren&#39;t really Jews, but Khazars from Khazaria, who were involved in Kabbalah mysticysim passed on from Babylon.</p>

<p>Revelation 2:9</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) <strong>and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</strong></p>

<p>Revelation 12:9</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, <strong>which deceived the whole world</strong>: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 5:2</p>

<p>Zechariah 11:17</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock. May the sword strike his arm and his right eye. May his arm be completely withered, <strong>his right eye totally blinded</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting then that the All-seeing Eye just so happens to be represented by the left eye, the one which isn&#39;t blinded.</p>

<p>Revelation 13:15</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve identified &quot;the image of the Beast&quot; is the all-seeing eye. This is going to be a literal all-seeing eye, a super AI computer that will know absolutely everything about everyone and will be linked up to the worlds surveillance network (I saw a BBC program that already revealed that Intelligence in Britain can simply tap into all these other camera surveillance networks around the world where they can find anyone they want using facial recognition software)</p>

<p>This is what the whole scientific dictatorship has been building too, this is the false Utopian society that Zeitgeist: Addendum promoted, in which Jacques Fresco admitted that his false Utopian Society would be run by super AI computer that would know everything. When they&#39;ve killed off 80% the population (or however many they plan to), there will obviously be heaps of luxury things like sports cars, private jets etc... remaining that they&#39;ll tempt you with and tell you that you can have access to all this if you simply accept to have a Luciferian Initiation and receive a chip in your head or maybe a tattooed 666 barcode on your right hand that will give you access to all this. But you&#39;ll simply be enslaved into their false Utopian society.</p>

<p>Leading New Age teacher David Spangler said &quot;&quot;No one will enter the New Age unless he or she will take a Luciferian Initiation. No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she accepts the Luciferian Doctrine&quot;.</p>

<p>The company that publishes the U.N.&#39;s material is called Lucis Trust and was created by New Age Theosophist Alice A. Bailey. It was originally founded under the name of Lucifer Publishing, but was changed because it was too revealing of the true intentions.</p>

<p>Have you noticed how they have been frequently coming out with more and more about the Freemasons/Illuminati and their occult satanic beliefs in the media? This is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66jy4-ivAP8">Externalization of the Hierarchy</a>, which Alice Bailey wrote about. They want to indoctrinate you into their Mystery Religions belief system.</p>

<p>Revelation 13:17</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://goedgelovig.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/barcode666.jpg">And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</a></p>

<p>Will you be able to receive eternal salvation through the worship of pagan idols in the New Age religion or through believing that you are your own God? No.</p>

<p>John 14:6</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus said to him &quot;<strong>I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ephesians 6:10</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil&#39;s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>What <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUiwTubYu0">Bill Hicks was saying</a> makes complete sense now.</p>

<p>We have all got to wake up to the fact that we have been living under a lie and that they have had us all wound up chasing the Serpents tail when we&#39;ve actually been told what the truth is all along, <strong>but it has been hidden in plain sight!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>the article adresses coincidence</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For decades, all academic talk of coincidence has been in the context of the mathematical. New work by scientists like Joshua B. Tenenbaum, an assistant professor in the department of brain and cognitive sciences at M.I.T., is bringing coincidence into the realm of human cognition. Finding connections is not only the way we react to the extraordinary, Tenenbaum postulates, but also the way we make sense of our ordinary world. &#39;&#39;Coincidences are a window into how we learn about things,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;They show us how minds derive richly textured knowledge from limited situations.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>To put it another way, our reaction to coincidence shows how our brains fill in the factual blanks. In an optical illusion, he explains, our brain fills the gaps, and although people take it for granted that seeing is believing, optical illusions prove that&#39;s not true. &#39;&#39;Illusions also prove that our brain is capable of imposing structure on the world,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;One of the things our brain is designed to do is infer the causal structure of the world from limited information.&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>If not for this ability, he says, a child could not learn to speak. A child sees a conspiracy, he says, in that others around him are obviously communicating and it is up to the child to decode the method. But these same mechanisms can misfire, he warns. They were well suited to a time of cavemen and tigers and can be overloaded in our highly complex world. &#39;&#39;It&#39;s why we have the urge to work everything into one big grand scheme,&#39;&#39; he says. &#39;&#39;We do like to weave things together.</p>

<p>&#39;But have we evolved into fundamentally rational or fundamentally irrational creatures? That is one of the central questions.&#39;&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the help of another redditor I&#39;m going to be compiling a long piece of work that finally reveals the full agenda and post it on here, this is a brief outline of the future. </p>

<p>We have unknowingly been manipulated and fed propaganda for the coming of this event in 2012.</p>

<p>When the major event to happen at the 2012 Olympics is unveiled, people will be in such a shock and state of denial that society as we know it will just break-down.</p>

<p>Ridicule all you want now, but when the first of these events comes to pass you&#39;ll know it is the truth and what you will need to do to prepare.</p>

<p>Unknowingly, we&#39;ve been living under a massive psy-op that&#39;s made us believe that Bible prophecy isn&#39;t true, (but it is), this has mostly been done by the way of the Roman Catholic CULT giving us their ridiculous and false version of the Bible, in order to make us think it&#39;s a silly fictional book, when it isn&#39;t. Almost all Christians aren&#39;t following a proper and literal interpretation of the Bible (which is what you must do and is the reason we have been told to not do this by our enemies). It&#39;s not very hard if you read Daniel and Revelations to work out whether Bible prophecy is true or not and the evidence shows that it indeed is completely accurate. (<em>For those with wisdom and understanding</em> Psalms 110-118 also unlocks the period of the Tribulation, which is 2011-2018 plus the coming war of 2010 that precedes this.)</p>

<p>Make no mistake there will be no Rapture, this is a false Roman Catholic doctrine that will deceive many when it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>You may not believe these things are true now, but once they begin you&#39;ll understand the truth and what you have to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>2010</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be three Muslim/Arab states that will either make war with or be seen to pose a threat to Israel and under the Popes advice the U.N. will form a world government in order to destroy these countries.</p>

<ul>
<li>2011</li>
</ul>

<p>The Pope will sign a Peace Treaty with Israel and be seen by Israel as the coming Messiah that&#39;s saved them from destruction. This will mark the beginning of the Tribulation and the last 7 years on Earth and the first year of False Peace.</p>

<p>The Bible tells us &quot;Satan is a Liar&quot; and &quot;Satan Deceived the whole world&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEXZfiDC2Ns">The truth about &#39;Aliens&#39; and &#39;Reptilians&#39;, MUST SEE</a></p>

<ul>
<li>2012 - 2nd year of False Peace</li>
</ul>

<p>The coming Alien Invasion at the Opening Ceremony of the London &#39;New Jerusalem&#39; <a href="http://i32.tinypic.com/xf3l9v.jpg">ZION 2012</a> Games of the XXX Olympiad.</p>

<p>XXX = </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Porn</p></li>
<li><p>Kisses on a letter, e-mail or greetings card</p></li>
<li><p>xXx movie with Vin Diesel</p></li>
<li><p>X is the 24th letter of the English alphabet. 2+4/2+4/2+4 = 666.</p></li>
<li><p>‘Britain’s Got Talent’ or ‘America’s Got Talent’ (the three judges consist of 2 males and 1 female, this represents the father, mother and son of the false Trinity)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>When the aliens are revealed, people will break-down in a state of shock. When they will then believe and do and they&#39;ll be convinced mankind the Bible is nonsense and that we are &#39;free from the enslavement of God&#39; and can now break all the 10 commandments. People will participate in public orgies and blood sacrifices to idols.</p>

<p>The Olympics originated in Ancient Greece where the athletes performed nude, this acts as further programming in people&#39;s subconscious for this event.</p>

<p>The 5 rings of the Olympics represent the 5 Beasts of Bible. Think Lord of the Rings, 1 ring to rule them all or one master that rules them all and we even see how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Sauron">Sauron</a> is represented by the Eye of Sauron, the all-seeing eye.</p>

<p>The 5 rings in the New Age beliefs represent the 5 &quot;ages&quot; of the Earth and then they say we&#39;re entering a &quot;New Age&quot;. They teach that the previous Age was of Pisces and we are moving into the New Age of Aquarius (never mind that these New Age wackos never provide any proof for this).</p>

<p>The Olympic torch represents Lucifer the light-bearer, &quot;Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classical Greece was an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich.&quot;</p>

<p>Hitler spread disinformation about a Jewish Banker Conspiracy to the German people so he could get them to go along with his plan.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you see that they hate the Jews, they always blame the Jews. Why? Because they can&#39;t stand that they keep the commandments of God.</p>

<p>This will also mark the beginning of their &#39;New Order of the Ages&#39; where the False Prophet (Obama) will cause everyone to worship the &#39;New Age Trinity&#39; of the Father (The Pope, {Osiris}), the Mother (The Queen, {Isis} who&#39;s Diamond Jubilee is in 2012) and the Son (Prince William, {Horus} will be the false returned messiah, who will celebrate his 30th Birthday on the same day as the opening of the 30th Olympics. This is also why <a href="http://jubilee2012.50webs.com/william.jpg">this picture was taken of him holding the lamb</a>. More mind-programming for this event.)</p>

<p>The emblem for these games is a blue solar logo (the “Bright Sun”).</p>

<p>The sun will be at a new solar maximum at this time because of the approximately 11 year solar cycle. The last time it was at it&#39;s solar maximum was on 9/11/01. This is when they perform there big sacrificial rituals. </p>

<p>They are telling us to expect big solar flares in 2012 scorching the earth. The problem though is that sunspots have seen a record period of inactivity, this is because this world is nearing at it&#39;s end.</p>

<p>The Bible however says however in Revelation 13:13-14</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And he (the False Prophet, which is Obama) performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men. And deceived them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast (the Pope); saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve identified &quot;the image of the beast&quot; as the all-seeing eye. I believe the above passage speaks of <a href="http://darkotix.dreamhosters.com/illuminati-jayz.jpg">Obama getting everyone to do this to the Pope</a>.</p>

<p>Back to the Blue Sun Logo of the Olympics, I believe this is also in reference to God&#39;s blue law. This refers to God&#39;s day of rest on the sabbath, the last day of the week. In true occult fashion, Satan does everything the opposite of God, I believe this Blue Sun, refers to the Pope enforcing his own blue law, that will refer to the first day of the week Sunday and will be a day devoted to sun worship.</p>

<p>The Pope will take all our belongings and distribute them evenly across the world in a false act of peace.</p>

<p>Prophesy in Psalm 112 for 2012</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour. </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>2013 - 3rd Year of False Peace</li>
</ul>

<p>Prophecy in Psalm 113 for 2013</p>

<p>7 : He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;
8 : That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
9 : He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the LORD. </p>

<ul>
<li>2014 - Prophecies of an earthquake</li>
</ul>

<p>3 : The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
4 : The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
5 : What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
6 : Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
7 : Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; </p>

<p>At this point the Bible tells us all these things will have taken place too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Third Temple is rebuilt in Jerusalem.</p></li>
<li><p>The Rise of Babylon (the occult mystery religion beliefs, that originated in Babylon).</p></li>
<li><p>The Rise of the false one-world religion.</p></li>
<li><p>The appearance of the two witnesses and the rise of the 144,000 Jewish evangelists.</p></li>
<li><p>The Seven Seal Judgments.</p></li>
<li><p>The Seven Trumpet Judgments.</p></li>
<li><p>Midway point of 2014/2015 - The Abomination that cause Desolation</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Prophesy in Psalm 115 for 2015</p>

<p>4 : Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men&#39;s hands.
5 : They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
6 : They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
7 : They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
8 : They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them. </p>

<p>The Bible tells us the Midpoint sees</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Death and Resurrection of the Two Witnesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Destruction of the One World Church.</p></li>
<li><p>The death and resurrection of Antichrist.</p></li>
<li><p>Antichrist defiles the temple and proclaims himself God.</p></li>
<li><p>The Mark of the Beast begins.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jewish Remnant flees to the desert.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The final 3 1/2 years (2015-2018) will see -</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 7 Bowl Judgments</p></li>
<li><p>Martyrdom of Jews and Believers</p></li>
<li><p>Babylon is destroyed</p></li>
<li><p>Antichrist summons the world&#39;s armies to Armageddon</p></li>
<li><p>Battle of Armageddon</p></li>
