       For example, almost no one outside of the conspiracy crew even knows that Flight 253 was the sloppiest false flag op in known history, due to every single US news outlet putting a blackout on the majority of what passenger Kurt Haskell and others have said.  They just threw out what didn't fit their agenda.

       the only reason they have changed their minds is because the chinese government has launched massive sophisticated hacker attacks against google's corporate network, using previously unknown (0day) vulnerabilities in adobe and other client software. Other large US corporations have also been attacked recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with Google finally developing a conscience and refusing to go along with China's censorship. That's just the cover story.

       At least they have the balls the stand up against China, which few organization do.  I can't really blame them for dealing with China in the first place, that's a huge chunk of business and that's what Google is, a business.

       Leaps and bounds are easier to conclude when it's what you want to see.  It's much harder to explain a process step-for-step.  I believe, if at any point in a discussion, there is an assumption not based on fact; then the remainder of a discussion cannot be taken in good faith until that assumption has sufficient evidence to address.  I'm not asking you for evidence of "real power [wishing] to create an all-powerful world government".  I'm asking how China has a model gov't that mimics or exemplifies a model preferred by "elites".
      </p>
      <p>
       To be convincing; You'd need to start by discussing the matter subjectively.  Identify what or whom these "elites" are.  Name them.  Provide verifi(able/ed) subjective evidence of an elite agenda. ("Can you not see it happening around you?" is not proof since that is objective.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We may reach conclusions on our senses alone.  I hold faith that this is a subject where many have reassured themselves of answers based on unsolved questions.  I am now asking questions such as those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, provide verifiable/ed evidence that China has a similar agenda.  I've read into as much as I can bear about the abuses on human beings of another nation.  However, I don't wish to assume anything about their actions that isn't explicit.  That would run the risk of continuing a chain of assumptions that systematically bolster faith in more falsehoods, and so on.

       Well maybe if we didn't have something such as HISTORY to go by then yeah maybe we'd all go down your path. Just because YOU are INCAPABLE of learning from history does NOT mean the rest of us are. Do your OWN research....get off your high horse and join the people instead of remaining in your extremely narrow view of your own "reality".

       And why does history; dictated, rather than experienced, hold more value than your own process of observation and conclusion?  What makes you think I have a high horse?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell, I am doing my own research.  The claims made so far haven't included a
       <em>
        single
       </em>
       name or identity to look into.  I have seen titles, and assumptions, all reinforced with more.. titles and assumptions.  SO, I ask questions of those who make claims, since claims imply understanding, and understanding implies concrete knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you mind clarifying
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       where these questions are proving to be a loss?  You could also try asking me questions and I'll see if I can answer them if you wish.

       Study John P. Holdren

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1969 Holdren wrote that it was imperative "to convince society and its leaders that there is no alternative but the cessation of our irresponsible, all-demanding, and all-consuming population growth." That same year, he and professor of population studies Paul Ehrlich jointly predicted: "If … population control measures are not initiated immediately and effectively, all the technology man can bring to bear will not fend off the misery to come."

       Also, what defines John Holdren as an elite?  He may be "Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy"  However, I can only find stories of a man remarkably concerned about what he judges to be an issue of sustainability versus population growth.  Not to mention your quote came from a site (discoverthenetworks.org) that reads like an internet propaganda 'rag'.

       I look to the policy as a simple observation. 1 serving/2 people = 1/2 serving per person.   1 serving/1000 people.  1/1000 serving per person.  Someone's gonna die.. slowly.  What would be your solution in this case?  I'm unsure whether you have knowledge that would prove me to be naive; I'd appreciate it if you shared.

       If you can't afford to have more children in a family, you either lower your standard of living to accomodate, raise your wealth, (which means gaining it at the expense of another, usually indirectly), or you just don't have more kids.  Now imagine your 'family' being one-billion strong.

       My solution to not having enough food for the amount of people would be for nature to take its course. Whether that be some starve to death or make more food if possible. Definitely not for government to be involved in any way shape or form. Does not matter how many.

       So you think the only way someone can raise their wealth is at the expense of another...hmmm...I definitely disagree. If I enter into an agreement to work for someone and they've agreed to pay me for that work it's a win win not a win lose. They get something done they needed done and I raise my wealth.

       You seem to be on a high horse because regardless of how anyone answers you it's not good enough or if it is you just continue to badger on. For instance I replied with some quotes of John P. Holdren's desire to do the exact same thing that China is doing to curb the supposed population problem. Instead of acknowledging that you got your original answer you troll on and ask how is he an elite. I mean give me a break...Obama nominates the control freak to a position of power and you ask what makes him an elite? You come off as an ass when you do such things. A troll just trying to annoy people with a zero common sense mentality. Is that your goal? To troll?

       No shit sherlock....yet your goal is to come in here and troll for that explanation knowing full well it's been written a thousand times over, video's of it all over the web, countless stories right from the peoples mouths who have experienced it and are now warning the people who haven't experienced it personally. Documentaries out the ying yang. If you have access to Reddit then you have access to Google. People don't have any desire to play your game. You can claim you're just wanting proof and want people to not make leaps and bounds but it becomes immediately obvious that you're just a troll. You could be given proof all day long and you'd still be asking other obvious, pointless, diverting, time wasting, trolling questions. If you really aren't purposefully trolling, which I seriously doubt, but if you really and truly aren't trolling may I suggest you study up on gaining some common sense. That would help you more than anything.

       I appreciate you sharing this info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, I understand the history and notion of "he who controls the money supply, controls those who use it" as well as other historically noted usurpations such as the Russian Oligarchy (Tsars) and JP Morgan's rise to power.  Also, I've been reading up on Bilderburg, Illuminati, Corporate Personhood, watched series such as The Industry, Monsanto's GMOs, Codex Alimentarius presentations by Rima Laibow, HAARP, and more that don't come to mind at present.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm doing here is trying to ask a few extremely simple questions of people who make claims.. yet are consistently unwilling to share definitive knowledge.  Of the ones who have responded, aside from you,  they infer that they know more than the average 'informed' man, yet would apparently rather shoot down someone who hasn't beat off to the same videos as they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway Salami, I commend you on at least linking a foundation to the ideas here.  I started learning about such things with the very subject you share.  It still doesn't answer the original claim that I have questioned.

       I love when people think they are smart.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Try
       <em>
        real time
       </em>
       , as in the US government has been giving us a front row view of such an experiment for a very, very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Self-evident.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Um... maybe every single electronic transaction or communication you transmit openly being archived by multiple government agencies, and all the "laws" being rewritten to accommodate such craven intent.  Obama even flip-flopped on that issue with his overnight Rockefeller FISA bill vote change before he was elected, but after a big donor drop by the telecoms under fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how about everyone's cock and balls being photographed and
       <em>
        saved
       </em>
       when you take a flight anywhere.  Make sure your children smile for the camera, whose radiation is the perfect frequency to unzip DNA.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's not forget US citizens being subjected to indefinite detention, all without pesky lawyers, courtrooms, or having that messy family of yours involved because no one told them your government took you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The name of the game is control, and everyone copies notes from each other.

       1) Try
       <em>
        laying it out for "the reddit main"
       </em>
       .  Does the title of your post illustrate an inability to concisely explain to the differing crowd?  Or is it similar to the thrill of slapping each others' asses in the conspiracy locker room?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I can't prove the connection, so if it's self-evident, it's only that way to someone with specific knowledge, I imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Thanks for the candid info.  However, if you're a citizen of a nation (corporation) you have signed/attested to a contract with rights and duties.  You have obligations and someone to answer to.  You are a child of the state and really have no leg to stand on when you complain that the parent, or the process, is something you don't like.

       Sure, again: no one is being executed or disappearing. I am not condoning the actions of the US government but I am simply stating that they are hardly comparable to the normal Chinese government activities. They have roving death vans. We at least get stirred up about it whenever our country royally fucks the rule of law...and so does the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not surprised I got downvoted for that comment - so many people want to make the government out to be devastatingly evil all of the time - yet I know that my point is not empty. We treat our people better. How much better is debatable.

       the total subject of
       <em>

       Oh you are funny.  So, are you incapable of dealing with more than one issue at a time?  I notice you didn't manage to read that bit, which is ironic given your comment.  Also funny is that the purpose of language is to communicate information, so either you didn't understand what i put, which makes you stupid, or you did understand it, in which case you are stupid for attempting to say that what I wrote wasn't in English.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also amusing that you, an american (one would assume from your posts) would dare comment on my english, when i am english, and clearly better at it than you.  You are not, by the way, a native english speaker.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1969 Holdren wrote that it was imperative "to convince society and its leaders that there is no alternative but the cessation of our irresponsible, all-demanding, and all-consuming population growth." That same year, he and professor of population studies Paul Ehrlich jointly predicted: "If … population control measures are not initiated immediately and effectively, all the technology man can bring to bear will not fend off the misery to come."

       My solution to not having enough food for the amount of people would be for nature to take its course. Whether that be some starve to death or make more food if possible. Definitely not for government to be involved in any way shape or form. Does not matter how many.

       So you think the only way someone can raise their wealth is at the expense of another...hmmm...I definitely disagree. If I enter into an agreement to work for someone and they've agreed to pay me for that work it's a win win not a win lose. They get something done they needed done and I raise my wealth.

       You seem to be on a high horse because regardless of how anyone answers you it's not good enough or if it is you just continue to badger on. For instance I replied with some quotes of John P. Holdren's desire to do the exact same thing that China is doing to curb the supposed population problem. Instead of acknowledging that you got your original answer you troll on and ask how is he an elite. I mean give me a break...Obama nominates the control freak to a position of power and you ask what makes him an elite? You come off as an ass when you do such things. A troll just trying to annoy people with a zero common sense mentality. Is that your goal? To troll?

       No shit sherlock....yet your goal is to come in here and troll for that explanation knowing full well it's been written a thousand times over, video's of it all over the web, countless stories right from the peoples mouths who have experienced it and are now warning the people who haven't experienced it personally. Documentaries out the ying yang. If you have access to Reddit then you have access to Google. People don't have any desire to play your game. You can claim you're just wanting proof and want people to not make leaps and bounds but it becomes immediately obvious that you're just a troll. You could be given proof all day long and you'd still be asking other obvious, pointless, diverting, time wasting, trolling questions. If you really aren't purposefully trolling, which I seriously doubt, but if you really and truly aren't trolling may I suggest you study up on gaining some common sense. That would help you more than anything.

       Oh you are funny.  So, are you incapable of dealing with more than one issue at a time?  I notice you didn't manage to read that bit, which is ironic given your comment.  Also funny is that the purpose of language is to communicate information, so either you didn't understand what i put, which makes you stupid, or you did understand it, in which case you are stupid for attempting to say that what I wrote wasn't in English.

       It is also amusing that you, an american (one would assume from your posts) would dare comment on my english, when i am english, and clearly better at it than you.  You are not, by the way, a native english speaker.
