    <div class="md"><p>Leaps and bounds are easier to conclude when it&#39;s what you want to see.  It&#39;s much harder to explain a process step-for-step.  I believe, if at any point in a discussion, there is an assumption not based on fact; then the remainder of a discussion cannot be taken in good faith until that assumption has sufficient evidence to address.  I&#39;m not asking you for evidence of &quot;real power [wishing] to create an all-powerful world government&quot;.  I&#39;m asking how China has a model gov&#39;t that mimics or exemplifies a model preferred by &quot;elites&quot;.</p>

<p>To be convincing; You&#39;d need to start by discussing the matter subjectively.  Identify what or whom these &quot;elites&quot; are.  Name them.  Provide verifi(able/ed) subjective evidence of an elite agenda. (&quot;Can you not see it happening around you?&quot; is not proof since that is objective.) </p>

<p>We may reach conclusions on our senses alone.  I hold faith that this is a subject where many have reassured themselves of answers based on unsolved questions.  I am now asking questions such as those.</p>

<p>Finally, provide verifiable/ed evidence that China has a similar agenda.  I&#39;ve read into as much as I can bear about the abuses on human beings of another nation.  However, I don&#39;t wish to assume anything about their actions that isn&#39;t explicit.  That would run the risk of continuing a chain of assumptions that systematically bolster faith in more falsehoods, and so on.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, I am doing my own research.  The claims made so far haven&#39;t included a <em>single</em> name or identity to look into.

    <div class="md"><p>I look to the policy as a simple observation. 1 serving/2 people = 1/2 serving per person.   1 serving/1000 people.  1/1000 serving per person.  Someone&#39;s gonna die.. slowly.  What would be your solution in this case?  I&#39;m unsure whether you have knowledge that would prove me to be naive; I&#39;d appreciate it if you shared.</p>

<p>Do I think killing is an appropriate response; no.  </p>

<p>Do I agree there should be groundwork for reproductive limitations when evidenced rates of finite resources, production capabilities, and consumption compromise the basic needs of a populous; yes.  </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t afford to have more children in a family, you either lower your standard of living to accomodate, raise your wealth, (which means gaining it at the expense of another, usually indirectly), or you just don&#39;t have more kids.  Now imagine your &#39;family&#39; being one-billion strong.  </p>

<p>What do you mean by human history doctrine?  </p>

<p>The only thing I&#39;m aware of that is of significance to a mass of people that I&#39;m signed to is a nation.  That&#39;s only because my parents signed me up at birth to have rights and duties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My solution to not having enough food for the amount of people would be for nature to take its course. Whether that be some starve to death or make more food if possible. Definitely not for government to be involved in any way shape or form. Does not matter how many.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gaining it at the expense of another</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you think the only way someone can raise their wealth is at the expense of another...hmmm...I definitely disagree. If I enter into an agreement to work for someone and they&#39;ve agreed to pay me for that work it&#39;s a win win not a win lose. They get something done they needed done and I raise my wealth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by human history doctrine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like most people do with you, I&#39;m sure, I read something you wrote (about history) and took it wrong.</p>

<p>You seem to be on a high horse because regardless of how anyone answers you it&#39;s not good enough or if it is you just continue to badger on. For instance I replied with some quotes of John P. Holdren&#39;s desire to do the exact same thing that China is doing to curb the supposed population problem. Instead of acknowledging that you got your original answer you troll on and ask how is he an elite. I mean give me a break...Obama nominates the control freak to a position of power and you ask what makes him an elite? You come off as an ass when you do such things. A troll just trying to annoy people with a zero common sense mentality. Is that your goal? To troll?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leaps and bounds are easier to conclude when it&#39;s what you want to see. It&#39;s much harder to explain a process step-for-step.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit sherlock....yet your goal is to come in here and troll for that explanation knowing full well it&#39;s been written a thousand times over, video&#39;s of it all over the web, countless stories right from the peoples mouths who have experienced it and are now warning the people who haven&#39;t experienced it personally. Documentaries out the ying yang. If you have access to Reddit then you have access to Google. People don&#39;t have any desire to play your game. You can claim you&#39;re just wanting proof and want people to not make leaps and bounds but it becomes immediately obvious that you&#39;re just a troll. You could be given proof all day long and you&#39;d still be asking other obvious, pointless, diverting, time wasting, trolling questions. If you really aren&#39;t purposefully trolling, which I seriously doubt, but if you really and truly aren&#39;t trolling may I suggest you study up on gaining some common sense. That would help you more than anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you sharing this info.  </p>

<p>Though, I understand the history and notion of &quot;he who controls the money supply, controls those who use it&quot; as well as other historically noted usurpations such as the Russian Oligarchy (Tsars) and JP Morgan&#39;s rise to power.  Also, I&#39;ve been reading up on Bilderburg, Illuminati, Corporate Personhood, watched series such as The Industry, Monsanto&#39;s GMOs, Codex Alimentarius presentations by Rima Laibow, HAARP, and more that don&#39;t come to mind at present.  </p>

<p>What I&#39;m doing here is trying to ask a few extremely simple questions of people who make claims.. yet are consistently unwilling to share definitive knowledge.  Of the ones who have responded, aside from you,  they infer that they know more than the average &#39;informed&#39; man, yet would apparently rather shoot down someone who hasn&#39;t beat off to the same videos as they have.</p>

<p>Anyway Salami, I commend you on at least linking a foundation to the ideas here.  I started learning about such things with the very subject you share.  It still doesn&#39;t answer the original claim that I have questioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love when people think they are smart.</p>

<p>1) Try <em>real time</em>, as in the US government has been giving us a front row view of such an experiment for a very, very long time.</p>

<p>2) Self-evident.</p>

<p>3) Um... maybe every single electronic transaction or communication you transmit openly being archived by multiple government agencies, and all the &quot;laws&quot; being rewritten to accommodate such craven intent.  Obama even flip-flopped on that issue with his overnight Rockefeller FISA bill vote change before he was elected, but after a big donor drop by the telecoms under fire.</p>

<p>Also, how about everyone&#39;s cock and balls being photographed and <em>saved</em> when you take a flight anywhere.  Make sure your children smile for the camera, whose radiation is the perfect frequency to unzip DNA.</p>

<p>And let&#39;s not forget US citizens being subjected to indefinite detention, all without pesky lawyers, courtrooms, or having that messy family of yours involved because no one told them your government took you.</p>

<p>1) Try <em>laying it out for &quot;the reddit main&quot;</em>.  Does the title of your post illustrate an inability to concisely explain to the differing crowd?  Or is it similar to the thrill of slapping each others&#39; asses in the conspiracy locker room?</p>

<p>2) I can&#39;t prove the connection, so if it&#39;s self-evident, it&#39;s only that way to someone with specific knowledge, I imagine.</p>

<p>3) Thanks for the candid info.  However, if you&#39;re a citizen of a nation (corporation) you have signed/attested to a contract with rights and duties.  You have obligations and someone to answer to.  You are a child of the state and really have no leg to stand on when you complain that the parent, or the process, is something you don&#39;t like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My solution to not having enough food for the amount of people would be for nature to take its course. Whether that be some starve to death or make more food if possible. Definitely not for government to be involved in any way shape or form. Does not matter how many.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gaining it at the expense of another</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you think the only way someone can raise their wealth is at the expense of another...hmmm...I definitely disagree. If I enter into an agreement to work for someone and they&#39;ve agreed to pay me for that work it&#39;s a win win not a win lose. They get something done they needed done and I raise my wealth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by human history doctrine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like most people do with you, I&#39;m sure, I read something you wrote (about history) and took it wrong.</p>

<p>You seem to be on a high horse because regardless of how anyone answers you it&#39;s not good enough or if it is you just continue to badger on. For instance I replied with some quotes of John P. Holdren&#39;s desire to do the exact same thing that China is doing to curb the supposed population problem. Instead of acknowledging that you got your original answer you troll on and ask how is he an elite. I mean give me a break...Obama nominates the control freak to a position of power and you ask what makes him an elite? You come off as an ass when you do such things. A troll just trying to annoy people with a zero common sense mentality. Is that your goal? To troll?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Leaps and bounds are easier to conclude when it&#39;s what you want to see. It&#39;s much harder to explain a process step-for-step.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit sherlock....yet your goal is to come in here and troll for that explanation knowing full well it&#39;s been written a thousand times over, video&#39;s of it all over the web, countless stories right from the peoples mouths who have experienced it and are now warning the people who haven&#39;t experienced it personally. Documentaries out the ying yang. If you have access to Reddit then you have access to Google. People don&#39;t have any desire to play your game. You can claim you&#39;re just wanting proof and want people to not make leaps and bounds but it becomes immediately obvious that you&#39;re just a troll. You could be given proof all day long and you&#39;d still be asking other obvious, pointless, diverting, time wasting, trolling questions. If you really aren&#39;t purposefully trolling, which I seriously doubt, but if you really and truly aren&#39;t trolling may I suggest you study up on gaining some common sense. That would help you more than anything.</p>
