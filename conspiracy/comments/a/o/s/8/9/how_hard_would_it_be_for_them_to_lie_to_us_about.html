    <div class="md"><p>This sort of shit is infuriating to me, as a scientist.  The idea that the hundreds of scientists who are my colleagues, who have spent their entire lives, and made substantial sacrifices in their personal lives in the pursuit of science, would withhold or hide evidence of life on other planets (their lives&#39; work) is both ridiculous and insulting.</p>

<p>I know this may be hard to discern from your murky basement or from behind your Subway counter at work, but scientists are just regular people.  Because science is to a large extent a meritocracy, many prominent scientists and most non-prominent ones are not drawn from the elite (who aren&#39;t a homogeneous group anyway), and don&#39;t have any desire to prop up the status quo or participate in some pointless conspiracy to hide microscopic life on Mars.  It is a stupid idea.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with SuperSalami&#39;s last reply, but I understand his statement that maybe we will find there are values and ways to harness energy that would be perceived as a violation of modern day physics. I always return to Arthur C Clarke&#39;s famous quote when I see something humans thought or made that amazes me. </p>

<p>But it won&#39;t be done with a well balanced flywheel or anything so crude. And nothing is free, it may merely seem to be free from an uninitiated or laypersons  view point.</p>

<p>As far as the original article is concerned, I&#39;ve never been part of suppression that equates to Earth shattering suppression. But there have been instances where we needed to understand the implications before marketing or releasing it for general use. That can take anywhere from 2 months to nearly 7 years (our longest). The 7 year one was mostly due to going through channels and paper work.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the angle?  What possible motivation would the government/NWO/Jews/Illuminati/etc have for covering up the existence of life within the solar system?  </p>

<p>Lets work a quick hypothetical:</p>

<p>Hypothetical 1: Life exists in the solar system, but is non-intelligent or non-technical.  What reason would the goverment have for covering this up? There literally is no logical reason for such a coverup in this case.</p>

<p>Hypothetical 2: Life exists in the solar system, and is sufficiently advanced to be on par or well-beyond our current technology level.  Now, you could posit that the government might not want the world to have knowledge of advanced technologies/impending doom/etc related to alien intelligences, but how would you suggest they prevent millions of astronomers, amateur and otherwise, from picking up <em>some</em> trace of this intelligence.  Radio waves, microwaves, laser transmissions, signs of organic life (i.e. methane emissions, etc)?  This theory requires that we believe in a conspiracy among millions and millions of widely varying, intelligent people in nearly ever country in the world.  </p>

<p>So, to answer your question, it would be pretty damn hard for &quot;Them&quot; to lie to us about life in our solar system if it were intelligent, and insanely illogical for them to do so were it not.</p>

<p>Secrecy is power, always.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so, in the long run.  Where in the bible does it preclude life on other worlds?  Sure, it doesn&#39;t explicitly mention it, but it doesn&#39;t mention germs either, or space in general (according to Genesis, that&#39;s all water up there).  I think that the religious community would very easily adapt to life elsewhere as more creation attributable to god.</p>

<p>In terms of religion in general, I&#39;ll point out that some Christian and Muslim sects still consider belief in evolution to be blasphemous, yet the fact of its existence has not shaken those beliefs.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not as though what a single scientist says matters. This kind of science is controlled by NASA only, who is the only authority on these matters to the mainstream. </p>

<p>Maybe there is a parallel argument to made regarding whether the US uses underhanded means to control and subvert smaller nations in the name of freedom. You&#39;d have to be quite ignorant to suggest otherwise - and yet there seems to be indications that the monolith that is &quot;US science&quot; treats foreign scientists the same way. If that were taking place how likely is it that the average person would even know about it? We aren&#39;t even aware of the major debates and controversies that science is dealing with right now (unless we do some digging), and simply being presented with the usual line of &quot;trust us we&#39;re the experts.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a very good comparison, as this is a pretty good example of a single scientist publishing sensationalist results (which incidentally run contrary to literally <em>all other</em> scientific studies on the subject) in the interest of government funding.</p>

<p>And no, this kind of science is not remotely monopolized by NASA.  Scientists all over the developed world have access to much of the technologies (at least in terms of microwave/radio detection and spectral analysis) which would allow the detection of life in the solar system, advanced and otherwise.  </p>

<p>Honestly, your entire last paragraph flies in the face of reality.  Ever heard of something called CERN?  You know, the most advanced particle accelerator in the world?  The one run by foreign scientists that the US science monolith steamrolls in the name of freedom? I think you have a bit of a US-centric view on science, and lack much of an understanding of how it actually works in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I know, so much &quot;logic&quot; and shit elsewhere, amiright? People questioning blatantly incorrect assertions, rather than simply linking to a youtube video?  Just crazy out there, man. Its <em>safer</em> here. </p>

<p>Seriously though, I simply pointed out that your assumptions (and they were just that, incorrect assumptions) were incorrect in terms of how science is done in the world today.  </p>
