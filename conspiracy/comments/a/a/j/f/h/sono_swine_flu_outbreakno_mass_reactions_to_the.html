Ukraine happened before the vaccinations had started, and the (psychosomatic) disabled girl had regular seasonal flu vaccination, not swine. I don&#39;t really know any about any other remotely credible cases. There was a few cases of people dying from natural causes a couple of days after getting vaccinated, but no link was established. People die all the time, with or without vaccination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you familiar with the Jehovah&#39;s witnesses?  They are a Christian sect which believes we are living in the end of days.  They initially claimed that the world would end in 1914.  When this did not happen, they revised their predictions to point out 1925 as the year of Armageddon.  When 1925 came and went, they again revised their predictions to point at 1975 as the end of the world.  Once <em>that</em> came and went, they stopped making specific predictions.  </p>

<p>If it sounds familiar, its because the same thing happens in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> every day.  A prediction is made, without proof.  Said prediction fails to come to pass, and it is simply revised or tossed aside in favor of new predictions.</p>

<p>My prediction?  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> will find a way to make the failure of their conspiracy theories a conspiracy in and of itself.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same about endless conspiracy theories as John Cleese feels about mega capitalists - &quot;If I like chocolate it won&#39;t surprise you that I have a few chocolates in my fridge, but if you find out I&#39;ve got 16 warehouses full of chocolate, you&#39;d think I was insane.&quot; </p>

<p>Pick a religion or a way of life, then honor it. Do as little pontificating as possible. Then, once things to come up in life which seem to completely blow that religion/way of life out of the water you don&#39;t have to strech for explanations.</p>

<p>But, of course, that isn&#39;t dramatic. Live awhile and you learn it&#39;s the crazy people of the world who love the most drama, who drag their kids through it, who make a complete joke of whatever cause they&#39;re parading. No international bankers. No military contractors selling white phosphorous to be used on civilians. No corporate news execs lying to keep their viewers powerless and stupid. Just very, very ordinary people who don&#39;t give a damn about anything but a spotlight on themselves, right now, and to hell with anything else.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>H1N1 has already gone the way of bird flu, sars, mad cow, etc.  </p>

<p>First the medical establishment rebelled, then even the doltish American public showed they didn&#39;t buy the need for vaccination against a non-event.</p>

<p>The official nail in the coffin was a couple weeks back when award-winning CBS News correspondent and investigative reporter Sharyl Attkisson basically debunked H1N1 outright, first revealing that there were far, far fewer cases than were being reported, then filing a FOI request with the Dept of Health and Human Services to see the paperwork to back of their numbers, for which she was flatly denied.</p>

<p>The supposed &quot;millions of infected&quot; Ukrainians might perhaps beg to differ...but then evidently no reputable source has been able to track them down just yet to ask them....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a money making scheme, perhaps?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to come to the conclusion that the standard mode of operation in the PR schemes to push agendas through the media / alternative media is to put out memes on the polar opposite extreme ends of the spectrum:  The doomsday meme, and the &quot;trust us, everything is swell!&quot; meme.  </p>

<p>And of course, the truth is always somewhere in the middle.  The crooks get away with the money, the vast majority of the country has no clue, and those who would otherwise be paying attention are too focused on &quot;chip implants&quot;, &quot;nwo genocide&quot; and other such improbable nonsense- when the real story is that the public simply got scared into rushing to buy vaccines for a very mild flu.</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat.  </p>

<p>Perhaps, we are the primary executioners of our own mental imprisonment?</p>

I did see a article about a month or two back that was talking about how women could miscarriage from the vaccine, and there was 40 comments of women saying they had miscarriaged after receiving the H1N1 vaccine.  This could also just be a bunch of women who had gotten the vaccine, had a miscarrage, and found that article, when typing in H1N1 vaccine &amp; miscarrage.
