<p>Sherry was one of the stars of Aaron Russo&#39;s America: Freedom to Fascism. She was the former IRS agent who cried out, &quot;SHOW ME THE LAW!&quot;.  Right now she deserves the support of the entire Freedom Movement. We can give it to her by calling her Congressional Representative imploring him to intercede to save her life.  For her service to the Cause of Liberty, WE SHOULD DO NO LESS!! </p>

<p>Sherry&#39;s Representative is Hank Johnson, representing the 4th Congressional District of Georgia.</p>

Date: November 30, 2009 12:34:03 PM PST
Subject: Sherry Peel Jackson</p>

<p>Hi Friends and Family,</p>

<pre><code>Please, pray for my wife, Sherry Peel Jackson.  She&#39;s still having challenges while she&#39;s incarcerated.  Thank you, in advance, for your prayers and encouragement.  Here&#39;s a letter from Sherry to our Congressman, concerning her current situation.
</code></pre>

<p>~Colin</p>

<p>Dear Congressman Johnson
    I am Sherry Peel Jackson, your former CPA.  I am writing you because I am concerned about my health and my life.  Prior to becoming a political prisoner I was the picture of health.  In late June, 2009 I started experiencing a rapid heart beat on an irregular basis.</p>

<pre><code>Since this had happened infrequently in the past I did not think much of it.
</code></pre>

<p>However, in Mid July it started happening on a regular basis and I became concerned.
I went to the medical staff twice in Mid July only to be given a one-minute EKG test and
powerful meds without proper diagnosis.  I did not take them because I had not been seen
by a specialist.  One week later, on July 21 at 12:45am I left the dorm in flip flops to go tell
the officers that I was having a heart attack.  The officers on duty called the ambulance and
the ambulance checked my heart on their portable EKG machine.  It was beating at 150
beats per minute.  They took me to Leesberg (spelling) hospital where I remained until Friday, July 24th at 11:30pm.  During the hospital stay it was determined that my heart was healthy
but my thyroid was producing too much hormone, thus speeding up my heart.</p>

<p>This is called hyperthyroidism or Graves disease.  I was given two medications by the hospital
- Methimazole, which is an anti-thyroid agent used to reduce the amount of thyroid hormone
produced by the body and Metoprolol, which is a beta blocker used to slow the heart.</p>

<p>The hospital doctor told me that in four weeks (approximately August 21) the prison medical
unit was to do blood tests to determine how the thyroid medication was affecting my body.</p>

<p>The blood test was taken in late August and I was told that I would be placed on the
appointment schedule to come over and review the results.  I was never called.
I went over in early September and inquired of Dr. DeLeon as to how to get blood test
results.  He told me to put in a request to staff, so I did that on September 15th.  It simply
asked to see the results of the tests.</p>

<p>Sometime after September 23rd I received a response in writing, from Ms. Marich, that
stated that I could either make a sick call (come over early in the morning wait in line 
and fill out forms) or come to Open House to see the results.  Open house is held only on
Thursdays from 3:00pm to 3:30pm.  I went to Open House Thursday September 30th and
was told by Ms. Marich that she could not find the results! I watched her look through and
around several piles of folders in her office but at no time did she look on a computer for
them.  She told me to check back later.  On Wednesday October 28th I passed out around
4pm and was taken to medical and cleared.</p>

<p>On Friday October 30th my lips started turning black as if I had been a lifelong smoker.  By Sunday November 1st my lips were fully black. My boss, the Chaplain, called medical and a male nurse was sent over from the medium security men&#39;s prison on this complex (there are
two maximum security, one medium security and one low security men&#39;s prisons on this
complex with the women&#39;s camp).  He took my blood pressure and oxygen and said there was
nothing else he could do.  He told me to go to sick call Monday morning, which I did.</p>

<p>I showed Mr. Coucho my lips and told him that something was wrong with my blood, I could tell.
(I am leaving out gross details here).</p>

<p>He said I would be put on the schedule.  However, the very next day, Tuesday morning,
November 3rd, I found blood in my stool and rushed over to medical because I am smart enough to know that this is a major problem.  I was chewed out for coming over to medical
without a staff member telling me to come.  I told Charlie, the female nurse and Mr. Coucho
the PA that I was in the hospital in July, never got the blood work results and something was
terribly wrong.</p>

<p>I am 46 years old and I know my body!  I finally convinced them that I was not playing and
was not stupid, so they &#39;treated&#39; me with a packet for a stool sample test.  Mr. Coucho looked
on the computer for the blood test results from August and found them there! The blood test
showed a problem with the thyroid way back then!</p>

<p>He said I would be put on the schedule for new blood work later that week because these
results were too old.  He had a short conversation with Dr. DeLeon in Spanish and then said
the thyroid count was off. This was November 3rd.  I administered the stool tests and returned them to Nurse Charlie on Friday November 6th. Today is November 26th, Thanksgiving.  I have not received the results of the stool test. I have not been given any new blood test.</p>

<p>My neck is swelling up like a blow fish and I am having trouble talking.  I have been feeling very ill for the last two weeks. Congressman, I don&#39;t want them to kill me in here.  As you well
know, I am being punished for exposing government fraud.</p>

<p>However, millions of people don&#39;t file tax returns and I was just used as an example by the DOJ for their new program called the Tax Defiers Initiative. I have a wonderful husband and two beautiful children.  I have already spent 21 months in prison for a non crime, and I refuse to come out dead or maimed for life. I have not caused these people any problems.  This is no threat but just for your information. I also wrote the warden today.  Things can&#39;t go on this way as I languish in here for someone&#39;s political gain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. Propylthiouracil and Inderal will knock down the amount of thyroid hormone in your bloodstream. I know this, because I had Graves Disease for 8 years, spent 2 years getting my metabolism readjusted after the radiated iodine, and since then I&#39;ve been taking Synthroid every single day (because now I&#39;m hypothyroidal, and I will stay this way until I am dead). Or, you could get them to carve the gland right out of your neck--but, in all fairness, a lot of those neck-carving jobs leave you with nerve damage to your larynx. Talk like a bullfrog for the rest of your life--and if they leave even a PIECE that whole gland grows right back.</p>

<p>That, and let&#39;s calm down for a moment. This is FED time, we&#39;re talking about--not STATE time where you get the physician&#39;s assistant in place of a GP (and then he always hides his nametag a little so you can&#39;t read &quot;physician&#39;s assistant&quot; on the damn thing). So even though you have a nasty disease, and some a-hole CO&#39;s blocking your path to pill call, at least you got people who actually went to med school.</p>

<p>Watch out for the mood shifts. Your moods, perceptions, sense of confidence, sense of feeling &quot;fully aware&quot;--that&#39;s all metabolic, and it doesn&#39;t matter whether you go up or down, your anxieties will increase.</p>

<p>Second thing: nobody knows how to read THS/T4 tests. Think about it--that&#39;s endocrinology, chakra stuff. Even an endocrinologist (and you won&#39;t have one--you&#39;ll have a GP) can&#39;t really do more than take an inverse of the results and make a guesstimate. For real. </p>

<p>Oh, by the way Gary--Restore the Republic is a great site. And that was a great movie, too. Ignore that first guy who posted talking out has ass about &quot;tax conspiracies&quot;--if he likes bleeding for leeches, more power to him.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re in jail, that&#39;s your world. Get to know God, get to know those inmates trying to get to know God. Then, when you get out, you realize something: we&#39;re all doing time. That&#39;s all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay--update from me:</p>

<p>around noon i was able to call and speak with two of the offices listed above...i spoke with two young women, one at each office, and they both reported that the offices had received, in washington, hundreds of calls, and, in tucker, georgia, a significant phone-in effort--enough so that they are working directly with the office of prisons to resolve this issue...</p>

<p>i also was able to provide some background (i&#39;m sure i&#39;m not the only one who did such) on the significance and Hero/Patriot status of Mrs. Jackson, and just what she has done to garner such support from the Public...i named russo&#39;s film, stated and described Mrs. Jackson&#39;s role, and related that her imprisonment was the direct result of her requesting &quot;Show me the law!&quot;--i also explained that, while there was no such law, at that time, that has since been &quot;fixed&quot;, or so i believe i have learned from my own researches...</p>

<p>both ladies were unaware, they said, of just why this effort was being taken--to speak out in support of Mrs. Jackson, as they were also unaware of the Patriot/Truth movement--the lady in tucker said, &quot;you&#39;re part of a movement?...i explained that it is a loose movement of people and groups that is growing in numbers, a broad cross-section of Americans who have &quot;awakened&quot;, or are &quot;waking up&quot;--again, many as a direct result of Mrs. Jackson&#39;s actions on speaking out and participating in dissent that leads to the Truth ...the Truth behind the FED, the IRS, fdr&#39;s treasonous actions in the 30&#39;s, and the lies, deceptions, and manipulations perpetrated against the American People since...</p>

<p>one young lady is a lawyer, a &quot;legal fellow&quot; in the washington office--i attempted to engage her in a discussion of opinion on whether or not the Constitution, directly or indirectly, spoke to the practical, organic process of Law and the intent of the founders that Law would be understood by all--uncomplicated, plain languaged, not obfuscatory and overly-complicated...she refused, politely, of course, to participate in that conversation...up until that point, she had been very nice, but her attitude turned colder, with a cadence of separation in her speech--perhaps you know what i mean, and perhaps not...she was in a hurry, at this point, to conclude the call...i told her that if she was, in her capacity as a lawyer, aware of Constitutional subversion, that she could be seen to be part of the problem by willing participation in that subversion--notwithstanding that lawyers can be misguided and misdirected, too, i acknowledged...</p>

<p>the young lady in tucker was equally (or so itseemed) unaware, and our conversation stayed pleasant as i said mostly the same things, if rather shortened--though with the same impact!...she did sound, as did the lady in washington, sincerely interested in the background, and she stated she would look into the russo film (as did the lady in washington, btw), and she listened patiently and attentively to my accusations of heinous and treasonous criminality and unConstitutionality of the private FED, the IRS, fdr, and the lies, deceptions, and manipulations to which a growing portion of the American People are awakening and speaking out about...</p>

<p>we parted with graciousness and cordial regard...</p>

<p>both ladies were warmly and sincerely open about a follow-up call in a couple of weeks to ascertain the status of Mrs Jackson&#39;s disposition--both were, of course, careful in stating that this involved Privacy issues, and little could be actually said, other than if issues were being resolved or not...</p>

<p>anywa, that&#39;s my update--i hope that each of you were as successful!...probably more so...</p>

<p>my best wishes for Mrs. Jackson and her family!...it loiks as if Rep. Johnson&#39;s teams are working on the appropriate outcome, and will do their best to insure Mrs. Jackson&#39;s health--if not improving their own educations, though there is good cause for hope, due to the two ladies attitudes and listening abilities!...</p>

<p>of course, i named myself and my general locale--i expect fbi or others any time now...</p>

<p>;-)</p>

<p>peace...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does not apply to &quot;natural persons&quot; as in real life flesh and blood individuals like you and me, it only applies to legal fictions which they trick you into contracting with.  See your license?  Its in all CAPS, so is your social insurance and your Birth certificate, its you representing a legal entity (corporation) that is named after you in ALL CAPS to make you think it is actually you as a natural person.  When they get you to represent the legal fiction they can write the rules that bind that entity and one of those is income tax which is against the constitution because you have a right to property, to take away that right they make you work through a legal fiction and that legal fiction is bound by the laws created for it  not you as a natural person.  What you have to do is separate yourself from the legal fiction.  Its law only if it applies to you, if you&#39;re representing the entity in contract then yes they have jurisdiction, if not, they do not and your rights are preserved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you trying to tell me that people should be exempt from paying tax because of <em>text formatting?</em> thus is completely ludicrous.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s entertain the notion that an all-caps you really is just some ficticious entity. Doesn&#39;t the health system only look after the corporate entity? What about welfare payments? Isn&#39;t the ficticious entity the only thing keeping you in the country, and being registered as a resident of the United States? You can&#39;t just choose when you&#39;re corporate-entity-caps-man when it suits you - you&#39;re either on the books or you&#39;re not.</p>

<p>The capitalization of letters is a simple measure to make strings of text easier to store and retreive in a computer system. If this really was an issue - and it isn&#39;t - it&#39;s would be corrected within a week and the IR code would be modified.</p>

<p>Um... do you have <em>any</em> idea how law works?  It is, quite literally, the specifics in language that <em>define</em> the law.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not text formatting, go look in Blacks law dictionary or any law dictionary.  And yes to all your questions the health care system does only look after legal fictions <em>that you are representing</em>.  Its very complex and takes an education on the subject but if you are truly interested you will find out the truth for yourself, I suggest subscribing to the common law subreddit as a start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am interested and will certainly take your advice. The question still stands, though - why are you happy to represent your legal entity when you&#39;re getting healthcare, welfare checks, and not being deported, but as soon as it comes around to paying tax you abhor the idea?</p>

<p>Either way, claiming there is a difference between the two names is deemed as &quot;frivolous,&quot; will earn you a $5000 fine and have you thrown out of court. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My god, the willful ignorance coming off of you is stunning:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog.php?view=16627">http://www.campaignforliberty.com/blog.php?view=16627</a></p>

<p>Until you have confirmed this court case didn&#39;t exist, please stfu and do some reading.</p>

<p>Let that head of yours catch up with your mouth, because your very last statement clearly demonstrates you have no idea how to represent yourself as a sovereign individual.  In fact, most of your statements here have show that you do very, very little research (and poorly!) before you start lashing out at everyone.</p>

<p>And people wonder why liberty dies a slow and agonizing death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere on any public record systems for Arizona could I find anything relating to this case, so I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;m going to confirm its existence one way or another, unless you have some records you&#39;re willing to share?</p>

<p>The whole argument about the gold fringes on the flag is garbage. In 1925 the Attorney General said that the gold fringe &quot;does not appear to be regarded as an integral part of the Flag, and its presence cannot be said to constitute an unauthorized addition to the design prescribed by statute&quot; and that it was up to the Commander in Chief to decide on it&#39;s validity. Because of this, people jump to the conclusion that all flags with fringes are military flags, thus affecting the court&#39;s jurisdiction. This has, of course, been thrown out of a number of courts.
Again, if they really deemed it to be a seriously issue, the gold fringes would disappear overnight.
The fact that people are willing to try and shovel off their responsilbities as a human being and a functioning member of society over a fucking fringe on a flag sickens me.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t willful ignorance, this is <em>asking questions.</em> I understand you&#39;re asking questions about the current taxation system, but you have to ask questions of <em>everybody</em> - I&#39;m not happy to just sit here and lap up the information that Russo and Jackson feed to us. I am doing research, and it extends beyond a couple of rambling blog posts on some biased &quot;liberty&quot; site. If you&#39;re willing to lose the irritating tone and have a reasonable discussion (more than &quot;stfu do some reading&quot;) then I&#39;ll continue posting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The name in all caps dates from the Roman era.   From Black&#39;s Law Dictionary, 8th edition:</p>

<p>Capitis deminutio (from Roman law) A diminution or alteration of a person&#39;s legal status -- Also spelled capitis diminutio.</p>

<p>Capitis Deminutio Maxima (from Roman law) The diminution of a person&#39;s legal status as a result of being reduced to slavery.</p>

<p>Capitis deminutio minima (from Roman law) The diminution of a person&#39;s legal status involving a change of family, while both citizenship and freedom were retained.</p>

<p>Capitis deminutio minor (from Roman law) The diminution of a person&#39;s legal status involving a loss of citizenship but not of freedom. Under the Empire, banishment for life to an island or other restricted area had this effect. Also termed capitis deminutio media. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is trivia.  I wasn&#39;t saying anything about this being binding to anything current,  I said it <strong>dates from the Roman era</strong>.   The purpose of showing it was to show that <strong>historically</strong>, under <strong>Roman</strong> law, such a thing as case specific meaning to names, did exist.</p>
