<p>So then all our elected officials are immune from conspiracy theories?   Do you really think their constituents know they are part of the family?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I just figured that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would care about evidence that points to a world wide conspiracy.  I just think it&#39;s funny you dismiss the family as a cult.   Does it have members of congress?  Yes.  Does it have members in the senate? Yes.  Is it world wide? Yes.  But apparently it is of no interest to you because it&#39;s a cult?  Aparently the worldwide cabal of scientists that research climate change are much more organized and effect the world more?  </p>

<p>Because rigorous logical analysis of reality exposes the <em>motive</em> of the conspirators quite easily - and the behaviors and claims attributed to &quot;the Family&quot; (which is more commonly a euphemism for the Mafia, a very <em>real</em> player in global crime) do not conform to that motive.</p>

<p>And, because I&#39;m solution oriented, I don&#39;t give much of a shit about any one <em>effect</em> of psychopathy, but rather its cause.  As such, I don&#39;t spend a whole lot of time worrying about the minor characters, as they are a distraction from the primary goal of removing the concept of Efficacy of Evil.</p>

<p>Q.E.D. - a classic red herring.</p>

<p>Problem is, once you figure out the <em>objective moral scope</em> of these various &quot;conspiracies&quot;, they are all identifiable as subsets of the same class of deception strategy, of which a known value-add tactic is &quot;blame the other guy&quot;.

<p>So you are claiming this is a distraction?  </p>

<p>Honestly.  you are crazy.  it&#39;s hard to fight through the words and when I do... I end up realizing that you aren&#39;t making sense.  </p>

<p>this was days ago.  No one is going to read this.  Honestly I don&#39;t give a shit if people do.  No one likes me in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> anyway.  I&#39;m just letting you know that you should think about it.  </p>

<p>don&#39;t believe me?  Save this page.  Open it in word and replace memefilter with my handle and your&#39;s with mine.  reread it again but this time assume you are me.   That&#39;s going to be hard, but do it.  Put yourself in my shoes.  </p>

<p>The original question was &quot;Why aren&#39;t more people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> interested in &#39;The Family&#39;?&quot;  I answered that, paraphrased, there&#39;s very little meat on that bone, and I speculated why it&#39;s getting (rather obviously) pushed.  So yes, even if all motives are pure, it&#39;s still a red herring distracting from much larger and dangerous organizations.  In my opinion.</p>

<p>I can live with you thinking that.</p>

<p>If you take your nick from Rand&#39;s book, you should be able to parse exactly what I&#39;m saying.  Volitional actors (read: people) make choices based on their value systems.  In the act of choosing an action, they reveal their ethos, unavoidably.  The decision to lie reveals the actor&#39;s beliefs about lying, etc.  That is both the &quot;objective moral scope&quot; of a choice, and promoting a red herring fallacy is one of many &quot;deception strategies&quot;, all of which are are similar because they are members of a single class of strategies.  </p>

<p>While that reasoning may be crazy, it certainly should be easy enough for any objectivist to follow and make sense of.</p>

<p>I&#39;m barefoot in Florida, so no thanks hehe.  Seriously, two points.  One, debating in text is painfully slow, and I did it for a long time, so I have good reasons to avoid it now.  That&#39;s one of the reasons we built <a href="http://boldvoices.tv/">boldvoices.tv</a> - join the chat room and ask them.  It is a very well informed group of people.</p>

<p>Two, because of #1 I&#39;m sure I could be more explicit and detailed, but I&#39;m not going to be.  No-one&#39;s paying me to take my morning hours explaining everything I think, and I am available several times per week to address any questions live on camera.  Typing is slower than talking.</p>
