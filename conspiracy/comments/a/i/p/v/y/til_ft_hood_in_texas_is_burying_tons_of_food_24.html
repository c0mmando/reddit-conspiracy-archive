        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Night before Christmas when on the way home from my grandparent&#39;s house (about an hour away through the boonies) and I ran out of gas because all the gas stations were closed that I had passed and tried to get gas at (electric pumps closed and all, who the hell does that?) 
So after sitting there for about 10 minutes, trying to find my AAA card this older guy stopped and asked if I needed help, I think I forgot to mention it was pouring rain. He gave me a ride to the gas station about 20 minutes up the road and while he drove we just chatted about this and that. He was really informed, and I was surprised.. we had a lot of the same view points on a lot of topics, which was really rare to find in my part of the woods.
He proceeded to tell me that his son was stationed at FT. Hood in the military for many years. When his son came home (year or two ago)he had told him that they were secretly bringing food in by the truckloads and burying it, they had been doing it 24 hours a day for the last 8 or more years. (TONS and TONS and TONS of food) He said the would just dig a huge hole, drop it all down in there, an cover it up...
This struck me as very odd. When I got home  I tried to look up more information on this but all I could find was &quot;Shooting at FT. Hood&quot;. 
I&#39;m just trying to see if anyone else knows anything about this.
Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its true . I did this. If the slightest damage happens to a pallette of food or other goods these distributors will simply photograph it , and dump it. They are fully reimbursed by insurance. I drove the 14 wheel trucks. TONS of bubble gum baked beans cooking oil cleaning supplies pregnancy tests , dog food , you name it! When they realized we were keeping some of it and making a killing and giving away stuff , an armed escort was sent with us to the private landfill to ensure EVERYTHING went in the hole. It was utter insanity. This is happening all the time. Every time I see the starving kids commercial I wanna scream. Life is so fucking dumb :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just like ordinary citizens need to prepare <em>when</em> the shit hits the fan so does the military. </p>

<p>They need a stash of food if the roads close (fuel shortage, trucker strike, population evacuation,  blowing up roads in a war) and it is probably cheaper to bury it and save space than to store it in a building.</p>

<p>Not only that if for some reason they were to be under an attack buildings are a target. You blow up all the food and people can starve.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts on the matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some think that the world has had many advanced civilizations which were in some cases more advanced than our present culture. In a repeating pattern all the past civilizations have been destroyed quickly in a short period of time ranging from 3 weeks to 3 months. Current thinking is that the world is due for a catastrophe which the government has known about for the last 20 years. The catastrophe is due to some type of energy waves now traveling towards earth, that will cause massive global storms, which are predicted to move the West coast all the way to the Rockies and the East coast 300 miles in. Roughly 70% of the worlds population would be destroyed in this catastrophe. The electromagnetic waves from this storm will wipe out the worlds power grid for 10 years. There are underground bases and cities that the government have built to survive the catastrophe. Storage of food is one of the things that needs to happen to survive this catastrophe.</p>
