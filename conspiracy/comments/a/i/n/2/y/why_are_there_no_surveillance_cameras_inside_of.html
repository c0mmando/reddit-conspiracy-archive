    <div class="md"><p>No, the lack of cameras after 9/11 is rather conspicuous given all the &quot;security&quot; measures that were added.  Why is it useful to see someone, also after the fact, as they walk around an airport, but not while they&#39;re on the plane?  Most of the airport cameras have no better hope of preventing an attack since they&#39;re in public areas either near security or past security checkpoints.  They&#39;re there for forensic identification of suspects and to expose the weaknesses that allowed something untoward to happen.  Imagine if we&#39;d had cameras on the 9/11 flights, hooked to their own black boxes.  We&#39;d know how the hijackers were able to get into the cabins!</p>

<p>I agree that CCTV is security theater, as are the increased TSA requirements which didn&#39;t stop this Yemeni guy from setting his crotch on fire.  But there are two issues here:  1) this theater is intended to inure people to heightened police presence and invasive scrutiny; 2) these cameras are also potentially useful for the warrantless surveillance of dissidents or political opponents, and help fulfill the &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot; doctrine of being able to find out anything about someone at any time from a variety of sources.</p>

<p>I did not see that argument, but it also fails. Let me re-state that argument: cameras have to exist everywhere, otherwise they don&#39;t do anything. So how about this: a camera on an airplane is hundreds to thousands of times more expensive than one in the airport. They have to be more reliable, be tested to ensure they don&#39;t mess up with plane safety, and they have to be carried from place to place. Cameras in the airport can, if they do anything, stop actions before they occur. Not so cameras on the airplane, they only help if you stop the hijacking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;cameras have to exist everywhere, otherwise they don&#39;t do anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Huh?  <em>Who&#39;s</em> argument is that?  And how does it make sense?</p>

<p>&quot;a camera on an airplane is hundreds to thousands of times more expensive than one in the airport.&quot;</p>

<p>Based on?  I would guess the figure is tens.  Even so, that would amount to an insignificant portion of the expenditures on anti-terror measures over the last 8 years.</p>

<p>&quot;Cameras in the airport can, if they do anything, stop actions before they occur.&quot;</p>

<p>No, they can&#39;t.  If a screener who inspects a person and their carry-ons sees nothing, what&#39;s a guy at a low-res camera going to see?  Most aren&#39;t even monitored in real time.</p>

<p>&quot;they only help if you stop the hijacking.&quot;</p>

<p>Which is why convenience stores don&#39;t have security cameras, or banks!  Because they don&#39;t stop robberies.  Ridiculous.  They are there for identification of suspects and recreation of the events.  What would&#39;ve been more useful after 9/11, the supposed video of the terrorists walking through security that we do have, or video of what transpired on the plane?</p>

<p>It seemed to be your argument. You argue for cameras on planes by telling me about cameras on streets. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on? I would guess the figure is tens.</p>

<p>Based on having to continually fly those cameras around. Based on having to ensure that there is a place for them and having to reduce other carrying capacity and having to have airplane quality inspections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even so, that would amount to an insignificant portion of the expenditures on anti-terror measures over the last 8 years.</p>

<p>And provide an insignificant amount of protection. Saying that it is a small amount compared to that wasted does not mean it is not more waste.</p>

<p>And they are, as I said, mostly useless. It is just that on airplanes seems even more useless.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which is why convenience stores don&#39;t have security cameras, or banks! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A successful robbery does not end in the destruction of the convenience store or bank. A hijacking that ends in recovery of the airplane is an insignificant crime in the scale of things. The security concern is not an even where we recover an intact airplane, it is where the airplane is again used as a weapon. And we have already dealt with that problem, so there is no need for more measures. </p>

<p>We would not have had the video of the airplanes, they were completely destroyed. And, again, you are asking to do something tens and hundreds of thousands of times because there is a tiny chance of something happening. There are real security holes in our system, I don&#39;t get why you want more security theater.</p>

<p>&quot;A successful robbery does not end in the destruction of the convenience store or bank.&quot;</p>

<p>Hostage taking on planes (common in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s), does not end in the death of the terrorist.  There are also non-terroristic crimes that camera&#39;s are nominally intended to surveil.</p>

<p>Black box.  If they can do it for audio, they can do it for video.</p>

<p>And hostage takings are not particularly significant. If that were the problem we would not be doing any of these things. 9/11 showed that, as the least, they would kill everyone on board and, worse yet, use the airplane as a weapon. It is that second thing that matters, not hostage taking. Hostages are available everywhere.</p>

<p>This <em>is</em> only tens of times more.  Besides, the cost and weight do not significantly increase if you add 10 time the storage.  How much weight does it cost for a 6 hour, low res video (&lt;1 gig)?  Nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is too much.  I never said otherwise, you are just intent on believing that I am somehow advocating cameras because I can perceive the fact that having them in airports but not on planes is grossly stupid.  The &quot;rationality&quot; you have injected has been to suggest from every angle that surveillance of planes is useless for forensic analysis or that putting them on planes is tantamount to surveilling every aspect of society and that it is perfectly reasonable not to have put them on despite our &quot;unanswered&quot; questions about what happened on 9/11.  Well that&#39;s ridiculous.  If its important to view bank robberies or people walking through security checkpoints after the fact its useful to see hijackings after the fact.  That I think both are faux measures aimed at inuring people to fascist invasiveness is irrelevant.  The suggestion that the video we get from airports is logical to obtain, but that from the plane is not, is, in my opinion, an attempt to explain away a very valid point on how the steps we take against terrorists are not stupid, or wrong, but <em>not aimed at catching terrorists!</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Surveillance cameras wouldn&#39;t be too useful for two reasons. One, people are constantly moving so they&#39;ll be in and out of frame, visible or not.

<p>That said, there are some airlines that have surveillance systems setup for their fleet. The most notable one was <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-108564033.html">Singapore Airlines</a> back in 2003 </p>

<p>Americal Airlines&#39; alone revenue is in the $20-30 billion dollar range, with a fleet size of 650. By your numbers, this would be an installation cost of some $6,500,000.

<p>The cameras would increase security by helping us figure out <strong>exactly what is going on when these planes are hijacked, attacked or simply fall out of the sky</strong>.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve already filmed us at the airport (except the 9/11 attackers who used an airport with no security cameras), they&#39;ve tracked our credit card payments and read our passports, optionally strip searched or tapped us down at the airport, what more privacy do we have left to lose?

<p>This is what so amuses me about conspiracy and libertarian positions: having business do things is somehow automatically benign, but government is an inherent evil. I found myself in a mall recently, something I work to avoid. And I was struck again at the commercialization of public space. Once upon a time people went to the town center and shopped. And those who had something to say could stand on a street corner and say it. Now more and more is private space and I can&#39;t say a thing, but I can be photographed.</p>

<p>The lighting conditions outside can drastically change based on weather conditions and time of day. People are constantly moving, so they&#39;ll be in and out of frame, visible or not.</p>

<p>This never stopped cameras from being put up outside let alone render them useless. Modern security systems system could easily combine IR cameras with traditional ones to cover all the bases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is too much.  I never said otherwise, you are just intent on believing that I am somehow advocating cameras because I can perceive the fact that having them in airports but not on planes is grossly stupid.  The &quot;rationality&quot; you have injected has been to suggest from every angle that surveillance of planes is useless for forensic analysis or that putting them on planes is tantamount to surveilling every aspect of society and that it is perfectly reasonable not to have put them on despite our &quot;unanswered&quot; questions about what happened on 9/11.  Well that&#39;s ridiculous.  If its important to view bank robberies or people walking through security checkpoints after the fact its useful to see hijackings after the fact.  That I think both are faux measures aimed at inuring people to fascist invasiveness is irrelevant.  The suggestion that the video we get from airports is logical to obtain, but that from the plane is not, is, in my opinion, an attempt to explain away a very valid point on how the steps we take against terrorists are not stupid, or wrong, but <em>not aimed at catching terrorists!</em></p>
