       Post 9/11: So they can spin whatever stories they want about supposed would be terrorists.  The lack of camera's allows them to both spin random disturbances however they want (as dry runs, failed attempts etc.), and to control the understanding of staged events (like the shoe-bomber may well have been).

       No, the lack of cameras after 9/11 is rather conspicuous given all the "security" measures that were added.  Why is it useful to see someone, also after the fact, as they walk around an airport, but not while they're on the plane?  Most of the airport cameras have no better hope of preventing an attack since they're in public areas either near security or past security checkpoints.  They're there for forensic identification of suspects and to expose the weaknesses that allowed something untoward to happen.  Imagine if we'd had cameras on the 9/11 flights, hooked to their own black boxes.  We'd know how the hijackers were able to get into the cabins!

       they are being monitored. Otherwise, they are just more security theater. Comparing one security theater to another does not make either a good idea. I am still amazed that people here are asking for more surveillance.

       I think you're misunderstanding the thrust of this thread.  Given that it was posted to /conspiracy, I interpreted it more as an indictment of the suggestion that camera's are put in public areas to keep us safe ("If they're useful in other places, why not on planes?") and perhaps to suggest that the government is not interested in honestly presenting what happened in the bulk of alleged terrorist incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that CCTV is security theater, as are the increased TSA requirements which didn't stop this Yemeni guy from setting his crotch on fire.  But there are two issues here:  1) this theater is intended to inure people to heightened police presence and invasive scrutiny; 2) these cameras are also potentially useful for the warrantless surveillance of dissidents or political opponents, and help fulfill the "Total Information Awareness" doctrine of being able to find out anything about someone at any time from a variety of sources.

       I did not see that argument, but it also fails. Let me re-state that argument: cameras have to exist everywhere, otherwise they don't do anything. So how about this: a camera on an airplane is hundreds to thousands of times more expensive than one in the airport. They have to be more reliable, be tested to ensure they don't mess up with plane safety, and they have to be carried from place to place. Cameras in the airport can, if they do anything, stop actions before they occur. Not so cameras on the airplane, they only help if you stop the hijacking.

       No, they can't.  If a screener who inspects a person and their carry-ons sees nothing, what's a guy at a low-res camera going to see?  Most aren't even monitored in real time.

       Which is why convenience stores don't have security cameras, or banks!  Because they don't stop robberies.  Ridiculous.  They are there for identification of suspects and recreation of the events.  What would've been more useful after 9/11, the supposed video of the terrorists walking through security that we do have, or video of what transpired on the plane?

       A successful robbery does not end in the destruction of the convenience store or bank. A hijacking that ends in recovery of the airplane is an insignificant crime in the scale of things. The security concern is not an even where we recover an intact airplane, it is where the airplane is again used as a weapon. And we have already dealt with that problem, so there is no need for more measures.

       We would not have had the video of the airplanes, they were completely destroyed. And, again, you are asking to do something tens and hundreds of thousands of times because there is a tiny chance of something happening. There are real security holes in our system, I don't get why you want more security theater.

      <p>
       To reiterate, I think cameras in either place are near useless, I am not arguing for them.  I am simply arguing that if they were useful, planes would be one of the places they would be most useful so it is suspect, as to intent, to put them in airports and not planes.

       "And provide an insignificant amount of protection."

       Yup, just like all the the anti-terror measures post-9/11

      <p>
       "A successful robbery does not end in the destruction of the convenience store or bank."
      </p>
      <p>
       Hostage taking on planes (common in the '60s and '70s), does not end in the death of the terrorist.  There are also non-terroristic crimes that camera's are nominally intended to surveil.

        To reiterate, I think cameras in either place are near useless, I am not arguing for them. I am simply arguing that if they were useful, planes would be one of the places they would be most useful so it is suspect, as to intent, to put them in airports and not planes.

       And hostage takings are not particularly significant. If that were the problem we would not be doing any of these things. 9/11 showed that, as the least, they would kill everyone on board and, worse yet, use the airplane as a weapon. It is that second thing that matters, not hostage taking. Hostages are available everywhere.

       It is too much.  I never said otherwise, you are just intent on believing that I am somehow advocating cameras because I can perceive the fact that having them in airports but not on planes is grossly stupid.  The "rationality" you have injected has been to suggest from every angle that surveillance of planes is useless for forensic analysis or that putting them on planes is tantamount to surveilling every aspect of society and that it is perfectly reasonable not to have put them on despite our "unanswered" questions about what happened on 9/11.  Well that's ridiculous.  If its important to view bank robberies or people walking through security checkpoints after the fact its useful to see hijackings after the fact.  That I think both are faux measures aimed at inuring people to fascist invasiveness is irrelevant.  The suggestion that the video we get from airports is logical to obtain, but that from the plane is not, is, in my opinion, an attempt to explain away a very valid point on how the steps we take against terrorists are not stupid, or wrong, but
       <em>
        not aimed at catching terrorists!

       Surveillance cameras wouldn't be too useful for two reasons. One, people are constantly moving so they'll be in and out of frame, visible or not. The other is that lighting conditions can drastically change in an airplane depending on who opens or closes a window shade and that sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there are some airlines that have surveillance systems setup for their fleet. The most notable one was

       This is ridiculous.  The cost of putting.. say.. 30 cameras into a plane and storing that information in the black box is absolutely negligible compared to the cost of the plane or even the cost of fuel for one transatlantic flight.

       Let us say there are 10,000 commercial airplanes. (Some site said there were 3,000 currently flying in U.S. airspace, so 10,000 is a low but useful estimate.) Call it $10,000 to put in those cameras. (100 a camera, 200 to install on an airplane, I'll throw in a new black box.) So only $100,000,000 to do this. And what does it provide us? Some more invasion of privacy and no increase in security.

       According to studies, there are
       <em>
        millions
       </em>
       of security cameras set up in the United Kingdom alone, the Wikipedia quoted number from a couple of years back is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television#Crime_prevention_and_prevalence_in_the_UK">
        4.2 million cameras
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Americal Airlines' alone revenue is in the $20-30 billion dollar range, with a fleet size of 650. By your numbers, this would be an installation cost of some $6,500,000. This calculation expects that the airline would face the whole cost alone, without tax breaks or governmental support.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cameras would increase security by helping us figure out
       <strong>
        exactly what is going on when these planes are hijacked, attacked or simply fall out of the sky
       </strong>
       .

       They've already filmed us at the airport (except the 9/11 attackers who used an airport with no security cameras), they've tracked our credit card payments and read our passports, optionally strip searched or tapped us down at the airport, what more privacy do we have left to lose? How much more must people lose fighting unknown and unseen bogeymen?

       No, it would not tell us "exactly what was going on". The most useful information is the cockpit and equipment and we have that. The cabin is mostly useless. I don't care that there are already lots of cameras: I don't like them and don't want more.

       I don't like cameras either. I'm just seeing how much propaganda is taking place where there are no reliable sources of visual information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think back to the Pentagon attack, the government's first reaction is to ban/collect all cameras in a ten mile radius and then bury all tapes for next decade. If there were more cameras held by independent commercial or individual interests, this kind of totalitarian information control and manipulation would not be possible.

       I'd prefer not to be filmed at all and I don't want to argue for cameras as the only way, I just look for places where the cycle of propaganda and fear can be broken.

       And of what "actual" use is this? Things happen in lots of places, street corners see more crime than airplanes. You guys are giving the exact kind of hysterical reaction that lead to all of the TSA security theater. It was a rare event and somehow because it is rare you want more intrusion.

       A 747 burns 50-60k+ in fuel going across the US one way.  $100M might seem like a lot of moneyin a vacuum, but there is a huge amount of money moving around in this industry.  At your estimate, it's about 2000 flights worth of fuel.

       No, it is factual. And it is not free. You are spending $100,000,000. For that kind of money you should get some real increase.

       This is what so amuses me about conspiracy and libertarian positions: having business do things is somehow automatically benign, but government is an inherent evil. I found myself in a mall recently, something I work to avoid. And I was struck again at the commercialization of public space. Once upon a time people went to the town center and shopped. And those who had something to say could stand on a street corner and say it. Now more and more is private space and I can't say a thing, but I can be photographed.

       How about security cameras outside at a gas station or a bank?
      </p>
      <p>
       The lighting conditions outside can drastically change based on weather conditions and time of day. People are constantly moving, so they'll be in and out of frame, visible or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       This never stopped cameras from being put up outside let alone render them useless. Modern security systems system could easily combine IR cameras with traditional ones to cover all the bases.

       1) Flying is a very energy intensive thing, and how much energy is used is a function of the mass of the plane. Therefore, only 2 things go on the plane, things absolutely positively required for the flight of the aircraft, and things that generate revenue for the airline.
2) Even if you do have surveillance, what are you going to do with it?  No reaction to the tape is possible in the air, and after-the-fact pictures may stay curiosity, but are still otherwise useless.

       Why should there be cameras inside planes? It would cost at least $100,000,000 to do this (10,000+ commercial planes, $10,000 a plane) and would do pretty much nothing. The hysteria behind your question is exactly what has justified the hundreds of thousands of cameras already around that do nothing.

      <p>
       And hostage takings are not particularly significant. If that were the problem we would not be doing any of these things. 9/11 showed that, as the least, they would kill everyone on board and, worse yet, use the airplane as a weapon. It is that second thing that matters, not hostage taking. Hostages are available everywhere.

       It is too much.  I never said otherwise, you are just intent on believing that I am somehow advocating cameras because I can perceive the fact that having them in airports but not on planes is grossly stupid.  The "rationality" you have injected has been to suggest from every angle that surveillance of planes is useless for forensic analysis or that putting them on planes is tantamount to surveilling every aspect of society and that it is perfectly reasonable not to have put them on despite our "unanswered" questions about what happened on 9/11.  Well that's ridiculous.  If its important to view bank robberies or people walking through security checkpoints after the fact its useful to see hijackings after the fact.  That I think both are faux measures aimed at inuring people to fascist invasiveness is irrelevant.  The suggestion that the video we get from airports is logical to obtain, but that from the plane is not, is, in my opinion, an attempt to explain away a very valid point on how the steps we take against terrorists are not stupid, or wrong, but
       <em>
        not aimed at catching terrorists!
