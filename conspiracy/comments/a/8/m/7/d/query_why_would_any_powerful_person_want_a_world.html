        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every time I delve a little into the rabbit hole of world government conspiracy, I get conflicting vibes.  On the one hand, rich, powerful, influential people want to impose a single government upon all territories and persons of the earth.  On the other hand, that government will apply all manners of control to pacify the masses, making the world docile.</p>

<p>You ask: why do these two themes conflict?  Well, the way that disproportionately powerful people stay powerful is by convincing others that they will protect them with their power and frightening them that by taking their power they will become susceptible to the outside threat.  But if there&#39;s nothing to protect people from, how can the powerful remain powerful?  And if world-governance would remove this power, why would any powerful person chose it?</p>

<p>Think of 1984: the people are content to be cogs in the machinery of their supercounry because it is at war with one or both of the other two supercountries.</p>

<p>Think of Herman Goering&#39;s quote.  If there is no national threat, then this tried-and-true method of controlling people won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>I guess under world-governance, the most extreme dissenters would become terrorists.  These terrorists could be characterized as threats.</p>

<p>What am I missing?  Did I assume something presumptuous?</p>

<p>This brings me to a statement from Werner von Bran (as quoted by his assistant of 20+ years) that he made in the &#39;60s: &quot;First it was the fascists, now it is the Communists, next will be the terrorists, then the asteroids and then the aliens.&quot;</p>

<p>Will this come to pass?  I don&#39;t know.  But the fact remains that they can yet get a lot of (infinite?) mileage out of fabricated terrorists with inhumanly evil agendas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>War was a part of the economy. Therefore, it was necessary to conceive a state of war for a stable economy. The government, the group theorized, would not exist without war, and nation states existed in order to wage war. War also served a vital function of diverting collective aggression. They recommended that bodies be created to emulate the economic functions of war. They also recommended &quot;blood games&quot; and that the government create alternative foes that would scare the people with reports of alien life-forms and out of control pollution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a known fact that war increases the output of technological achievement (revealed to the masses at least). I know it may sound goofy, yet I believe that that the governments of the world know that extraterrestrials exist and at one point (perhaps not in our lifetime) it will eventually be revealed to the population. In order to do so, the governments must combine and amalgamate as one in order to show the &#39;aliens&#39; we are responsible as a civilisation and as whole that we can manage ourselves responsibily. The chaos it would bring to the balance of power, religion and (probably most importantly to the powers that be) the stock markets that &#39;we are not alone&#39; will be catastrophic if it is a sudden realisation. Hence this is why it will be a gradual process with the increase of technology (and war). I&#39;ve had a few beers, and this is the best I can articulate it at the moment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The globalist think-tank Club of Rome decided in the 1970&#39;s that the only way the people of the world would accept a world government would be if there was a global threat that humanity needed to unite against:</p>

<p>â€œThe common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.&quot;
- Club of Rome, The First Global Revolution</p>

<p>And this, from a recent Club of Rome publication - <a href="http://www.mmdnewswire.com/francesco-stipo-6231.html">&quot;World Federalist Manifesto&quot;</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;a world government is the only solution to world problems, such as climate change and the global economic crisis. A world confederation that respects the sovereignty of world nations and that deals with the issues of international economy that cannot be dealt by one nation alone&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, if the climate change, pollution or overpopulation boogeymen fails to serve as a surrogate Emmanuel Goldstein, we always have the nebulous, nefarious, &quot;The Terrorists&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the radicals and nationalists of the world going away anytime soon. There will always be pockets of rebellion to any world government, and false flag attacks are cheap and effective!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, thanks for the idea of another way those conspiring for world-governance might be influencing others.</p>

<p>How does your suggestion address my thesis that world-governance is bad for powerful people because it would conflict with their remaining in power?  If they already have a tactic that works to maintain power (e.g., &quot;we needs to protect ourselves from middle-eastern varmints,&quot;) you don&#39;t need a replacement, particularly one that moves the world towards world-governance, which, as I&#39;ve suggested, lessens the power of the powerful by removing the conflicts that keep them in power (a la KBR/Halliburton, e.g.)</p>

<p>Your scenario seems better suited to a &quot;the powerful want world governance; in what ways are they working towards it?&quot; question.</p>

<p>Is it world money?  Do they want to create a world currency?  How will that empower them.  What concrete effects does a world currency have that would empower the people that controlled it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, well if you think of this global government as the formal imposition of the current system of the Anglo-American Establishment upon the rest of the world, the globalist elites would not be ceding any power or wealth. They would massively expand their feudalistic power pyramid by adding many more people at the base.</p>

<p>The recent Club of Rome book I mentioned above talks about working towards a single world currency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm.  Thanks.</p>

<p>So maybe it is the money.  I was surprised that on that author&#39;s website (Francesco Stipo) he listed <em>four</em> branches of his proposed world federalist government: legislative, executive, judicial, and <strong>financial</strong>!  WTF, since when was any version of democracy served  by a goddammed financial branch of government?  The founders of the US had no financial branch.  I&#39;m starting to catch this conspiracy bug...</p>

<p>It occurred to me recently that when you control the money supply, and can give extra money you create to yourself, and it&#39;s digital (i.e, instant) you can instantly tax a country.  So, the fed is run by bankers, right?  And one of the fed&#39;s job is to loan money to banks overnight or whatever, right?  And whenever you create money, you devalue the currency as a whole, and move value from other people holding currency into the hands of whoever receives the created currency, right?  So...the fed is a quasi-governmental institution for instantly taxing the US and giving the increase in value to banks.</p>

<p>So...the fed is maybe one of the most undemocratic cancers that has ever grown in our country?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Madison&#39;s plan for our country delineated a careful balance of three gov. branches.  This author is proposing an novel co-equal branch to be in charge of finances.  If you think that&#39;s a good idea, I&#39;d be curious to know your justifications for that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that there shouldn&#39;t be some organized way of managing our national finances, I&#39;m saying that it doesn&#39;t need to be a co-equal branch of government.  (And if the current US Fed is any example of what we could expect of a world-federation finance branch, I would add that we should not have our finances controlled by a group with secret meetings, which is not amenable to public oversight, with their membership significantly placed by the vote of banks instead of citizens.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From armchair understanding of economics, one of the reasons that gloabl oversight is being discussed is that because the markets have become global to enforce any sort of regulation would require a body that countries reconginse as having authority. If you think that free markets works just fine then a system that enables regulation is something to aviod. If, like myself, you think that free markets are a failed ideology then global regulation is something that is required.

    <div class="md"><p>A carbon offset tax isn&#39;t a Tax for Living, it&#39;s a Tax for Polluting.  It&#39;s just the case that the way first-world countries live causes more pollution.  But not more than China, whatever world their country qualifies as right now.  </p>

<p>Not that I support that idea, although I might.  I do think we should do more to bring the rest of the world up to speed with us.  How do we expect to have a peaceful world when so many people are dirt poor and uneducated?  And immigration problems?  That wouldn&#39;t happen if people were relatively happy/healthy where they already are.</p>

<p>What makes you think the corporations would flourish while individuals suffered under such a tax?  How would it be any different than right now where corporations wield disproportionate power and influence.  It seems to me to be indifferent what sort of taxes are floating around when the corporate/individual balance is way off-kilter.</p>

<p>EDIT: carbon offset tax is a tax for polluting <em>more</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool video, thanks.  I knew about all this stuff, but seeing the pictures/numbers again is good.  I totally agree with the ideas.</p>

<p>Why is a carbon offset tax fraud?  It makes those who over-produce CO2 accountable for the harm they cause to the world (assuming that overproduction of CO2 is actually causing harm to the world.)  Presumably the tax would apply to cattle-farmers and maybe rain-forest loggers, too, so it would help the problems you suggest need helping.  (But if not, then the tax is shitty, and should account for those things.)</p>

<p>LOL, I don&#39;t think CO2 is nasty, I think it&#39;s a carbon and two oxygen atoms.  It just appears to be a problem in high volumes cause it locks in the suns heat, overheating the earth.</p>

<p>No version of the carbon offset tax taxes an individual for the number of breaths he takes a year.  So no, it&#39;s not a tax on living in any sense unless you consider pollution a necessary part of living.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually the evidence says that CO2 is a byproduct of warming not a cause..thats part of the fraud.. also I will add that since 1860 we might have warmed up .5 a degree this is a good link into some exposure of Faux and real numbers from New Zealand.

<p>I guess a point to be made is that some scientists can not explain why temps are NOT rising while CO2 has risen... that is why they were &quot;cooking&quot; the numbers of TEMPS to fit their preconceived notions of CO2 being a pollutant. Hey Im not a wing-nut and do agree there is alot of problems that need to be addressed...I just agree with the other 1/2 of the scientists who say we are barking up the wrong tree on CO2. I also think this Carbon offset tax is a fraud that will do more harm than good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What evidence says that CO2 is a byproduct of warming?  Last I heard all the evidence said was that there was a correlation between the two and the arguments are all about which model accurately explains causation.</p>

<p>Yeah, of course I&#39;m also not sure about whether CO2 is causing warming or if we&#39;re even observing warming that is abnormal given a timespan of 100,000 years.  But it seems fishy that it correlates so well with the increase of CO2, which we&#39;re releasing in mass quantities with our use of fossil fuels (and cows.)</p>

<p>I do think that it&#39;s less than 1/2 of scientists that are anti-global warming.  I think it&#39;s more like 1/10.  Not that being in the majority proves correctness.</p>

<p>I&#39;m researching this world-governance/global-warming connection (Iron Mountain Report)...I still don&#39;t buy the idea that global warming is a conspiracy cooked up to scare the world into world governance.  (I really don&#39;t want world governance)  Do people really think that all (or most) climate scientists are willing to sacrifice their academic integrity to service the world&#39;s Ã¼ber-elite to create a world government?  Seems fishy.</p>

<p>EDIT: I think we&#39;re going to see that these &quot;exposÃ©s&quot; of climate science fraud are themselves fraudulent.  Not 100% on that, but I would bet $100.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without jumping straight into the topic of global governance, I could talk for hours about the &quot;good&quot; a community--any community--could do itself by having an ongoing &amp; uniform agreement with all its citizens that it would &quot;only trade goods/services for the sake of obtaining that which benefits the entire community, or in cases of emergencies, sustains the life of one of its members&quot;. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the limit of trade. If that&#39;s abided by, and the people have brotherly love for one another, then there would be very little room for discontent and strife to enter that community. In contrast, if you don&#39;t abide by this policy then you have EVERY reason to expect strife and discontent to enter your bailiwick. </p>

<p>Now, that&#39;s not even at a world level. In fact, that&#39;s not even at a nation level--you would have to start with small townships, and probably in an environment where a lot of trade restrictions (almost all external trade restrictions) have been knocked-out through war, natural disaster, social upheaval or all the above. But it all starts with trade--the porousness of your community--and beyond even that it starts with motive within the community, or what Hegel would have called &quot;Spirit&quot; (Geist). </p>

<p>Now, that&#39;s the attitude which works, but it is nothing close to the attitude prevelant of people the world over right now. Globally, mankind still defines &quot;rightness&quot; as his own rightness--his unfettered ability to get all he possibly can, everything he wants piled higher and deeper. And it doesn&#39;t matter whether we&#39;re talking American mankind or Sudanese mankind, whether were talking about the Federal Reserve supporters or the Alex Jones supporters--now, what we&#39;re talking about are human beings everywhere there are human beings on this planet. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a very difficult thing to wrestle with--but it&#39;s going to be wrestled with; and no, there is no global government (nor will ever be a global government) which can impose this model on mankind. And I almost feel I would be insulting your intelligence if I explained to why that&#39;s not going to work--I think you can envision well enough on your own how you would react to that type of government&#39;s imposition. Yet even as I type this there is much going on to make this global government a reality, and people will then war against it. Then they&#39;ll break off from it and follow whatever military leaders don&#39;t like the organization--yet they&#39;ll still be fighting, as they&#39;re still following that &quot;self motive&quot;--self first, self last, self always. </p>

<p>In the end you have a bunch of gangs fighting amongst themselves--practically individual men fighting amongst themselves. And you lose everything. You lose your education systems. Your hospitals. Anything which requires a level of human unity--gone. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see much hope for this current civil order. In fact, in the next 10 years I expect global anarchy--I think its foregone at this point. People have to get really, really sick of what they&#39;re doing to themselves and each other through self-interest before they&#39;ll take seriously anything I have to offer. Afterwards, I can see myself playing a John Winthrop, only without the connection to any foreign government--or maybe an assistant to such a leader. [And I could talk about Winthrop and our transition to a republic, but that&#39;s not really for here.]</p>

<p>And then--years and years into the future--I actually can see a global government coming about, but it wouldn&#39;t be anything like the one coming together today. Instead, this would come after humanity gets beaten down by enough real wars (not false-flag wars, or wars for oil merchants), real plagues, real catastrophes so that people really start to abandon &quot;shameless self interest at all cost&quot;--out of their own volition they begin looking out for their brother man. But that&#39;s not what&#39;s coming about today. What they&#39;re talking about in Copenhagen is giving total control of humanity&#39;s productive input over to the billionaire heirs of bankers who aren&#39;t any different than the punk rich kid down the street who routinely crashes his dad&#39;s Mercedes. </p>

<p>And yeah--that is absolutely crazy. </p>

<p>For my part, I think that there needs to be something to keep our population in check so that we don&#39;t become so numerous that we have no space to stand.  Our planet is big, but fill it with enough people and we&#39;ll be striving with one another for space to piss!</p>

<p>There are some scary ways that such population control might be implemented, but there are some very common sense ways, too, such as make condoms and education available to poor women throughout the world so that their families make healthy choices instead of just breeding with no alternative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just the guidestones. The globalist elite routinely express their support for the ideas of eugenics and the depopulation of &quot;undesirables&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, Ted Turner (member of the aforementioned Club of Rome and creator of Captain Planet) has been quoted many times talking about the need for a global one child policy. Ted Turner has 5 children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We&#39;re too many people; that&#39;s why we have global warming,&quot; he said. &quot;Too many people are using too much stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>Turner suggested that &quot;on a voluntary basis, everybody in the world&#39;s got to pledge to themselves that one or two children is it.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back in 1996, Turner stated in an interview with Audubon Magazine that a 95% population reduction would be ideal. Below is his quote.</p>

<p>â€œA total population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but see my response below.  This explains why a global gov. might be able to form/survive, but it doesn&#39;t explain why the powerful would want to move away from the status quo.  Presently I think the reason the powerful want to move away from the status quo to world gov. is to implement a global currency and control it like the fed currently controls US money: secretly, with no oversight, with the power to give its members (banks/bankers) money whenever it wants.</p>

<p>The recent Club of Rome book I mentioned above talks about working towards a single world currency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm.  Thanks.</p>

<p>So maybe it is the money.  I was surprised that on that author&#39;s website (Francesco Stipo) he listed <em>four</em> branches of his proposed world federalist government: legislative, executive, judicial, and <strong>financial</strong>!  WTF, since when was any version of democracy served  by a goddammed financial branch of government?  The founders of the US had no financial branch.  I&#39;m starting to catch this conspiracy bug...</p>

<p>It occurred to me recently that when you control the money supply, and can give extra money you create to yourself, and it&#39;s digital (i.e, instant) you can instantly tax a country.  So, the fed is run by bankers, right?  And one of the fed&#39;s job is to loan money to banks overnight or whatever, right?  And whenever you create money, you devalue the currency as a whole, and move value from other people holding currency into the hands of whoever receives the created currency, right?  So...the fed is a quasi-governmental institution for instantly taxing the US and giving the increase in value to banks.</p>

<p>So...the fed is maybe one of the most undemocratic cancers that has ever grown in our country?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From armchair understanding of economics, one of the reasons that gloabl oversight is being discussed is that because the markets have become global to enforce any sort of regulation would require a body that countries reconginse as having authority. If you think that free markets works just fine then a system that enables regulation is something to aviod. If, like myself, you think that free markets are a failed ideology then global regulation is something that is required. As to what effect it would have on the &#39;powerful&#39; - I don&#39;t know. </p>
