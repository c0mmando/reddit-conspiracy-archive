Seems like anyone that did any research on the matter would agree. Are people really just too stupid, afraid, and herd-like to accept this? I don&#39;t get it. What do most people think really happened? Or are they just too busy masturbating to New Moon and whatever else is on TV?</p>

<p>As SovereignMan said, this is basically a US phenomena. The rest of the world is open to the idea that the US Establishment would allow 3000 of its own citizens to be murdered to further an imperial agenda. 9/11 truth is healthy skepticism outside of the US.</p>

<p>Americans, however, are subjected to the most relentless and insidious propaganda campaigns the world has ever seen. Turn off your TV for a few months, turn it back on, and you will see for yourself. It&#39;s really quite shocking.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The reality of 9/11 truth is that 99% of people haven&#39;t given it more that a passing thought (an article here, news piece here), and therefore are unaware of what the conspiracy theories are and what evidence they&#39;re grounded in, or what the &#39;official&#39; story is and what evidence its grounded in.  So your observation I would generally agree with as far as the general population, (they just don&#39;t care).  Where I take issue is when that attitude/beleif is applied to people who actively dispute conspiracy claims.  Pundits I enjoy (stewart, maher, colbert, matthews, kristol) all sound terribly uninformed whenever they address the issue of 9/11 truth (and many other issues).  So when people say I&#39;m a fox news watching neo con, obama lover, bush loyalist, or incapable of believing the government could be capable of such evil, or any other accusation in that vein, I find it personally infuriating.  Or saying I&#39;m brainwashed by the media, its nothing more than a talking point that avoids discussing broader issues of 9/11 truth/9/11 debunking, while displaying an attitude of smug superiority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually try to stay out of this sort of stuff because there is really no hope in changing either of our minds on how the events of that day happened. The north and south tower did collapse from the top up, and they fell directly on top of the foundations. Of course the infamous wtc7 collapse from the bottom up in what clearly looks like a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7BImVvEyk">classic demolition</a> I realised this when I first saw this video on that day, but still believed the official story until youtube became available. And Lets not forget who benefited most from the attack, the military industrial complex with wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and not to mention the continued &quot;war on terror&quot; that essentially allows bill of rights to be ignored, see the patriot act. Then there&#39;s the pentagon, flight 93, Dick Cheney, NORAD, NYFD, broken communication, and plenty more.</p>

<p>No, I do not believe the official story one bit. I do believe the truth will come out eventually, when the last remnants of civilization look back at our history to see what went wrong, and come to find out we sat around watching American Idol while our wealth/power/freedoms were brazenly stolen from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The floors that were hit were the ones that <a href="http://www.911blogger.com/files/Correlation%202.jpg">had their fireproofing upgraded</a> in the previous two years.</p>

<p>Yes, you&#39;d have to know pretty exactly where and when the plane was going to hit. Like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Paul_Bremer">L. Paul Bremer</a>, the former Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism and at the time heading <a href="http://global.marsh.com/risk/crisis/">Marsh Crisis Management</a> said it in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2pW6WZhZrQ">live interview just a few hours later</a>, &quot;there had to be some very good coordination&quot;.</p>

<p>The plane hit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tenants_in_One_World_Trade_Center">Marsh USA&#39;s offices exactly</a>, but he makes no mention of this in the interview.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also notable that after resigning from his governmental position, L. Paul Bremer became a director at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissinger_Associates">Kissinger Associates</a> who&#39;s dealings with <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/cummings/cummings14.html">Osama Bin Laden</a> voided Henry Kissinger from heading the 911 commission.</p>

<p>Interesting coincidences carry on as the same L. Paul Bremer is assigned as the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/07/iraq.features11">American pro consul in Iraq and manages to &#39;lose&#39; billions of dollars</a>.</p>

<p>These are facts, not conspiracy theories. They do not prove a conspiracy or a crime, but make it clear this isn&#39;t just about some guys in caves wielding box cutters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NO, it&#39;s all about dissecting the inescapable contradictions within the official story, and demonstrating (using available evidence that the official story conveniently ignored) that much of the official story is blatantly false.

Allegations of doctored news footage in particular are not unheard of (only a fringe minority believe they occurred) and not only there is no credible evidence to support such allegations, there is absolutely no need for the news footage to have been doctored anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cover story.  You say you&#39;re installing internet upgrades.  Detonation wire can look like Ethernet wire.  You perform upgrades throughout the building, moving businesses from floor to floor into vacant floors as you do the job over a series of months.

Once you have a precise location, you detonate starting there.  Blame progressive collapse.  Feed that that story from day one.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see:  One that could be done is shield the devices.  One side could directly face the beam, while the other be shielded from the environment with steel, or whatever material you need to get the job done.  It&#39;s not that hard to figure something out, given the requirements and a little thinking outside the box.</p>

Also, in your earlier post, you assume the planes where flown manullaly into the buildings. But with remote control and guidance technology, they would be able to tell you what desk the nose cone would of hit.

Something like &quot;oh that&#39;s just xxxx&quot;.  And how could bomb sniffing dogs detect a cord?  You seem to be thinking it&#39;s some sort of wire like in the cartoons where the spark moves across the room.  I don&#39;t know much about detonation cords, but I presume that you can get the job done with just a copper wire that sends an electric signal to a device.  It&#39;s a building full of copper wires. No dog is going to pick up on that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are talking about multiple devices (dozens/hundreds), and theoretically miles of copper wire (the more wire, the more resistance, and the more power required).  So it is &#39;possible&#39; but in order to have sequenced explosions you are going to run it to problems due to both due to speed and power requirements.  Just because you can create a scenario does not make it plausible, or practical.</p>

<p>ETA:  Copper wire wouldn&#39;t withstand the impacts and ensuing fires, which was the main point being addressed in this comment thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And again, you are thinking small.  Though buildings are big, the scale at which copper resistance would produce failure has to be much larger.  And the &quot;power requirements&quot; wouldn&#39;t need to be that much.  Just a signal could do.  The ignition could be triggered by a simple switch. </p>

<p>And again, the explosives and corresponding network of wires could be protected. And like Christmas lights that continue to operate when you pull a light out in the middle of the row of lights, they can be wired in such a way where even the destruction of another side could allow the overall system to continue to work.  You just need a little creative wiring.  And it&#39;s not that hard if you know what to expect.</p>

<p>So its not impossible for a plane to vaporize.  The plane didn&#39;t completly vaporize, there was <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?q=pentagon+debris+pics&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;ei=H4gSS5nQDZKMMaWS5TM&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;amp;ct=title&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CBAQsAQwAA">debris</a> found.    Keep in mind that this section of the pentagon was reinforced in the months before the blast, so although it may not have been &#39;nuclear power strong&#39;, it was reinforced to with stand impacts/bomb blasts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories are set up to be outrageous sounding so that people feel they have no choice but believe the official stories entirely.  </p>

<p>Case in point, the H1N1 virus.  If people are led to believe either they must believe it was an engineered disease designed for the New World Order to control world populations, or it&#39;s nothing to be suspicious of at all, most people are going to take the second.  They&#39;d rather be wrong than get painted in a corner with the nut cases, despite the obvious fact that the manufacturers of vaccines are pushing a product that can&#39;t be sold without public panic.  Creating public panic is unquestionably a crucial part of their business plan...but a serious public debate cannot happen on the subject.  The second someone questions anything at all they are automatically part of the tin-foil wearing loonies.</p>

<p>The same with 9/11.  Here we have the co-chair of the 9/11 Commission saying they were underfunded and lied to.  We have the chief counsel of the Commission saying they were lied to.  We have the most secretive Administration in history, willing to lie about anything (see Iraq WMDs for instance) supplying all the information.  Any reasonable person would conclude that 9/11 was never sufficiently investigated; there is no other possible conclusion.</p>

<p>But as long as anyone who questions the official 9/11 story is considered a nutcase, the general population will be content believing in a report which by no objective means is completely accurate.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s important to a lot of people to have some level of faith in our government, and they are willing to ignore a lot of evidence to preserve that faith.</p>

<p>Dude.  Propaganda says &quot;everyone is convinced 9/11 truth is bull shit&quot;. They don&#39;t do propaganda that says that unless huge numbers (in fact a majority) believe we were lied to about 9/11. </p>

<p>You live in a place like the USSR or Oceania where you will be propagandized 24/7.  You will be told crazy shit 24/7 and you will have to pretend to believe it.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Like the 9/11 heariings uncovered the full and unvarnished truth about 9/11.</li>
<li>Like it was some huge accident that we invaded and instituted a very brutal occupation (and have stayed since 2003) in Iraq, which didn&#39;t have WMD, cause they need liberating not cause they have our oil (which we&#39;ve just forced them at gunpoint to hand over to us and which the permanent military bases we&#39;ve built there will insure we keep).</li>
<li>That every phone call, email and web post must be monitored and stored 24/7 for your own protection, not as part of Total Information Awareness part III or IV</li>
<li>That these bankers just accidently keep giving themselves several hundred billion dollar bonuses every six months or so.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>This was suggested as a theory by some since WTC7 which held the Secret Service field office as well as the SEC offices handling the Enron IPO probe, WorldCom, etc. Of course, the <a href="http://1933key.com/9-11-Conspiracy/9-11-Destroyed-SEC-Enron-Investigations">Enron IPO probe</a> case was closed because the evidence was destroyed. Photocopies, anyone? Microfilm? Digitization and server backups? This the year 2001, not some prehistoric times.</p>

<p>Nobody would really <em>care</em> about the WTC7 being destroyed since no lives were lost in its collapse. Plane departure times being off would explain a lot of things being off, even the collapse of WTC7 being prematurely reported. All dressed up for the party and no backing out. However, to hit WTC7 with a plane would require you to take out the two towers in the same operation.</p>

<p>When you consider the erratic flight paths of the planes, the departure delay of the second one is a good theory for why the first plane took such a long detour. After the second plane was confirmed, they both took a direct route to Stewart AFB where they crossed paths at the same time.</p>

<p>This has been discussed before, but for two planes to cross paths is easy enough, but for them to cross a point at the same time requires a lot of coordination. If you&#39;re going to crash planes into buildings anyway there isn&#39;t any reason to coordinate such a meeting unless for some reason you&#39;re planning to swap planes for drones as suggested by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a> scenario. Stewart International Airport, formerly Stewart AFB and used for CIA drug smuggling, Iran Contra operation and even bringing in Bin Laden would be an ideal site for this.</p>

<p>Turns out that Stewart International Airport also was leased to a foreign company for 99 years, just like the WTC properties were leased to Silverstein. You&#39;d think a lot of airports and properties are leased like this, but incidentally Stewart became the first US commercial airport to be privatized.</p>

<p>Wild fantasy? I quote from the Northwoods proposal, drafted up by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and sent to the Secretary of Defense...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact 
duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary 
organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate
would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded 
with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared
aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.</p>

<p>So how do you reconcile that the flight recorder data provided by the NTSB, which itself reveals (in independent analysis) that the flight path was different (different angle of approach compared to the official path), the altitude was much higher (nowhere near ground level), the speed recorded is WAY beyond the physical limits/structural integrity of what the plane could bear, and most recently, that the flight deck door (i.e. cockpit door) was not opened in flight (so how was the hijacking performed)...? If any/all of this is news to you, see here:

<p>So you admit that many (if not all) of the phone calls (our only source for the &quot;heroes&quot; story) had to have been faked by the US government (some were recorded, so it&#39;s not just a case of family witnesses persuaded to lie on the record in the interests of National Pride)?

Plenty of people saw &quot;a&quot; plane, but from what I&#39;ve heard, that plane flew -over- the pentagon, and then &quot;something&quot; travelling really, really fast hit the pentagon a few minutes later. That &quot;something&quot; was a cruise missile or something else -- not a huge commercial airliner. I haven&#39;t heard of anyone who actually saw a commercial airliner impact the pentagon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  Removing this sub reddit from my main page. I believe that Bush and Cheney allowed 9/11 to happen, and that the government continues to let the talk of controlled demolition and missiles to continue because it gives them a very easy way to marginalize anyone that questions the official story.  But I don&#39;t need this kind of abuse from you assholes.  I have suffered enough as a result of those attacks.  I don&#39;t need you horde of children who probably watched the attacks on television in your grade school classes belittling my experience and observations that morning.  Bye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be convinced that 9/11 was an inside job when I see evidence of it. Serious, good evidence. If such evidence does exist, I&#39;ve never seen it on any website or in any form. </p>

<p>Remember, the United States government is awful at keeping secrets, really bad. We couldn&#39;t even keep the Russians from stealing the plans for the hydrogen bomb. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t think one person, especially someone in the FDNY or NYPD would speak out? You think people who lost friends and family in the attacks would keep quiet? You don&#39;t think one military guy would speak up and be the person who saved the United States from evil? </p>

<p>If the US government planned and executed the attacks there should be mountains of evidence, but instead there&#39;s not one scrap. Where are the blueprints of the drone planes? Where are the factories where they were built? Who built them? Are you telling me Boeing factory workers are in on the conspiracy? </p>

<p>Just think of who would have to be in on the conspiracy: </p>

<ol>
<li>People who designed the dummy jets. </li>
<li>People who built the dummy jets. </li>
<li>People at private companies who authorized the financing of the dummy jets, hired workers to build them and authorized the factory space to be used for dummy jets. </li>
<li>Every last person in the administration, including previous Clinton staffers, secretaries, clerks and office workers. </li>
<li>Lower level military officers who would&#39;ve received orders to launch cruise missiles at the Pentagon. </li>
<li>Private and specialists at the launch facility and at numerous radar stations. </li>
<li>Thousands of air traffic controllers and airport administrative personnel. </li>
<li>The entire NYPD, FDNY and the entire NYC government, including people who lost co-workers and loved ones in the attacks. </li>
<li>The private clean up crews at all four sites, including their supervisors and administrative personnel. </li>
<li>The thousands of investigators and administrative personnel at the FAA. </li>
<li>The owners and operators of the WTC, as well as their staffs, and hundreds of MTA officials and their staffs.</li>
<li>Demolition crews and their supervisors. </li>
</ol>

<p>So, you&#39;re looking at at least 10,000 people who would have to be in on the conspiracy, many of whom would have loved to see GWB indicted for treason or impeached, many of whom suffered great traumatic losses in the attacks. And yet not one of these people  has come forward with a single shred of evidence. </p>

<p>Think of the financing alone. From building dummy planes to wiring a building with explosives, how much would that cost? Someone authorized those payments. People in private companies would have had to keep records of the costs and accounting of where the money came from and where it was going. Yet not file has been produced. People always keep track of the money. </p>

<p>Not one written military order has been produced. Not one email has been produced. There has yet to be one single whistle blower or one accidental leak.</p>

<p>Not only would one of these thousands of non-government officials be highly, highly paid to come forward, they would be praised as a courageous savior. Plenty of governments across the world would love to see the US government embarrassed like this, plenty of people would still love to see GWB punished. Yet no one has come forward with any single piece of evidence or document. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at all the 9/11 &quot;Truth&quot; sites and their &quot;evidence.&quot; It&#39;s all conjecture, circumstantial at best, and more often than not, it&#39;s not even evidence of a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Look at this site&#39;s Top 40 reasons to doubt the official story:
<a href="http://911truth.org/article.php?story=20041221155307646">http://911truth.org/article.php?story=20041221155307646</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s not one piece of evidence presented, just some conjecture. </p>

<p>When the 9/11 &quot;Truth&quot; movement starts actually presenting evidence, witnesses and solid details that could only be explained by a inside job, then I&#39;ll take them seriously. It shouldn&#39;t be that difficult with an operation that large, that expensive and involving that many people. </p>

<p>Give me evidence and I&#39;ll believe you. Until then, yes, it falls under &quot;Bullshit.&quot; </p>

<p>6 years ago I would have debated you, noting the several fallacies in the above claim.  However, now I just put on the record that you <em>added nothing</em> to any evidence chain, or theory.  You just bitch that <em>your</em> evidence diaper is soggy, and that we should &quot;give you evidence&quot; so you&#39;ll believe us.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care what you believe.</p>

<p>If you are an honest researcher, there&#39;s vast mountains of perfectly 
<em>valid and admissible</em> evidence all over the interwebs, and I&#39;m sure you could find it <em>if you wanted to.</em></p>

<p>But you obviously don&#39;t, and as such my time is better spent working with people who have more honor and better credibility.</p>

<p>For real analysts: the fnord count is quite high in OC.  Enjoy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of a lack of evidence. Everybody have seen the conspiracy theories, the blurry video clips and the findings of rust a hundred times, but all the evidence this far have been circumstantial. We need confirmed credible witnesses testifying under oath, concrete voluntary confessions and hard undeniable evidence. Everybody are innocent until proven guilt and extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Blurry photographs and name calling will get you nowhere. A few minutes of tape recordings can be enough to take a president, but you don&#39;t have it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got karma to spare, it&#39;s important that you guys realize this. And, yes I am of aware that the official story lacks evidence just as much. I&#39;m not convinced of anything this far.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not a government agent. I just really do not believe in the 9/11 truth conspiracy at all. I believe it gives the gov&#39;t much more credit than they actually deserve.

    <div class="md"><p>Who said anything about &quot;the US Gov&#39;t&quot; ??????????</p>

<p>Also, we don&#39;t need a benefit, motive, or outcome to observe that the fairy tale that was told to us about what happened on 9/11 is false.</p>

<p>Some benefits: owner of WTC got insurance payout, the military-industrial complex (incl. Halliburton) got two new wars, etc.</p>

<p>Remember how after 9/11, the Dept. of Homeland Security was founded? That was partially because different branches of the government weren&#39;t talking to each other &quot;very efficiently.&quot; I&#39;ve heard that the FBI and CIA don&#39;t really interact all that much. I&#39;ve also heard that the CIA has done a lot of shit without telling much of anyone.</p>

<p>That said, I don&#39;t believe in establishing a benefit, a motive, or an outcome when it comes to 9/11 truth. It&#39;s people who hypothesize about that shit that make the 9/11 truth movement seem like bullshit, because there is no evidence (yet) that any one particular person or entity was fully responsible. But there is a fuckton of evidence that the &quot;official story&quot; is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Generally, most theories (of which there are many) that I have seen involve individual and groups being responsible, not &#39;the government&#39;.  The term ,&#39;the government&#39; has very little meaning without it being explicitly defined within the context of each theory, or rather hypothesis.</p>

<p>I would argue that most theories seem to involve the <em>use</em> of the &quot;government&quot; as a resource, tool, and/or cover by some group of individuals, interests, etc.</p>
