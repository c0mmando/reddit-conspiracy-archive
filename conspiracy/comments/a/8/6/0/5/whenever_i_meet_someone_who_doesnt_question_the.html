<p>I watched the video, I think if you look at it from a skeptical and a &#39;unbeliever&#39; stance you will see it has no conclusive evidence, and again, supports claims of believers but does nothing for us who want clear evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure our Government failed at the highest level to prevent these attacks, that mistake being labeled as malicious and as actually deliberate requires a lot more proof than I am seeing. </p>

<p>I do appreciate everyone&#39;s commitment btw, I wish you all the best in seeking your personal truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>USAC (US AIR COMMAND) intercepts ~100 planes every year (remember Paine Stewart&#39;s plane? that was a USAC intercept).</p>

<p>So why do people believe that on 9/11/01, not one, but <strong><em>four</em></strong> jetliners flew around in US airspace, defeating the most sophisticated air defenses in the world, <strong><em>for a fucking hour, unchallenged</em></strong>, including hitting <strong><em>the best protected building in the world, the Pentagon</em></strong> without so much as a defensive rocket being fired?</p>

<p>The two planes that <em>were</em> scrambled were sent up late, and then told not to fly at maximum speed.</p>

<p>But this is all believable to certain people.  I will refrain from further comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I refuse to accept all the government claims of &quot;mistakes&quot; and &quot;missed ccommunications.&quot;  Four jetliners, all turning off their transponders at roughly the same time should have set off alarm bells from coast to coast.</p>

<p>The fact that this did not happen merely deepens the mystery of how the White House, POTUS, Congress and the Pentatgon could be left so open to attack.  </p>

<p>It makes no sense that the holes in our air defense system were wide enough to drive an aircraft carrier through, and that this is acceptable as an &quot;excuse&quot;.   No one was demoted, no one discharged, no one called up on charges, civilian or military, about what was clearly a dereliction of duty, or a defense plan so inadequate as to be tantamount to criminal, allowing 3,000 deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9.2 seconds is pretty clear - 110 floors in two different buildings dropped at near if not exact free fall speeds. That indicates that the floors below were gone before the floor above &quot;collapsed&quot; on it. If you know some of the details of the structure you know that is impossible to have that happen from one floor &quot;collapsing&quot; near the top. Then explain that same phenomenon for WTC7 without any jet hitting the building.</p>

<p>You take a billiard ball drop it 110 stories with one sheet of paper per every floor and it takes over a minute and half to reach the ground.
I don&#39;t know how you can get past that without dropping some acid.</p>

<p>Then why hasn&#39;t anyone published a paper that demonstrates this?  If it&#39;s impossible then some bright structural engineer out there ought to be able to prove WTC7 could not have fallen due to structural failure, of the type specified in the NIST report, and gravity.  </p>

<p>Why do you think this hasn&#39;t been done?  Because it&#39;s not impossible.  Or are all the structural engineers out there in on it too?  All the Universities too?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iran Contra was a for profit scheme wrapped in false patriotism, it would be nowhere near the feat of convincing Government agents to willingly allow the slaughter of 1000&#39;s of American Civilians. The fact that your site has the format of a over the top conspiracy site and somehow manages to include all of a target audiences least favorite players is suspect in it&#39;s own. Again, I don&#39;t see evidence, I see something people want to believe, maybe stronger than a Kenyan birth certificate but at the end of the day it is in the same category of information.</p>

<p>All you have given me is a carpet of loosely bound threads, each one flapping in the air while you keep pointing out how beautiful the patterns are, it&#39;s still a shit carpet.</p>

<p>There is in that last link alone 3 hours of video to watch. Honestly guys, best of luck to you, I don&#39;t believe you but I hope your right, I would love to see every single agency and country mentioned in these writing and videos come up before a trial, they all deserve to answer for at least one other thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really no different in this administration. To me that is the hard thing to get people to understand. I&#39;ve been round for a LONG time and nothing is changing for the better despite all the promises ALL politicians have made through the years. Democrats and Republicans are just two different heads on the same snake. People putting their hopes and dreams in a failing , corrupt system over and over and never getting the big picture.</p>

<p>My kids don&#39;t even understand what freedoms I had growing up because they were removed or adjusted for our benefit before they were of age to understand what they were. Despite the fact that a lot of people here in Reddit not liking religion or Christianity (which is their right) it should also be noted that Christian&#39;s also have the same right in this once awesome country to practice what they believe whether or not they like it. When you start to say they can&#39;t it&#39;s no different then any other hate crime. If American is to remain free all people have the right to choose to do as they please - worship or not. When you make worship against the law something seriously evil is happening. I didn&#39;t mean to get off course here but stop and really take a look at what is happening today in government (both parties).</p>

<p>On the surface this like every other law they pass doesn&#39;t seem that bad and is there for somebody&#39;s protection (very admirable) so everyone agrees then it&#39;s used just as all laws are against something else. In this case it&#39;s Christians or making what the bible says a hate crime. Ok enough of this rant -</p>

<p>Agreed!  Just yesterday our church was raided and 1/4 of our members are still in for &quot;questioning&quot;.  Why can&#39;t america wake up!</p>

<p>What really pisses me off are people that want &quot;God&quot; taken off our currency!   We just barely got it on there and now they claim it&#39;s not right?  Well we have decades of history tied to &quot;in god we trust&quot; what are we going to do, go back to the dark ages when we didn&#39;t have it on our currency!  Our founding fathers would have never approved!</p>

<p>To reiterate, both studies (FEMA and NIST) said damage from the twin towers did <em>not</em> contribute to the collapse. </p>

<p>You&#39;re original state that a skyscraper &#39;collapsed on them&#39; is completely false.  </p>

<p>You also used the word &#39;massive&#39; in regard to the fires.  While a word like &#39;massive is arbitrary and subjective, i&#39;d argue it is also a false claim, as compared to <em>many</em> other high rise buildings that have been on fire, this fire was quite small.  It was only on a small percentage of floors, and couldn&#39;t burn in any one place for very long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If only there was some proof.  Has anyone published a paper demonstrating that WTC 7 should not have fallen?  Nope.  Has there been any hard evidence that there was demolition? Nope.  Has there been any reliable whistle blowers?  Nope.  </p>

<p>The truth is the NIST gave their best guess as to why and how WTC 7 fell.  Are they 100%  accurate?   Most definitely not.  But since there weren&#39;t cameras or sensors on the inside monitoring the support structure to see exactly what failed, when and why the best we can do is an educated guess from the various videos and wreckage.  There are still a lot of unanswered questions about the fall, even NIST admits that.  All they have is their best guess.</p>

<p>This point seems lost on a lot of people.  Even after they&#39;ve read through the entire NIST report, which is laborious at best.  It also saddens me that we spend so much time on this topic while completely ignoring the obvious lies like WMD in IRAQ.   </p>

<p>No, not when they outright ignored some evidence, fabricated others, <em>changed</em> their story back and fourth a few times, gave themselves a large margin of error for their fire simulation, refused to test physical samples for explosives, and ignored eye witness testimony that didn&#39;t fit with what they were trying to prove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part yes.  Obviously there was political pressure and public pressure for them to reach a conclusion faster.  I&#39;ve not heard or read statements that there was political pressure for them to reach a predetermined outcome.  </p>

<p>But thats what I&#39;ve been saying all along!!! There are people who are speaking out against it!  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not an architect or engineer, but I am a computer scientist/software engineer, and I can tell you, they outright omitted some variables in their computer simulations that seem very &#39;arbitrary&#39; (in the sense that it helps push the fire theory).  Stuff where if I did it at work, I&#39;d get fired.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say how accurate their actual &#39;physics&#39; are, because I only have an elementary understanding of physics, but there are certainly other professionals who are speaking out against the report.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/">http://www.ae911truth.org/</a></p>

<p>David Ray Griffin did a good job in his book pointing out the numerous flaws in the study <em>without</em> having to cite other conflicting studies, he does it simply pointing out the blatant contradictions in their own report.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mysterious-Collapse-World-Trade-Center/dp/1566567866/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1259268541&amp;amp;sr=1-1">http://www.amazon.com/Mysterious-Collapse-World-Trade-Center/dp/1566567866/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1259268541&amp;amp;sr=1-1</a> </p>

<p>The whole fire theory hinges on a few key facts that don&#39;t add up: How long it takes fire to bend steel, how long a fire burned in one place, how the design of the beams affect the collapse, and how the beams were dislodged and why.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t necessarily draw the same conclusions he does which is &quot;If it isn&#39;t fire, it must be An Inside Job&quot;. </p>

<p>For all we know the terrorists could have had a car bomb in front of the buliding, or the CIA had the whole thing pre-wired to go up, or a few dudes from Worldcom decided they didn&#39;t want to go to jail, who knows.</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> glaring holes in the NIST report, and we are trying to assist others in &#39;hearing&#39; about them.   The thing is, WTC 7 is largely unknown.

<p>Then write up a technical critique and post it.  Send it around to a few professors or researchers and see if they agree.  Other people have, that&#39;s how the first round of errors were caught.  That&#39;s how errors are caught in everything that&#39;s published.  </p>

<p>Then one would expect journals are researchers in the field to agree.  Problem is they don&#39;t.  They tend to see the NIST report as the best guess.   Are you saying they are deliberately closing their eyes and publishing papers and research that agree with the NIST findings?  Are they all in on it?  Are there any researchers in the field that support this idea that fires couldn&#39;t have done it?</p>

<p>It would help a lot to get some actual researchers in the appropriate fields to back you up.   I&#39;m totally willing to read papers and reports, but what I mostly see are arguments like yours.  Put yourself in my shoes.  What facts have you given me?  None.  Your fire theories aren&#39;t based on science.  You have no research to back you up.  David Ray griffin wrote a bunch which no one in the fields of research he is addressing take it seriously.   If they don&#39;t take it seriously why should I, who know nothing about the field, take it seriously?   </p>

<p>Ok it seems now your arguments have gone from using logic to just believing something because the majority <em>haven&#39;t contradicted it</em>. </p>

<p>Are you saying anyone in the ae911 truth group isn&#39;t legit, or suddenly loses their credentials?  Yes, some are crackpots, but are you saying all of them are?  Labeling someone as a &#39;truther&#39; doesn&#39;t render their arguments invalid by default.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when reading up on the 911 truth movement,  Assistant Director Michael J. Heimbach of the FBI (counter terrorist division) gave praise to AE&#39;s presentations.  Its on wikipedia.</p>

<p>And yes I agree its a bit far fetched. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then one would expect journals are researchers in the field to agree. Problem is they don&#39;t. They tend to see the NIST report as the best guess. Are you saying they are deliberately closing their eyes and publishing papers and research that agree with the NIST findings?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where is this happening?  I hope you are not just making a guess, but I really am interested in reading other published articles supporting NIST&#39;s WTC 7 findings.   I would also be just as interested in reading critiques of Griffin&#39;s work.</p>

<p>Believe me, I went back and fourth on the WTC 7 thing.  At first I found  the evidence questioning the mainstream story.  Then I read the  NIST report and their FAQ, and thought it was pretty legit.  Then I read some of the contradictions Griffin pointed out in their study.  Then I scrutinized the NIST report even further and found even more fishy things about it. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t found anything that does a good job supporting the  NIST study.  Most people on 911 debunking sites are quoting the Popular Mechanics article which is full of crap.  NIST&#39;s own <em>report</em> debunked that one.</p>

<p>I&#39;m keeping an open mind, so I will read anything you point out.  But saying that &#39;people who aren&#39;t truthers don&#39;t agree&#39; is not a legit argument, especially considering how new the report is and how little media attention its gotten compared to the Twin Towers. </p>

<p>I believe the final NIST report on WTC 7 wasn&#39;t released until around a year ago. </p>

<p>Silence and ignorance by the scientific community (on a whole) is not the same as their stamp of approval. </p>

<p>Ok it seems now your arguments have gone from using logic to just believing something because the majority haven&#39;t contradicted it.</p>

<p>I could care less about a majority.  I care about what people that do this for a living think about the science.  Most of this stuff seems bogus to me, but what do I know, i&#39;m an amateur.  I&#39;d like to know what other people in the relevant fields think.  For the same reason you go to a doctor when you&#39;re sick.   Also, I never talked about a majority, you tossed that in.  </p>

<p>Are you saying anyone in the ae911 truth group isn&#39;t legit, or suddenly loses their credentials? Yes, some are crackpots, but are you saying all of them are? Labeling someone as a &#39;truther&#39; doesn&#39;t render their arguments invalid by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No I&#39;m saying it&#39;d be nice if there were researchers outside of 911 truth that agreed.  Just like it&#39;s nice to have researchers outside of the NIST that are willing to publish papers supporting the NIST findings.   At the very least 911 truth should be able to get papers published that support their findings.  So far the only one that I know about that has has been on thermite.  I would like to see more papers published like that.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fire theory is not mine actually. Thats what the actual NIST report reaches in its conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes which is why you say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole fire theory hinges on a few key facts that don&#39;t add up: How long it takes fire to bend steel, how long a fire burned in one place, how the design of the beams affect the collapse, and how the beams were dislodged and why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To which I say, if it doesn&#39;t add up submit a paper and demonstrate the problems with the NIST report.   BTW, be sure that before you link to an article or paper purporting to have demonstrated this that it hasn&#39;t already been looked over by researchers in the field and have found it lacking.</p>

<p>As far as critiques of Griffin&#39;s work, what have you already read?  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Really?  What sites are still quoting popular mechanics?  Seriously, I&#39;d be happy to send them email telling them they shouldn&#39;t reference it.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m following your logic here.  Why is it a problem it was released a year ago and how does that affect the findings it reached?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Maybe this gets to the heart of the discussion. If what you say is true then there should be a rabid fight inside the scientific community to prove it one way or another.  As it is, it&#39;s totally one sided, NIST released their report and pretty much everyone agrees with it.   There has been exactly one &quot;controversial&quot; paper, the thermite paper.  Why aren&#39;t there more?  Where are the papers talking about how the building couldn&#39;t fall like it did?  Where are the papers talking about how the fire couldn&#39;t have brought down the buildings?  The onus is on the truth movement to provide these detailed explanations.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think the onus is on the truth movement?  Or do you think it&#39;s up to everyone else to prove you wrong?</p>

<p>I thought about what you said, and while I think I&#39;m right about the flaws in the  NIST report, I realize that even if I make a damn good case at the end of the day some people are going to want an &#39;authority&#39; in the subject to weigh in with an opinion.</p>

<p>So even if I get you to say &quot;yes your critiques sound correct&quot;, I could always be missing something being that I&#39;m not a structural engineer.</p>

<p>Basically  I think you&#39;re right in that I need to find someone who is more qualified to give an opinion on the report if I want to convince a large group of people. </p>

<p>Any ideas where to start?  I live by a few universities, not sure if emailing a professor some homework is the best way to go...</p>

<p>If you really do have some ideas, I&#39;m open, and i&#39;ll keep you updated if I make any progress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know others that have written up papers and had engineering friends review them.  If you don&#39;t have any friends or acquaintances that would be willing to do that you can boldly step into sites that will do it for free.  I&#39;ve seen a few such examples on the JREF forums where people have posted their work for critique.   The problem with that is they are harsh and you&#39;ll also have to wade through comments to find the decent critiques.   </p>

<p>Another avenue you might try is emailing some of the people in the A&amp;E truth group.  That actually might be the best place to start.   After you get their feedback and make modifications,  I&#39;d try a more open format like JREF.  Really if it makes it through JREF intact then you should be able to submit it to more areas without fear of it being dismissed.  it&#39;s a hellish process and it takes a while but the rewards are pretty good.  </p>

<p>The worst that happens is that you waste a lot of time and don&#39;t come up with anything convincing but at least are far more knowledgeable. </p>

<p>The best is that you&#39;re able to point out some flaws in the NIST report and I&#39;d imagine get response from not only NIST but from other researchers on both sides looking for even more errors in the report.</p>

From my very limited knowledge shape charges simply cut the beam they don&#39;t get rid of it providing enough structural instability for the whole thing to fall.

<p>There is a problem with the above statements. There was no live video coverage of the first plane hitting the tower. There couldn&#39;t be.

<p>Exactly.  So what would you do?  Keep him in the room where the children could kill him or move him to safety outside where they&#39;d only have to worry about everyone with a rifle outside of the school.

<p>yes, because moving him out of that secure school room to a car outside in a very public environment is the first thing you should do to secure him from those kids!

First of all, Logic fails in this universe, as quantum mechanics demonstrates - (Logic comes from the idealism of Socrates and Plato, the logos, influencing Western thought and science, but it&#39;s ultimately a failed belief on the most fundamental levels of reality).  Secondly, human beings will still make determinations.  I assumed the sun was going to come up today, and I was right.  I can determine that 9/11 was an inside job as much as I can determine that dinosaurs walked the earth and that I&#39;m commenting on reddit right now.  The &quot;you can&#39;t be sure of anything&quot; argument is pseudo intellectual cowardice for people that want to impress others with their fake skepticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So whats your opinion on the hundreds of verified suspect events related to 9/11? I suppose i don&#39;t need to bring them up considering you&#39;ve &quot;thoroughly examined it&quot;. I suppose you’ll point me to the debunking websites, I’ve been there too. Here is what one of the main debunking site said about the melted steel in the basement. </p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.debunking911.com">www.debunking911.com</a>
“However, for simplicity and to allow for losses, assume 1 gJ/tonne of yellow hot steel in the basement(s) of WTC 1 &amp; 2(?).
This could easily be supplied by a pressure pulse down the box columns as each floor is stripped off.”</p>

<p>If you believe that a “pressure pulse” caused high grade construction steel in the basement to liquefy then don’t reply, you’d be wasting both our time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still think there were greater errors, miscommunications, and general incompetence in the intelligence community prior to 9/11.  I think it will probably be a few years before their full extent is revealed. Think of the small pieces we have seen through Gates&#39;, Clarks&#39; and Farmers books.  They all reveal more of the inner workings of the National Security apparatus prior and post 9/11, and expose its shortcomings.  I don&#39;t beleive this was part of an elaborate plot as most truthers do, but bureaucratic and organizational arrogance and incompetence.</p>

<p>So I guess I don&#39;t think things are &#39;incorrect&#39;, I just put that as a caveat in my post to try and avoid about a dozen youtube videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The jet fuel burned off very fast. Most of it went up in the fireball. Besides the maximum temperature for burning hydrocarbons (jet fuel) in air is, thus, about 1,000°C—hardly sufficient to melt steel at 1,500°C. It is highly unlikely that the steel at the WTC experienced temperatures above the 750–800°C range. Which would not melt steel. </p>

<p>Neither tower fell on WTC7. Whatever brought it down it was not the towers. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=877gr6xtQIc">A Danish expert in controlled demolition looked at the collapse of WTC7</a>, which he had never heard of before. and said it was due to controlled demolition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were not pools of weakened steel in the basements of both towers and WTC7. Also as the above poster said MAX temp of a hydrocarbon fire is 1000 degrees which this fire most certainly did not reach, the heavy dark smoke pouring out of both towers is indicative of a oxygen starved fire. Also even if it had perfect oxygen and perfect fuel mix even then it doesn&#39;t STAY at 1000 degrees it only reaches that point during what is called flashover if memory serves. </p>

<p>Also the steel heats up not in isolated areas but spreads along every other thing it is connected to specifically around 15 tons of steel in just the area of the fire. </p>

<p>Add to this the time involved .. what was it from 2nd impact to 2nd fall 50ish minutes? So a fire of less than 1000 degrees heated 15 tons of steel to 800 degrees in 50 minutes?</p>

<p>Ok sure ... it isn&#39;t even hard to debunk this shit anymore.</p>

<p>Why did they sell the steel mere days after the collapse, if the story they tell is true that should not have happened.  It was illegal. Tampering with a crime scene, tampering with evidence etc. 
Why did the investigation receive so little funding originally (less than a &#39;normal&#39; plane crash).
Why does the NIST report conflict so heavily with eye witness testimony and observable fact. I will give an example.</p>

<p>Eyewitness: Mark Loizeaux, President of Controlled Demolitions Inc. which was involved in the clean up operation, said that several weeks after 9/11, when rubble was being removed, &quot;hot spots of molten steel&quot; were found &quot;at the bottoms of the elevator shafts of the main towers, down seven (basement) levels.&quot; </p>

<p>Peter Tully, President of Yully Construction, which also was involved in the clean up operation, said he saw pools of &quot;literally molten steel&quot; at the site.</p>

<p>Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the twin towers said &quot;as of 21 days after the attack, the fires were still burning and molten steel was still running.&quot;</p>

<p>William Langeweische the only journalist with unrestricted access to ground zero wrote &quot;areas where underground fires still burned and steel flowed in molten streams.&quot;</p>

<p>Captain Philip Ruvolo, a firefighter involved in the recovery efforts said (in a video online) &quot;you&#39;d get down below and you&#39;d see molten steel molten steel running down the channel rails like you&#39;re in a foundry like lava&quot;</p>

<p>I can list hundreds of these quotes of eye witness testimony otherwise known as &quot;evidence&quot; however here is the NIST quote about molten metal at ground zero.</p>

<p>NIST-&quot;NIST investigators and experts ... found no evidence that would support the melting of steel in a jet-fuel ignited fire in the towers prior to collapse&quot;</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the issue of course, the whole question is since the fire couldn&#39;t have melted the steel why was the steel there in a molten state?</p>

<p>The NIST handles with easily with this next statement.</p>

<p>&quot;The condition of the steel in the wreckage of the WTC towers (i.e. whether it was in a molten state or not) was irrelevant to the investigation of the collapse since it does not provide any conclusive information on the condition of the steel when the WTC towers were standing&quot;</p>

<p>Does that sound as stupid an answer to you as it does to me? I am pretty sure that I am safe saying that I DO know the condition of the steel before collapse, It was solid, it was in beam form, and it was supporting a building. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to convince you I am right, as I said before none of this leads me to any conclusion other than these two &quot;we are being lied to&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened&quot;. I hope I helped move you to also be interested in asking more questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What can make steel molten after a collapse? 
Yes it could have been iron which melts at lower temps but still not low enough. However where did all the iron come from? These were steel buildings.</p>

<p>Every answer I have ever found on this topic (9/11) only leads me to more questions unless I accept what I am told with very little critical thought.</p>

<p>You bring up the steel being messed up, I can list quotes from the crane drivers about the steel being cherry red and girders dripping steel at ground zero. I can also link to images of steel a foot thick bent like a straw with no stress cracks or fractures, this also takes incredible heat. Heat that could not have been present with the current story.</p>

<p>You can speculate as to what they mean by the answers but you have to admit the fact that the answers they provide requires your speculation means they didn&#39;t answer the questions well enough. Keep in mind the NIST report is the 2nd report on this because the first one was such obvious bullshit. NIST didn&#39;t do much better, I have read both reports.</p>

<p>Your speculations are basically the same thoughts I had and as a result I still don&#39;t know shit, I still know I don&#39;t know shit and I still have questions. That is after years of research and reading every government report issued on the subject.</p>

<p>Yes, I have a lot of free time.</p>

I am hoping to validate questions that already seem valid to me by spreading them to the point they can no longer be ridiculed as you see happening in other locations in this thread.</p>

<p>You raise excellent points, better points than 1200+ people who worked on those reports I spoke of could come up with in 5 years. That raises more questions for me, doesn&#39;t it for you?</p>

<p>You at least have to admit that none of these items you claim no knowledge about are beyond your knowledge right? You could take the time to learn it and then have some pretty valid conclusions that would at least stand up to moderate scrutiny? Why have the members of the 9/11 commision the Fema Report and the NIST report all failed to do this then?</p>

<p>My only conclusion is if 1200 scientists had truth on their side supported by evidence, this conversation would have been over years ago. </p>

<p>You have a good answer but this hard to stomach.  Sure heat travels but it also does it pretty slowly.  the building wasn&#39;t made of aluminum, don&#39;t assume it was.   Steal isn&#39;t that great of a conductor of heat otherwise in the civil war they wouldn&#39;t have been able to wrap railroad ties around posts.  Heat just doesn&#39;t&#39; travel that fast along steel.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know heat travels, I know it travels slowly, this is a factor though and it is ignored.</p>

<p>I am not sure which part you have issue with in the heating of steel issue so I will simply provide more information about the whole thing and see where we stand after that.</p>

<p>From NIST - &quot;In no instance did NIST report that steel in the WTC towers melted due to the fires.&quot; It goes further saying &quot;melting point of steel is about 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,800 Fehrenheit), ... NIST reported maximum upper layer air temperatures of about 1000 degrees Celsius (1,800 Fahrenheit.&quot; </p>

<p>So maximum fire temp 1000 degrees, notice the word maximum. </p>

<p>NIST reports that its metallographic analysis of recovered steel found &quot;no evidence that any of the samples had reached temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius&quot; - and this is a statement about recovered steel of every type, not simply steel from core columns.</p>

<p>Now from MIT&#39;s Thomas Eager &quot;It is argued that the jet fuel burns very hot, especially with so much fuel present. This is not true ... The temperature of the fire at the WTC was not unusual ...  In combustion science, there are three basic types of flames, namely, a jet burner, a pre-mixed flame, and a diffuse flame .... A fireplace is a diffuse flame burning in air as was the WTC fire. Diffuse flames generate the lowest heat intensities of the three flame types .... The maximum flame temperature increase for burning hydrocarbons (jet fuel) in air is, thus, about 1000 degrees Celsius .... But it is very difficult to reach this maximum temperature with a diffuse flame. There is nothing to ensure that the fuel and air in a diffuse flame are mixed in the best ratio.&quot;</p>

<p>Edgar goes on to point out that the black smoke being emitted from the towers was a sign that the fires in the towers, far from having the best ratio of fuel and oxygen, were oxygen starved fires. 
He estimated the fires were burning at 648-704 degrees celsius.</p>

<p>Also according to NISTs final report - &quot;the initial jet fuel fires themselves lasted at most a few minutes.&quot; - so after that it was only desks and carpet and files and plastics etcs burning in a quite normal oxygen starved hydrocarbon fire, unable to melt steel.</p>

<p>I checked the timing of the fire as well in case you had issue with the 50 minutes of time available to heat the steel to failure with a 600-700 degree fire. I found you are correct in this issue I was ignorant, but only by 6 minutes. The south tower fell 56 minutes after being struck. With the plane causing damage to only, and again according to the NIST not me- </p>

<p>13 exterior columns severed, 1 heavily damaged
10 core columns severed, 1 heavily damaged
39 of 47 core columns stripped of insulation on one or more floors.</p>

<p>I can further show these estimates to be a bit excessive if you like.</p>

<p>I have a lot more information if you need it, I do hope I have convinced you however that I am neither ignorant nor lying, and that this issue is NOT fully resolved.</p>

<p>As far as your jail comments, yeah someone should be. Who is the question, many of these people are telling the truth or think they are.</p>

<p>As far as fires just look up the definitions of the three types of fires and you will see why it basically had to be one of them. Any pockets of fire would be inconsequential to the collapse of one of these towers even if the pocket was a whole floor. Steel buildings are known to burn for many hours with no structural integrity lost. A quick google search will reveal testimony, images and video of enough of these to convince you.</p>

<p>All the fires, yes.</p>

<p>As far as melted steel yes there are hundreds of eye witnesses of molten steel, satellite images of excess heat weeks later, fire officials reporters crane operators etc all saw it. People also speak of cherry red girders being recovered days later and dripping steel at ground zero sticking out of the ground. </p>

<p>This is a common misconception.  A building did <em>not</em> fall into another building.  Some debris damaged WTC 7 (the third tower to collapse that day), but it was very minor damage and <em>two</em> <strong>government</strong> reports concluded that damage from the collapsing twin towers did <em>not</em> contribute to the collapse.</p>

<p>The &#39;official&#39; story was that fires burning for a few hours on a few floors weakened the support beams enough to the point that the whole building...collapsed (evenly) upon itself.  They also had quite a margin of &#39;error&#39; in their simulations to prove this is what happened also. 
Don&#39;t believe me, read the report.  </p>

<p>The N.S.A. historian, Robert J. Hanyok, found a pattern of translation mistakes that went uncorrected, altered intercept times and selective citation of intelligence that persuaded him that midlevel agency officers had deliberately skewed the evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanyok concluded that they had done it not out of any political motive but to cover up earlier errors, and that top N.S.A. and defense officials and Johnson neither knew about nor condoned the deception.</p>

<p>Mr. Hanyok&#39;s findings were published nearly five years ago in a classified in-house journal, and starting in 2002 he and other government historians argued that it should be made public.

<p>WASHINGTON (AFP) — North Vietnamese made hoax calls to get the US military to bomb its own units during the Vietnam War, according to declassified information that also confirmed US officials faked an incident to escalate the war.</p>

<p>And, possibly another rabbit hole:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On several occasions &quot;the communists were able, by communicating on Allied radio nets, to call in Allied artillery or air strikes on American units&quot;, it said.</p>

<p>They did?  Where does the report say that? Seriously, after acting like an ass and insinuating I&#39;m a liar, I would like to know!  Or is it you who is lying?  What it does say is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As much as anything else, it was an awareness that President Johnson would brook no uncertainty that could undermine his position. Faced with this attitude, Ray Cline was quoted as saying &quot;... we knew it was bum dope that we were getting from Seventh Fleet, but we were told only to give facts with no elaboration on the nature of the evidence. Everyone know how volatile LBJ was. He did not like to deal with uncertainties.&quot;[31]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying the NSA gave them bad information to escalate the war?  So the other information in the report about the captain admitting it probably was ghosts is just a lie and he was really wanting to escalate the war?   Along with the other people involved in relaying false information to the johnson administration?  They were all just wanting to escalate the war?</p>

<p>Yes.  I know.  You copied it from the article.  Which in fact is false, or can you actually find a place that the article is referencing that demonstrates what the article is saying is correct?  This is my whole point.  Or is any article on the internet proof enough for you?  Have you even read the report the article is talking about?  Seriously?  Have you read it?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think so.  So either you are A:  A shithead that believes everything on the internet or B: A liar.</p>

<p>So Which are you?  If you aren&#39;t A or B then you&#39;ll be able to answer my original question instead of just trying to dodge the question.</p>

<p>What we have evidence of is the pentagon and other government agencies responsible for our safety failing and then desperately trying to cover up their ineptness so that they can maintain their relevance and not be blamed and in some cases prosecuted or at the very least sued.

<p>Why be deceptive?  Who has openley stated that &quot;they don&#39;t trust their own &#39;official report&#39;&quot;?</p>

<p>They have said openly that they were lied to by several government bodies, for example, the Pentagon.  Or do you actually have a quote of someone saying that.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Which is a misleading as well.  They knew they were being lied to by the pentagon and other agencies.  If they had had balls at all they would have referred the matter to the justice department who because of bush also would have done nothing.   So far, from all I&#39;ve read, the Pentagon lied to try and cover up their ineptness which the commission didn&#39;t do anything about.  But non of the members said anything about not trusting their own report,  just that it&#39;s incomplete.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> Ok... I better do the comprehending for you:  If the report is based on lies (pentagon lies, whitehouse lies, etc), which is exactly what they are saying, then how the hell can you call it a truthful account of what happened???  Those &quot;lies&quot; can make all the difference. </p>

<p>Just as an example: Did they know or didn&#39;t they know ahead of time?</p>

<p>From the salon article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version,&quot; Kerrey said. The commission had limited time and limited resources to pursue its investigation, and its access to key documents and witnesses was fettered by the administration. &quot;I didn&#39;t read a single PDB,&quot; Kerrey said, referring to the president&#39;s daily intelligence briefing reports. &quot;We didn&#39;t have access to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed,&quot; the mastermind of the plot. &quot;We accepted a compromise, submitting our questions to him through the CIA. Now, that&#39;s not the best way to go about getting your questions answered.</p>

<p>So far, from all I&#39;ve read, the Pentagon lied to try and cover up their ineptness which the commission didn&#39;t do anything about. But non of the members said anything about not trusting their own report, just that it&#39;s incomplete.</p>

<p>Thats an interesting conclusion.  What evidence do you have for the motive of their deception? </p>

<p>ineptness, a small sampling, I encourage you to read through them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was the military trying to come up with a story that made its performance during 9/11 look reasonably competent, when in fact the military had effectively left the nation’s skies undefended that morning.” In particular, tape recordings of communications at NORAD’s Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) indicate that the military did not know of the hijacking of Flight 93 until it had crashed. 9/11 Commission team leader John Farmer will even say that it is “99 percent” certain that Pentagon officers knew they were lying when they made statements to the Commission, sometimes under oath.</p>

<p>Mid-May 2001: CIA Withholds Photo of Al-Qaeda Leader from FBI</p>

<p>Wilshire also asked that the FBI be officially told bin Attash attended the summit in Malaysia, but this information is again withheld</p>

<p>WBZ-TV prepared a story on Ptech, but withheld it from the public for more than three months after receiving “calls from federal law enforcement agencies, some at the highest levels.” The station claims the government launched its Ptech probe in August 2002, after they “got wind of our investigation” and “asked us to hold the story so they could come out and do their raid and look like they’re ahead of the game.”</p>

<p>Newsweek’s main conclusion is: “The investigation turned up no damning single piece of evidence that would have led agents directly to the impending attacks. Still, the report makes it chillingly clear that law-enforcement and intelligence agencies might very well have uncovered the plot had it not been for blown signals, sheer bungling—and a general failure to understand the nature of the threat.”</p>

<p>I&#39;d also like to say how inept the FAA is though I can&#39;t find a good link for that.  Did they try to cover it up?  Hell yeah.  They should be prosecuted!</p>

<p>Of course they could be lying to cover up the fact that Bush let, or led the attack, but then all the people involved would have to be lying, not just the people that were trying to cover up the people that were &quot;lying&quot;.  That sounds confusing because it is.  Why would FAA administrators try to cover up the &quot;lies&quot; of their air traffic controllers?  Why would NORAD try to cover up the &quot;lies&quot; of their officers?  The reason we know about these blatant attempts at a cover up is that the air traffic controlers and officers at NORAD and the Pentagon were telling the truth that people above them were trying to hide... which was ineptness at an institutional level.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FAA flawlessly executed a grounding of every flight in north america and every flight inbound to north america and redirect all those flights in a few hours that day. It is extremely odd to me that the ineptness that was evident that day was so isolated and the ways it was isolated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reply and I&#39;ll look up a source, but if I remember right the airline actually found out first that they were hijacked and then FAA knew about it and then like 15 minutes later Norad new about it.  One might expect the FAA to find out first then, within minutes, (say 2) they would alert the defense department.   </p>

<p>I think you have me wrong.  Individuals performed amazing that day.  The system however was fundamentally flawed.  Remember Katrina?  That was another case of people performing amazingly well (and bad) but the system being completely foobar.   I&#39;ll also add that it it wasn&#39;t for the honesty and bravery of the FAA air traffic controllers the situation would have been far worse and we never would have known about the fuck ups because the FAA tried to cover it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s all true but what is also true is the FAA performed the tasks they failed to perform that day on other days, repeatedly, flawlessly, for years. The system wasn&#39;t flawed except on that day ... </p>

<p>Source?  </p>

<p>From my memory the FAA was chastised because they had shitty tests.  But really I want to see your source.  If you can&#39;t find you&#39;re I&#39;ll try to find mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should merge replies.</p>

<p>My source for this is the FAA itself, intercepts of airliners happen every week and have been happening every week for years. I have quotes from that day, call logs, and testimony of the FAA and NIST. They show basically that a lot of stuff sounds fishy and more is unclear about who fucked up, but again it mostly raises more questions.</p>

<p>Again I want to state, I don&#39;t think I know what happened, I don&#39;t think the government was &quot;behind it&quot;. However, I do think we have been lied to in many ways and I do believe that the investigation was shoddy and illegal, in fact I can prove it. (disposal of evidence from a crime scene, tampering with evidence) Also several government agencies deviated from normal procedure in the extreme. Just compare the funding and investigation of TWO plane crashes that day against any other crash in the history of commercial air travel.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s for sure.  It pisses me off that the Obama administration was willing to gloss over this injustice.  it pisses me off that Bush facilitated the lies.  </p>

<p>i&#39;ll stop...  Ok, maybe a little extra.  Fuck them. Fuck them. People should be in jail.  A lot of people should be in jail. It&#39;s insane that they are not.  No responsibility. But I digress.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s an excellent question.  i don&#39;t know.  It pisses me off that no one wanted to find fault.  Same thing happened during katrina.  We let these assholes get away with homicidal negligence at the very least.  I have a hard time typing it makes me so upset.  There is so much our government is doing wrong it pains me to even think about it.  Torture, lies, corruption, conspiracy, you name it, these fuckers think they are above it.  i don&#39;t know what else to say. </p>

<p>Basically I&#39;m pissed that we at least haven&#39;t tried to find out.  i&#39;d really like to know if our government is this inept, or if they are corrupt. I&#39;m fighting a losing battle though.  Ironically I bring this up to my conservative friends and they label me a conspiracy nut, I bring this up to my liberal friends and they just assume the Bush administration is already guilty.  </p>

<p>Cyince has made a ton of awesome contributions to this forum.   I apologize.  It has seemed that the few times we&#39;ve crossed paths, he&#39;s avoided debating with me.  I shouldn&#39;t take that to mean he&#39;s never had a good debate with others.</p>

<p>This does <em>not</em> however, mean his facts are correct all the time.  Looking through is post history, he&#39;s spread a lot of misinformation just like many of the hardcore truthers with the most far fetched theories do.  </p>

<p>I still disagree with his position and would like to engage him in a debate, primarily because I don&#39;t think I&#39;m as off putting as some of the others and I might just bit a bit more informed.  </p>
