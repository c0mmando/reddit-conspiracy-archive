       It has been reported that Bush considered planting WMD. They couldn't have pulled it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that you need a long trail to establish where/how the WMD was made. You need petro-chemical factories. You need sources -- factories or easily-documented by the UN sanctions import records -- for the initial chemical pre-cursors to make the WMD. You then need munitions factories and special bunkers to store the WMD. This is a lot of shit that sticks out.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know from the 1990s UN inspectors that this infrastructure was destroyed. We know from the pre-war 2003 UN inspectors that they could not find anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, even though Bush considered planting WMD --
       <strong>
        he
       </strong>
       <strong>
        simply
       </strong>
       <strong>
        could
       </strong>
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       <strong>
        expect
       </strong>
       <strong>
        to
       </strong>
       <strong>
        get
       </strong>
       <strong>
        away
       </strong>
       <strong>
        with
       </strong>
       <strong>
        it.
       </strong>
       Bush and his people weren't idiots, they knew that if such a planting were exposed it'd be far more damaging than just not finding any.

       Lets expand on this fact recognizing that finding in WMD's in Africa was golden.
      </p>
      <p>
       After years of research I'm just in awe. I would love to read all of the red tape and see how things were strateegerized. Even though these types of events are inherently evel , the history and dedication that went into would make textbook history just a fucking boring show.

       You could also add the idea that they may have found something, anything that they could hype up to the easily fooled (read fox news crowd).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, weigh the fact that they may find something and be able to hype it up vs. planting something and dealing with the ramifications of getting caught?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose its any easy choice.

       well the needed to find in the very least enriched uranium. It's not just some thing.  Last time I checked, it wasn't about tricking Fox News. I don't know the last time the U.S. was worried about the things they've done. We have the last 100 years to see that's rather apparent.

       I'm not a liberal or a progressive. But it seems to me that aside from privatizing/corporatizing social security, Bush did everything he wanted to while he was president. Like it or not, you've got to give him credit for that.

       I'm not sure that they care about that, although it's a possibility.  But this is the real question: why don't they care about credibility?

        a Department of Defense whistleblower who has revealed that a US covert operations team had planted "Weapons of Mass Destruction" (WMDs) in Iraq – then "lost" them when the team was killed by so-called "friendly fire."
       </p>
       <p>
        "According to Ms. Rogers, there was a covert military operation that took place both preceding and during the hostilities in Iraq,"
       </p>
       <p>
        "These people died, mostly in the same place in Baghdad, supposedly from a stray cruise missile or a combination of missiles and bombs that went astray," Martin continues. "There were supposedly 76 who died there and the other 24 died through a variety of 'friendly fire,' 'mistaken identity,' and some of them – their whereabouts are simply unknown."

        Sources say the Office of Special Plans deployed several extra-legal and unapproved task force missions prior to and after combat operations began. Under the supervision of Doug Feith, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, the OSP ran largely unsupervised and operated in secrecy. According to those familiar with the plans, the off-book missions were approved by Feith -- himself currently under investigation by the FBI for allegations of passing US secrets to Israel and Iran -- Cambone and then-Deputy National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley.

       <p>
        During the summer of 2003 through the fall of 2003, the team, whose members who were not named by sources, is said to have interviewed many Iraqi intelligence and former intelligence officers. The UN source says that the political problem discussed had more to do with solving the lack of WMD than anything else.
       </p>
       <p>
        “They come in the summer of 2003, bringing in Iraqis, interviewing them,” the UN source said. “Then they start talking about WMD and they say to that ‘Our President is in trouble. He went to war saying there are WMD and there are no WMD. What can we do? Can you help us?’”
       </p>
       <p>
        The source said intelligence officers understood quickly what they were being asked to do and that the assumption was they were being asked to provide WMD in order for coalition forces to find them.

       Every component in a WMD, whether it be chemical, nuclear or large scale explosive has some unique fingerprint that can easily be traced back to it's origins.

       Yes, but technically we didn't sell the entire munition to Iraq -- we "only" gave them the instructions and then sold them raw materials to let them make the munitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW as an aside, before the 2003 US invasion, Iraq gave the UN a CD-ROM full of documentation about their WMD programs to try to convince the world that they had disarmed. The US took possession of that CD, promising the UN that the US wouldn't alter it. The lying US gov't modified the CD removing US corporations and US gov't involvement in Iraq's '80s-era WMD program.

       It seems rather sloppy to leave evidence behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American people and probably the world was already convinced that there were WMD's.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't NEED to plant anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example is WTC and the Pentagon. In planning the destruction of the building was it anticipated that there later be evidence that thermite was used?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course not because all evidence was supposed to be destroyed in the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the Pentagon? There are reports that surveillance footage was taken by surrounding businesses and is indefinitely classified. All except ONE video from a gas station that shows an explosion and no plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was evidence of thermite in the remains of WTC. Yet the government is sticking to it's original story that the buildings did a free fall because of handful of terrorists and a couple of planes. It's the perfect alibi.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 60's when the towers were being constructed there was an interview with the architect and he stated that the buildings could withstand the impact of a an airplane strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       So were these buildings built to be destroyed or did someone take the creators words and execute them?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is don't leave criminal evidence behind. If you were to plant WMD it would be a little bit harder to cover up.

       So, what you're saying is that there was no need to plant evidence because we were already in there.  Once we were in, it wasn't like having or not having WMD's was going to make any difference.  And if we did plant WMD's, then it was more likely that we'd get caught planting fake evidence which would cause more problems than just not having them at all.

       Here's a crazy idea that will go down like a zeppelin sized lead balloon-
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the Bush gang had really thought that there were WMD's in Iraq?  They might have convinced themselves, through sheer will power and stovepiped falsified evidence, that the WMD's were there.  Further, perhaps they were actually just as surprised as us when none turned up.  Even further, perhaps they weren't the ruthless criminal masterminds that we've made them out to be, but actually just hapless victims of their own desires and ambitions.  Occams razor would suggest that since Bush and Co. did not try and fake WMD's, that they were not actually party to a conspiracy to fake the WMD evidence.  The secondary level of Occam's razor (the conspiracy level) though, would suggest, as has been mentioned here already, that having already gotten what they wanted by invading Iraq, that there was no need to bother with WMD's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure that my initial idea will be eagerly slammed, as this is the tinfoil hat subreddit.

       Are you really so insecure in your position that you have to preemptively accuse people of being biased if they disagree with it?

       You're completely idiotic if you believe Occam's Razor can or even should be applied to every situation. According to Occam's razor, the Gulf of Tonkin incident happened just the way the government said it did. Also, a magic bullet killed Kennedy. And, speaking of Kennedy, all the murders within that family were purely coincidental. Gee whiz, the Kennedys sure do have bad luck!
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, if you believe that the world's intelligence agencies thought that Saddam had nuclear weapons and were wrong about it, you're absolutely insane at worst - and at best need to pay a lot more attention to the news.

       Simple Answer: Then the war would be over. No weapons of mass destruction in Iraq found = longer war.

       Even if this sounds like an oversimplification at first, I think this could well be one of the core issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war was created to be sustained, not to be completed. As long as it was permitted to go on, there was no need to add conclusive WMDs into the picture since this would have offered some people closure.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might not have ended the war but some people would have said that the US got what they came for and should now return home. They had to shift targets to keep going indefinitely.

       Because it didn't serve the mission objective. IMO it was because the discovery of WMDs would of made it more of a UN issue and they just really wanted to kill Saddam and get them some free oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Also, to play into the conspiracy game. They could of actually found weapons and confiscated them with the intention to use them at a later date under the guise of a middle eastern org.

       Because they were really there, but somehow hidden, destroyed or transported away as the US invaded.

       I remember hearing reports of satellite photos showing the chemical warfare "trucks" on the border of Iraq and Syria, but then the media seemed to loose interest in it and I haven't heard of it since then. Maybe I'll so a quick web search and see if i can find anything on it.

       If there was any real evidence that Iraq had WMDs and shipped them to Syria before the war, the Bush administration would have been all over it. After it became apparent that there were no satellite photos showing trucks entering Syria from Iraq people started claiming that they were shipped with modified passenger planes. Of course, no evidence was ever provided.

       It seems rather sloppy to leave evidence behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American people and probably the world was already convinced that there were WMD's.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't NEED to plant anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example is WTC and the Pentagon. In planning the destruction of the building was it anticipated that there later be evidence that thermite was used?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course not because all evidence was supposed to be destroyed in the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the Pentagon? There are reports that surveillance footage was taken by surrounding businesses and is indefinitely classified. All except ONE video from a gas station that shows an explosion and no plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was evidence of thermite in the remains of WTC. Yet the government is sticking to it's original story that the buildings did a free fall because of handful of terrorists and a couple of planes. It's the perfect alibi.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 60's when the towers were being constructed there was an interview with the architect and he stated that the buildings could withstand the impact of a an airplane strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       So were these buildings built to be destroyed or did someone take the creators words and execute them?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is don't leave criminal evidence behind. If you were to plant WMD it would be a little bit harder to cover up.
