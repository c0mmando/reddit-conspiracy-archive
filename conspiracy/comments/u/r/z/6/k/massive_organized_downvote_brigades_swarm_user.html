       I think a lot of people are still just very uneasy about the whole subject, and if the "official story" isn't true, well then they have a lot of things to think about that would make them uncomfortable, and a lot of people don't want to go there...plus it's easier to hop on the bandwagon and just bash anyone who dares to go against what the mass media said happened

       Too many Americans are programmed to treat 9/11 Truthers like Holocaust Deniers. Anytime you question history presented by mainstream sources (books, TV, school), you get thrown into that group of 9/11 whack jobs.

       I'm not sure, but the heart of the problem is that people you neither know or trust are subtly affecting your opinion.  This is also known as
       <strong>
        GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT
       </strong>
       , because when you believe things that are untrue, you have a very high chance of doing something stupid.  You didn't know any better, and that was by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is tragic, because people who have the best of intentions end up doing terrible things.  American soldiers don't want to do evil...  But they are...  And I believe that's why the suicide rate is so high.  A life of evil is not worth living so the it's probably the most noble soldiers who are opting out of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This needs to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       People you neither know, nor like, nor trust should have no sway on your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trash must be kept OUT of your mind.

       Yes. I was doing well till a couple of weeks ago then suddenly got hit with these downvote brigades. I can rarely get anything to move more than a few votes. For every upvote I get I get a downvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there may be a cabal. But more and more I suspect the reddit admins. And if they are doing it it is because they are told to do it. We all know about shadow banning but that's easy to detect. But if they have a program to add downvotes to anything someone submits, that would work as well. And that you wouldn't detect except when it breaks the pattern of normal votes and then you'd have no proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I've been here 4 years, have 249k karma, I KNOW how voting runs. And it is getting the first two or three votes that is the hardest. But suddenly I get a downvote for every upvote till I almost always have 0 or 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while there might be the Israeli cabal behind some of it, I think it's a very nasty little country that I've criticized on reddit and that could make me a target, but more and more I think it's reddit. It started when I argued with some mods. They deny its them and it probably isn't, but it did start then.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they are ruining reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They totally ruined
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       till it is just a feeder site for corporate media and corporate media comes precensored. I've read how the CIA had agents in all major US media. I suspect reddit has gotten big enough that British Intelligence has taken over
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       . And someone is doing the same thing to
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       . Almost every submission has a corporate logo next to it now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, they fix it so we can't know so I don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm thinking of trying digg. See how it runs. See if you can move stuff without being part of a cabal.

       Seems like the tsunami of PR money unleashed prior to a national election imparts a sense of invincibility to the conspiracy; but afterward, the horde of liars, and their lies, submerging the truth always wash back out to sea along with it, leaving the truth jutting even more boldly from the sands of time. We've seen it several times since that particular crime was perpetrated, like a machine stuck in repetitive-but-pointless activity. Exposure is something the conspiracy cannot adapt to, so it keeps doing what it has been programmed to do, whether it works or not.

       This is the logic of the fascist. The fact that a tiny group of sick individuals may or may not come from a certain demographic says nothing about that demographic as a whole. Blaming Jewish people for the worlds ills is infantile racism.

       Pretty much. I think Lube is just here to harass decent people. He seems perfectly happy to dance alongside  the fascists from NLW. That speaks volumes about his (lack of) character.

       I don't think that there's any question at all that he's here just to troll. When you look at his comment history it's all he does. It's actually kind of pathetic that he finds his own life so empty and devoid of meaning that the only was he can find gratification is to go on web sites like Reddit and attack pretty much everyone that might disagree with his paranoid opinions and rants.

       LOL son! Who's projecting now? I think you'd find my primary account's comment history to be fairly innocuous. This one, not so much, since I had to separate my normal redditing activities in order to avoid the incessant stalking of Nolibs et.al.

        EDIT:

       Care to expand on what these supposed "paranoid opinions and rants" are? I mean one that isn't clearly a farcical jab at the paultard-tards. I don't recall a single comment or post that I've made that would even come close to fitting that description.

       Nothing there is any worse than what Nolibs et. al. engage in on a regular basis. Attempting to have a conversation with you guys is pointless. You guys aren't interested in conversation. You don't pick your targets to have a conversation with them. You guys troll, period. Any opinion that isn't covered in the flying jizz of your circlejerk is just fodder for your x-posting troll machine. At least I admit that what this account does is pointless trolling. Still waiting on examples of paranoid and ranting.

       I remember when I tried to explain hypocrisy to you but apparently your feeble little mind couldn't see what you and your Ron Paul fanboys have been doing for years now. There is a sub that was organized simply to attack anyone who's opinions is different from their own. That sub is

       and it's populated mainly by scum like yourself. Your pathetic attempts to intimidate or harass me and everyone else who is opposed to putting a racist, doddering old fool in the White House simply exposes you for what you are.

       I think the poor guy has some deep pysological problems, with a sense of humor like that of a 12 year old's. Just yesterday he saw a comment of mine when I was talking about manure for the garden and he just went on about how I've got some "endless supply of bullshit" or whatever. After I told him how sad he was a few NLW sockpuppet accounts came in to agree with Lube about how funny his pathetic jokes were. Honestly it's so pathetic it's somewhat comical since I know that he really is quite a bit older than 12.

       Yes it will. There are plenty of rational people out there that hear and believe facts. If you can actually show something to people, some of them will accept it.

       Misinformation and spouting theories as facts is no better than the worst of Fox, and just drives away the truly intelligent people that could actually help uncover truth.

       You'd be surprised at how often and quickly the supposed rational mind cowers and rebels when it's presented with rational evidence suggesting and showing that the world is VERY,
       <em>
        VERY
       </em>
       different than how we've been brought up to believe it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, rationality is often nothing more than a thinly veiled vestige of emotional security brought upon by years of societal conditioning since childhood (infancy actually).  Oftentime, what one is brought up to believe is true during their formative years they cling to regardless of whether or not they get data possibly contradicting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, of course, does not apply to everything, but one would simply be remiss in thinking that human beings are more rational than they are.  Often, we are little more than a thin veil of faux rationality thinly covering a mountain of charged emotional perspectives.

       Yes.
       <em>

       small percentage.  As much as we'd like to not believe this, I'm sure both you and I would likely have been two of the untold many that believed the world was flat way back in the day.  I'm sure we would have also been in the group crying "Crazy lunatic!" to the first person to propose that it the planet was, in fact, round.

       Oh and no one here is arguing with that - at least not I.  This statement was not even necessary, as it was not even part of my point to allege anything different from this you mention sentiment here.

      <p>
       Well, it depends on who and what you consider "truly intelligent".  You'd be surprised at how many PhDs, doctors, and scientists are just as dogmatic and rigid in their way of looking at things as the next religious bigot.  You might also be surprised at just how much knowledge you can find living between the ears of some people most would consider loony or insane.

      <p>
       Again, this is fair.  I personally fully agree with this and the sentiment.  However, even the theory of critical thinking must be critically analyzed and examined for the faults that might exist within.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are simply so many variables involved regarding certain issues that one would be ill-advised to write almost anyone off as loony or uncritical.  Even in the craziest theories, remnants of the truth might be found that may not be contained anywhere else.

       So.. you really think that we should spread misinformation and exaggerations in hopes of tricking people to believe what you believe?? Or just take issue with anyone believing in others?

       Did you read or understand anything that I said?  Let me try it again:

       I said that it is important to understand that there is validity and truth in a LOT of things that we might not initially think are such.

       I'm personally not speaking with regard to or dealing with r/conspiracy as a whole.  I'm talking about ME.  Even so, however, r/conspiracy has it's finger a LOT closer than almost any other subreddit to the pulse of just how fucked up things are on this planet, so even though there are a few posts that stray a bit left of the field, anyone would be approaching the very apex of uncritical thinking if they disregarded the slew of valid posts simply because some in the group were not sound.

       Don't say "you people" in an alienating and discarding kind of way.  You're part of them, as am I, as is everyone.  "You people" doesn't represent me, because I didn't then nor am I now claiming creationism as being the "only" answer.  I didn't say that then, nor am I saying that now.

       I'm not sure, but the heart of the problem is that people you neither know or trust are subtly affecting your opinion.  This is also known as
       <strong>
        GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT
       </strong>
       , because when you believe things that are untrue, you have a very high chance of doing something stupid.  You didn't know any better, and that was by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is tragic, because people who have the best of intentions end up doing terrible things.  American soldiers don't want to do evil...  But they are...  And I believe that's why the suicide rate is so high.  A life of evil is not worth living so the it's probably the most noble soldiers who are opting out of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This needs to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       People you neither know, nor like, nor trust should have no sway on your opinion.
      </p>

       The trash must be kept OUT of your mind.

       Don't say "you people" in an alienating and discarding kind of way.  You're part of them, as am I, as is everyone.  "You people" doesn't represent me, because I didn't then nor am I now claiming creationism as being the "only" answer.  I didn't say that then, nor am I saying that now.

       That doesn't matter though, because I'm also not saying that they're all wrong either.
