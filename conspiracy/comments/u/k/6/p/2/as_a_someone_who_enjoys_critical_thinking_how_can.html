       I consider myself a fairly rational person, but I'm open to conspiracies. I definitely believe that stuff happened on 9/11 that the US hasn't told us about and there are some shady goings-on with the banks right now. However, I take issue with the belief that the Rothschild group owns half the world and that the government actively works against our best interests. I mean, people aren't actually as dumb as everyone makes them out to be and are very good at spotting bad stuff when it seems reasonable and possible. Like JFK or 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking from an Australian perspective here, we obviously haven't got it so bad right now, and nothing
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       related in any case (as far as I'm aware).

       is full of KGB agents trying to disinform good western people like us who love our western value's of freedom and liberty.

      <p>
       The Governments have shown time and time again that they care  about us. I mean come on dude, We spend so much money on defense the terrorists are so scared it's silly. Yet i come here and see people talking about false flags and what not.
      </p>

       America has enemies, deal with it. Dissidents who misinform the public with 'OMG FEMA CAMPS CABALISTIC GROUP OMGAWAD' are just people who haven't grown a lot and can't grasp the real world we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is a beacon of freedom, we should not question the government, because it has our best interests to protect us from Al-qaida attacks with more security and road blocks. Did you hear about Drones flying over America? That's cool! LIKE CALL OF DUTY !!

       We should ban this subreddit. It only misinforms good patriotic people.

       Did you know that Hitler took a nation that was destroyed by bankers via hyperinflation and brought it back to prosperity?  He did so by kicking out the usurers and issuing a new debt free currency backed not by gold but the labor of the German people.  Germany went from 50% unemployment to 2% unemployment due to Hitler's monetary policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't the kind of thing a psychopath does.  It takes a truly noble man to stand up to the bankers and say NO to economic slavery.  Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You already know the mainstream media lies to you about practically anything that's important like 9/11 or JFK.  Could it be possible that they're also lying to you about Hitler?
      </p>
      <p>
       You might wonder, ...what about the 6,000,000 jews he killed?
      </p>
      <p>
       ...if you would be so kind and humor me, please search for SIX MILLION MYTH.  You might be surprised to find out how many times 6,000,000 jews can die.

       Protip: someone new to conspiracies will probably get offended by all this 'Evil Zionist Rat' business. Not saying there isn't merit in these theories, just we've been brought up to respect others, regardless of what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hitler didn't kill thousands, trigger WWII and burn books he'd probably be considered a good leader, yes. In fact, thats why Fascism works so well. You get a charismatic guy who fixes everything and then things escalate. I know that Fascism isn't taking root in America because you haven't even tried to fix your problems and none of your leaders are charismatic. Which is why I'm suspicious of Ron Paul ;) (kidding).

       You're probably right about newcomers being offended, but there is a flip side I've noticed.  A lot of every day "normal" people aren't particularly fond of the Jewish people.  They might not speak out against them like I do, but let's just say they've rubbed many people the wrong way with their famous "chutzpah".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can get people like this to know that
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pbx87/weekly_discussion_missing_links_the_definitive/">
         9/11 was a Jewish false flag attack
        </a>
       </strong>
       , the game is on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for the reminder, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, it is a bit surreal to me that I am defending Hitler today.  Two years ago, I couldn't have imagined myself doing this.  It's only after finding out that Israel did 9/11 and then doing more research into Jewish crimes...  what a rabbit hole that was...  I have to combat their lies by telling the truth to the best of my ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, thank you for the reminder.

       I've heard this before, and I'm going to have to side with
       <strong>
        <a href="http://zioncrimefactory.com/2012/04/05/the-nazis-gave-rothschild-bankers-the-boot/">
         ZionCrimeFactory
        </a>
       </strong>
       on this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       National Socialist Germany gave the Rothschild's the boot, not only in Germany but in Austria and France as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans talk about merely auditing the Fed, and the braver ones talk about ending the Fed.  National Socialist Germany ended the equivalent of 3 Feds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is why the Jews have demonized Hitler so badly.  They don't want people to know that he took concrete steps toward ending economic slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no usury in Germany when Hitler was in power.  Like a decent human being, he banned that subtle form of slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that something an agent of the Rothschild's would do?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that weren't enough, they put out an
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rothschilds_(film)">
        anti-Rothschild movie
       </a>
       to tell the people about how terrible this banking family was.

       Those evil Jewish boogins.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate your points and contributions to the discussion (hence up votes) but these are just blogs filled with pretty inflammatory anti-Semetic sentiments. I think most people agree to expressing skepticism towards the official explanation, but in Australia, we don't like change and tend to be conservative (NOT Neo-Con so much) when it comes to politicians, and today's Parliament is so close that it pretty much comes down to single issues swaying voters. (referring to the first and second of your links.)

       Just out of curiosity, do you know what the six million myth is?  If not, I would suggest you acquaint yourself with the peculiar fondness the Jewish people have for the number 6,000,000.  You might be surprised how many different times six million jews can be in peril.

       The sad thing is, this subreddit seems full of blatant Holocaust-deniers. It really puts a damper on real conspiracies and discussion.

       There was a time when I thought that anyone who denied the Holocaust must be a terrible person.  I truly believed that.

       , one day, I took the time to look at the other side of the story.  I've been fighting Jewish lies ever since.

       I've taken the time to look at it too, and it's still insane to me. Not insane as in "I can't believe it", but insane as in "I can't believe that people actually consider it". When I read about it, look at interviews, the faux-documentaries, etc, it still seems absurd to me.

       I'm not a religious person, but one of the most powerful experiences I ever had was meeting a Holocaust survivor. I feel there's something about truth, that when you see it you know it. Anything from when your friend's lying to you, or when your Government is. That if you're keen enough, and smart enough, you'll notice where the truth is, and what is isn't. And for me, the truth is that the Nazi party systematically tortured and murdered millions upon millions of people in Concentration camps.

       It also scares away newcomers and makes often well thought-out theories seem ridiculous. I would be suprised if in a few years, all this Jewish hate will be 'lies spread by government disinfo agents to breed hate and distrust against the most powerful non-Christian religion in preparation for the upcoming crusade' or something.

       It does scare away people. Especially because it lacks any real intellectual base. It's like saying the Third Crusade never happened, and it was all Islamist/Christian/ propaganda to further hostilities against Christianity/Islam. It doesn't help that this is certainly the best subreddit for anything conspiracy-oriented, and there aren't other reddits to inhabit.

       My suggestion is to exercise your Google-Fu. If you read something interesting, research the shit out of it. There's a ton of disinfo. Also, a lot of the disinfo has morsels of truth hidden in plain sight, but it's easy to disregard it when it's covered in some of the most ridiculous bullshit known to man.

       I tend to be a fairly informed consumer of media, which is why I dislike some parts of reddit due to it's crippling left wing bias, even if I agree with it. I suppose some theories just seem too unlikely to be true. I know some people would say, 'Ah, thats just what they want you to think!'.

       Yeah, some people are paranoid to the point where I'd suggest doing a reality check, but I have to agree that there's always been secret deals made by wealthy individuals at the expense of those not in the know.

       The best advice I could give is to check every article against articles of foreign medias. You'd be surprised about the bias or blatant propaganda, such as the supposed revolution in Syria.

       So, you believe shady stuff is going on with banks (designed from the ground up by the Rothschild ponzi scheme), but you don't believe that the Rothschilds have any influence over that?
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe the government is covering up stuff about 9/11, but they're not actively working against the public interest?
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe JFK's assassination was suspect, but you take issue with the fact that it might be because he had just recently, via executive order, re-enabled congress to print a competing currency to the Federal Reserve Note?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you like the intrigue, but can't swallow the answers if it means that the money masters own you?

       Good luck with that.

       To be honest, and I know I'll be labled as a sheep with this comment, but I don't think they do own me. I do everything I can to avoid what I see as threats to myself, my friends and country and use credit unions exclusively, vote for Independents or other supporters of small sustainable government and avoid big business wherever possible. Unless you can give any suggestions, its all one man can to, although I do encourage others to follow my example. Without going tinfoil hat mode, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am open to the answers (as is the point of the thread) but I just think some things seem a bit far fetched. I don't think the government is bad, its just the people in the government, and to be fair, your congress is shit right now and there hasn't been a good role model in American politics for years. And I hadn't even heard of the Rothschilds until I became interested in the conspiracy movement, and you'd think a guy with an ego as big as some websites say it is, his face would be on every billboard.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: forgot to mention, my belief was that there was little US government envolvement in JFK, but there was strong Cuban exile influences which put the idea in LHO's head that the president should be killed for the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.

       If your looking for clarity on the world and how our leaders seem to all be leading us a certain way, William Cooper laid it out, in plain english, in his series on the Religion of the Illuminati - Mystery Babylon.  Check my channel for the whole series I have been posting.

       They do not care about the average person.  To them, those who do not use their intelligence are no better than animals who HAVE no intelligence and therefore are "beasts of burden" to be dealt with by those who have the intelligence.

       I highly recommend this series as it shows how many men throughout the ages have given up their freedom and gone through the rights and rituals of initiation into the secret societies to which they pledge alligeance to their fellow Mason/Knight Templar/Assassin (Check out William Cooper's Mystery Babylon episode on The Assassins to hear about how people willingly kill themselves at their master's command!)

       I would suggest to you that critical thinking and having an open mind to conspiracy are not opposite ends of any spectrum. No one demands you believe
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       proposed conspiracies. I personally think the claims by Icke (overlord lizard people) to be outrageous and Alex Jones is nuts. Being a critical thinker is a great tool for anyone trying to decide which conspiracies are true and which are false (remember some crazy shit is put out to "contaminate the well" of the legitimate).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever heard of the term "follow the money"? My personal belief is that if a conspiracy does not involve money and fleecing the masses, it's probably bullshit ... I blog
       <a href="http://inkandpaperguy.wordpress.com/">
        here

      <p>
       Also, you may be giving too much credit to humanity, as a whole. We tend to assume everyone is like us in terms of IQ and morals. So, if you are smart, you will assume most people are too. We tend to affix our morals and standards on others too; for example, did you ever notice guys that are hyper-jealous tend to be cheaters?
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of us are too stupid or too afraid to even consider the issues discussed on this subreddit. If you doubt me, go out and talk to 10 people face to face about the shadow government of the USA. Just sit back and watch the psychological struggle taking place right in front of you.

       Well, as to your claim that rothschilds don't own half the wealth, here's a rational source that shows some small group does control 80% of the wealth.

       I appreciate your points and contributions to the discussion (hence up votes) but these are just blogs filled with pretty inflammatory anti-Semetic sentiments. I think most people agree to expressing skepticism towards the official explanation, but in Australia, we don't like change and tend to be conservative (NOT Neo-Con so much) when it comes to politicians, and today's Parliament is so close that it pretty much comes down to single issues swaying voters. (referring to the first and second of your links.)

       To be honest, and I know I'll be labled as a sheep with this comment, but I don't think they do own me. I do everything I can to avoid what I see as threats to myself, my friends and country and use credit unions exclusively, vote for Independents or other supporters of small sustainable government and avoid big business wherever possible. Unless you can give any suggestions, its all one man can to, although I do encourage others to follow my example. Without going tinfoil hat mode, of course.

       I am open to the answers (as is the point of the thread) but I just think some things seem a bit far fetched. I don't think the government is bad, its just the people in the government, and to be fair, your congress is shit right now and there hasn't been a good role model in American politics for years. And I hadn't even heard of the Rothschilds until I became interested in the conspiracy movement, and you'd think a guy with an ego as big as some websites say it is, his face would be on every billboard.

       EDIT: forgot to mention, my belief was that there was little US government envolvement in JFK, but there was strong Cuban exile influences which put the idea in LHO's head that the president should be killed for the failed Bay of Pigs invasion.
