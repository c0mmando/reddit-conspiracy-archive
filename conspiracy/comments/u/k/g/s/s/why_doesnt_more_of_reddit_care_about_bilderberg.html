However, the bubble in conspiracy wouldn&#39;t be one of people who don&#39;t want to hear alternative stories. I, for one, rarely agree with most of the content on here, I still read it, process it, argue it. Less and less often because apparently by disagreeing with any point anyone makes in this sub just means that you&#39;re a sheep and can&#39;t apply critical thinking to subjects that are very gray.</p>

<p>I understand how that may make you feel, but please understand that not all of us look at karma and up and down votes to determine how truthful something is. Id rather have another opinion that may be viewed by the community as wrong than have only one opinion that has 50k up votes.  Fuck them, let me hear your voice.</p>

The people who have controlled -- absolutely controlled -- the movie industry, the television, the radio, the magazine publishing business, the popular music industry, and major book publishing, for decades, are not going to just roll over and let the free Internet take away their propaganda power. They won&#39;t stand for it. They&#39;ve got all the money and they are going to use it. True, they are not creative, but they can buy the cveativity of others, and they have done so, and will keep on doing so, until their control over the Internet is as near to absolute as they can make it. And they will use the Internet for the same two purposes they have used the other media -- (a) to make money, and (b) to brainwash the general population for the purposes of control.</p>

<p>I have to leave for work, but if you do a search for it, you will find plenty of articles where the government has admitted to manipulating social media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember an article claiming the US wanted HBGary Federal, now ManTech, to create software capable of sockpuppeting on social media networks, so called &quot;persona management&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The-HB-Gary-Email-That-Should-Concern-Us-All">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The-HB-Gary-Email-That-Should-Concern-Us-All</a>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks</a></p>

<p>But there&#39;s nothing to suggest they ever use such software, or even have it. </p>

<p>Lots of groups have astroturfed, everyone from the tobacco industry to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2010/dec/13/astroturf-libertarians-internet-democracy?showallcomments=true#comment-fold">right-wing libertarians</a> are guilty of it, but for all the &quot;US gov&#39;t shilling on Reddit&quot; claims I hear, I&#39;ve never seen a shred of evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of that tin foil hat shit is posted by the government in an effort to make all conspiracy theorists look like nuts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that in itself is a tinfoil hat claim. Do you have any evidence of this? This claim is repeated here often, but again I see no evidence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then people like you lump people like me into the same category of nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assess people individually. Usually on the basis of their claims and the evidence (or lack thereof).</p>

Type anything into that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationLog/search?q=obama&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=new">search bar</a>, and you get a load of stuff, and as sje46 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ukgss/why_doesnt_more_of_reddit_care_about_bilderberg/c4wgycs">says below</a>, there&#39;s plenty on reddit about Bilderberg.</p>

<p>The real reason is that we don&#39;t know what goes on, so what to discuss? We could endlessly speculate that they are planning on taking over the world because we got no reason not to think that, right? It&#39;s speculation like that that gets this community it&#39;s reputation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s far more likely it is exactly what they say, a business meeting for the most powerful people in the world. These occur everyday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what was the point of your original post? That all those results were removed due to creeping bias and ego battles?</p>

<p>Why not <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=bilderberg&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">link to this</a> as well, so people don&#39;t think you are suggesting a reddit conspiracy?</p>

<p>Why not show both sides of the coin, and state that the removed posts you linked to were removed due to reasons not relating to Bilderderg?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how your OP is relevant. The questions is &#39;why doesn&#39;t reddit care about Bilderberg&#39;, and you link to 16 submissions that have been removed in an attempt to show bias, while ignoring the fact there are many more Bilderberg related links in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> alone.</p>

<p>They have already achieved their goal...Obama is president yay!! That simple fact has made wiretapping and torture good now!...no work needs to be done and they certainly wouldn&#39;t want to work with a lowly conspiracy theorist paultard. The Bilderberg group does not exist and journalist should focus on Justin Beiber even if all the most powerful people in the world are meeting in Chantilly. Investigative journalism is for troublemakers if we have a black president.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones gets a lot of stuff out there that is good. He is a hard worker that has done a ton of research.</p>

<p>But he&#39;s a manic depressive with borderline schizophrenia. Hence why he goes from crying for the dead babies, to destroy the Elites, to drink whole milk, to we&#39;re loosing the war/we&#39;re winning the war in 5 seconds flat.  Also the fame has made him narcissistic.  Have you noticed that he can&#39;t let a guest get two sentences out without Alex interrupting and pushing for his own view?  Have you notice that he jumps from conspiracy to conspiracy to maintain his self image as the &#39;leader of the resistance&#39;?</p>

<p>He does a lot of good but he is unstable.  I also think the Bilderberg-like groups are using him.  I believe they are feeding him a lot of stories to distract him from the real issues.  I wouldn&#39;t doubt if his long rambling videos are getting &#39;donations&#39; from Bilderberg front groups to keep the truth shrouded by the &#39;tin foil hats&#39; groups.</p>

<p>Shit, half of reddit&#39;s traffic is practically to TIL/askreddit and most of THAT traffic links straight to wikipedia. Look up the rothschilds on wikipedia and they&#39;re hardly even billionaires....</p>

<p>The Bilderberg Group, Bilderberg conference, or Bilderberg Club is an annual, unofficial, invitation-only conference of approximately 120 to 140 guests from North America and Western Europe, most of whom are people of influence.[1][2] About one-third are from government and politics, and two-thirds from finance, industry, labour, education and communications. Meetings are closed to the public. [...] when Bilderberg participants reach a form of consensus about what is to be done, they have at their disposal powerful transnational and national instruments for bringing about what it is they want to come to pass.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group">wikipedia</a></sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>^ This. Everything about what happens in the meetings is purely speculative. They might be preparing for our alien overlords to arrive at the end of 2012. They might be coordinating charitable activities. As far as I&#39;m aware the media hasn&#39;t even seen an <em>agenda</em> from one of these gatherings much less a discussion of what goes on at them.</p>

<p>My suspicion is that they&#39;re wheeling and dealing in small groups for personal gain and that they aren&#39;t coordinating anything as a whole organization. That&#39;s capitalism for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because you nut jobs tried to link global warming, to this group.  A clear example of Oil Propaganda.  Then you went on about population extinction by this group, with no proof.  Then you go on and on about &quot;the jews&quot; as if &quot;the jews&quot; all jews, have a secret plot to take over the world.</p>

<p>Had you stuck to something provable and believable you might have had something.  </p>

<p>Only a fool today doubts global warming is real and is man made.  No group proposes mass extinction of most of the human population to fix over population.  And you haven&#39;t proven a &quot;jewish&quot; conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda.  </p>

<p>Being labeled or associated with &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is an extremely damning ad hominem.  </p>

<p>If you were so inclined, you can shut down any conversation you did not care to have by labeling someone a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;.  Try it some time if you do not believe me.  Find some forum post advocating for Ron Paul or something and say the word &quot;conspiracy&quot;.  It is akin to wiping shit all over the person&#39;s face.  A huge number of people who might be reading ( who do not have their minds made up ) will stop reading.  </p>

<p>There are some ridiculous conspiracies out there, and they are associated just as easily with things like &quot;bilderberg&quot; or the fed, etc. Even the &quot;military industrial complex&quot; is sort of immune.  You bring it up, you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist.  All intellectual conversations deteriorate.  </p>

Many of us already know there&#39;s not a lot we can do about them and their machinations on a day-to-day basis (jobs, family, all of that), and they&#39;re so entrenched in the the various interactions of media, banking, food production and the like that to thwart their attempts to control societies-at-large would be almost futile.

<p>Why Bilderberg?  Why not demand an inside understanding of one of the many wonderful buildings in Washington DC?  Why isn&#39;t Alex Jones extremely upset about the meetings that happen in the Oval Office, those at NSA, or Downing Street for that matter?</p>

<p>Alex Jones, in focusing on Bilderberg, evokes demons in the negative space of the meeting&#39;s mystery.  He wants to say I broke the news, I know something either you don&#39;t know or don&#39;t want to accept, I am an especially heroic and intelligent part of this society.</p>

<p>To have a good peak at the Eric Cartman-like nature that is Alex Jones-- the satisfaction he gets from feeling exceptional, his working to eliminate threats to his ego and the authority he has as the leader of his radioshow cult-- check out his interview of Noam Chomsky.  Chomsky just tells him what he knows about English law, and Jones with a split tongue thanks him for being on the show, to tell his audience about his books, and upon his hanging up, says:</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m more certain than ever that [Noam Chomsky] is a New World Order shill.&quot;</p>

<p>pt 4: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwjK07gEpCM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwjK07gEpCM</a></p>

<p>pt 5: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0APTn1EPg9E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0APTn1EPg9E</a></p>

<p>Alex Jones says some legit stuff, but Bilderberg just isn&#39;t one of them.   And his treatment of someone he knew outclassed him intellectually is telling.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Bilderbers are ok. 
It is good that politicians and policymakers get a one change to speak off-the-press, be direct with each another and say what they really think. Alas, because of how things are, that kinda of speeches have to be hushed out of sight.  Some things are need-to-know for a reasons, and the speeches in Bildergerger meetings are that for good reasons. (Say, for example, as a prime minister of EU-country, if you publicly state that you don&#39;t think Euro is going to work out for long and your country is making preparations for departuring it. it would be scandal in the press, break the united face of EU, mess up businesses and cause turmoil in domestic politic discussions, etc... So it is good that there is an unofficial channel where this kind of straight-talk can be had)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy that NWO-conspiracy-kid-eating-mumbojumbo. Sure, there might be agenda to unite the world beyond the UN, but mainly, it is a off-the-record for networking and checking up what is going on outside stylized press-releases. Some of the participants are members of different lodges and societies there, but an-sich, Bilderberg isn&#39;t meeting arranged for and by them.</p>

<p>On previous years, the leaked referates of the keynotes and discussions have been really revealing about how real-world politic their topics are, and the predictions made in them usually keep well. </p>

<p>I kinda dislike how everyone projects their most-NWO-conspiracy-whackjob fears to this meeting. The real thing happening there, the real-world policies discussed in the meetings are of most interest, and this paranoid hate-fear-mongering towards the evevent just distracts and widens the gap between attendees and participants even further.</p>

<p>//disclaimer - Naive finn, I kinda trust that most of our politicians are good-willing, somewhat honest and uncorrupted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually very familiar with them, and reddit is definitely one, because you can subscribe and unsubscribe from any group that doesn&#39;t agree with you. However, the bubble in conspiracy wouldn&#39;t be one of people who don&#39;t want to hear alternative stories. I, for one, rarely agree with most of the content on here, I still read it, process it, argue it. Less and less often because apparently by disagreeing with any point anyone makes in this sub just means that you&#39;re a sheep and can&#39;t apply critical thinking to subjects that are very gray.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really like this sub, but top comments like this are stupid. Type anything into that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationLog/search?q=obama&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=new">search bar</a>, and you get a load of stuff, and as sje46 <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ukgss/why_doesnt_more_of_reddit_care_about_bilderberg/c4wgycs">says below</a>, there&#39;s plenty on reddit about Bilderberg.</p>

<p>The real reason is that we don&#39;t know what goes on, so what to discuss? We could endlessly speculate that they are planning on taking over the world because we got no reason not to think that, right? It&#39;s speculation like that that gets this community it&#39;s reputation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s far more likely it is exactly what they say, a business meeting for the most powerful people in the world. These occur everyday. </p>

<p>I agree it&#39;s interesting, but to suggest there is a reddit conspiracy to suppress it is so stereotypical, and doesn&#39;t even stand up.</p>

<p>No wonder you&#39;re banned from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> with comments like this.</p>
