       It is my opinion that he operates a form of controlled opposition for TPTB. The reason why he is such a maniac about "privacy and security" for Wikileaks is so that anything that enters the honeypot may not leave without specific authorization

       im almost finished reading his "unauthorised" autobiography and i must say that it made me admire the man even more now than before. he sacrificed so much of himself. i think he is fair dinkum. he actually inspired me to vote &amp; learn more about politics. i wish i could do more for him, as i do not see things going well for him. he put his everything where his mouth is and he got shafted by so many people that he "trusted". in my opinion he is the dalai lama of political transparency.

       I definitely feel the world needs some one like him, but at the same time I am not convinced that he is sometimes in it for the right reasons and not fame or money.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is something to be said about publicly making your face known and standing firmly behind what you say. it lends a lot of credit to what you put out there. At the same time remaining hidden and anonymous alleviates any suspicion that profit is your ultimate motive.

       I didn't watch the youtube video in the above comment but my thoughts are this;
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like the guy one bit. He has changed his views a lot over the years and really has made me be completely on the fence about whether or not what he's doing is still right in his own mind. He creeps me out, he's wildly arrogant, and I'm not sure he even knows what his true views that he stands for are.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said..
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian Assange is brilliant. And I'm not talking Barrett Brown who has an impressive vocabulary, I'm talking quite possibly one of the most impressive minds we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange took hacking to another level, it wasn't brought out until later years, but the guy was amazing. Not even that, but his etiquette about it was just..marvelous.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was basically the robber who didn't carry a gun or a weapon, just snuck in and out, didn't break anything, cleaned your house and took the thing he was looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       We learned a lot about Assange in University, and the guy is simply brilliant. But that doesn't mean that I like him.

       Not necessarily. If 4 accounts are saying "I don't trust Julian Assange" in this post, then upvoting themselves with fake accounts, it gives the impression that there are many people that don't trust him. Then, subconsciously readers will follow the mob without any reason whatsoever. Most people are idiots with no critical thinking skills that will use an aggregate of comments to form an "informed" opinion on a topic because they subconsciously trust that others did research to form their own opinion.

       I agree a well-constructed response can help, but just look at how many people on
       <a href="/r/Politics">
        /r/Politics
       </a>
       like Obama. (I'm not saying he has fake posters, I'm saying people are just dumb and will disregard a thought out response to prevent the discomfort of being wrong) The internet is a very good positive feedback loop, and has difficulty actually changing peoples minds because you can always find someone to agree with you and tell you that you are right.

       Julian Assange is regarded as a champion of transparency and freedom yet he has a show on russia today news, the Russian governments propaganda mouthpiece! Can no one else see the blatant hypocrisy here? Assange can be considered a Russian agent now in my book, fuck rt and fuck Julian Assange.

       When the American media is just as biased as the Russian media, you watch both and try to find the truth.

       Thats a very good point actually I dont watch either I rely on the irish media. Do you think Julian Assange would publish leaks about Russia or keep His bosses in the Kremlin happy?

       No, but thats what the American media is good at showing. If you watch, and acknowledge the bias, they can be good sources of information. You just have to read between the lines.
