    <div class="md"><p>Never forget that the people around you are much more like you than you have ever imagined.</p>

<p>Talk to people, even if you don&#39;t know them.  You will find that people like it when someone who is sincere and non-threatening talks to them.</p>

<p>I was at Costco recently and was sitting in the area with tables for eating things and there was a woman there in her late 80&#39;s, sitting there by herself eating one of those incredible $1.50 ice cream bars.  Well, those things are worth $10.  You can&#39;t buy one anywhere else that I even know of.  So I asked her if it was a good deal.  Well, yes, it is, she said.  Within 5 minutes she had disclosed to me that not only did she visit Costco every month to enjoy one of those but that she was the widow of a General in the US Army and had lived in about 8 different countries over the past 60 years.  She had an incredible pension, children &amp; grandchildren all over the place, and until recently spent 2 months of every year going anywhere in the world she damn well wanted to visit.  I could have sat there and listened to her until sunrise the next day.  I may never see her again but she very much enjoyed telling me just a few highlights of her life, sharing them with me.</p>

<p>I am 63 and have quite an interesting life myself, but I didn&#39;t even try to interrupt her in our &#39;discussion&#39;.  I want you to know this - if you talk to people, especially people you don&#39;t know - once in a while you will be very pleasantly surprised what they will share with you.  A side of life you never imagine existing awaits you, and you will be the better for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is presumptuous to assume TPTB will put you on a list and do something sinister to you for thinking outside the box.</p>

<p>There is a growing minority of us who have studied a million conspiracy theories, know something is up, but also know enough to know what happens to those who try to fight it. We are here to study, and to spread information to those who are open to listen, but nothing more.  </p>

<p>To play devil&#39;s advocate a bit, perhaps it is the &quot;sheeple&quot; who will be culled first in some sort of event; after all, perhaps there is much less use for the ignorant plebs in a more utopian society, and the &quot;elites&quot; wouldn&#39;t mind keeping around a subset of &quot;awake&quot; people; as long as they don&#39;t act out in ignorant, fear based ways.  </p>

<p>This is as much a psychological battle as it is anything else, as a matter a fact for 99% of us armchair conspiracy theory researchers, the closest we will have to get to the &quot;Illuminati&quot; is the specter of paranoia we have to fight in our own minds.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m merely offering a different outlook to liberate oneself of paranoia; perhaps you are not interested, that is fine.  Some people really identify with the struggle, the battle, and I respect that.  We need people like that too.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realized a long time ago was that to defeat all the MSM BS was to flood the internet with (what ever you decide) was the truth. Join the chorus of voices. So I started a web pages back in the nineties just linking to articles I believed needed to be seen.
I never really got a lot of traffic, but if any of my relatives or old friends look me up ,now they have thousands of links I post everyday.</p>

<p>Now I have all these links and when I am in a thread  I sometimes,lol, remember posting something relevant to the issue being discussed and it&#39;s easier for me to find the link.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example,  I was reading about <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/05/23/groups-concerned-over-arming-of-domestic-drones/" title="Groups Concerned Over Arming Of Domestic Drones">Groups Concerned Over Arming Of Domestic Drones</a></p>

<p>and I found a link from back in 2008, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2008/10/packs-of-robots-will-hunt-down.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&amp;amp;amp;nsref=specrt10_head_Pack%20hunting%20robots" title="Packs of robots will hunt down uncooperative humans">Packs of robots will hunt down uncooperative humans</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s scary all this happening,, <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-08/news/31036604_1_drones-unmanned-aircraft-new-bill" title="FAA: Look For 30,000 Drones To Fill American Skies By The End Of The Decade">FAA: Look For 30,000 Drones To Fill American Skies By The End Of The Decade</a></p>

<p>Just think what all this means. There will be no protests in the future. We are all going to be locked down. And if they start chipping us, these drones will be able to do selective assassinations.</p>

<p>We are fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not wrong that you will be targeted if you express forbidden ideas on the Internet.</p>

<p>About the most dangerous thing you can do is criticize Jews in any way -- they&#39;ve got whole organizations devoted to harassing and villifying anyone of any pominence who writes or says anything that deviates from the propaganda line they&#39;ve been brainwashing us all with for decades. The people in these organizations are nasty dudes who have no pity, and they will destroy your life, as an example to others ... merely for expressing an idea that they disagree with.</p>

<p>There are other areas of discussion that you are forbidden to talk about in a free and open manner. You know what they are. We all do. It&#39;s called self-censorship, and we impose it upon ourselves to avoid being targeted by the self-appointed champions of political correctness, or as I prefer to call it, social correctness. No one wants to be publicly labeled, because they know that even if the labels are completely wrong, they will stick.</p>

<p>The sad thing is that so many people go along with this practice. Maybe they are just too stupid to realize what is happening. Or maybe they hope they themselves won&#39;t be accused of witchcraft if they point their fingers at others and scream &quot;witch.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
Fear is such a weak emotion thats why I despise it
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
So scared of what you think of me, I’m scared of even telling you
Sometimes I’m like the only person I feel safe to tell it to
I’m locked inside a cell in me, I know that there’s a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
My screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having any views outside of the majority flock will yield one the blow back of social retribution. I have given up on trying to pass on knowledge to friends and family through Facebook, face to face conversations, etc. I moved from urban Canada and now live in Canada&#39;s bible belt ... where entire communities are saturated with the indoctrinated and the tithers. The closed minded and the willfully ignorant dominate.    </p>

<p>I keep a <a href="http://inkandpaperguy.wordpress.com/">blog</a> to document the struggle, primarily for the sake of my children. I am the proud parent of two young people who utilise logic, common sense, have a sense of integrity and can quickly detect the scent of bullshit when it is being served up to them. As I age, I treasure the real connections I make, in person and online. I surround myself with people who are smart enough to see the trends. I trust the trustworthy. </p>

<p>I never forget that the world is turning into a dystopia ... transparency and the truth is the only cure. </p>
