People are always saying the big businesses own everything. Voting is rigged, we have no voice. When in fact we have the biggest voice and we are major game changers in the world. It is about spreading the message of the power we have. That power comes from our money.
If we all stopped giving the big companies our cash it would at least give them a shock. Can you imagine if we all stopped buying coke, they would soon sit up and panic. 
With essential product like oil at least try and find an independent garage. The less money we put into the &#39;system&#39; the less power they have. Right?</p>

<p>You sir, don&#39;t recognize that we as a people live in a transparent democratic government for the people by the people.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no cabal that wants to rule the world. This is very silly. Do you watch cartoon network or something? I remember those 2 rats who plot world domination. Every time someone brings up the &#39;elite&#39; in a discussion, i remember that funny cartoon show. Good times.</p>

<p>It&#39;s alright guys. You&#39;re living in a state of paranoia. It&#39;s a phase everyone goes through.</p>

<p>I suggest buying medication from big corporations who care for our well being. </p>

<p>Zoloft might be your first choice my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it really so unbelievable that a few friends might get together and form a plan? And if those friends are very wealthy and powerful, that it might affect us regular people. World domination, maybe, but I am not 100% sure. However I know that me and some friends of mine have conspired before, for camping trips and vacations, etc. people do this all the time, and it usually does not have a major effect on many others. In my humble opinion, it doesn&#39;t seem that out of the ordinary that someone with a lot of money and power would use that money and/or power to help someone else with a lot of money and power. As a matter of fact it happens all the time. It&#39;s called politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if this could work you would also have to look at who owns coke and who else do they own. I read a story about a few companies using aborted fetal tissue to test flavor enhancers or something like that. Some of my friends were discussing a boycott of these companies. Anyway Nestle was one of the companies on this list. I know good and well the vast majority of what you buy in a grocery store is Nestle. So they would pretty much have to shop at organic store and/or live on a farm. </p>

<p>These are all nobel ideas, but realistically it&#39;s like trying to dent iron with pebbles. I don&#39;t want to say we have to lay down and take it, but outside of something coming to light or civil war, we&#39;re kind of along for the ride like it or not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying... and if you reverse the trickle down effect you&#39;re going to realize that those middle isles in the grocery store are mostly owned by the same parent companies.  So unless people are willing to perimeter shop with reserve... nicking a chunk out of one of the subsidiary groups by boycotting specific products probably isn&#39;t a bad idea.  To a company, a loss is a loss and if you&#39;re boycotting to result in a loss that would do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;ve been hearing &quot;we&#39;re on the edge of something massive&quot; - obviously not in your exact words - nearly my entire life.</p>

<p>I like Lawrence O&#39;Donnell&#39;s take on it;</p>

<p>&quot;The bigger and scarier you think something is, likely the smaller and less frightening it actually is.&quot;</p>

<p>edit;</p>

<p>Not discrediting you for your opinion or anything. I think we&#39;re due for something, but not for another decade and a half~ish in terms of something gigantic. I&#39;ve just been hearing the same &quot;It&#39;s about to get real&quot; quotes since I can remember.</p>

<p>We&#39;re likely on the same side of this, just have different predictions, so please don&#39;t take this as a huge argumentative tactic.</p>
