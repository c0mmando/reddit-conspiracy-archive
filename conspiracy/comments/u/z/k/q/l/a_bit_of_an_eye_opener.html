       I'm not the first to say this but when i heard it on Joe Rogan (not sure who said but it maybe Shane Smith) it made me feel powerful in this world again.
People are always saying the big businesses own everything. Voting is rigged, we have no voice. When in fact we have the biggest voice and we are major game changers in the world. It is about spreading the message of the power we have. That power comes from our money.
If we all stopped giving the big companies our cash it would at least give them a shock. Can you imagine if we all stopped buying coke, they would soon sit up and panic. 
With essential product like oil at least try and find an independent garage. The less money we put into the 'system' the less power they have. Right?

       There's no cabal that wants to rule the world. This is very silly. Do you watch cartoon network or something? I remember those 2 rats who plot world domination. Every time someone brings up the 'elite' in a discussion, i remember that funny cartoon show. Good times.

       Is it really so unbelievable that a few friends might get together and form a plan? And if those friends are very wealthy and powerful, that it might affect us regular people. World domination, maybe, but I am not 100% sure. However I know that me and some friends of mine have conspired before, for camping trips and vacations, etc. people do this all the time, and it usually does not have a major effect on many others. In my humble opinion, it doesn't seem that out of the ordinary that someone with a lot of money and power would use that money and/or power to help someone else with a lot of money and power. As a matter of fact it happens all the time. It's called politics.

       Besides missing ops point is that one thing you're not considering is the mindsets of people that are able to amass such wealth and power being very different from most people.  For one they are generally a lot more selfish and demanding of control.  A group of people with those trates do not make for a good secret ruling group since they will spend too much time fighting each other for power within it.

       Even if this could work you would also have to look at who owns coke and who else do they own. I read a story about a few companies using aborted fetal tissue to test flavor enhancers or something like that. Some of my friends were discussing a boycott of these companies. Anyway Nestle was one of the companies on this list. I know good and well the vast majority of what you buy in a grocery store is Nestle. So they would pretty much have to shop at organic store and/or live on a farm.

       These are all nobel ideas, but realistically it's like trying to dent iron with pebbles. I don't want to say we have to lay down and take it, but outside of something coming to light or civil war, we're kind of along for the ride like it or not

       It would, but if you boycott coke and still buy poweraid or aquafina then coke as a company is still getting money

       I understand what you're saying... and if you reverse the trickle down effect you're going to realize that those middle isles in the grocery store are mostly owned by the same parent companies.  So unless people are willing to perimeter shop with reserve... nicking a chunk out of one of the subsidiary groups by boycotting specific products probably isn't a bad idea.  To a company, a loss is a loss and if you're boycotting to result in a loss that would do it.

       Not to mention that banks are also large corporate entities, who have more power and money than most other businesses in the world. Nobody is gonna take out all their cash and store it in a safe at home. Should everyone just pull out all their stocks and forget about investments? Society has made us to be reliant on the system.

       I am lucky enough to still get a paper paycheck so I have no bank account any more. All I do is cash it at the bank the check is drawn on. I quit dealing with banks as much as I could several years ago.

       He's absolutely right. The greatest conspiracy of all is learned helplessness (perhaps you wallow in it?). The government doesn't give us our rights, we give the government it's rights. With unity we can not be stopped, and that's why it is so important to divide us on a million different issues...

       Good luck reprogramming the minds of the general public, you go and tell them to stop buying coke because they pay some country for weapons (not meant literally). Yes, we the people could stop them but so many people are so ignorant to the idea of the corruption in their government they wouldn't do anything.

       I have to agree. The idea that somehow we are going to battle years of brainwashing and the power of the corporate media makes it all feel kind of futile.

       It's not about money anymore. TPTB is global now and don't need anything like numbers on its bank accounts.

      <p>
       10 years ago, the mass could have overthrown the government and take back the power, but with new technologies, they don't need us anymore. There are all kind of machines to grow food, a lot of new weapons we could not even imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think power is determined by some number on a bank account ? Nowadays, power is determined by access to technology. All the money in the world can't buy your liberty.

       So there is no hope, should we just roll over and die now then?
There has to be a solution, its pointless knowing all this and then knowing we have no power, no way to succeed, then whats the point?
      </p>
      <p>
       We vastly out number the elite so we must be able to claim back our world. So what if they have the technology? You still need operators to operate and control all this tech. Not all things are self automated yet, and tech is far from fault free and perfect.  It still needs humans to oversee the deployment of tech.

       See that's where I refuse to believe. There will, at some point, occur an event or series of events that create a tipping point of anger and frustration that will at the very least push back the efforts to control the general populace. It won't be a full-scale revolution, but there will be a bit of a balancing out.

       Not discrediting you for your opinion or anything. I think we're due for something, but not for another decade and a half~ish in terms of something gigantic. I've just been hearing the same "It's about to get real" quotes since I can remember.

       We're likely on the same side of this, just have different predictions, so please don't take this as a huge argumentative tactic.
