       TZM has nothing to do with Freemasons, its videos and posts like this that give a bad image to a completely positive social movement.

       While TZM provides sources this fellow well.... His video cuts off a 4 mins mid speech and has no sources...
I would love to hear what parts of the tzm films you seem to disagree with so much that you discredit the whole movement. You are sorely mistake if you think PJ makes a net profit from tzm btw.

       The video was referring to the OP saying tzm and free masons are somehow in cahoots. I said I'd love to hear what parts of the tzm films you seem to disagree with. Its clear you just don't have anything to offer. You said PJ scams people, what do people usually get scammed for? I am not mad just curious, do you really have nothing to offer?

       I guess its easy to just say "I'm not going to talk to you" rather than back up your claims.

       There's no reason for me to speak because you're ignorant. I have no interest in talking to people who put words in my mouth and speak for me. You can take that how ever you want, but it's clear that you have no interest in actually having a discussion with me once you speak on my behalf.

        I said it was in reference to the OP, can you move past that?

       Its ironic calling me ignorant and saying I don't want to have a discussion when I asked you to back up a claim and you won't. You say I speak for you when you are the one telling me "I'm mad" you do see the irony in this also? All you have to do is back up your claims, instead you just try and dismiss me because you really have nothing to offer?

       You didn't ask me anything, re-read your post 100 times and see what question you asked me. I expect an apology from you when you realize that you didn't actually ask me anything in your first post, you told me a whole bunch of things you thought I'd say, and you said you'd like to hear my take on it, that's not a question.

       So you want me to tell you everything that I disagree with in 10+ hours of film, so you can dissect it and argue with me? I've done that enough times, I'm sorry. You win, you're right, you're the best.

       Just saying, I got to 8 hours of real time from this discussion before it branched out too much and I couldn't be bothered to follow it. How come you were willing to debate your right to say nothing this hard, if everything you are doing is in the name of you not wanting to put the effort into discussing the film?

       I said I didn't have time to talk about Zeitgeist, it's pretty easy to reply to someone who is constantly replying when you've got all the time in the world :P
      </p>
      <p>
       With dual monitors I can easily continue what I'm doing, and reply when I'm replied to. If I go to answer all of the things I find incorrect about TZM and Peter Joseph's comments, I'm going to need a lot of time, a lot of sourcing, and will likely cap out the amount of text you're even allowed to fit in a box multiple times.

       Just because I had an inkling you wouldn't provide anything, doesn't mean my mind was set, you made such a large claim that I thought you would have some evidence at hand... You had/have the opportunity to provide some insight but, you fail to do so, I didn't ask for a 10 hour reply just something, rather than nothing.

       I don't save every thought I have on a notepad on my computer. I have had dozens of conversations about PJ before, and they take an infinite amount of time, and both parties end the discussion without much difference.

       I don't consider you unique, and you didn't really make me feel like conversing. I would need hours to conjure a reply, despite everything I need to say, I would need to source it, type everything, find the sources among my bookmarks, and then chain reply to you as you argue with me. Really not interested, which is why I chose a one-liner and said I didn't want to talk to you, after how you originally replied to me.

       Hours to conjure a reply? You could say I read blah blah that he did blah blah. If you know enough to make a claim that PJ/TZM is a scam you should have something to provide without having to go back to your bookmarks. You claim he is a scam and thus TZM is a scam but you can't provide one reason off the top of your head? You do realize how this completely discredits you? I could say the world is flat and that I don't have hours to conjure a reply, that doesn't give much weight to my claim/opinion. If I had hours of research proving that the world was flat I would at least have a one liner that I could pick from my brain.

       That isn't saying, "I'd love to hear a one-liner about what you think is bullshit" you wanted me to explain everything I found through TZM to be bullshit, and that would take a long time.

       You need to read what you're saying before you start saying something else. You say one thing, and then in your next paragraph say you were saying another.. I feel like you're fucking with me, or at the very least inadvertently trolling.

       There's no dodge, you're just an idiot. You over and over claim something you didn't actually say, and then say I avoid it. Then when I tell you that it would take me hours to actually formulate a reply that you require, you tell me I have nothing to offer because I say you aren't worth the time.
      </p>

       Thanks for proving why you aren't worth my time with all your responses, I would gain nothing by typing all of what I have to say to you, read all the shit you've said and what I said.

       This is incorrect. Maybe you backtracked and started saying that later, but that's not what you initially asked for.

       Someone more paranoid would call you a shill but, I just exposed you as a complete moron who thinks referencing to past or present tense changes the fact that you are being asked a simple question that you cannot answer. Your pathetic line of thinking causes you to care more about your image in retrospective to the group than you do about a greater truth. There is really no easier way for me to explain how pointless it is for you to project your ignorance onto others.

       You're an idiot, and this statement proves it a million times over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say one thing, and then you go back and say you said a different thing, and then a different, and then a different.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but you're a dolt, and you're the epitome of why people hate theorists. I don't want to deal with you, so thus I'm wrong, and clearly running away. Never once do you think, hey, maybe it's just you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had numerous lengthy conversations with people on Reddit, and in real life. I don't converse with people that have no interest in an actual conversation, you proved that. If you don't see it, read your posts and then what you "claim" you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please let it go, I have no interest in having an in depth conversation with someone who acts like you do when told that I don't want to discuss it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't give a flying fuck about my image, or I wouldn't post here with what I do. You would know that if you knew me from this sub, I don't really care what people think about what I have to say. What I do care about, is an imbecile wasting my time because you think that since you finally asked me a question, that claiming you did the first five replies didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were going to misconstrue such easy things to understand (like, for example, things that you said and you could have easily read) then why would I have a discussion with you about something you vehemently agree with?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you're not chain asking me, doesn't mean you were before, and since you claimed that you were even though I pointed out that it was painstakingly obvious that you didn't, that led me to believe that any conversation with you would erupt into something like we're having now. Where I tell you I'm not interested, and then you sit there trying to instigate me into giving you a reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know people like you, and I have no interest in giving them any bit of my full attention. You can have my replies in between things I'm doing, but I'm not going to give you a full length, legitimate response about something I think, when you can't even give me an ounce of respect and shown that you couldn't from your first replies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't emphasize enough, just because you antagonize me, it doesn't mean I'm going to reply to you. I can tell you why a million times, and I know it really upsets you, but I apologize. If you want to approach me at another time, and not be so immature and lie about what you were actually saying, then I can have this conversation another day. But I don't feel as if though you're looking for a constructive discussion, and your replies have only strengthened that belief for me.

       I'm glad you admit you don't care that you project your ignorance onto others. How do you even operate in day to day life? You just spent all that time to type a whole paragraph when all you had to say was, "I don't actually have anything to back up my claims" You spent more time and energy making up a bunch of bullshit reasons why you can't give
       <strong>
        ONE REASON
       </strong>
       as to why PJ/TZM is a scam? Literally a whole fucking paragraph not one reason. I don't know if I should laugh or cry for humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for respect? You didn't respect TZM/PJ, literally you discredited over 400,000 people, you won't give them enough respect to give one fucking reason as to why they should be discredited? You have to earn respect. Its sad how easy people can discard something no matter how large if it doesn't agree with their current world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a clashing of world views, you refuse acknowledge anything that changes yours while I am prepared at any time for all my perceived nothings to be flipped upside down. I find it rather exciting, you however, find it terrifying.

       This is not what hypocritical means either. I don't care if you're open to being refuted, you will react by replying to me. I'm not saying how you will react, I'm saying you will reply.

       I'm replying to you on a second screen while doing work.

       I love how long this has gone on, its the longest, "I don't know anything but, I'm too arrogant to admit it" replies in history. You are a pristine gem of ignorance! Don't think people calling out your bullshit claims is ever going to go away. How can you even expect people to take you seriously if you just spew shit out of your mouth and hope people don't call you out? Then when you do get called out you say they are not worth your time. Good to know you are not involved in a field of science. I wish I could go into work and make a claim that we should all get bonuses because the EPA is a scam, but people would ask why I think epa is a scam. If I told them I'm not willing to have a discussion on the matter then no one would believe a single fucking thing. This is exactly how you operate, you can't do this in the real world so you spew your opinions here on reddit as if they were fact assuming no one will call you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are fucking tool for someone the way you spew ignorant statements that discredit whole lines of thinking and hundreds of thousands of people along with it. You do this all through projected ignorance, don't spew shit that you can't prove to be true as if you know it to be true.

       idgaf if I get called out, I get called out every day when I post. I rarely get called out by immature dolts who put words in my mouth and then wonder why I have no interest in talking with them. I get proved wrong about shit every single day, I just don't like to talk to people like you. I've made this so unbelievably clear that my dead grandmother would still be able to recognize it, right now, from her grave.

       Pay close attention inbred, as I'm only going to say this one more time.

      <p>
       I don't want to have a conversation WITH YOU. I don't give a flying fuck about discussing this with someone who actually wants a discussion, but the second you started telling me what I was going to say (i.e. your first post) I have no interest in speaking with just you about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how to make this more clear, I've said this to you in nearly every single post I've made when speaking with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to talk to you about this topic. I don't care what YOU have to say about this topic. I will gladly discuss TZM, PJ, and TVP with anyone who doesn't act like you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You continue to poke and prod at me, telling me over and over again what I'm thinking, and not noticing that it's you I have a problem with, not the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeat, I am called out on things every day, and I have no problem admitting when I'm incorrect, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       That isn't the case here though, I'm not incorrect about anything. I made a post, you replied to it over-dramatically, then when I said I don't want to discuss this with you, you barraged me non stop how that is indicative of me having "nothing to offer" when in reality, I just don't want to waste my time WITH YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your terrible analogies, your obvious lack of understanding of definitions of words you keep saying, and your immature persona is why I have no interest in talking to you about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am so confused what you don't get about that, and how you keep saying things that are so unrelated to what I'm saying, that I honestly feel like you've just been trolling me this whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you weren't making the time go by so incredibly fast by having these meaningless discussions with you as you simply can't comprehend a single thing I'm trying to convey to you, I would stop replying. But as you keep making me repeat the same things over and over, and you still don't seem to get it, I am enthralled by the idea of continuing to say the same things, and seeing how many different rants you throw at me about the fact that I'm "ignoring the question" when I've made it so crystal clear that I just have a problem with you, that I think it's hilarious you still don't understand that.

       You just don't like me because I exposed your bullshit comment and you can't defend yourself. Your only defense is that I am not worth your time but you sit here over and over again trying to save face. Its really pathetic how you have to lie to yourself and others just so that you can feel better about yourself. Why don't you just stop reading these comments and move on spewing more bullshit claims that you can't back up with any real evidence. Don't forget that the world is flat because I said so and I am not willing to discuss that with you because you are beneath me. Honestly you remind me of when Steven Colbart when onto the oriley factor, you just don't fucking get it. I never said I wanted to say anything about the topic I just wanted to hear why you felt the need to discredit the whole movement without actually explaining why. This act of questioning you is what makes you so mad that you keep coming back here to reply, why do you care? Why do you keep coming back? All this energy spent keeping yourself ignorant doesn't it get old?

       I've said this numerous times, but I don't think you're actually reading anything I'm saying, it seems like you're just having a conversation with yourself. If you were reading what I'm saying, you wouldn't be replying with half the shit you're saying.

       I never backtracked from this by the way. There's no defense. I've stated from the first time I replied to you that I had no interest in talking to you about this, and it was because of you.

       I don't like people like you, so I don't discuss anything with people like you.

       Look at how many posts I've made where I've explicitly stated that the only thing keeping me from delving into the topic is YOU, and yet you still sit here telling me what I "really mean" -
      </p>
      <p>
       I reply, because you keep attacking me, over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've stated that I have no interest in talking to you about this, and yet ANOTHER fucking post comes in from you about the fact that I won't talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you're obviously in some sort of psychosis where you can't comprehend that maybe you are the actual reason I don't want to discuss something, but let me assure you, it is you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can easily defend myself, I do so all the time, I just have no interest in conversing with you, or replying to you in any other way than to tell you to stop telling me what I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're literally ignoring every part of what I say and then just replying with what your pre-determined answer of what "I really think" is. It's pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro tip for any future conversations you attempt to engage in;
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't start off a conversation with a condescending remark that is a pseudo-question where you sneak in a bunch of implications of what you "think" that person is going to say, before they even say a word to you. Then when they say they don't want words put in their mouth, don't start foaming and continuously tell them they have "nothing to offer" because they don't want to deal with your antics.

       You can't defend yourself, that would involve actually having knowledge regarding the subject matter, if you could defend yourself you would have, instead you just quote me and post hypocritical comments as if it somehow proves you have knowledge of the subject matter. Who do you think you are fooling saying that you could defend yourself but you won't? I read everything you say its all just bullshit reasons trying to cover up the FACT that you have nothing to offer regarding tzm, that's the truth of the matter, if you had something you would have offered it instead of playing out this whole charade. You got called out on your bullshit and are too much of a little baby to admit it. I'll say it over and over again so its apparent, you are just a mad little kid who can't defend a stupid claim he made, not only that but you care so much that this is being exposed that you will over and over again claim that you have evidence but are withholding it. You are a joke, seriously you made my day, its so much fun to call people on their bullshit and watch them cry like a little baby when they can't make up something to cover it. I think I'll add you to friends and see how many more retarded things you say. You have a problem with TZM not me, that much is apparent, or you are just too scared to post your worldviews online for others to compare theirs too. Either way you lie and are scared. I can't wait to hear what bullshit you will spew avoiding the fact that you have no evidence when you claim you do. What are you scared of really? This is reddit man not high school.

       It's an online forum, I don't gain or lose anything by talking to you about this, and with how you've shown that you act, I am reaffirmed that replying to your original statement (because it wasn't a question) would have have been useless.

       More importantly, I'm not scared of you, or this topic. I just don't want to discuss it with you, I've been adamant about it this entire time, and I'm honestly perplexed that you still don't see that.
      </p>

       Note how all I've done is tell you I don't want to have a discussion with you, and it's just brought on a barrage of personal attacks, you putting words in my mouth, and you still asking me questions that I already told you I don't want to talk to you about...

       You're the reason why people look at the TZM movement as a bunch of nutjobs, so you should probably do your movement some justice by quitting while you're ahead.

       I. Just. Don't. Want. To. Talk. To. You. About. TZM. Please, tell me that I "secretly mean something else" again, and that's not putting words in your mouth, or telling you what you're going to say, that's what you've done post after post even though I've continuously said, that I am simply not interested in YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you're used to speaking to people who will crumble when you sit there and attack them because they don't want to answer your questions, but I have nothing to prove to you, I just think you could use a gigantic lesson in etiquette.

       You have a serious ego problem because you lie on the internet and when someone calls you out you get mad and make up a bunch of reasons why they are not worth your time to reply to yet you reply to them over and over again because you are a complete tool trying to save face. You are the essence of everything that is ignorance. Its comical that you claim not to have an ego and then claim that someone is beneath you and not worth your time all while
       <strong>
        you reply over and over again trying to save face and steer attention away from the fact that you don't know shit about tzm or how it could be a scam
       </strong>
       At this point you are just embarrassing yourself, now when you post an ignorant comment someone is going to click on your comment history and see how much of a lying sack of shit you are. But, I remember now you said you don't care what people think of your comments you literally just come here to spew bullshit so you feel better about yourself, why don't you just say your stupid comments to yourself instead of posting them where normal people will read it and say "wtf is this fool?", and inquire upon how he came to his conclusion, which the inqury will be met with "I don't have to explain myself to you" The more you post stupid shit the more people are going to tell you its stupid shit, welcome to reddit.

       Then stop posting. I'm only replying because you continue to reply. You keep having to get this cheesy one-liner in at the end.

       You're not exposing anything, you've only proved my point that I was right to not have a discussion with you about anything. You've done all of this because I said I didn't want to talk to you about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't backtracked, I haven't gone outside of saying the same thing, and yet you continue, even now, to tell me that there's a different reason for why I don't answer your questions, other than the fact that you're an obnoxious, pompous, immature man-child who can't comprehend that maybe you're just a dick, and that's why I don't want to talk to you about anything.

       You dismissed a positive social movement with over 400,000 members. That's not putting words in your mouth you literally did that by claiming PJ/TZM is a scam, yet you deny it and say I put words in your mouth. Are you a complete mouth breather? You haven't made any position clear except that you are complete ignorant twat who writes off whole social movements and then gets offended when someone calls out your bullshit in a not so kind manner. Literally you are not just a lying sack of shit but you are a hypocritical little baby that can't even comprehend that his ORIGINAL POST was a completely offending post to begin with.

       I've pointed out to you numerous times that I have had no interest in discussing this with you since your original post, where you condescendingly make a statement (which you later say is a question, which, it still isn't) and then tell me what you think I'm going to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when I tell you that, you vehemently argue against me saying that the "real reason" I don't want to argue with you is that I'm afraid of you, I'm afraid of answering, I have no response.. I have no response, for you, I've made that clear.

       Again, don't give a fuck when people try to refute what I say, I do not care for actually having a rebuttal to people like you, who do so in a way you do.

      </p>
      <p>
       If you want proof of what I mean, please go back and re-read this entire conversation, and how many times I said I don't want to talk to you about this, and yet you still sit there and tell me why that is, despite the fact that I tell you in nearly every post it's because of the way you reacted and the way you decided to talk to me about it.

       I am not saying I refuse to create a discussion with you about this because you "called me out in a mean way" I'm saying I'm refusing to talk to you about this because from the get go you've proved that you have no ability to actually discuss this, which was apparent when you started off by telling me what I was going to say, and then continuously told me throughout our entire conversation that I'm lying, and I really have no problem with you. I have a giant problem with you.

       You made a statement like a jackass, told me what you thought I was going to say, like a jackass, and then you told me that you asked me a question (which you didn't do) and that I was not answering because I had "nothing to offer" like a jackass - because you never asked me a question. You showed me within five replies what a debate would be like with you, so I was more than correct with my original assessment that not answering your question was the best move. If you're this mad because I said I don't like you, I can only imagine how livid you would be if I actually disagreed with something that clearly makes up 99% of your anatomy.

       This has never been about TZM, or any argument, or PJ, or anything. This ENTIRE conversation I've had with you, all of these little debates, have all stemmed and only have to deal with YOU. You are the only thing that kept me from formulating a response.

       I don't know how else to convey this to you, it is entirely you that kept me from replying to your original statement with a response that you desired. I do not like people like you, so I'm not going to answer a question that I've answered numerous times, that would take me a very long time to accurately and definitively answer, when you have shown yourself to not be interested in any sort of discussion at all.

Stop telling me what I "really think" stop telling me what you "really know" just stop. I've been very adamant and clear that it is you I have a problem with, so please just understand that.

       You can't go one reply without telling me what I'm really thinking, and you've actually had more of a conversation with yourself than you have with me in the last six hours. You should seriously seek professional help.

      <p>
       When you say something like this, it's hypocritical. You're saying I'm getting mad because I reply to you every time you reply to me, but you say you aren't mad...but you won't stop replying to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's being a hypocrite.

       What did I lie about? That I didn't want to talk to you about this because I knew how you would react in a discussion with me?

       And the term is "couldn't care less" - which I wouldn't expect you to know as you're a follower of Peter Joseph, so you obviously have a 34 IQ.

      <p>
       I don't care that you called me out, ask people in this sub who have conversations with me, people call me out all the time, I just knew from your first post that there would be no benefit to having a discussion with you about this. You've proven me correct post after post.

       I told you a long time ago. You win, I'm not going to reply to you about TZM. You've said it, you're going to stalk me and read all my posts because I wouldn't answer your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we've got it all out of the way. I'm not going to answer you about TZM, you're going to stalk me, got it. You're the best. What else are you hoping to accomplish through this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I obviously can't get you to understand that I just didn't like you from the first post you made and felt that any sort of legitimate discussion would gain nothing outside of me having to tell you every post that I meant what I said, and not what you think I meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you win, you're the greatest, no one is better than you. Please, continue to stalk my posts and pretend you aren't upset by what I said.

      <p>
       This has obviously cut you deep, and I've apologized for that.

       You're being dense and you're making analogies that aren't even remotely logical. You're insanely rude, and I gain nothing from speaking to you. I've spoken to extremely eloquent and well-spoken TZM members who have changed my views good and bad on a lot of issues that PJ brings up. You would bring nothing to me in a conversation because you already showed your divine argumentative and conversational skills when we first started having this debacle, and I know that there is nothing to take away from speaking with you.
      </p>

       I've taken a lot away from TZM members whom actually give a good name to the movement. You unfortunately don't fall into this group. Due to this, which I found early on, I felt no reason to discuss anything with you, as there would be nothing to be gained in a conversation with you. As stated, I have had plenty of discussions with people about TZM, good and bad, and there's no reason for me to have a discussion with someone who acts the way you do, when I can speak to someone who doesn't have the demeanor of a high school dropout.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are making such poor comparisons that it's honestly depressing, and I really wish you'd stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have shown your age, or at least your maturity, in every post you've made towards me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I continue to be on the border of kind to you, despite how irrational and insulting you constantly are to me, and I don't see where you think you reserve the right to be a dick to me just because I didn't want to have a conversation with you about something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew you would do stuff like this when you made your first post, and time and time again you keep insulting me, you keep being condescending, and you keep attacking me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why it's such a huge deal to you that I didn't want to discuss this with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's honestly disappointing that you can't comprehend that because of the nasty way that you speak to people, and the nasty way you've spoken to me, that I would have no interest in carrying on a conversation with you about something you are very passionate about. You already attack me this much and I've told you absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have to answer your question just because you ask me one. And me not answering is not a sign of denial, or ignorance, it is a sign of your inability to communicate properly with other human beings, which is likely why you find it okay and necessary to constantly insult people and attack them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only started to get frustrated with you when you were deliberately ignoring my posts, responding to comments that you've made about what you think I meant, or think I was going to say, and then got mad at me for not wanting to talk to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before; if you want to actually have a civil discussion with someone, don't start out a conversation with condescension, accusations, and insults. No one will want to talk to you when you approach situations like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You started replying to my posts 2 or 3 at a time, or editing while I was simply replying to get more and more last words in, when all I've been saying this entire time is that I just didn't care to have any sort of discussion with you about anything because of the way you acted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It snowballed into this nonsense because you simply wouldn't take that as an answer. There is no way someone wouldn't want to talk to you, it must be because I have nothing to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's what helps you sleep at night, or feeds your self-esteem, believe that, but stop putting words in my mouth and stop telling me what I think.

       You were an arrogant, ignorant twat with your very first comment. This wall of text with nothing but, "I could answer you nicely but you were a dick to me" is really pathetic, you won't even admit that dismissing a whole social movement without anything to support the claim might offend someone. You expect someone to be civil when you make stupid comments like that? Come on you type this wall of text that really has nothing in it, for what? So you can feel good about being ignorant and not being able to back your claims? If you want civil comments to your posts then don't make stupid ignorant claims when you can't back them up, weather or not you find the person accusing you of falsity to be "civil or not". I've literally just been mirroring you from the first post, hence my Steven Colbart/Orily reference. You ever look in the mirror?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its funny how you are clueless as to why I would ever not be civil with you off the get go when you make a stupid ignorant comment (your first comment) and refuse to back it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       My analogies are actually spot on, you just fail to see how much of a twat you were with your very first comment. You fail to comprehend it from another person's perspective, you have a very limited worldview. You got offended over the internet, closed up, got mad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the great thing about the internet man is you don't have to reply to me calling your bullshit, you can just ignore it without making yourself look like a complete tool. Don't forget the holocaust never happened because you are mean and I don't have to explain it to you because you were mean to me.

       Again insulting me. I wasn't arrogant, and I certainly wasn't ignorant. You were the only one misinformed in your reply to my original post, as if you had read my post, you would have seen that I said there is factual information in the videos and movement, but it's clouded by the misinformation in it. You didn't read that though.

       I didn't dismiss the movement, I dismissed PJ and the videos he puts out. The movies aren't the entire movement, and PJ doesn't represent everyone who follows the movement. It is ignorant for you to assume that by my insulting PJ, I am insulting anyone who follows TZM.

       I don't like Roger Goodell, but I like football. If I don't like the way Goodell is doing things, does that mean every NFL team and player should feel offended? Or all fans of the game should be?

       Once again, after the nine billionth time, I am not replying to you about TZM because I don't have an interest in talking to you about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note how I'm still replying to nearly your entire post (outside of comments that have no ability to be replied to) and yet you don't reply to anything I say?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can keep insulting me, and keep misunderstanding what I'm saying, but it's not going to change anything from my end. I love discussing TZM, it's such an incredibly unique thing to discuss, it offers such a wide range of information that talking about the entire movement could take up days. I think there are things to be learned both positively and negative outside of TZM. But I also didn't discredit THE ENTIRE movement, or all of the videos, or EVERYTHING Peter Joseph said. You would have noted that, if you had even a basic reading comprehension, but you don't, which is obvious that this conversation is still going on while you sit here and insult me again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
       You spoke to me like an imbecile looking for a fight from the beginning and ignored my actual posts the entire time, including now, that's not someone to have a discussion with. Sorry to say but, I don't know you, I don't really care about you, so just because you ask me a question, doesn't mean I have to answer it. Especially when you approach me the way you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no discussion in someone talking at me, and someone insulting me and attacking me, so I won't do that with you.

       I'm getting some stuff out of you slowly, first you think PJ is the leader of the movement this proves how stupid you are, another thing why do cry like a little baby saying I am putting words in your mouth when you have done the exact same thing in every post you made? Its really sad how you finally let a little out and the first thing you say just proves how ignorant you are. I see why you didn't want to say anything because you don't know anything. If i were you I wouldn't talk about things or make claims about things that I have little understanding of, if I did, I would be prepared to have my claims refuted rather than completely unprepared and risk being offended by someone refuting my claim. Or if I was making a dick ignorant comment i would expect dick uncivil responses.

       Ever heard of a leaderless movement? Are you that fucking stupid? You prob think PJ invented something. I am not speaking to a person I am speaking to an ignorant twat that can't back up his claims because he makes claims with zero evidence. You should go watch some Robert Sapolsky as you label things you know nothing of. As for reddit your comment history is plain that no one replies to your or even up or down votes anything you say, you make one liners that really don't add to any of the discussions you just give your OPINION, I am probably one of the few people who actually commented on your stupid shit.

       Again leader of TZM I lol'd I don't even know what to say to that, you fail to comprehend.

      <p>
       You have to actually bring something to the table to have an in depth conversation, you just brought ignorant spew and nothing else, I called you out you cried like a little baby trying to defend something that is not defensible. Keep on telling people on the internet you have evidence but you don't want to provide it, seriously you make the internet a better place.... You are calling me schizophrenic and say I don't know how to talk to people? You should do standup.

       Do you know what schizophrenia is? Look up the symptoms, you'd be surprised how many of them you've exhibited in our conversation alone.

       Fyi, if you did look through my post history, you'd see numerous times where I explain my time on Reddit.

       I have three major heart conditions, simultaneously. I spend so much time on Reddit, because I literally can't do much else. To me, wasting half a day on Reddit is what I do every day, there's not much else I can do and work from home is incredibly limited.
      </p>
      <p>
       You though, by your own will, sat here insulting me post after post for not wanting to talk to you about something, for half a fucking day. Do you really not see how crazy that is?

       You ignored everything in my post, I also included an edit because you constantly edit your posts and can't get all of your thoughts out at one time.

       Your evidence IS an opinion. Me not wanting to answer you meaning "I am ignorant" is the definition of an opinion. You can't know my intent, you can't know what I'm thinking, the fact that you claim that as evidence is yet another staggering sign of a mental illness.

       Saying what? I have replied to nearly everything you've said in all of your posts, unless you say something completely irrelevant, like this;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why don't you make some more claims and not back them up while you are at it. What do you have to say about Santa Claus or Jesus?

       Why reply to stuff like this? There's no point.

       The only thing I've continued to deny you the right to see a legitimate response from me about is TZM, and my original post. That clearly bugs you to no end.

       You forget I already accomplished my mission of proving you actually have no knowledge of the subject manner, you reinforced this by asking who the leader was. You literally cannot comprehend hypocrisy, irony, or satire, that much was made apparent as well. Again expect people to call your bullshit out in the future. I think the most funny part of all your posts was you crying about me inferring and you doing the same exact thing in just about every post, to a much more extreme degree as well.

       I do, and I'm called on it every day. What is unique to you is, you haven't actually called me on anything.. You've realistically just had a twelve hour conversation with yourself where you've not listened to anything I've said and formed your own opinion based on what you think I meant by what I typed. You've insulted me every step of the way after I've repeatedly been so kind to you in comparison to what you've been saying to me. If you must know, the way you treat other individuals is not reflective on the TZM movement.

       See when I say stuff like this, I show you why. You just make drastic claims and even though I've asked you every time you say things like this; you refuse to acknowledge it.

      <p>
       Explain what I'm doing that's hypocritical? What, that I insulted PJ and his movies and you then in turn took it to mean I'm insulting the entire TZM movement?
      </p>
      <p>
       I again reiterate, if you truthfully feel as if though you have an equal voice in TZM as PJ does, please, let me know.

       In general, an opinion is a subjective belief, and is the result of emotion or interpretation of facts. An opinion may be supported by an argument, although people may draw opposing opinions from the same set of facts. Opinions rarely change without new arguments being presented. However, it can be reasoned that one opinion is better supported by the facts than another by analyzing the supporting arguments.

Also you are a reptilian, I have evidence but I can tell you don't like that I am not going to tell you so I won't! We really are different you being a reptilian and me being a CHILD OF THE LIGHT!!!

       I feel like your first statement is probably correct here. You linking the what I would assume is the wikipedia definition of the word opinion holds really no merit here unless you're using it to agree with me. And you asking me if I know the quadratic formula is clearly once again irrelevant.

       See where this logic fails? I actually asked you a question, and you aren't answering.
      </p>
      <p>
       You didn't ask me a question, and got mad at me for not answering it, and before even actually asking anything, claimed I was avoiding answering it.

      <p>
       It's been a delight having this pleasureful meeting with you, and despite the fact that you won't actually ever reply to what I'm saying, I hope you feel like you aren't crazy despite all of this.

       Again mission was accomplished a long time ago, proved you really have nothing to offer, proved that you are a twat, proved you can't comprehend irony, hypocrisy nor satire. You quote individual parts of a sentence as if you are proving something its sad really. Bottom line you are bullshit and anyone that reads this knows that, you typed all of this and didn't once defend your statement that I claimed false. All because you just don't want to because you say you know how it will turn out (wait you putting words in my mouth NO NO HOW COULD YOU) Seriously you mine as well have slammed your face into your keyboard it would have provided you with more creditability than "I don't have to explain myself to people who are not civil even though I myself am a moron and was rude with my first comment" This a million times, you are such a hypocrite its funny. here why don't you quote something out of context again and say how it proves I don't understand irony. THAT MIGHT BE IRONIC IF YOU DID HO HO

       My first comment wasn't ignorant and rude. You simply misunderstood it. I insulted PJ and the videos that were put out. You took that as an insult to the entire Zeitgeist movement. That's your own devise, you misinterpreted what I said.

      <p>
       You've shown again that you have no basic reading comprehension and you are the epitome of why so many people look at members of TZM as nutjobs. I know respectable people who follow the movement and would be embarrassed to see someone like you.

       Yeah, you're right. And anyone who reads this would know that I told you over 50 times that I wasn't going to have an in depth conversation with you about TZM because you're anasshole, and you don't deserve a conversation with anyone.

       You offended me and any TZM member with your ignorant comment thus you get called out and shit on by someone who actually has something to back their claims with. You literally got thrashed you never once even tried to dispute the fact that your original comment was an offending one that is not true. This makes you a complete douche, a tool. Your original post you claimed PJ was a scam and now you deny it, what a fucking loser, I'm glad reddit knows how much of a tool you are now.

       You act as if your original post was not a dick statement, that's what is so sad. You think writing off a whole social movement based on your opinion is somehow ok, sure you can make the post but, don't try and act as if it is fact, don't try and defend yourself saying you have the evidence but, just don't feel like providing it to someone who is offended that you made an OFFENDING comment.

       This over and over again, you can't even comprehend that your first comment was that of an ignorant tool. You tell me what this is all about but get mad when I use what you have said against you.... You are so hypocritical and stupid its really sad.

       There's really only one rule: never go full retard. Well, that and don't support anything reddit doesn't support. Then again, what is reddit? Well, it's a giant lake full talking fish that gather around you and feed you again and again until you swell up, can't take it anymore, cry and struggle and eventually grow fur and leave this planet for a better one with blackjack and hookers.

       Hello, users, I am the unofficial SRD ambassdor bot, here to quickly explain exactly what SubredditDrama is.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">
        /r/SubredditDrama
       </a>
       (SRD) is a meta subreddit dedicated to aggregating the drama on Reddit strictly for observing and discussing. Although the bot above, brigitte_mohnhaupt, would like you to think that SRD is an invasion subreddit, drama is never submitted to SRD for the purposes of causing drama or swaying discussions in their favor. That would kind of defeat the purpose of observing drama anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If you choose to follow the link provided by brigitte_mohnhaupt into SRD please read the sidebar before participating.
       </strong>
       You're welcome to participate in the discussion, but SRD is not another platform for your drama.

       Many people grow up being taught that history was a certain way, A. Ralph Epperson calls this the "Accidental History".  Now tell me, do you believe that powerful people just let history happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or do you think at least 1 or 2 of them (at least remember) got together in secret and talked, even casually, about how to make the world better for them and theirs at the cost of "the people"?

        OP
       </strong>
       Check my channel for a whole lot of listening material.  I highly recommend William Cooper's Mp3 Collection where he goes into detail about the "Conspiratorial History" that you were never taught in school, nor were you supposed to have learned about it.

       </a>
       .  PM me to get info about Mp3 collections I have.

      <p>
       And tttt0tttt, please inform the OP of the amount of freemasons that help found the United States, or who the first PM of Canada belonged to.  Just so that you show that you are basing your opinion on nothing.

       Haha, thank you! You know why I do?  It's because the religion of mystery babylon is the religion that holds it all together.  How could so many people be "in on it" and no one talks?  How can so many different types of people be working together for a "one world government" when on the front we can even agree on environmental issues?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is clearly sumthing deeper and mystery babylon explains it. period. haha.  Back of the dollar bill.  32 and 33 feathers on each respective eagle wing, why is there a pyramid?  What the fuk is latin doing on the American dollar bill?
      </p>
      <p>
       We've all been scammed on a massive scale.  I believe Bill knew the truth and was working on waking everyone up.  He didn't tell us what we wanted to hear, he was real, and that's why he was killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you been going through the collection?  Or not so much.  I can recommend TONNES of specific episodes if you'd like.  I'm probably getting close to over 300hrs listening in the last like 3 months.  About 20 hours a week listening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inspirational beyond all words.  Especially hearing what he has to say
       <strong>
        KNOWING
       </strong>
       that he was killed for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       RIP Bill.  You've done you're part.  Its time for us to step it up!

       <p>
        One recent historical account of Freemasonry, THE TEMPLE &amp; THE LODGE, boast instead of the profound influence of Freemasonry on the founding documents, (while carefully trying to avoid creating the impression of a Masonic conspiracy)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of the fifty-six signatories of the Declaration of Independence, only nine can definitely be identified as Freemasons, while ten others may possibly have been. Of the general officers in the Continental Army, there were so far as documentation can establish, thirty-three Freemasons out of seventy-four. Granted the known Freemasons were, as a rule, more prominent, more instrumental in shaping the course of events than their unaffiliated colleagues...
      </p>
      <p>
       On 11 June, (the Continental) Congress appointed a committee to draft a declaration of independence. Of the five men on this committee, two - Franklin and...Robert Livingston - were Freemasons, and one, Robert Sherman, is believed, though not confirmed, to have been. The other two, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams - were not, despite subsequent claims to the contrary. The text of the declaration was composed by Jefferson. It was submitted to Congress and accepted on 4 July 1776. The nine signatories who can now be established as proven Freemasons, and the ten who were possibly so, included such influential figures as Washington, Franklin and, of course, the president of the Congress, John Hancock. The army, moreover, remained almost entirely in Freemasonic hands...As we shall see, it is in the Constitution that the influence of Freemasonry is most discernible...

       There is a lot of good info in the Zeitgeist films. Some questionable info but none the less I recommend it to everyone. Decide for yourself what is the truth. The stuff that doesn't make any sense then look it up yourself. You will get a lot of different opinions here from a lot of different perspectives. Some people are just set in their ways and beliefs and if this doesn't go along with their beliefs then it is wrong and will be able to find ways to convince themselves and maybe even you that it is. When asking people what they think of something I need to know what kind of person I'm talking to a christian, jew, muslim etc because they are gonna take it differently or reject it no matter how truthful it is. The first 2 parts of zeitgeist moving forward is really good info IMO. I liked the last part too but I can see why people would be turned off by that, seems like people would have more control over others than they do now. The way humans are living is very destructive to the planet and eventually our own way of life will be threatened because of it. Something needs to be done.

       I agree that the first two films are different than the third, first two seem to me an angry rant about the division-ism of religion and how ironic it is that every religion stems from paganism. The third is just amazing, I love the Standford and Berkeley professors, Dr Robert Sapolsky is a boss.

       The pagan religion of Sun Worship on the front isn't so bad right? Worshiping the sun because it is huge and awesome, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, the sun represented and represents (to them) "the light", "intellect", or "Lucifer" (Yes, Lucifer).

       <em>

        of the Intellect.  Because he told Eve that "She would surely not die if she ate from the tree of knowledge, and she will be as a god"

       Are you following me?  Don't worry if you're not.  There's a lot of learning to be done and I won't pretend to tell you I am complete, or near complete (because how can you ever be done?) but listen to the mystery babylon series in my channel from hour 1 all the way through and your eyes will be opened SO wide you'll wish they had never been opened.

       Ok.  Listen to the first two hours of the 40 hour mystery babylon series and then decide for yourself if you'd like to continue.  William Cooper does the most in depth explaination and analyis on the Secret Mystery Schools of the world than anyone I've ever heard.  I'll put here the youtube video if you wanna just stream them like that and I'll put the link for a direct d/l of the mp3 so you can take it with you to work or listen to it on your ipod like i do.

       The Sun is representative of Lucifer, the fallen god of the material world.  Dont get caught up here though.  They worship lucifer BECAUSE!!!! He gave Eve (and thus Man) intelligence over God and promised that "she would surely be as a god".

       That isn't saying, "I'd love to hear a one-liner about what you think is bullshit" you wanted me to explain everything I found through TZM to be bullshit, and that would take a long time.

       I cannot offer you anything. You've shown that you have no interest in having a discussion with me from your first post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care that you called me out, ask people in this sub who have conversations with me, people call me out all the time, I just knew from your first post that there would be no benefit to having a discussion with you about this. You've proven me correct post after post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told you a long time ago. You win, I'm not going to reply to you about TZM. You've said it, you're going to stalk me and read all my posts because I wouldn't answer your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we've got it all out of the way. I'm not going to answer you about TZM, you're going to stalk me, got it. You're the best. What else are you hoping to accomplish through this?
      </p>
      <p>
       I obviously can't get you to understand that I just didn't like you from the first post you made and felt that any sort of legitimate discussion would gain nothing outside of me having to tell you every post that I meant what I said, and not what you think I meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you win, you're the greatest, no one is better than you. Please, continue to stalk my posts and pretend you aren't upset by what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has obviously cut you deep, and I've apologized for that.

        In general, an opinion is a subjective belief, and is the result of emotion or interpretation of facts. An opinion may be supported by an argument, although people may draw opposing opinions from the same set of facts. Opinions rarely change without new arguments being presented. However, it can be reasoned that one opinion is better supported by the facts than another by analyzing the supporting arguments.

      <p>
       I feel like your first statement is probably correct here. You linking the what I would assume is the wikipedia definition of the word opinion holds really no merit here unless you're using it to agree with me. And you asking me if I know the quadratic formula is clearly once again irrelevant.

       The pagan religion of Sun Worship on the front isn't so bad right? Worshiping the sun because it is huge and awesome, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, the sun represented and represents (to them) "the light", "intellect", or "Lucifer" (Yes, Lucifer).
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The Sun is a Metaphor for Enlightenment
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Devil/Lucifer through THE SNAKE in the garden of Eden is the
        <em>
         provider
        </em>
        of the Intellect.  Because he told Eve that "She would surely not die if she ate from the tree of knowledge, and she will be as a god"
       </strong>
      </p>

       Are you following me?  Don't worry if you're not.  There's a lot of learning to be done and I won't pretend to tell you I am complete, or near complete (because how can you ever be done?) but listen to the mystery babylon series in my channel from hour 1 all the way through and your eyes will be opened SO wide you'll wish they had never been opened.
      </p>

       Because once you find out the truth and find out their lies through their symbolism, you become responsible.  You have to become responsible.  You have to do something.  That's why I am here.
