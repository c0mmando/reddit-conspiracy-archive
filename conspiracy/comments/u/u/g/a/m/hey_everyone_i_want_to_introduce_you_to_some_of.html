<p>p.s. I hope everyone of them gets shadowbanned by the admins and never learns that they could come here to escape that silent prison. Really.</p>

<li><p>Admins for Reddit got butthurt and shadow banned some commenter for what appears to be a completely inane post or he was shadowbanned long before that post and it was his first in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Either way you can&#39;t tell because you can&#39;t see the rest of their posts to even see if it was justified.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderator policy is to ban any account from the /r/ that&#39;s been shadow banned by admins because it will fill up the moderator queue.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from an outsiders perspective it really looks like you&#39;re being a tool in this situation. Instead providing a brief explanation you include a link to some long winded post about subreddit drama we may not actually care about. Then out of some misguided sense of nobility you create an entirely new post to vindicate your poor reception (ie downvotes). Yeah in this case you come out looking like kind of a prick. </p>

<p>I can see through a single incident without attributing it to the whole person. You are probably well intentioned and frustrated with a certain trend you see and I guess what I really want to say is you seem to be handling it wrong. I chose this place to comment because NWO broke it down in a few sentences showing that it can be done.</p>

<p>Good. Yeah. I&#39;m glad I look like a prick for informing people that they&#39;ve been frolicking around on reddit <strong><em>invisibly</em></strong> for God knows how long.</p>

<p>Yeah. I&#39;m the prick. I deserve all the downvotes I get for even daring to try to correct highly inappropriate behavior (the blind, back alley thuggery of leaping to wrong conclusions and encouraging others to join the circlejerk - when there&#39;s a goddamn link there in front of their faces explaining everything, but they refuse to fucking read it).</p>

<p>Yeah. I&#39;m the prick because I don&#39;t appreciate being abused for doing volunteer work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you know I&#39;ve done lots of unpaid moderating etc and I don&#39;t think I ever thought of it as some kind of noble volunteer work. You keep bringing it up like you&#39;re providing entertainment in a pediatric burn center. It&#39;s not as cool as you think and it really doesn&#39;t command respect when you&#39;re putting out such a negative vibe. </p>

<p>I mentioned that I don&#39;t attribute this bad attitude to you as a whole person but seemed to go right over your head. I mean it in the best way possible: I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a great guy and everything but you&#39;re kind of acting like a dick. It&#39;s not your charity work that makes you seem like an asshole the is the constantly berating people because they fail to meet your expectations.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever moderated before you&#39;ll realize that the influx of new members who fail to read the FAQ, rules, stickies, etc never ends. If you can&#39;t stand it anymore and your blood pressure is out of control maybe it&#39;s time to hang up the modhat. </p>

<p>You seem to think you got a raw deal the first time because everyone downvoted you so you created a new post to vindicate yourself. Just move on it happens. It&#39;s happening now. You posted this expecting some feedback and you couldn&#39;t expect everyone to agree with you. It really doesn&#39;t matter what the issue was, your negativity and childish temper tantrums are the reason all your comments were negative.</p>

<p>Who was shadow banned</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The person I responded to. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/IvanAslan">http://www.reddit.com/user/IvanAslan</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>for what reason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not know, because we did not do it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>was anyone banned at all? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. The same user was <strong>also</strong> BANNED from this subreddit, but NOT as any sort of disciplinary action on our part. Rather, we&#39;re just getting them out of our modqueue.</p>

<p>Shadowban == Admin (reddit, inc. employees) action.</p>

<p>Ban == A local subreddit action done by moderators.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between an admin and a moderator, AND there&#39;s a difference between a shadow ban and a ban. RE-read the link with this information in mind. There are two types of bans in question here (ban and shadowban), as well as two different groups of people (mods and admins).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain that without being an arsehole?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably not. </p>

<p>I honestly think the problem is that a great many people think the admins and the mods are all the same people, raking in 6-figure salaries from Conde Nast. I AM A VOLUNTEER!</p>

<p>Without fail, there are people who want to jump to some conclusion they think they can justify without any knowledge of the matter whatsoever, despite my efforts.</p>

<p>This question is answered in the link, too.</p>

On the other hand, we have no way of knowing if the number is accurate, and it might just be an attempt to harass some innocent individual due to some personal grudge. For this reason, such numbers should not be posted, and when posted the posts should be removed.</p>

<p>This did not happen. No one was banned over the posting of the public official&#39;s phone number. Although the post was removed for it.</p>

<p>I added context=10 (overkill, but a good release of frustration), because of this confusion.</p>

<p>I assumed (I admit - I shouldn&#39;t assume anything, ever) that you&#39;d recognize the message, because you commented in the original post.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Due to the mass influx of new users (and this situation seems to be a resulting symptom), I&#39;m going to discuss a few PSA posts with the other mods. Looks like we need some sort of &quot;welcome to r/conspiracy&quot; introduction to link people to from time to time.</p>
