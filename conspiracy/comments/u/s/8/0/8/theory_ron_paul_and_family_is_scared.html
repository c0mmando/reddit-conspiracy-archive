       Possibly, Rand could be scared for himself and his father, so he goes out and endorses Romney.

       Do you know what will happen if these threats came out and were proven or were to be materialized? I think you are underestimating the power of tens of millions of people who are informed(mostly) and armed(mostly).
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is Rand Paul is not a principled man, he became a senator on his fathers back and he's been taking the lobbyist bribes, he's been waving off important issues and been pissing himself in the pants of the though of Romney offering him the VP slot.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is obviously a sellout and that's that.
      </p>
      <p>
       To make up all these conspiracy theories to defend Rand lust for power and importance is stupid and this is what gives conspiracy theorists bad name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just take it like it is, and in this case it is in your face sellout by Rand who kept saying for weeks, if not months that he'd support the GOP nominee whoever it was. The fact that he did it with such glee and smile is even more traitorous than the act of endorsing him itself.

       you really think so huh? not to sound like a "provocateur," but look at the occupy movement. where is peaceful protesting getting us? we protest peacefully and are assaulted by police. we're assaulted by GMO foods, chemtrails, vaccinations and wars that we don't want. they aren't being peaceful, so what the hell makes you think being peaceful is gonna get us ANYWHERE? Everyone needs to WAKE. UP. NOW.

       Violence is a language that can only say one thing:
       <strong>
        STOP
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Peaceful ways of saying "stop" have been tried for years, but it's becoming increasingly clear our so-called leadership doesn't give a fuck.

       It's called organizing and voting asshole! Not camp out and protest non-stop, and when that doesn't work get violent. What a retarded thing to say. If you are willing to use violence then you don't value life at all, you're just a punk asshole. Just another idiot the other side points to label the entire movement. I say fuck you, you're not part of the solution. You're part of the problem.

       If voting was all a sham private companies like Rasmussen wouldn't be able to accurately predict election results in election after election by asking sample populations of random citizens. So I can already tell you believe bullshit and FUCKiNG RETARDED.

       bad?  No.  You feed a little bit to him inside of something he really likes and agrees with - like a piece of meat or something.  That way he'll simply be responsible for his own demise by continuing to do something that he thinks is actually good for him - eating the piece of meat in this case.

       Ron Paul has not bowed out of the race, although he has ceased active campaigning for popular votes. He is working instead to secure delegate votes for the Republican National Convention by winning them through the various state conventions around the U.S. between now and August.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is relevant, because delegates are all that really matters, and he will likely have the second most delegates representing him at the national convention. If so, they could disrupt the proceedings or cause trouble for Mitt Romney, the likely nominee. Therefore, he has power and can get Romney and the party to push his agendas, such as auditing the Federal Reserve bank, ending the war in Afghanistan, etc.

       That, but also many Romney delegates are Paul supporters and my vote for Paul over Romney.  It takes time and effort to sign up to be a delegate, and Paul supporters seem to have had the time and the passion to become "Romney delegates" who still intend to support Paul.

       So in your opinion does Paul still have a chance to will the nomination?  I was (from an outside view) led to believe that its basically a lost cause.  What would you say the odds of Paul winning are?  Now this is a bit personal so feel free to say no answer but if Romney won would you vote for him to push the republican agenda forward or would you vote for obama/abstain?

       I'd say it's unlikely at this late stage, but nobody really knows. Half the state conventions haven't even taken place yet, so all of the numbers out there in the media regarding delegates are just guesses.

       I will never vote for Romney or Obama. Romney is a corporate-shill who is funded by people like the Koch Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Obama constantly oversteps the constitution (which is nuts when you realize he is a constitutional law professor). Either one of them is a completely unacceptable choice for president. I'd write-in Ron Paul or just vote Gary Johnson.

       I don't think so. If they were going to kill Paul, they would've done it long ago. And if they did kill Ron Paul, he would become a martyr and it would galvanize at least a million people into violently striking back.

       He is a republican and he lost the election to be the republican nominee for president.  The republicans that lose in the nomination process always endorse the guy that finally wins the republican nomination.  That is why they are in a party.  Other republicans will always back other republicans.  Same goes for Democrats.  That is the way the game is played.

       How can they get elected if all of the elections are controlled by a shadow government?  Why is all voting controlled by Diebold  boxes unless the candidate's last name is Paul? If the bildeberg's decide who gets elected, then why are the Paul's magically exempt from this system that is so airtight and clockwork so as to be able to control every aspect of your life through mind controlling fluoride, yet Paul supporters are inexplicably exempt from tap water's mighty psychotropic qualities?

       It runs deeper than that.  Dr. Paul was on the way to win the nomination.  That's what the people want, whether they realize it or not, and it's the most well kept secret in politics.  He knew it better than anyone but somewhere along the line he realized that he and his family are in danger.  His son took it a step father and endorsed Romney, a "poster boy" of the establishment, just to demonstrate their "loyalty."  Don't expect to hear from the Paul family any time soon, this is a dark day for freedom.

       The real reason they like RP is the austerity measures.

       you have no understanding of basic economy do you? How do you know even then that the money is going to go the the right place? How do you know that the insider congress and globalists in the white house aren't going to give themselves all the money and screw you over.

       Not to mention that your notion of free money is stupid, have you heard about inflation?

      <p>
       Giving trillions of dollars around to every person is going to inflate the currency tenfold.
      </p>

       Not to mention that its not sound economic policy as you are not using the supply and demand, you are using artificially created money from no production.

       I mean this is the common socialist notion that has absolutely no ground at all. You may have good intentions, but your views to achieving it are so dangerous that you are a bigger threat than the giant banks governing now.

       I really don't think defense budget is that big but it is poorly allocated.  I like that we have the best weapons tech out there, but we buy far too much rather than just researching it.  DoD could more effectively dominate a small country with 1950s weapons protecting the Army Corp and economic development than showing off flashy toys.

       The intelligence agencies pull more per year from cocaine and heroin trade.  They are the ones giving us a bad name and wasting the most money as well as generally fucking the whole world up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to consider is most of our high tech manufacturing is done on DoD contracts.  It's vitally important that you don't just "cut" this part of the economy, but have other things for them to do that are similarly high tech like infrastructure along the lines of NAWAPA.

       I was under the impression that the intelligence agencies are part of the defense budget, but maybe I'm wrong. But either way the intelligence budget is about 1/18th of the overall defense budget. And as you said, using some of that defense spending on infrastructure instead of defense would be better suited for our economy. I'm not arguing to rid the budget of that money, but to allocate it into programs stateside that would be far better for our economy. Take Germany, for example. Before WW2 ended they spent massive amounts on defense, now they've allocated that money elsewhere and are flourishing. That's what we need.

       I support the maintenance of America as sole global superpower, although I hate the general direction of our foreign policy and the ends to which that power has been used the last couple of decades.  A big budget to maintain technological superiority is fine by me.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the intelligence community being on defense budget, yes and no.  They get defense dollars, but most of their funding is off budget ("black") and comes from things like the drug trade.   Poppy in Afghanistan is $500 billion per year and cocaine is huge too.  The black budget of the intelligence community rivals the entire "on-budget" defense appropriations.
      </p>

       I'd like to see a much larger Army Corp deployed worldwide to do analogues to NAWAPA everywhere.  We need to build out a global mag-lev system, electricity grid, internet, etc.  I don't mind doing this in an "empire" fashion.  Whatever country objects to us modernizing global infrastructure can have a talk with the army.  If Wahhabi cult members in Saudi Arabia are going all "hurr durr infidels" because Army Corp is building desalination plants, use the regular army to shoot 'em up.  The bulk of the world's population will love us if we only deploy with the aim of actually helping them instead of this divide and conquer stuff the intelligence community has turned our foreign policy into.

       No.  I don't believe that local governments should be able to violate rights bestowed on the people by their federal government by virtue of their federal constitution.  I believe in the righteousness of the concept of a national constitution and a bill of rights---to a limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitution's clauses and amendments so broadly so as to touch almost every facet of human life in this country and that has resulted in an almost unbearable smothering of the states and municipalities.  The USSC's fall-back legal fiction of the interstate commerce clause has justified the intrusion of the feds on state and town/city sovereignty for way too long, and it is only getting worse.
