       I have noticed lately, that a lot of violent suggestions have been surfacing on this sub-reddit. I would suggest that caution be taken when replying or most definitely agreeing with people when they say things that are violent and could be portrayed in a certain manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know and have heard of the recent ploy by CIA and other groups to recruit and eventually bust "terrorist". These terrorists end up being disgruntled Americans who would normally most likely just complain about government and get on about their day. However; in these circumstances they are tricked and coerced into performing terrorist acts only to be busted and the CIA sits back and says "oh see, we need to blah blah blah with america because we have terrorists on our own soil".
      </p>
      <p>
       So i request that my fellow brothers and sisters be careful, because as it stands, we DO NOT know who is on this board and i could very well see a government funded project to gather sources from a place like this being put into effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for taking the time to read this and be careful out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I would like to address some concerns but first and foremost i would like to thank everyone for their input from both sides of the fence. Some of you seem to think i am telling you to be passive and not be violent or to actually censor yourselves, this could be further from the point of what i am saying. Whatever your opinions are and what you feel should be done...that is fine and it is your own to do with as you please. My concern was that we all be careful with what we say when we don't know who we are saying it to. If you are on here blasting government and stating that we should do "blank" to them and there happens to be one of the people mentioned in my post here looking for people to put in some entrapment plot....then you have made yourself a prime suspect. Also, at the same time, my request was that we be cautious WHO we agree with when that person might be preaching some anarchy type movement because you never know what that persons true intentions might be. I thought this was made clear in my post, however; i apologize if what i wrote was confusing... English is my first language. :)

       Tell me, Who wants to browse a subreddit that thinks there's a cabal that wants to rule the world, and at the same time has a democratic system installed to serve the people. See? wasn't that easy? America is a democratic state that is transparent and hides nothing.

       I'm not big on the whole, "they're out to get us" schtik either. this being said, I have to call a "little bullshit" on your comment. it's almost like you are swinging the pendulum the other direction. I think most people would agree with the fact that there is a power elite in every culture. And that power elite exists to protect itself and it's interests. And that it has much more concentrated resources than do the average John Q Public. And that the interests of the average citizen may sometimes clash. And that when this happens, John Q Public will usually be on the losing end, be it through whichever means necessary.

       People also need to understand that some of the biggest 'groups' trying to change the world we live in, are trying to do so through non-violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an excellent post, and even without government influence, people need to really try their best to stop thinking the only way for change is through a massive violent revolution.

       Hear, hear. Things can change hard and fast, totally without violence. Actually, considering the relentless
       <em>
        increase
       </em>
       in pressure on people these days, most likely the next major revolution is going to be the exact opposite: a great, big sigh of relief. Hopefully, it's going to be more of an "awakening" than a "revolution".

       This next world will either be won by war or by peace. If by war, the only thing that will change is power. If it is won by peace, than us humans have accomplished something magnificant.

       The gay agenda, black civil rights, the berlin wall, and the acts of gandhi had no direct affect on labor cost, except in instances when labor became

       The falling of the Berlin wall, yes, you are correct. The "capitalists" were and remain against civil rights, gay rights, and most decidedly did not want a free India.

       How about the adoption of the internet as a revolution? Non-violent, global, fast, world changing...? Does it qualify or does a revolution require direct political representation?

       Black civil rights did have an effect on labor costs. As did women working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like As Upton Sinclair wrote in The Jungle:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The first family had been Germans. The families had all been of different nationalities–there had been a representative of several races that had displaced each other in the stockyards. Grandmother Majauszkiene had come to America with her son at a time when so far as she knew there was only one other Lithuanian family in the district; the workers had all been Germans then–skilled cattle butchers that the packers had brought from abroad to start the business. Afterward, as cheaper labor had come, these Germans had moved away. The next were the Irish–there had been six or eight years when Packingtown had been a regular Irish city. There were a few colonies of them still here, enough to run all the unions and the police force and get all the graft; but most of those who were working in the packing houses had gone away at the next drop in wages–after the big strike. The Bohemians had come then, and after them the Poles. People said that old man Durham himself was responsible for these immigrations; he had sworn that he would fix the people of Packingtown so that they would never again call a strike on him, and so he had sent his agents into every city and village in Europe to spread the tale of the chances of work and high wages at the stockyards. The people had come in hordes; and old Durham had squeezed them tighter and tighter, speeding them up and grinding them to pieces and sending for new ones.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Agents of northern factories came not just to Europe but to the American south, recruiting poor people, mostly blacks, to come north and work, and break the unions. At the time most unions did not accept black members so blacks were a great scab workforce.
      </p>
      <p>
       But capitalists do want more and more cheap labor to compete with more expensive union labor, usually white male union labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I consider a revolution to be a change in the form of government, to increase the number of people who have political rights. Which most of the things you describe were not.

       It speaks!  The american public for all their guns couldn't win a civil war between gov forces and citizens today so their best hope is to convince the lower end players in the government that they are serious and NEED to be listened to.  A violent uprising will just result in a lot of dead protestors.

       It is a pity that you cannot see social change unless it is violent or explosive. I think that is a result of your shortcoming, not a lack of non-violent change. The Pirate Party is a good example. Huge social change happening.

       Do you have any actual evidence of this "rise of the paid troll and government owned shitstirrers" on reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       E; Haha, alright! Let's downvote a reasonable request for evidence. This subreddit will definitely be improved by circlejerking over each other's claims instead of actually trying to figure out if there's an validity to them, so long as they fit with a conspiracy agenda.

       Globally, we are headed for a big conflict. We are over due from a time stand point. There are plenty of indicators of a powder keg ready to blow ... growing economic issues, massive fraud from banksters and politicians, high unemployment rates, rising commodity prices, austerity measures and blow back, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that intellect is the first casualty of war. When shit begins to come off the rails, the radical or extremes gain more followers. Watch the news and see Neo Nazis at Euro 2012, preachers gaining support for putting gays in cages, protests and clashes in the streets tagged as gangs of lazy troublemakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am amazed at the growing levels of group ignorance throughout the world. The vast majority of people do not understand or care about the nuances behind protests and many sitting in front of their TV would not mind seeing a few skulls cracked to regain "order". If you are a regular on this thread, you have probably been personally exposed to the squelching of healthy dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time to stand up for your beliefs; teach your children to stay rational and smart, "disobey" like Gandhi would, speak up, when you can. This fact must be mixed with the grim reality that in the current economic world climate, the monkeys are running the zoo, for now.

       Taking a stand in youth is easy. Frankly, you have nothing and therefore you have nothing to lose. This makes you more dangerous and effective to lead the charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with taking a stand when in your 40s or 50s is that you have economic needs to provide for a family. How smart is it if I get locked up for assaulting a cop, or getting labelled "crazy", alienating my "mainstream" clientele and tear apart my family in the process?
      </p>
      <p>
       This current situation &amp; time is just a battle; make no mistake, I am not condoning conceding the war. Do the math ... fighting mass collusion and corruption effectively requires momentum. We do not have "the numbers" for a fair fight, yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like it or not, being smart and seeing things for what they are is the best strategy if you have many "irons in the fire" of current society.

       The thing is.....if people keep this mindset we will

        never

       have the numbers you speak of. The movement will
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       gain momentum if it's comprised of people 40 and under.
       <strong>
        You
       </strong>
       hold more power in an OWS protest than my 27 year old body does. People see
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       down there, a 40+ with kids and a mortgage, they will see that it ain't just
       <strong>
        jobless hippies
       </strong>
       asking for a hand out. We need more metaphorical
       <strong>
        mirrors
       </strong>
       in OWS so people can see themselves in it and apart of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If America keeps seeing me down there, 27 year old dreadlocked white guy, they will find nothing in common and assume them and I are fighting for different things. They start seeing you and I, arms locked protesting the same thing, they
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       pay more attention.

       You, my friend, make a very good point and may be completely right about this. Frankly, I have given up hope on most of my country's society.

       I live in Canada and with few exceptions (Quebec protests, Canucks losing the Cup finals in 2011, etc.) my country's people tend to be docile. Perhaps that change needs to start with me.

       Even if you never go to a protest you can help. Just educate as many as possible. Keep posting and asking questions. People like myself understand the front lines aren't for everyone. We know we need people behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no family or kids so I'll be down there laying my life on the line for you and your family. We need you to be the normal guy that tells the rest of the world that us weirdos are fighting for good, not anarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can do this. Everyone is learning their roles. To be honest, you can do more from your computer than I can do on the streets. I've got faith in us, in people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I greatly appreciate the open mind. Remember every little thing helps. Just staying active on sites like this means more than you can believe. The more subscribers to this subreddit, as well as others, gives me so much hope. It's a sign that people are waking up and catching onto the bullshit they've been sold. I notice it and
       <strong>
        they
       </strong>
       notice it as well. And as you, sort of, said it's a numbers game and our side is starting to bring way more out of the gray and into the light.

       Politicians react to riots. At first, the reaction is simply to suppress more riots, but when enough of them happen (as they did in the late 1960s) changes begin to take place. I don't think quietly standing around in little fenced-off areas permitted by the police is quite going to do the trick. Such protesters are too easy to ignore.

       I'm inclined to agree with this part of your post. Whenever the people in power (who are not the politicians) think they can get away with a war, and profit from it, without too much blood splashing back on them in their cushy Manhatten penthouse apartments and Cape Cod beachfront mansions, they trigger a war. It changes the whole dynamic of a society, and gives them a fresh start to repeat their rapacious predations.

       They weren't "power tripping". They (FVAnon) were unwilling to explain or discuss why the rules were put in place despite blatant concerns relating to those rules. This isn't the best idea - especially not in the context of a group such as Anonymous which would obviously be opposed to baseless rules or laws. Furthermore, while a lot of these rules are disputably justified in order to protect r/anonymous from legal ramifications, this dialogue explaining
       <em>
        exactly why
       </em>
       was obviously needed.

       Why thank you very much for your wisdom. Unfortunately for people like me. It's too late. My big mouth has probably landed me on the watch list already. Even though my genealogy shows 37 (documented) of my ancestors fighting for New England Militias in the American Revolution, and knew what real patriotism is than the douchebags in Washington today.

       Hey NSA here.  Why do you think you warrant being on our watchlist?  Honestly if you think you do you are probably overestimating your worth in the grand picture.  I'll talk to my spook friends on Monday though to see if you should really be worried my guess is yes but not for the reasons you think.

       I'd like to add a side note. Yesterday I read that an Americans chances of being killed by a "terrorist act" are the same as them being killed by their own furniture. It seems true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the fear, and the fear-mongering are born out of TV and the internet for us today. For example. If a kid gets beaten by another kid in a school-bus in Oklahoma, it gets plastered all over national television giving the impression, and delivering the picture as if that phenomenon is "sweeping the nation". The images are often met with "Oh, my. People are
       <em>
        cray-zee
       </em>
       !" When in fact just that kid doing the beating in Oklahoma is quite crazy, and even then we don't know the back-story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another truth is that the vast majority of Americans are basically good, and non-violent people. Just walk out on your street and you'll find that your neighbours are not all shooting each other, setting fire to things, or fighting in the streets. Even in the worst neighbourhoods violence happens as a small slice of the day. Furthermore, people are basically good, people all over the world are basically good. It's the media telling you that people are "all crazy" that "the world is going insane".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were to watch youtube video after youtube video of violence from lets say Mexico or Afghanistan, it doesn't happen to people like that. It's not back to back like youtube videos, violence happens and then there is a lull (Battles in a war are an exception of course, and not a part of "everyday life".)

       I'm sorry to be devils advocate, but passiveness has been the government best friend. The entire new age movement, focus on non violent movements during history class, have been hugely successful for the powers that be. Although your post is of truth, as one should not agree to commit violence in a public forum, one should prepare for violence to be used against ones self. Protect yourself.

       So, you're encouraging all of us not to express our real opinions, out of fear that they will be used against us by the authorities? We should self-censor ourselves so that the government doesn't need to bother to make the effort to censor us? I don't think that's why we come here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is, the American government is the enemy of the American people. If Americans want the country to improve, they need to oppose the government. Those charged with enforcing the will of the government over the people, with regard to all the new anti-privacy and anti-freedom regulations that have spewed out of Washington over the past decade, are acting contrary to the Constitution and the rule of law. They must also be opposed.

       If you want to plan acts of violence go ahead but professing them on the internet first has zero benefits other than venting your rage in a stupid manner. It's either going to a) get you caught first, b) get you caught after or c) get you monitored and a case built against you for planning acts of violence / terrorism or d) maybe just maybe get you an accomplice where there's now double the risk, double the paper trail.

       That's where it goes. We are not allowed to express our real opinion unless those opinions are docile and non-violent, unless we do not rebel or encourage rebellion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "government" isn't the enemy. The government is made up of people like us, working slobs doing a job. It is the plutocracy who has gotten control of the government that is the enemy.

       The mods are so afraid of the population here that they are afraid to remove anything but blatant spam.  Even when they concede it has nothing to do with conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: sorry mods, not saying you are wrong for that position either as I've discussed with "ContheorySpiracist" just that the nature of the subreddit makes it very difficult to remove off topic posts without rants about censorship.  I think most of the mods are doing a great job for the position they are in.

       Agreed - and if what you say is true (which I wouldn't doubt all too much), I'm sure I'm pretty high up on their list of "terrorists to bust".

       You make a very, very valid point, but at the same time, we DO have to become more and more vigilant to fight against the system, because the system is not - repeat NOT - here to serve us/the 99%.

       Youre right on with everything except who they catch.  Every story ive heard from the FBI Domestic Terrorist entrapment sting has been muslims, except for the one bridge bombers story a couple of months ago, they were left wing radicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Id like to know if there is a way as a community we can find out who the government provocateurs are and out them.  Maybe we play along with potential terrorist for a bit until they cross the line, then turn THEM in.

       I am not so sure if peace IS the best weapon at all times. I just think we should be careful what we say and to whom we say it. Everyone has their own intentions and opinions and they are welcome to them. My goal is to insure that people are aware that there are those powers out there who would prey on people who they feel could be easily manipulated into doing something.

       FBI is more into entrapment than the CIA, the CIA are actually just well funded terrorists acting under the us flag...
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, violence is not the solution. Engaging in violence just justifies (in the eyes of lawmakers/police, those still slumbering, etc) many of the draconian policies being enacted recently. I think Gandhi had it right, and that is why he got shot...

       One of my life goals (that I'm never actually going to pursue) is to get picked for one of the FBI terror plots. I'll then go to the local cops and get a wire. Then when it comes time for the FBI to pull their little sting I'll arrange things so that the local cops are a few blocks away along the proposed travel route. The local cops will then bust the FBI agent provocateur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately there are a few things that will make this never happen.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        I'm not muslim.
       </li>
       <li>
        I'm not brown.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The current trend is that only people who fit one or both of the above categories can be targets of FBI terror plots.

Also, what makes you think they wouldn't coordinate with local enforcement?

       Another fatal flaw...

      <p>
       There's always the hope that someone is either incompetent or ambitious. Also there was that mosque a few years back that called the FBI on an FBI agent* who was trying to set up a terror plot.

       The problem here is that you're considering this subreddit a "family" and not a beacon for actual crazy people who aren't interested in evidence or facts. The kind of people who gravitate toward things with a "conspiracy" label are often assholes spewing nonsense, that's mislabeled as "misinformation" or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't some tight-knit group where important discussions are happening, it's an almost 60,000-person large group where links relating to "conspiracies" are aggregated and commented on. Nearly all "original discussion" here is just the same old tired bullshit, or gifs of fucking wtc 7 going down. Even the legitimate ideas get beaten to death and then traipsed around constantly to the point where anyone who participates in discussion is automatically lowered to the same "loony" status.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's any big, overarching conspiracy here, it's that it was so easy to group like-minded people in an area where any great ideas they actually have are lost immediately in the torrent of bullshit and sock puppets and ron paul haters/fanatics and what the fuck else ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are real places on the internet where real people can group together for real discussions on these kinds of things, but why would you expect anything but normal "conspiracy" and reddit bullshit in a conspiracy subreddit? And why would it need to be blamed on any larger conspiracy? This just lends credence to the whole "paranoid-tin-foil-motherfuckers" stereotype which makes it hard for true discussion on really, really fuckin' important things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any community that gets this large is automatically subject to the lowest common denominators. Infowars forums, anyone?

       No unorganized violence please. Other than acting as a trigger for the inception of a "true" police state, it becomes a gateway for Al-CIAdea false flag terrorism attacks around the country (this time putting the blame on 'domestic' terrorists). OUr best bet is to fight with our dollar, until hyperinflation a la Zimbabwe happens. At that point, once people will no longer be able to afford the basic neccesities of life, most will no longer fear death, and be ready to revolt. This is my firm belief why Big Ben hasn't actively engaged in QE3 and QE4, because of what hyperinflation may do to this country. Remember that there are something like 2 million registered gun owners in the state of Vermont(?) alone. Big Ben and his zionist puppet masters do not want a mass uprising. Especially that cock-sucking shill, Brzenski, who's main goal for the last ~70 years has been the implosion of Russia. And we all know why.

       Just for the record, even Gandhi never thought complete non-violence was the end-all, be-all of protest.

       I am not so sure if peace IS the best weapon at all times. I just think we should be careful what we say and to whom we say it. Everyone has their own intentions and opinions and they are welcome to them. My goal is to insure that people are aware that there are those powers out there who would prey on people who they feel could be easily manipulated into doing something.
