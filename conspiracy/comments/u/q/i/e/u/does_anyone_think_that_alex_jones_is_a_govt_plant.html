        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was watching one of the infowars films and in it they talk about how the FBI used a racist call in radio show as a way to investigate its listeners. In fact the host of the show was employed by the federal government, this according to the infowars film. Sometimes i listen to the Alex Jones how and I feel like its a way of bringing out the rabble rousers ect ect, as well as a method of discrediting political dissent by its sometimes outlandish claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be a big fan of his. Now...not so much as he is a bit &quot;over the top&quot; for my liking.</p>

<p>Made a point of watching all his documentaries, especially Obama Deception and the Police State films.</p>

<p>To be fair, even when watching some of his earlier stuff, especially pre 9/11, he has the same abrasive, confrontational and to be honest, unpleasant personality. If anyone has seen his film on Waco where he confronts the FBI agent they will know what I mean.</p>

<p>The last few videos of his I watched he seemed like an atypical mad man, the kind of guy who would walk around with a sandwich board with &quot;The End Of The World Is Nigh&quot; written on it.</p>

<p>Is he plant? No, I honestly believe he is not and he has his own agenda.</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that <em>he</em> believes in what he says no matter how outlandish it may seem even to the most ardent &quot;conspiracist&quot; and I think that over the last few years something specifically unerving or bizarre has happened to him for example that has sent him over the edge...for lack of a better way to put it. I don&#39;t know why I feel that I just get the impression that he is not the same Alex Jones I started to follow years ago.</p>

<p>As for disinformation, yes I believe that <em>could</em> be possible but not necessarily happening. He is more well known now than he was 5, 6 or 7 years ago and relatively mainstream. If he does have Government sources it&#39;s entirely possible that he&#39;s being fed things to make him seem like he&#39;s losing the plot and because, as I mention above, he believe in his cause so much, he will put it on his website etc. for all to see, maybe without confirming it&#39;s legitimacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but it&#39;s all a big show. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered <em>what</em> the protest was about, Jones would&#39;ve stormed in there with all the deafening gusto of a cat. 5 super buffoon.. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the guy <em>is</em> responsible for waking up A LOT of people (Including myself). Eventually though, is seems the truly intelligent/enlightened always end up distancing themselves from his venomous rhetoric, and doing their own research. He&#39;s almost.. a necessary evil.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked with him in the 90s for about a year as his Saturday night producer on KJFK. A lot of his information was good, but his conclusions were frequently damaged by leaps of illogic. For instance, when the military was renting out cities to practice urban warfare scenarios, that part was rock solid. Excellent reporting, good sources, and i was proud to contribute to that research  </p>

<p>The conclusion that this was a sign that FEMA camps were coming and posse comitatis was on the verge of being overturned was without foundation, and was frankly embarrassing. He subverts his good well researched data with insane conclusions delivered with such hyperbole and misplaced conviction that it destroys any credibility he may otherwise have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain to me exactly how many people have been held in FEMA detention centers that were converted from the slew of military bases cleared out in the early-mid 90s and you might have a point. Add to that point exactly how competent FEMA turned out to be during Katrina in 2005. </p>

<p>Facts seem to destroy any nihilistic hope you may cling to that FEMA and the government are an infallible organization that organizes detainment centers to store dissidents in all 50 states while simultaneously waging armed urban warfare with impunity in the streets since 1998. </p>

<p>Your fatal flaw is assuming that a bureaucracy can maintain utter and complete secrecy and inhuman levels of competency in a way that runs utterly counter to basic survival instinct and yet can still be somehow battled via talk radio and Ron Paul mixed with a potent gulp of tangy tangerine mixed with filtered tap water that magically removes the fluoridation that has clearly made our entire male population impotent since the 50s. Apparently we have doubled the US population in the last 40 years by sheer luck. Or maybe the cancer causing polio vaccines and sperm murdering fluoride aren&#39;t so effective after all. </p>

<p>Vaccines are now good for you? Didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p>and Flouride as well isn&#39;t harmful?</p>

<p>Geez, I must have been living in a fantasy land this entire time getting off to the fact that our food is bullshit, our water is bullshit, ocean pollution and GMOs are ACTUALLY better for society and that sterilization in Vaccinations doesn&#39;t even happen, no one in history has ever been sterilized by vaccinations or in general! What was I thinking!</p>

<p>oh and I will add that Yes Alex Jones is a Government CIA Operative plant who is trained by the CIA to control and keep tabs on the opposition of their grand master scheme they call the NWO! because uh uh if he wasn&#39;t, they would have killed him by now...yea. I LIKE MONEY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may notice that I said in an earlier comment that being a part of the research and broadcasting about urban warfare training while WORKING AS A PRODUCER ON ALEX JONES&#39; SHOW was a highpoint for me. Where was it used in the real world? Iraq, 3 years later. Urban warfare does not automatically mean warfare on US soil. There are cities everywhere. </p>

<p>&quot;I guess the United States has never put a group of people into camps before..&quot; </p>

<p>This is the fatal flaw with most conspiracy theorists. They think that there is an unending continuity of intent across multiple generations. That somehow internment of Japanese citizens and detention at Guantanamo are part of the same &quot;plan&quot; that was meticulously worked out well in advance of a constructed event to get the &quot;sheeple&quot; on the side of this suspension of a subset of societies liberty. To the detriment of logic, the human element of desire and unpredictability is removed and all events become part of a clockwork plan. </p>

<p>Most people can be fallible, most systems are flawed, individuals and groups act without fully comprehending consequences, and some people are sociopaths. What we are really poor at as a species is predicting all possible outcomes, planning for every contingency, and thinking of ourselves as bad people. Conspiracy thinking disallows new facts, the passage of time, and above all that things change. </p>

<p>New information comes up suggesting that meteorologists mis-predicted the climate trends for the last 15 year segment of time? They can&#39;t just be wrong, they must have planned it that way!</p>

<p>We aren&#39;t prescient or infallible. We&#39;re all just people, and we&#39;re always learning. Learning, being wrong, isn&#39;t a sign of conspiracy or ill intent, it is a sign that we are striving to better ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In his mind, he must be a martyr. That is the only mental state that can justify his personality of being either &quot;right&quot; or &quot;angry&quot;--never intrigued, contemplated, or pensive towards his discussions and interviews.  Of course, this is just the Alex Jones of the Alex Jones Show. His personal life and affect are not subject to this scrutiny.</p>

<p>I can also agree that he seems to be an &#39;agent&#39; (or just a misguided person), but of who remains a mystery. I don&#39;t know if there is even a trail to follow on him. The most input I can offer is empirical; his actions and rationale seem to exist as a justification for others to act as boorish and unrelenting toward people who simply wish either to be left alone or have their point heard. It is this justification that makes people with interest in purported conspiracies seem fringe. What he reports on isn&#39;t outlandish [if you look past loaded language and assumed reasons], but his attitude is.</p>

<p>As a side note, as much as I question Alex Jones, I&#39;d never trust him less than I do David Icke. David, even if he believes with every fiber that he is right, does not seem to offer whole truths. His approach is more Hegelian, and, luckily for him, there is such an absence of truth in this world that he can be heard without opposition.</p>

<p>Physically broke the law. There is a law on the book in which he broke. Although, we agree with what he did, he broke the law. It&#39;s easy to take him down.</p>

<p>Hasn&#39;t broken any laws, simply uses his 1st Amendment to say what he feels. Take him down, shed to much light, or can your brain not think outside of what you want to believe about Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Think about this. Alex tells you not to vaccinate your kids because the government (NWO, Illuminati, whatever) is poisoning children. Well why would they poison the children of blind, obedient parents? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to try and harm the children of dissenters, who are likely to become dissenters themselves by having them die of easily preventable illnesses?</p>

<p>The fact Alex tells parents not to vaccinate their children proves to me that he&#39;s a disinfo agent who does more harm, literally, than good.</p>

<p>To answer the question, yes, I absolutely believe that Alex Jones is somehow being used by the government. I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s a plant, a useful idiot, and/or just being used as an example to discredit conspiracy theorists, but in any case, I don&#39;t believe for a second that there aren&#39;t behind-the-scenes shenanigans surrounding him. He is too mainstream for the government not to take an interest in him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a cult of little personality. At best, he&#39;s an untalented fuck, a celebrity obsessed attention whore with a big microphone, at worst he&#39;s an over the top corporate plant designed to delegitimatize conversations about what is really going on - so that if any of the issues he talks about are ever discussed, you get shot down with &quot;oh you&#39;re one of those Alex Jones nutbags&quot;.</p>

<p>His website is pure conspiracy propaganda trash, which is a fucking shame if its legit because he causes far more harm than good and the original pieces he publishes are completely amature and an antithesis to the concept of legitimate journalism.</p>

<p>He could publish a story ignored by the media about any of the truly fucked up shit that is going on and being blacked out by the media - and despite not needing to embellish or pull &quot;facts&quot; out of his ass to expose the shocking and legitimate story, he&#39;d still make up a bunch of fairy tale bullshit about how they&#39;re satan worshipers and eat babies or some shit, and slip it into the story somehow.</p>

<p>He&#39;s just a tool. I wish he&#39;d shut the fuck up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones does a lot of harm; though I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a government plant, just a right-wing racist idiot.
His biggest misnomer is that the New World Order is socialistic, rather than capitalistic. Right, Alex, look at all the socialism spreading throughout the world. What I see is multinational corporations monopolizing power globally, backed by transnational institutions like the WTO, World Bank, IMF, etc. &quot;Globalism&quot; is obviously capitalist, and where there&#39;s resistance, like in Venezuela and Bolivia, where countries try to keep their resources and independence from the global banking/corporate apparatus, they&#39;re villified and assaulted by the international media, intelligence agencies, everything the firstw orld countries can throw at them. 
It&#39;s Orwellian double-speak to look at what&#39;s going on in the world with consolidation of economic power in the hands of the Fortune 500 and say that the political elites hate capitalism; the political elites <em>are</em> capitalism.
Also, Alex Jones is a racist thug. Is he also right about a lot of stuff? Yeah, sure, but that doesn&#39;t make him a net positive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. He&#39;s had way too big of a waking up effect. Someone like David Icke and Glenn Beck though are real disinformation agents.</p>

<p>I mean have you seen Glenn Beck cover the Bilderberg, FEMA camps, Bohemian grove, NDAA? </p>

<p>So no he is not a disinformation agent, he does not have the best sources and he is a red blooded Texan and that is why he comes off as he does.</p>

<p>Those who do not cover stuff or cover it, but spin it like its nothing and try to make fun of you for questioning stuff are disinformation agents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I checked multiple sources, but came to no solid conclusions (as is usual in matters of &#39;conspiracy&#39; that only seem to align). For the moment, I concede more research is needed. I saw a supposed class roster from from one of Alex&#39;s schools, among other documents, but these still PROVE nothing. I would like to believe from the nature of his routines that Bill Hicks would not intentionally deceive people, but it does not seem out of his humour either. After all, people only care about watching &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked with him in the 90s for about a year as his Saturday night producer on KJFK. A lot of his information was good, but his conclusions were frequently damaged by leaps of illogic. For instance, when the military was renting out cities to practice urban warfare scenarios, that part was rock solid. Excellent reporting, good sources, and i was proud to contribute to that research  </p>

<p>The conclusion that this was a sign that FEMA camps were coming and posse comitatis was on the verge of being overturned was without foundation, and was frankly embarrassing. He subverts his good well researched data with insane conclusions delivered with such hyperbole and misplaced conviction that it destroys any credibility he may otherwise have. </p>

<p>Edit: the man got to me with MK Ultra. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, and that&#39;s awesome! ...You should totally do an AMA (If you haven&#39;t already). There&#39;s a chance <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> might go ape-shit and throw karma-feces all over your hecticengine. If you know what I mean. -<em>Ahem</em>- Anyway, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a complete shill.. As you previously stated, good information is disseminated through his radio show, and InfoWars &quot;documentaries.&quot; However, you do have to pick through a lot of bullshit (Or as you so eloquently called it, &quot;hyperbole&quot;). That&#39;s why I said the more acute you are, the faster you&#39;ll take what you&#39;ve gleaned from Jones, and move towards more thoughtful/credible, less abrasive resources.</p>
