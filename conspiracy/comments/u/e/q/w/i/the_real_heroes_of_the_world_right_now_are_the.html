        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We hear nothing of it, like it doesn&#39;t even exist. The worst disaster in the history of mankind, still unfolding. Reports are inaccurate at best. How many workers have sacrificed their lives for this cause? How many more will die? How many people around the world will suffer because of it? Are they &quot;draining the damn&quot;?</p>

<p>Why did they put cooling pools 100 feet in the air?</p>

<p>Why did they dig out the hillside to be at sea level during construction? If it was for the purpose of not having to pump the water up the hill, then why didn&#39;t they simply build the entire plant at sea level, but behind an earthen mound? Tsunamis have historical context in Japan.</p>

<p>Why won&#39;t they allow non affiliates in to inspect the cooling pools?</p>

<p>I&#39;d really just like some accurate numbers on worker deaths at this point, sadly, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get those for decades...</p>

<p>This is a global problem, I don&#39;t think Japan can do it by it&#39;s self. Why haven&#39;t they at least entombed the reactors. Why haven&#39;t they started the process of removing the fuel rods? From the most recent photo&#39;s I&#39;ve seen, the pools are still filled with debris, and the wall of fuel pool 4 is bulging. They are still pumping thousands of gallons of contaminated water into the sea every day. THEY DON&#39;T HAVE AN ANSWER, at least, and at best, or, they are complicit in attempting to reduce and exterminate the majority of life on earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wish I didn&#39;t share your concerns.</p>

<p>If building 4 were to collapse, due to another quake ... <em>Fuck</em>. Nobody would be able to work on site (unless we invent some new lead spacesuits, recruit death-row inmates, etc).</p>

<p>As is, the buildings are leaking a lot of radioactive seawater &amp; steam every day. You just can&#39;t see the steam cause it&#39;s warm now. Was visible in the winter.</p>

<p>I agree the international effort needs to be HUGE.</p>

<p>1) New Seawall! A fucking big one.</p>

<p>2) Dry dam to contain radioactive seawater (though I suspect they wouldn&#39;t do this b/c it would further irradiate the work site, and they want to disperse it all in the Pacific). </p>

<p>Hopefully it&#39;s not as big of a threat as we think. But I&#39;ve had a bad feeling about this one from the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve felt the same way since the tsunami.  The Japanese are pretty self sufficient.  Maybe dangerously so, to the point they would not ask for help even if they needed it.</p>

<p>I have read stories that claim this disaster is even worse than Chernobyl.  If that is the case, then international attention is required if only because Japan is an
island nation and pumping tens of thousands of gallons of irradiated water back into the largest ocean on the planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now you just aren&#39;t making sense.  Do you even know what you are bitching about?  You mentioned that there is radiation freely flowing into, as you put it, &quot;the largest ocean on the planet.&quot;  Which I went on to point out that your astute observation was, in fact, mildly redundant, considering that all bodies of water are connected.</p>

<p>So it really doesn&#39;t matter what body of water that radiation is flowing into now does it, junior?  Also, calm down.  You&#39;re going to have a heart attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, I&#39;m good.  Healthy as an ox.  Trying really hard to keep you on topic, but I teach autistic children so I&#39;m used to this kind of thing.</p>

<p>The fallout from this disaster has immediately impacted the Pacific Ocean, the largest on the planet.  Why is this significant?  Simple.  You have Philippines, Micronesia, Polynesia, Melanesia, Australia, Taiwan, Japan and Indonesia.  Many of these places rely heavily on fishing for food.  All of these places are in the path of the currents (Kuroshio, North Equatorial, South Equatorial and Peru/Chilean) that could keep the irradiated water cycling around their shores for years.  The size of the Pacific Ocean (64 million sq/mi) and volume (620 million cu/km) affects the dilution of the irradiated water.  </p>

<p>Will contaminated water affect other oceans?  Yes.  Will it be anywhere near the levels that will be experienced by these islands, east coast of Asia, west coast of the Americas?  No.  As a result of dilution and cooling due to the MASSIVE size of the Pacific, the radiation levels would drop to &quot;acceptable&quot; levels by the time they hit the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Now, back on topic, if Japan refuses to reveal the true severity of their problem or if the world does not intervene/tries to cover up, the contaminating of the world&#39;s largest ocean will continue.  And by the time anything is done about it, it would be too late to save the millions of inhabitants of the immediately affected area and certainly too late to prevent excessive cross-contamination of the rest of the world&#39;s oceans and sea life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t talk about nuclear plants if you don&#39;t know anything about them. They are still trying to figure out away of recovering the spent fuel from the damaged pool above ground. The original crane is broken, so it&#39;s a big challenge, and will probably take at least another year or two. The only concern is if the pool collapses the spent fuel will be exposed, which wouldn&#39;t be very good. But even if that happened, the outcome would still not be as bad as Chernobyl, where the pressure vessel containing the reactor exploded and scattered radioactive material all over the place. </p>

<p>Tl;DR    best case scenario: nothing happens; worst case scenario: it&#39;s still not as bad as Chernobyl.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets sing the quote you facts and check your sources song! It goes a little something like this... <em>ahem- do re meeeee</em></p>

<p><a href="http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/03/deaths-per-twh-for-all-energy-sources.html">http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/03/deaths-per-twh-for-all-energy-sources.html</a></p>

<p>Coal is FAR more dangerous than nukes, in fact, wind power has four times the mortality rate. Rooftop solar energy has 11 times the mortality rate as nukes (because people fall off the roof while installing it.)</p>

<p>Deaths per trillion watt-hours:</p>

<p>Coal – world average 161 (26% of world energy, 50% of electricity)
Coal – China 278
Coal – USA 15
Oil 36 (36% of world energy)
Natural Gas 4 (21% of world energy)
Biofuel/Biomass 12
Peat 12
Solar (rooftop) 0.44 (less than 0.1% of world energy)
Wind 0.15 (less than 1% of world energy)
Hydro 0.10 (europe death rate, 2.2% of world energy)
Hydro - world including Banqiao) 1.4 (about 2500 TWh/yr and 171,000 Banqiao dead)
Nuclear 0.04 (5.9% of world energy) </p>

<p>BTW, It has also been theorized that emissions from a coal-fired power plant are more radioactive than emissions from a nuclear power plant generating the same amount of electricity.</p>

<p>Radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium exist as very small trace elements in coal, that occur naturally. But when the coal is burned, most pesky impurities like carbon are eliminated, effectively concentrating the remaining substances in the fly ash that results... and which come out the smokestacks into the air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t realize the extent of the cover-up. All mainstream media outlets are guilty of doing so. I get my information from industry experts like Arnie Gundersen.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. Another argument choc full of holes. First of all, your quoting an industry &quot;expert&quot; like Arnie Gundersen. I have viewed his evidence, and still I find some (not all, but SOME) of his finding are questionable at best. And Ill explain why, if perhaps it wont be discounted as more of the &quot;Great Conspiracy&quot;. According to Arnie Gundersen himself (interviewed by CNN USA&#39;s John King tonight, 6/7/11), filters on Geiger counters are too large to capture the miniscule sized &quot;hot particles&quot;, or &quot;fuel fleas&quot;, as Arnie says the nuclear industry calls them. So your data is likely inaccurate at best according your own experts, not mine. Next, the term &quot;hot particles&quot; has been thrown around alot, and while I realize this is a semantics issue, and I wish that Gunderson would step up be very clear about what they mean when the term is used. I would say that a naturally occurring uranium molecule blowing in the wind is a hot particle. I would say that radon in your lung is a hot particle. I would say that an inhaled Cs-137 molecule is a hot particle. How about a microscopic spec of americium? Yep, that&#39;s a &quot;hot particle&quot; too. They are by no means equal, but they are all &quot;hot&quot;. But just for argument sake, lets go with the conventional definition of a hot particle  as a [n alpha-emitting] particle that contains sufficient activity to deliver at least 1000 rem/yr to the surrounding lung tissue. For isotopes having half-lives greater than one year, this would correspond to particles containing at least 0.07 pCi of alpha activity.</p>

<p>Now let us consider your collection method, and Arnie&#39;s as well, is that the evidence he produces is dependent on a number of variables, few of which were tested with sufficient controls to be considered fact. The amount of radiation detected depends directly on how much area particles are collected from. If you wipe down twice as much area, you should see roughly twice as much signal. The amount of radon in the air would also be a factor, and that depends on the soil and rock content of the area, and the local weather conditions (temperature, pressure, rain). So tremendous variations can occur depending on how the wipe is done and what the exact local conditions are. There is no way those elevated activities are from Fukushima. Our air data, when combined with data from the CTBTO (<a href="http://www.ctbto.org/">http://www.ctbto.org/</a>) and others, show that radiation levels in the air are very low or undetectable worldwide. In fact, levels in North America were never anywhere near the typical outdoor activities of the radon decay products (≈5–15 Bq/m<sup>3</sup> = 0.5–1.5E-2 Bq/L). Compare this to our air data, where the peak one day total activity was still less than 1E-5 Bq/L. it matters how many particles are inhaled versus the radioactivity of those particles (i.e., decays per second). I should point out that we have a long, consistent set of measurements of radioactive fission products in our air filter measurements. And even on our single highest spike in air concentration (I-131, 4.3E-6 Bq/L, on 3/23-24), I estimate that one would only breathe in about 0.03 radioactive decays per day, or one every 35 days. Also, it turns out that about 50% of our exposure from natural radioactive sources is from the inhalation of radioactive particles. This is primarily due to the decay daughters of Radon-222, which create &quot;hot particles&quot; of radioactive Lead, Bismuth, and Polonium in the air. If your interested, a summary of the total breakdown of background exposure can be found by googling UNSCEAR 2000 Report Vol. I, Annex B: Exposures from natural radiation sources, primarily Table 31: Average worldwide exposure to natural radiation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s 10 x the background level of radioactive <em>cesium</em>, but the amount of radiation from that is trivial compared to the naturally-occurring potassium and polonium. And all of it together is still <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2012/05/30/153925233/nuclear-tuna-is-hot-news-but-not-because-its-going-to-make-you-sick">very low and safe to eat</a>.

<p>Tuna is <em>always</em> radioactive. So is every other kind of food.</p>

<p>There is information about your everyday exposure to radiation, including a small selection foods, here: <a href="http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm">http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm</a></p>

<p>You mean they&#39;re &quot;obviously biased&quot; because they don&#39;t agree with you? I don&#39;t know who you mean by their sponsors. Tokyo Electric? The tuna industry?</p>

<p>Well, there&#39;s a little truth to what you say. It&#39;s like driving from New York to Philadelphia, then deciding it&#39;s too dangerous to drive the extra block to your grandmother&#39;s house because any amount of driving is dangerous.</p>

<p>How are you going to avoid starvation if you avoid all radioactive food?</p>

<p>You might want to take a few classes to help you judge the reliability of sources and help put things in perspective. You could find out what a picocurie, a gray, and a millisievert are. You could take a statistics class and learn how you expect to get different answers about the cancer rate is, depending on your method of gathering data.</p>
