    <div class="md"><p>There are much better videos about the atrocities perpetrated against the Palestinian people.  </p>

<p>The problem is, the people of the US are so pro-jewish and brain washed by a filtered, manipulated media they are unable to open their eyes to evidence and facts.  </p>

<p>If you try even a little bit to take the side of Palestine, inherently you are against Israel, against Israel = anti-semite, anti-semite = Nazi.  </p>

<p>Nazi = you should never be taken seriously, everything you say is false, no need to review any evidence or facts, you should be tarred, feathered, and never allowed to reproduce.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that is the mindset I have encountered with the majority of Americans.  I blame the US government.    </p>

<p>I blame both . . . but yes.  I personally blame the user even more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel =! Jewish.  It&#39;s not that people are pro-Jewish, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with being pro-Jewish, unless of course, you are an antisemite, it&#39;s that people are so pro-Israel.  I know a lot of Israelis and I&#39;ve had discussions with them about the atrocities in Palestine and it&#39;s really difficult because they have been so indoctrinated to believe that these people would murder Israeli babies in their sleep if given the slightest chance that they think it&#39;s justified, or they refuse to believe it.  The Israeli anti-Arab propaganda machine is just too damn effective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As recently as 2 years ago, I might have agreed with you, but after studying Judaism and all the crimes committed by the Jewish people over the last few thousand years, I have come to the conclusion that there is something wrong with Judaism itself.  It is the most racist and psychopathic ideology on the planet.</p>

<p>If you read the Talmud, it has a lot of rules where it says treat Jews one way, and treat non-Jews in another (fucked up) way.</p>

<p>People often criticize me here for going after Jews rather than Zionists, but the treachery goes back thousands of years long before Zionism ever existed.  Those who criticize me probably mean well, but I mean well, too.  I&#39;m trying to be accurate.  Of the 109 Jewish expulsions, only about 4 of them happened while Zionism existed.  The rest cannot be blamed on anything but the practice of Judaism.</p>

However I don&#39;t think it is all jews as I know many good jewish people who don&#39;t agree at all with what Israel or zionism is about, it might be worth to note though that they are non-practicing &quot;jews by heritage&quot; and the few orthodox jews I&#39;ve came across did have an air of arrogance and &quot;fuck you im better than you&quot; attitude about them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you name another Prime Minister, or leader of any country that has called a <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BaMLlnb_KI">joint session of congress</a> and received greetings by</strong> both sides of congress with open arms and cheers throughout the speech <strong>from both sides of congress in unison?</strong></p>

<p>The president of the united States does not enjoy such a royal welcome, but most certainly the most powerful fucking city in the nation with the most powerful players in the nation at hand are NOT &quot;NYC, Florida&quot; or LA; so you are <strong>wrong about that.</strong>  It is the s the governing body, the body that controls everything around you and it is pro-Israel.  You better fucking believe they are.  And they control the information you receive.     </p>

<p>It is the governing body of this fucking country and they stand in unison when the Prime Minister of Israel calls them to listen to his rhetoric, and speaks nefore them.  </p>

<p>Obama speaks at a joint session and you have one side of the <a href="http://www.mofopolitics.com/2009/09/09/video-obama-called-liar-in-front-of-joint-session-of-congress/">aisle calling him a liar.</a>  </p>
