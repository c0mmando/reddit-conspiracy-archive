       Hello
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit seems like a platform which can bring non-mainstream news to the masses. However, it does this through the same mechanism which has been in operation since the turn of the 19th century. Individual stories, which give you a glimpse into the inner workings of the machine, but which taken in isolation, never give you the full picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to get 'the full picture' is to basically do a full time research mission to get to the bottom of it. Noam Chomsky has documented this extensively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for example
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/uhj7j/western_banks_reaping_billions_from_colombian/">
        this story
       </a>
       about how western banks are profiting from the illegal drugs trade. It's one story, like a jewel in a sand of irrelevance. It sits amongst the worldnews subreddit, another taxidermy which separates out reality into a number of smaller and smaller 'disconnected' realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would be useful, would be a way to crowd source 'the bigger picture' with each new piece of information bringing an increasing clarity to the 'image' it develops. I don't know how this data would be visualised or how it might work, but my gut feeling is that the application would be more visual, more interactive, looking more like a network which can be clicked, explored, and added to.
      </p>
      <p>
       News that is here today, connected to nothing, and gone tomorrow is creating the illusion of non-collusion. We need to begin creating an interactive spiders web of how everything is connected, how the inter-relationships play out, and to keep this web alive, so it constantly grows and becomes easier and easier to understand. It needs to be alive and malleable as reddit, but less news focused and more 'big picture' focused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone understand what I'm getting at?

       Yes, I understand what you are getting at.  I am an average person, of average intelligence and it has taken YEARS of sifting through books/blogs/newspapers/internets to reach a similar conclusion.  Most people of my socioeconomic setting simply cannot relate to this information, and will never take the time to do this kind of research.  They are too busy just trying raise families and survive.

       You should stop being so anti-semitic. The Jewish people are victims of persecution for a long time. They're not trying to take over the world. You have been misled by the Nazi's and they have been demoralized to an extent that it's very hard to become normal again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what you think, i feel bad, i am racist. But the solution is very simple. You need to go to a psychiatrist and stop coming here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jewish people are just trying to survive. It's not a conspiracy why they're so successful. They are just trying to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest watching mainstream news and stop coming to this place. It's filled with communist propaganda and misdirection. People actually think there's a cabal trying to take over the world.

       I understand what you are talking about, and hope someone smarter than I am can implement something like this. I had read that a function of greater intelligence is the ability to make more connections between seemingly disparate data. A way of crowd-sourcing the connections would be a great tool to help those of us with less than genius intellects ALSO see the connections.

       Sounds like you're describing wikipedia. It goes without saying that the model has already proven itself to be anything but incorruptible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, if you want a more effective research mission as you call it, you'll need it to exist mostly in the meat space and rely heavily on legwork: Loose affiliations of individuals who gather and condense info into workable anthologies that are then released onto the internet. In other words, a well organized, intelligent, grass roots and autonomous press force.

       Reddit isn't the place to pull that off.

       I think you are correct. It's not so much a closed group as it is about getting together people with a common goal. Couldn't we start with freemind or something like that?

       I had to look up freemind. No reason why it shouldn't work. Keep your groups tight, adaptive, small, and focused. Get a good editor. Make sure everyone is smart and capable of poring over reams of printed text. Most of all, remind everyone that a goal-oriented project can't allow itself to be sidetracked by pop-up interests. Good luck.

       Seems like a really good idea. Simple news stories, even if groundbreaking, still don't pack a good punch. I'd say post this idea to other forums and websites and push this idea out there. I especially like the idea having a sort of anti-establishment tone to it as well.

       I'm more concerned about how the info stream is
       <em>
        managed
       </em>
       than how it is connected.  As one example that I'm fond of retelling... after 2008 the Obama administration took to the internet to silence the liberal base.  (The same people who had just worked so hard to get him elected, yeah.)
      </p>
      <p>
       They took over Democratic Underground, created "pseudo-admin" accounts that deleted whatever criticism they could not shout down, and banned users who they could not silence with simple deletions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there was reddit.
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       reaches the front page of 1M accounts, and any criticism from the base was likely to gather steam.  So
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       was taken over and the spam filter was turned up to 11.  It no longer bore any resemblance to a real "subreddit" if you know how it works, but to the outside world it looks like a big, REPRESENTATIVE stream of political "facts."
      </p>
      <p>
       The level of propaganda and media control in America has become very serious since 2008 (or maybe I'm just noticing it now), and it is disturbing as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       So OP, to collect this "lost" information, the real problem is that it is being
       <em>
        intentionally
       </em>
       buried.  You'd be fighting city hall to get it out in the light.
