    <div class="md"><p>As in exactly as planned you mean?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been slow creeping to system meltdown for years.  The global depression that started in 2007 never lifted much and is taking a more severe downturn now.  All western nations have unemployment substantially over 10%, many in the low 20s, with the 30s depression era being only high 20s.</p>

<p>Really this whole process started with the assassination of JFK and the decision by global elites to renege on the post-WW2 allied agreement that in return for the dollar being made reserve currency the USA would back global investments in infrastructure, industry, and education.  It started and stopped in spurts for the first 10-15 years after WW2, but JFK&#39;s death ushered in the end of all of that and the 50 year slow creep to an economy that produces only plastic trinkets and paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I am going to disagree with you (with respect). Greece was not a test at all, that began in Argentina. People forget about Argentina...</p>

<p>They already know just how far to go and are doing it... and the Greeks are acting pretty well like they thought you would. A bit of riots, starvation, pensions gone, suicides... etc.. but nothing that was really unexpected. They got exactly what they wanted.</p>

<p>The bonus was that Greece was an easy target. The politicians were easy to buy off, Greeks were labelled as tax-evading , lazy so and so&#39;s and so they &quot;deserve&quot; what happens when you don&#39;t work to age 85, at least 16 hours a day... </p>

<p>You should look up odious debt if you have some time and see if any of the concepts of that might (they will) apply to Greece today...</p>

<p>Funny, the US used that to clear out Iraqs debt, why not the Greeks, and the Spanish, and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>I feel damn bad for anyone caught up in this, whats happening in Greece is a first step for the rest of us.... just watch and see.</p>

<p>I was actually mentioning the fact that the Greek people had been mislabeled as lazy and self-indulgent. And that many people here in the West felt that since the Greek people did not work so hard and so long as people in the west... they deserve this &quot;austerity&quot; fate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But it didn&#39;t start with Greece. They have been pulling the same thing on other countries for decades. They get the same response down to riots. They expect them. But they don&#39;t care. Until we rise up and kill these bastards it will not stop. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each nation&#39;s economy is individually analyzed, then, says Stiglitz, the Bank hands every minister the same exact four-step program.</p>

<p>Step One is Privatization</p>

<p>After briberization, Step Two of the IMF/World Bank one-size-fits-all rescue-your-economy plan is &#39;Capital Market Liberalization.&#39; In theory, capital market deregulation allows investment capital to flow in and out. Unfortunately, as in Indonesia and Brazil, the money simply flowed out and out. Stiglitz calls this the &quot;Hot Money&quot; cycle. Cash comes in for speculation in real estate and currency, then flees at the first whiff of trouble. A nation&#39;s reserves can drain in days, hours. And when that happens, to seduce speculators into returning a nation&#39;s own capital funds, the IMF demands these nations raise interest rates to 30%, 50% and 80%.</p>

<p>At this point, the IMF drags the gasping nation to Step Three: Market-Based Pricing, a fancy term for raising prices on food, water and cooking gas. This leads, predictably, to Step-Three-and-a-Half: what Stiglitz calls, &quot;The IMF riot.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The IMF riot is painfully predictable. When a nation is, &quot;down and out, [the IMF] takes advantage and squeezes the last pound of blood out of them.</strong> They turn up the heat until, finally, the whole cauldron blows up,&quot; as when the IMF eliminated food and fuel subsidies for the poor in Indonesia in 1998. Indonesia exploded into riots, but there are other examples - the Bolivian riots over water prices last year and this February, the riots in Ecuador over the rise in cooking gas prices imposed by the World Bank. You&#39;d almost get the impression that the riot is written into the plan. </p>

<p>Now we arrive at Step Four of what the IMF and World Bank call their &quot;poverty reduction strategy&quot;: Free Trade. This is free trade by the rules of the World Trade Organization and World Bank, Stiglitz the insider likens free trade WTO-style to the Opium Wars. &quot;That too was about opening markets,&quot; he said. As in the 19th century, Europeans and Americans today are kicking down the barriers to sales in Asia, Latin American and Africa, while barricading our own markets against Third World agriculture. <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/the-globalizer-who-came-in-from-the-cold/">http://www.gregpalast.com/the-globalizer-who-came-in-from-the-cold/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this is deliberate. Now it is in Europe it will be in the US soon. Old Americans will be starving in the street. And until we kill the plutocracy we cannot stop their evil actions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not for the time being, unless there&#39;s another really bad external shock. If Greece leaves while Spain and Portugal are on the brink (that&#39;s another good thread topic, how Portugal&#39;s situation is the US&#39;s revenge for their drug policies) then it will trigger capital flight from those countries and make the situation 50x worse. And with the ECB and the like having mitigated many of their positions vulnerable to Greek exit, but not Spanish/Portugese/Czech exit, TPTB don&#39;t want this at the moment. Maybe in the next few months, unless it&#39;s out of their control- which could be the case.</p>

<p>IMO Spain is more fucked than Greece. I think that in the end, one Eurozone doesn&#39;t really have a future. Maybe multiple countries sharing currencies like an expanded NEWNEY system or something.</p>
