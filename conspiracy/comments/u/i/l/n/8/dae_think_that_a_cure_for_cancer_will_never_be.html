    <div class="md"><p>No, first up cancer isn&#39;t one thing that you can cure.  It is hundreds possibly thousands of different things.  Some of them have already been cured and we&#39;re finding new cures every day.</p>

<p>You&#39;re understanding of the economy by your first sentence is quite poor.  Any company that found a cure for one of the bigger problem cancers would make a fortune off of it.  Much more than just therapies since they would have the entire market where with therapies they are often split amongst a number of different possibilities. </p>

<p>The speculated cancer therapies are mostly being pushed by snake oil salesmen trying to profit off the suffering of others.  The reasons they aren&#39;t allowed for sale generally is that they haven&#39;t undergone any real scientific testing of effectiveness or safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there were reports recently of an effective treatment for a few types of cancer that was a drug that could not be patented and therefore no company was willing to manufacture it, and when the testing had shown its efficacy the last remaining manufacturer of it shut down production.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was shown to be effective on specific types of cancers in petri dishes.  Lots of things do that but don&#39;t scale up.  The reason it&#39;s not being sold(it is actually just for different uses) is that no one is willing to spend the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars required to test it on actual humans and get it approved for us as a cancer treatment.  This isn&#39;t big pharma being evil, this is people expecting them to spend hundreds of millions of getting something approved that their competitors could turn around and sell without that cost.  You want someone to blame, blame the cancer charities for not paying for the testing.  Not big pharma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My dad was diagnosed with cancer about 5 years ago.  He didn&#39;t want to go with the standard cancer treatment because of the side effects, so he tried various alternative cures.  Finally, he took vitamin B17 in the form of apricot seeds and his PSA values started  to go down.</p>

<p>I just talked to him and asked him whether he was eating his seeds, he said he had stopped and was in good health.  He and my mom now believe that cancer can be cured or prevented by keeping blood pH above a certain level by eating plenty of vegetables.</p>

<p>In any case, he continues to be alive and healthy and has never had any kind of chemo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the whole diet and exercise thing.  First, when dealing with nutritional protocols there&#39;s a dearth of privately conducted studies that show anecdotal evidence of being helpful.  Unfortunately, most of these are conducted in journals that are not associated with the medical community. In fact, most of the research is done in Asia.  </p>

<p>This is incredibly unfortunate like OP says because some of the studies do demonstrate promise without the use of drugs or radiation--i.e. nutritional protocols.  Unfortunately, nutrition loses all legitimacy in the US because 1) such protocols can rarely be patented and 2) the testing protocols used for drugs costs millions of dollars that frankly cannot be financed normally.  </p>

<p>I know from personal experience that someone can be &quot;cured&quot; of a disease such as cancer using only nutrition and exercise--an orthomolecular approach. I don&#39;t really have the research at my disposal because the above things were told to me by the person who cured himself.  That said, I find it humorous that people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are upholding &quot;science&quot; like it&#39;s some holy bastion of integrity and that only what &quot;scientific testing&quot; done to the tune of millions of dollars can be taken as sacrosanct knowledge.

<p>It&#39;s not a holy bastion of an integrity nor is it sacrosanct knowledge. But having something published in a peer-reviewed journal usually (<em>usually</em>) means that the standard of evidence being presented is higher than anecdote. Ergo, it is a more reliable method to share findings. And when you&#39;re dealing with a medicine or a treatment, properly conducted trials are necessary.</p>

<p>If you plug &#39;orthomolecular cancer treatment&#39; into a journal database you will see there is ongoing research in that area.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely they can cure almost all the major big diseases. Drug companies buy the patents all the time and sit on the research all in the name of profit for drugs to treat symptoms.</p>

<p>For crying out loud we have fracking Elementary kids taking DNA out of cells and replacing them with computer generated DNA off the internet in backyard synthetic biology community class rooms as a hobby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the way i see it, the &quot;cure&quot; for every non-trauma based illness is diet and exercise.  unfortunately, most people seem to want to be able to take a pill that will allow them to get better while continuing to do what got them ill in the first place.</p>

<p>i nearly died a few years ago, probably due to drug abuse and a generally unhealthy lifestyle.  being uninsured, i was unable to find any doctor that was even willing to run any tests.  at first i felt cheated, like it was a bad thing that i was unable to rely on the &quot;experts&quot;, but that was before i realized how great of an opportunity i was being presented with.  i&#39;ve been given a second chance; a chance to heal myself and be an example for others to do the same.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t have all the answers, hell i&#39;m not sure that i have any answers; but what seems to be working for me is a combination of paleo and carb back-loading.  by paleo i don&#39;t just mean grass-fed beef, pastured poultry and wild caught fish; i believe fermented foods are also a very important aspect of the paleo diet...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like you&#39;re pretty young. I suspect you&#39;ll have a different view when you get older - not that many people in their 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s get non-trauma based illness.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying may very well be true for you, right now, but it&#39;s certainly not true for everyone, everywhere. </p>

<p>A friend of mine in school (he was 20-30 years older than I was) was married to a woman who developed breast cancer. They didn&#39;t have very much money and were generally hippie types who lived in a rustic setting and thought drug companies were evil and they decided to treat her breast cancer by drinking a lot of some kind of fermented mushroom tea. She died, and it was very sad. I still wonder if she could have lived longer if they hadn&#39;t gotten sucked into the whole &quot;medicine is an evil scam&quot; meme. The &quot;diet and exercise&quot; thing sure didn&#39;t cure her cancer, even though they tried as hard as they could. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since we&#39;re discussing anecdotes, my grandmother did the standard chemo/radiation wtfever and still died.  I still wonder if she could have lived longer if she hadn&#39;t gotten sucked into the whole &quot;keep doing what you&#39;re doing, but add chemo and/or radiation&quot; meme...</p>

<p>Are you making the claim that relying on &quot;experts&quot; is better for your health than diet and exercise?  If so, what are you basing this claim upon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see a reason to choose between proven treatments and diet and exercise. I think that relying on experts is better than relying on snake oil salespeople and people who think they can make cancer disappear (or not appear) by thinking nice thoughts. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that traditional Western medicine is all that great - but I think it works better than a lot of the sentimental/mythological garbage that floats around as &quot;alternative&quot; treatment. </p>

<p>I also think that pharmaceutical companies are run by businesspeople who like to make money - just like people who sell marijuana-based or other &quot;organic&quot; cancer cures. </p>

<p>The standard cancer treatments aren&#39;t typically presented (by responsible people, anyway) as miracle cures - some people who are diagnosed with less invasive, less aggressive, cancers in areas of the body that are easier to treat (or remove) are &quot;cured&quot;. A lot of people can&#39;t be cured, but the chemo/radiation treatments can slow the progression of the cancer.</p>

<p>If someone told your grandmother that if she did chemo/radiation that she&#39;d be guaranteed a cure, I&#39;m sorry. That wasn&#39;t true and she shouldn&#39;t have been told that. My impression is that the &quot;experts&quot; are a hell of a lot more careful about discussing the risks/benefits of various treatments than the average &quot;alternative&quot; provider. I think it&#39;d be great if some alternative practitioners would do serious clinical studies about their treatments.</p>
