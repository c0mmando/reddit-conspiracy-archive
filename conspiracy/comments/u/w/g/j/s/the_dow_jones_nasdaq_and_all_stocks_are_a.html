       You are right, but this is not a conspiracy, even the wall street journal I think or maybe it was the huffpost wrote that 80% of the trades are done by computers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact wall street itself was started as a ponzi-scheme, but instead of the criminals facing trials and being put in jail for the scam, it got "regulated" by the government and continued to operate.

       A lot of the trades are done by computers.  That doesn't however follow with what hes saying.  Since those computers trades do affect the markets.

       How do you get that it was started as a ponzi scheme?

       I use to work with quants occasionally back when I did datawarehousing at MS.  HFC is nothing new, nor does it have anything to do with what the op posted.  It's actually the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans aren't involved in HFC but thats one specific type of trading.  There are lots of other types that humans are involved in.

       If you think of the stock market as a completely government controlled ponzi scheme, where the government knows what the future of that computer program will look like, it explains a lot.  They can craft large events around future drops and increases to make it look like the market is legit.  At some point in the future the market will be gone, because that is the fail safe, the government decided it had X number of years to defeat the soviet union, otherwise war would be necessary and in that case the market would be destroyed anyway.  The economic 'strife' while we purchase billion dollar stealth warships is a STORY crafted to justify market moves.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was simply a future market drop that had to be justified by an event.  Think:  if the market dropped 3000 points in two months in september of 2001 and October 2001, for no reason, what would people do?  Lose complete confidence and question the bigger than madoff ponzi scheme that is the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing in 2008, if that drop occurred without the banks being blamed and the 'economic meltdown story', people would question why the market lost more than 1/2 its value for no reason.  Then the ponzi scheme would be discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people behind the market ponzi scheme are the people behind 9/11 and every other disaster in the past, and in the future. Because if you know what the market is going to do because you wrote the program that it follows, you can be infinitely rich, and at that point who cares about freedom or saftey or anybody...
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, it makes sense, the same way madoff couldn't turn off his ponzi scheme, the US Government can't turn off the market that is a complete fraud, and they are slaves to the future moves that they can't stop because the ups and downs are prewritten in case wars with the soviet union were necessary in this century, which they so far haven't been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you understand why prominent people stopped flying before 9/11, or didn't show up for work that day, or left the building before the planes hit for a 'dentist appointment', they knew something was going to happen, maybe they didn't know exactly what... but if you knew the market would drop 2000 points tomorrow for no foreseable reason, you would suspect a disaster of some sort that you dont' want to be part of.  Knowing the future of the fake stock market computer program keeps these people not only rich but safe, and those in charge of creating the events that 'justify' to the sleepy public these drops in share prices morally justify to themselves that keeping a fake market going is better than keeping no market at all and telling that truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if Obama came out and said, "hey the market is a fake" or somebody trying to tell this truth about why 9/11 happened, they'd be ostracized and criticized and smeared before the words left five feet from their lips.  As long as everyone believes that the market is real then its OK, but the market has an end and that is why all the saftey measures are being put in place so the NEW MARKET that is actually real can be restarted once this fake one ends at zero.  And don't worry, there will be a really good story on reuters, yahoo and on CNBC as to 'why' it happened, but it was inevitable because it was predetermined 40 years ago when the US decided to take all action necessary to defeat the soviet union.

       It's run by Manoj Narang and a small group of mathematicians and scientists called "quants," which is short for quantitative analysts. Their high speed computers trade 40 million shares every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asked if humans are ever involved in the trading, Narang told correspondent Steve Kroft, "Humans are not involved in the trading because humans are way too slow to trade on the kinds of opportunities that we're trying to capture. We're trying to capture opportunities that exist for only fractions of a second."

       What makes this a good post?  It has nothing to back it up except an idea from someone who has clearly never worked in the financial industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of prominent people in the financial industry died on 9/11 as well as other industries.
