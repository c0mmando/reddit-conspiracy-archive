When i asked him about the unexpected visit he said that he couldn&#39;t go home, because a large group of police officers had blocked all the roads to this particular neighborhood and were going door-to-door trying to round up people with warrants.  </p>

<p>Is this a thing that can be done in America?  he said that they have done it for about 3 days counting the one he came over to my house.  he said he was at home for it one time, but didn&#39;t answer  his door when he heard someone banging on it.  also, from what he has learned from residents that have been there a few years, this isn&#39;t the first time it has happened.  what are your thoughts on this and what it might mean for the future police state.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Will you join a mob, walking towards your local city hall with pitchforks and torches, if they passed you on the street? Are you prepared to die for other people&#39;s freedom?</p>

<p>We need the <strong>entire</strong> nation to strike. Not just some occupy people. But this will not happen until blood is spilled. The public is obviously desensitized to pepper spray and rubber bullets. They need it in their face, right in their quiet little neighborhoods. <strong>Stop protesting wall street and protest the other Americans not doing anything about it</strong>. The sheeple need to be converted. If they will not join they will be used against us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think an angry mob and a group of protesters with witty signs are equally easy to hit.  actually, the mob would probably take fewer casualties as they will actually be fighting back.  if we caught them before they are allowed to use real weapons we could get where we needed to be.  the only thing peaceful protesting is doing is letting them take our liberties without any bloodshed on their end.  it isn&#39;t like protesters aren&#39;t being beaten/tazed/pepper sprayed  already.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  But in this age of communication via the web, we can do incredible damage to the corporations by following the money.  I have been doing a lot of research about how Cuba operates. I am against Gitmo and a boycotting Cuban exports is a step in the right direction.  Imagine even ten years ago this info was not readily available.   I feel for OWS and the like, but i think they see that hanging out in groups is their only option.  Divide and conquer can be used against the police as well imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not entirely. I didn&#39;t explain myself in the greatest manner.</p>

<p>I think people aren&#39;t going to pay attention to it until people are being killed. Everything that I&#39;ve seen about OWS is that it&#39;s looked at like a nuisance. The alleged &quot;innocent&quot; you speak of need to join a side. They <strong>will</strong> be used against us in the sense that the patriots of this upcoming civil war will be viewed as &quot;terrorists&quot; and these &quot;innocents&quot; will be offered food, money, shelter, medicine or whatever for turning in the very people trying to free them from monetary slavery.</p>

<p>Now on to protesting the &quot;innocents&quot;. I&#39;m not saying move into neighborhoods and protest. Start with the people working for the government and banks. Educate them on the slavery they are in, and assisting. Protest the police that are &quot;just doing their jobs&quot;. <strong>Basically stop protesting the rich elite and protest the ignorant fools that the rich elite control</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s a simply terrible idea.</p>

<p>First, you just have no idea when you walk into a neighborhood whether people there are doing anything about it or not.</p>

<p>Second, the people who aren&#39;t doing anything, aren&#39;t doing it because they have been systematically lied to by the people in charge, telling them that change is impossible, and that the people advocating change are dangerous.</p>

<p>By demonstrating against the great mass of Americans, most of whom have done nothing wrong and are just hapless pawns of a huge system, you&#39;re alienating exactly the people who would naturally be on your side if you educated them.</p>

<p>You are wrong.  In the US, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Fourth Amendment</a> still exists - the police are <em>breaking this rule</em> in order to conduct these searches, and it&#39;s fairly likely that even in the corrupt legal system of today these searches would not withstand a legal challenge.</p>

<p>By telling us that these rules don&#39;t exist any more, you&#39;re buying into their lies.  Perhaps it is true that, &quot;It is currently this bad in America, and it will get worse,&quot; but claiming, &quot;There are no actual &quot;rules&quot;&quot; is equivalent to saying, &quot;And there is nothing you can do about it&quot; - the worst possible thing to be saying at this moment of crisis.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying that the police in the United States will defect to the side of the people and stop obeying orders from their superiors?</p>

<p>It&#39;s conceivable this might happen occasionally.  It seems highly unlikely that anything beyond a small minority would do it.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t really help your argument, either...</p>

<p>There <em>are</em> still rules.  Courts <em>are</em> still an option.

<p>You sir are quite hilarious. Distasteful? You&#39;re serious? What the very same military establishment does to citizens of other countries should be found distasteful. </p>

<p>The militant OWS crowd won&#39;t be using depleted Uranium. They won&#39;t be killing women and children. They won&#39;t be destroying villages from 1000 miles away with Tomahawk missiles. They will be fighting for my freedom as well as your own.</p>

<p>Do you truely believe this? If so then why hasn&#39;t a court taken Bush, Cheney and their cronies for war crimes? Where is the Judicial Branch? I&#39;ll tell you. It&#39;s in the pockets of fortune 500 companies. The day our government let 9-11 go unpunished was the day all of your thinking should have gone out the window. The rules have changed and the sooner you wake up to the fact, that <strong>they</strong> don&#39;t care about the rules, the better off you&#39;ll be.</p>

<p>Edit: Please tell me you truely believe our military are such machines they will kill their own citizens. I&#39;ll understand if you meant National Guard or DHS but the military as a whole give a fuck about Americans and will not be used against us. The government knows this and I know this. </p>

<p>Edit 2: We&#39;re dealing with people that truely believe that they are above the laws that have been created by man. They view themselves as deities. This is not something that cannot be fought with intellectual conversation. The people that run this world view every human life as expendable pawns that are only here for them to use to attain goals by any means necessary.</p>

<p>We are animals. Fight or flight instincts kick in when there is no where else to hide. What does an animal do when backed into a corner? Their thoughts become irrational and they fight for escape to freedom even if it costs them bodily harm or death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago I worked at a warehouse which was in a town of less than a thousand. Most of the town was farmland or industrial. The local cops would often go through the parking lot midshift, running plates, then wait for those with warrants outside at the end of the day.

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much. In a town that small all they get is speeders, trucks taking the wrong routes, and the ocassional teenage mischief. Seeing as industrial work and manual labor is rather common for ex-cons, they have to go hunting. The property owner obviously wasn&#39;t happy, as they were stealing good labor. Hence the cease and desist order. Even the cops can be charged with trespassing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is how it was explained to me.  There where police officers setting up road blocks around a particularly ghetto neighborhood.  everyone who left or entered the neighborhood where questioned by these cops and where checked for warrants.  also, several groups of police officers where going door to door, if anyone answered they where also questioned and checked.  he didn&#39;t stay around long enough to see much else as he came over to my place and stayed until well after sundown.  i was also told that this had been happening for a few days. but his schedule had gotten him out of the neighborhood before they started and back after it had finished.  i take this as factual as the man in question had no need to create such a fabrication, and with the corruption in Louisiana law enforcement at present.  if what they where doing is called a warrant sweep then i suppose it was.  if that is the case is something like that allowed to be done on such a scale.  has something like this ever been done on such a scale before?  </p>
