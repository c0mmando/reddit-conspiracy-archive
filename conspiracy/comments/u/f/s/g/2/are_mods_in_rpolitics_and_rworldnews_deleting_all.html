    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I posted the guardian article yesterday morning with the title, &quot;The Bilderberg meeting has begun in the US,&quot; and it was removed in 2 min by davidreiss666. I asked him why and his only response was, &quot;it&#39;s US news.&quot; As if the US is not part of the world. I tried to explain that it&#39;s a transnational meeting being held in the US (which I assumed he knew), but there was no further reply. I then posted it to r/news and it got to 35 karma. Interesting to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the thing, however.  If standing back <em>ensured</em> the falling of the empire, then yes.  I <em>would</em> absolutely stand back.  Why on Earth would anyone want to risk harm coming to themselves if the opposition is sure to inevitably fall <em>anyway</em>?</p>

<p>The problem is that this opposition - i.e. the world-raping 1% - has been standing strong for a long, LONG time now, and even though it&#39;s having a bit of difficult time right now, it&#39;s STILL owning the world.  It&#39;s <em>still</em> controlling everything and everyone pretty much.  It&#39;s <em>still</em> being responsible for death upon untold number of deaths.  Additionally, it&#39;s fighting back REAL hard to make sure that it stays alive.  If that empire has anything to say about it, IT will be the one who wins and remains standing at the end of the day - and the 99% will remain servile.</p>

<p>In other words, the opposition if fighting hard and strong - and it&#39;s <em>winning</em>.  We the 99% are indeed beginning to fight back hard . . . but it&#39;s not hard enough, and the 1% are <em>still</em> ahead and on top - and if they have anything to say about it, they will <em>remain</em> on top and we on bottom.</p>

<p>It is because of this that I think it&#39;s pretty important to - in whatever way you can - oppose and resist them.  I think any &quot;standing back&quot; kind of attitude on our part simply gives them breathing room to regroup and continue forth.</p>

<p>The shit stack is NOT worth my life or your life or anyone&#39;s life if the 1% are absolutely SURE to fall and WILL indeed loose.  However, and as explained above, this is NOT by any means at all a certainty.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that fighting the shit stack IS worth one&#39;s life, however, if the alternative is to continue to be enslaved and become even more so than ever before.</p>

<p>If the likelihood is that you will be living on your knees (and it&#39;s looking that way), then the shit stack IS indeed worth standing up and fighting your ass off for - even if that ends up meaning that you&#39;ll die.  At least that way you&#39;ll die fighting to remain standing on your own two feet, as opposed to doing nothing and ending up living a controlled and monitored life in subservience.</p>

<p>And I would say I&#39;m NOT following the crowd.  Hell that&#39;s my point.  It&#39;s the crowd that is more willing to do nothing and stay back.  THAT&#39;S the problem.  That crowd is NOT willing to stand and resist.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually not following the crowd.  The crowd is more willing to keep watching tv and wearing designer clothes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a revolutionary war going on and it went hot a long time ago.</p>

<p>Lots of people try to conceive of this in terms of conventional weapons which is pretty asinine.  Waging conventional warfare against the state is impossible, which is why you get a lot of bullshit from fake dissidents telling you to buy rifles and other 19th century crap that won&#39;t do you any good.</p>

<p>Pretty much all intellectuals, scientists, businessmen, etc., consider themselves enemies of the state at this point.</p>

<p>One of the more pleasant indicators of our success in the last year or so has been Obama transferring stealth helicopter tech to Pakistan and stealth drone tech to Iran.  He&#39;s a conscious agent of treason and thought he was really pulling a slick one with both of those incidents, but that shit is old as fuck and doesn&#39;t really matter.  He outed himself as a spy basically (illegal technology transfer on orders from the White House) but accomplished nothing by doing it.  What you should discern from this is that the remaining players in positions of power are ignorant as fuck.</p>

<p>It pleases me to no end to see that Obama has a policy/desire of first strike thermonuclear war, we have the technology to wage a first strike global war and be fine, yet Barry can&#39;t pull it off.  He is simply too ignorant and even if he knew what weapon systems to commandeer, the people that operate them wouldn&#39;t follow his orders.  He has essentially no control over our <em>actual</em> military, just the conventional weapons bullshit.  That much sucks and people die for it, but at least humanity as a whole is OK.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still too silent and dormant in the states, however.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t entirely disagree with this.  I think it&#39;s <em>significantly</em> more important to fight using means that are not in any way limited to guns and rifles, but - although I myself have actually never owned nor even fired a gun - I think it&#39;s important for the population to make sure and <em>also</em> arm themselves <em>along</em> with fighting the system in all the other non conventional ways possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty much all intellectuals, scientists, businessmen, etc., consider themselves enemies of the state at this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I think the sentiment of this statement is good - and probably not entirely inaccurate - I fear that it&#39;s not sufficiently true, and there is indeed too sizable a number in the aforementioned ilk that are indeed still working for the state.</p>

<p>Regarding Obama, regardless of how inept he may be in some areas, there seems to be still enough unfortunate global support for the U.S., it&#39;s policies, and it present (and past) administration(s) for them to continue running (and ruining) much of the planet.</p>

<p>The totalitarian tiptoe officially turned into an all out, full on totalitarian <em>sprint</em> a few years ago, and unless the 99% can smarten up fast, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any guarantee yet that we&#39;ll come out on top.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The uncloaking you&#39;ve seen the last few years is a sign of the system unraveling, not getting more control.</p>

<p>The NDAA isn&#39;t really a step in the wrong direction.  It&#39;s a positive sign.  Due process hasn&#39;t existed for a long time - the NDAA didn&#39;t <em>really</em> change anything in that regard.  It&#39;s great that gov-co is in such a bad position now that they have to admit it.  That should tell you they are finding it increasingly hard to get their employees to go along with immoral orders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  You&#39;re right.  As I said toward the end of my writing above, the totalitarian tip toe has officially turned in to a full on totalitarian sprint toward the finish line of complete world rule over the masses.  That &quot;sprint&quot; is an indication that the masses are indeed catching on to the 1%&#39;s ultimate plan of world domination, and are themselves beginning to act out and resist that domination.  However, the fact that there hasn&#39;t been even MORE active resistance is, to me, an indication that simply too much of the 99% is still asleep.</p>

<p>And isn&#39;t the NDAA that act whose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act">&quot;critics claim allows indefinite military detention&quot;</a>??  That doesn&#39;t really sound like it&#39;s a step in the <em>right</em> direction.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to come by someone who doesn&#39;t think both parties suck / work together behind closed doors / we have no real options.  This is one of many openings to conspiracy research - maybe the dumbest 20% or so of the population hasn&#39;t walked through this door yet.</p>

<p>About half of Americans are 9/11 truthers and we have super majority 9/11 truthers in much of the rest of the world including China, India, and Islamic nations - over half of humanity.  There is a massive movement towards independent agriculture, co-ops, guns are selling at record breaking levels, people are fleeing America for greener pastures, etc.</p>

<p>Not everyone has a good enough memory to study everything it takes to see the big picture, or the opportunity to do so in life, or the intelligence it takes to sift through the BS.  Almost everyone knows that something is very, very wrong and almost all of these people tend towards more education about what that is and therefore greater resistance to the state as a result.</p>

<p>From my perspective many are waking up - this is true - but there are still many that are lost in the muck, in the dark, and blind.  Heck, just look at Reddit itself.  While there seems to be a decent percentage that are becoming aware of the manipulation that has been going on, there are still many, many individuals that are honestly still under the deluded impression that the system should still be generally supported and backed.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I agree with this.  The extent of the manipulation, however, exists much, much deeper than this, and it is not enough for someone to just &quot;know&quot; that the government is rigged.  Too many people say they know it&#39;s all a scam, but they are STILL going along and voting and carrying themselves and their lives pretty much just as they did before they realized how bad things are.  This effectively changes nothing.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>We are certainly not in disagreement regarding our general points.  However, I would say that 1) the percentage of the &quot;dumbest&quot; is, unfortunately, much greater (30, 40?), and 2) there is, I think, a great, great percentage that has indeed woken up to the fact that there is a pool of reality and truth that the 1% have been keeping all of us from . . . but most have only either just LOOKED at the pool, or have ever so slightly only dipped their big toe in and then scurried back to their imagined lives of fake security.  Many are now more aware that they are living a lie and there IS a pool of reality they&#39;ve been denied from, but they are too used to the comfort of their chicanery, and have only but skimmed the surface of that pool - not daring to venture too far in the waters.</p>

<p>We need to dive in and start swimming is what I&#39;m saying.  And not enough of us are doing that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>About half of Americans are 9/11 truthers and we have super majority 9/11 truthers in much of the rest of the world including China, India, and Islamic nations - over half of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This might be true, but the fact that the planet is STILL under such dire circumstances and STILL being ruled over to such an extent by such negative forces is an indication to me that 1) the 1% are still in power and are NOT giving up their advantage, and 2) the 99% are not doing enough to combat this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a massive movement towards independent agriculture, co-ops, guns are selling at record breaking levels, people are fleeing America for greener pastures, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see this too much, but I also hope it&#39;s just me and YOU yourself are actually right and more correct in your perspective than I am.  I would hope that this is the case as well, but, again, things seems a bit slow to me.  I do think it&#39;s a good thing if what you say is indeed happening.  I think that many should stay here and fight to improve this system HERE, however, instead of fleeing to another area - since the level of 1% domination that exists is global and not just in the U.S.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you and I are pretty much in general agreement, and I DO think you are right that more of us are waking up.  Educating and enlightening oneself is indeed a great key in uncovering what&#39;s going on, and the more it happens, the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is just personal anecdotes, but about a decade ago I used to read some Satanic websites/forums and</p>

<p>1) Satanism (CoS, FCoS, ToS, FSC) is pretty mundane, really. Think precursors to the vocal antitheists we see now, with a bit more superstition about &quot;magick.&quot; I never met any who believed in Satan - mostly they just hated Christians. Many tried to be creepy and offputting, but I&#39;d be more comfortable with them than fundamentalists because these guys were pretty sane and took full personal responsibility for their actions (ie. no divine guidance.)</p>

<p>2) If I had to stereotype the group in any way, it&#39;d be less &quot;creepy&quot; and more &quot;prone to the pettiest bickering and infighting you&#39;ve ever seen on the Internet.&quot; They can pick some fun iconography, but that bickering was the most unattractive part of that whole group of communities... next to the resentment that fuelled them...</p>

<p>Hilaire du Berrier was the publisher of the Monte Carlo-based Hilaire du Berrier Reports. Mr. Du Berrier closely followed and chronicled the activities of Bilderberg and its overlapping groups, for over four decades. In a September of 1991 issue of the Hilaire du Berrier Report (also reported elsewhere in the French press), David Rockefeller addressed media facilitators at the 1991 annual Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany. In his talk, Mr. Rockefeller, a member of the Bilderbergers, former Director on the Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) (1949-1985) and co-founder of the Trilateral Commission, thanked them (most of whom are also members of one or more of these groups) for their &quot;discretion&quot;:</p>

<p>“We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost 40 years. ...It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticated now and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto determination practiced in past centuries.”&quot;</p>

<p>The most common reason submissions are blocked there is for editorializing the title. Best way around this is to just give it the article title, and put any additional editorializing, perspective, or context in a comment to the submission. So long as the articles are about the current Bilderberg meeting in Virginia, and the title matches the article title (or is directly lifted from the opening sentences of the article) it should be ok for <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> IMO. </p>

<p>So if anyone submitted &#39;Bilderberg meeting in Virginia&#39; stories in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and they&#39;re not showing up, message me and I can take a look. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Titles that resulted in legitimate articles not getting through because of editorializing? Here&#39;s one: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bilderberg Group in Virginia Selects Mitt Romney&#39;s VP Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana and arrest a man who crossing the Street where they are gathering in Virginia this year. WATCH THE VIDEO INCLUDED WITH THIS STORY...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For context, the article title and subtitle were this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bilderberg Protester Arrested For Crossing Street</p>

<p>Security crackdown surrounding elite confab intensifies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article had nothing about Romney, Daniels, the VP spot, or the Bilderbergs anointing someone for that spot; the article was about the security situation outside. That and having all-caps commands to readers in the titles doesn&#39;t go over either (editorializing). </p>

<p>It would be great if people would just keep it simple and straightforward with the titles, and let the article speak for itself. In many comment threads, the first few comments are what sets the tone and topic for many of the comments that follow, so a submitter making the first comment to their article (providing extra context, highlighting certain details, or whatever) can spin things in the direction they want the commenters to consider, while having an accurate title so that people who want to read articles know what they&#39;re getting when they click the title (the point of the &#39;no editorializing&#39; rule). </p>

Plus not all mods post the explanation comments. Still, no mods in /politics posted explanation comments a few months ago (when I saw the practice being done in several medium and large subreddits by longtime mods there and recognized it as a good and healthy idea), so it&#39;s progress, albeit moving at slow speed. </p>

<p>You&#39;re totally right about the need for more communication as you described, and that providing the crucial bit of information regarding <em>why</em> something was removed would fill in the space that suspicions and persecution complexes currently fill. In the past 6 months, the use of scripts by mods is really taking off, and the use of moderator bots is just getting going, so I don&#39;t think it will be long until the explanation messaging is automated in some way or another. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a concerted effort by reddit, but rather there are mods in the high profile subreddits that are stemming the flow of information.  It&#39;s likely that there are whole mod accounts managed by companies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, all! <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> ambassador here, hoping to clarify a few things to those of you who may be confused:</p>

<p>SubredditDrama (SRD) is a /r/bestof style subreddit that aggregates drama from all over reddit. We aim to not participate in the drama we link to, but if you would like to discuss any of the drama you are free to do so in our subreddit. If you choose to do so, please read the guidelines in the sidebar before contributing. We like to watch drama, not start it.</p>

<p>If you have any complaints about Slytherbot2 please PM <a href="/u/AlyoshaV">/u/AlyoshaV</a>, Slytherbot2&#39;s proprietor. I am sure he would love to hear your comments.</p>

<p>This bot is maintained by the SubredditDrama mods. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSubredditDrama&amp;amp;subject=RE:%20subredditdrama%20bot">You can get in touch with us here.</a></p>

<p>and you can tell just how &quot;hands off&quot; they are just by looking at how hard they upvote their bot (4043 comment karma) vs how hard they brigade against the bot they are calling out.  Seriouly, just click the link and check out that negative score.Now then, do you really think you can take them at their word when they say &quot;we&#39;re totally not brigading we promise&quot;?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let <a href="/r/subredditdrama">/r/subredditdrama</a> drag your sub into their proxy war with SRS!</p>
