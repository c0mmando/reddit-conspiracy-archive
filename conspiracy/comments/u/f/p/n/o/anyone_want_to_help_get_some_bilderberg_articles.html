<p>I agree 100% that Bilderberg should be a frontpage story on reddit (hell, in the MSM too)... but don&#39;t be surprised if your account gets banned.  And when it does, don&#39;t be all like THE JEWISH NWO SHILLS CENSORED MY ACCOUNT IN R/POLITICS... they&#39;d do the same thing to people organizing upvotes in r/MensRights, <a href="/r/Obama">/r/Obama</a> or r/Romney.  </p>

<p>What&#39;s there to articulate against biased ridicule? All I wanted was for people to be aware of the organization and question it. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say hey here are some posts I made, can anyone upvote them for me? I said anyone want to help get some articles on r/politics. </p>

<p>I posted my articles to provide an example of what I had already submitted on that topic. </p>

<p>Oh well, it&#39;s all over now anyways. I&#39;m going to bed, I&#39;m not sure what part of the country you are in but it&#39;s 11 o&#39;clock here and I&#39;m sleepy. Have a good night. </p>

<p>No you lied to him, the mod you were talking to.. </p>

<p>No I didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t like being called a liar so please stop. </p>

<p>Unfortunately all it takes is one small mistake.</p>

<p>Actually no, it says plain as day on the rules of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> that only repeat offenders will be banned. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Manipulate comments and posts via group voting, which is against reddit TOS - such content will be removed, and <strong>repeat offenders will be banned</strong>.</p>

<p>Since in your eyes I am an offender, it&#39;s still my first time. </p>

<p>He knows that and that is why he justified by saying I was being a smartass. </p>

<p>Not to mention he called me dense in a later message. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a ban for personal reasons, a couple of the other mods are helping me get un-banned anyways. </p>
