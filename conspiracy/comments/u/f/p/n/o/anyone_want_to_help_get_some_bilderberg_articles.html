       I'm all for spreading the word to at least get people thinking about this stuff.  But I'm not sure we should be spamming other subreddits with content that may be off topic.

       Keep in mind, they could just as easily send shills into our midst to throw off our discussions in retaliation.  Yeah, we can ban them, but not until after they've caused nice disruption.

       Spread the word, but don't create a conspiracy doing so.  Would be counterproductive of our mission here, I would think.

       Organizing upvotes for submissions in other subreddits is gonna either get the submission removed or your account banned from posting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree 100% that Bilderberg should be a frontpage story on reddit (hell, in the MSM too)... but don't be surprised if your account gets banned.  And when it does, don't be all like THE JEWISH NWO SHILLS CENSORED MY ACCOUNT IN R/POLITICS... they'd do the same thing to people organizing upvotes in r/MensRights,
       <a href="/r/Obama">
        /r/Obama
       </a>
       or r/Romney.

       Well put, you guys are awesome! I'm trying to get unbanned right now, but they have decided to say this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We stand in a unified front on this one and users do get banned from time to time for doing it. It isn't personal, I assure you."

       That would not work very many times.  I guess you are referring to the user that was banned for doing such.  The complaint for the vote gaming was raised by a subscriber to r/politics; I don't actively go to other subreddits to look for vote gaming.

       We should put up the word "Bilderberg" everywhere.  Create bots to run google searchs day in and out. twitter, facebook, etc. Just post the word "Bilderberg" and nothing else in every possible place we can. Won't be much of a secret if you can't go anywhere with out hearing about it.

       You really poorly articulated your points on bilderberg in all the topics you created, so to me, it's no surprise they saw you against the sub-reddit rules. Just because /conspiracy lets you post whatever you want, doesn't mean all subs are the same.

       And another thing, how do you know what luster is thinking? That's kind of a strange thing to say don't you think?

       You are also very defensive and confrontational for someone sitting on the sidelines.

         Organizing upvotes for submissions in other subreddits is gonna either get the submission removed or your account banned from posting there.

         I agree 100% that Bilderberg should be a frontpage story on reddit (hell, in the MSM too)... but don't be surprised if your account gets banned. And when it does, don't be all like THE JEWISH NWO SHILLS CENSORED MY ACCOUNT IN R/POLITICS... they'd do the same thing to people organizing upvotes in r/MensRights,
         <a href="/r/Obama">
          /r/Obama
         </a>
         or r/Romney.

        <p>
         To be fair, you are calling for people to spam the subreddit.

       <li>

         I'm all for spreading the word to at least get people thinking about this stuff. But I'm not sure we should be spamming other subreddits with content that may be off topic.

       I just post on stuff that I see, and then when people comment back, I comment back. I'm bored watching Bones, and I don't mind conversation.

       This is entirely correct. But you also are claiming that you have no idea why you were banned, when you admit that you were just being lazy and did things you wouldn't have done had you been giving your full attention to your comments.

       Unfortunately, if they feel you violated the rules, you would be gone. The guy should have identified himself as a mod I guess, but it's not like people who are mods is kept secret.
