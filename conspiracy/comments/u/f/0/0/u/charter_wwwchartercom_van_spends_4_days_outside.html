       Ron Paul's presidential campaign was another monumental failure. Romney fittingly clinched the nomination the other day with a big win in Ron Paul's home state of Texas. Mr. Paul, as I expected, came in third behind Romney and a guy who dropped out of the race. As expected, Ron Paul even did poorly in his home district. That's pretty much all you missed.

       BTW I think you should try to not post photos of so much drugs online. I'd bet that's what happened to you.

       How about this. If you're going to sell drugs, it may not be a good idea to brag about it online, show pictures of it, and take requests for custom pictures with your weed.

       if he's already been sentanced and jailed then he should know by now what evidence they had against him leading up to it. But since he's careful not to mention it I'm assuming he's full of shit and just wants the attention here trying to say it's an unkown conspiracy when he's already received his discovery documents containing all the evidence against him.

       MTCONE, in general is full of shit. We will never get the real story here on what happened. At this point we can only speculate, unless someone can find a news article. However, if we do that, then the NoLibsWatch crew will claim we are hunting down his personal info, and then we risk getting banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm speculating for fun here, but I really don't care what the whole story is. All I know is that a dude posted a big bag a weed online, then he goes away to jail for 6 months a week later, then he comes back claiming conspiracy. The whole thing is hilarious and that's all I care about it.

       Seriously; plenty of good people who sell pot go to jail.  You certainly understood the risk, and besides, don't I remeber something about you posting pictures of your mass stash on Reddit? Add this to having trollish enemies and what do you expect.  All that said, it's good to have ya back; just stay away from the skunk this time

       Then don't bitch about it when you get busted and have to do a minimum of jail time. Being caught with five
       <em>
        pounds
       </em>
       of marijuana should have bought you a lot more jail time. So who did you rat out to get them to let you out early?

       Wow. You must be really desperate to score some kind of points after Ron Paul got his ass handed to him again. By the way, fuck-wit, that's not a Japanese toy and I wouldn't sell a piece of shit like that. But being a piece of shit yourself you really couldn't be expected to know that.

       I'm not angry at all. I like it when Ron Paul supporters show how truly immature and ignorant they are. By the way, just so you know, it's likely that I made more money last year buying and selling toys on the internet then you did working at McDonald's or whatever fast food restaurant it was where your parole officer got you a job. And buying and selling toys is my very part time third job.

       I don't have to work three jobs, greenie. Not everyone is like you and just wants to sit around smoking dope and masturbating to photos of Ron Paul. Some of us are thinking about our futures and are doing something to prepare for them. Most of the money I make from the toy sales goes into an IRA. The rest of it goes to a vacation fund that allows me to take at least two long vacations every year. I was at Rocky Mountain National Park earlier this year and in September I'm going camping on the Olympic Peninsula. The primary job alone would allow me to live quite well but I do enjoy my luxuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may think that selling toys is something to be mocked but at least I'm not cleaning other people's toilets or whatever it is that you do for a living. I bet you wish now that you hadn't dropped out of school in the seventh grade.

       Sorry, herky, but you working three jobs and scrimping and saving all year just to camp out with deer ticks and swarms of mosquitoes seems sad to me.

       Now don't get all emotional again, herky. Have you been screened for Lyme disease?  That could be the cause of your rapid mood swings. Be sure to keep your tent zipped up and wear long sleeves and lots of strong tick repellent. Enjoy! You deserve it.

       Well you did post images on Reddit of the
       <em>
        substantial
       </em>
       amount of marijuana in your possession. If you go on the internet frequently, you tend to leave quite a substantial trail. If I took time to study your posts here (or got an automated program to do it), it's plausible that I might be able to track your activity to accounts on other websites, and eventually discover your identity.

       I find it highly unlikely that even the most sophisticated law enforcement agencies would be able to gather any useful information on me.

       Wrong again. I wasn't in federal court. State law allows for 3 lbs for personal use. (actually differs by county). I had 4 lbs. Still had nothing to do with any federal laws. My charges were not federal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is extremely bizarre for local authorities to bother with such a small amount. I was the ONLY one locked up for such a small amount and only 1 of maybe a half dozen arrested on marijuana charges. Marijuana charges make up about 1% of local felons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously you have never left the county you were born in (I am guessing somewhere in the ozarks) so I don't expect you to understand how the rest of the world works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana is legal in 17 states. You should trying visiting them. Or at least a county outside your own.

       Actually let's go over this just so I know I have your story straight. 
First you posted a large amount of drugs on a non-throwaway reddit account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a charter van parked across from your house for four days.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think that even the most sophisticated law enforcement agency can track you through the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You did nothing illegal but still went to jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police found you at a hotel and knocked on your door with no explanation or warrant  and you let them in with large quantities of illegal drugs both in plain sight and apparently hidden in the room
      </p>
      <p>
       Your discovery documents make no mention of why they were there or what their probable cause was for knocking on your door.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite them not having probably cause you decided to take a plea for a year in jail despite your claims that this is actually a harsh sentence. (most people don't take pleas for harsh sentences to begin with)
      </p>
      <p>
       No one you sell to was busted and rolled over on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You had 5lbs of weed while simultaneously only having 4
      </p>
      <p>
       You got day for day with good behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in summation: You sell drugs, one day a van parked across from your house for four days then whilst in a hotel you heard a knock at the door answered only to find it was the police. Without telling you why they were there you decided to let them in despite the fact that you had drugs all over the place. They arrest you. The discovery documents you are required by law to receive, containing all the evidence against you including probable cause makes no mention of their probable cause or any previous investigation. Then in a masterful stroke of legal genius equal to that of
       <a href="http://static.tvfanatic.com/images/gallery/lionel-hutz-picture.jpg">
        Lionel Hutz
       </a>
       you took an incredibly harsh sentence in a plea bargain even though a first semester law student could have gotten you out of it without any problems. You to this day have no idea how they found or the real reason they were there but you think it involves some vast conspiracy, even though you are untraceable online. Sound about right?

       You constantly attack me with these throwaway accounts and talking of my ego. You really don't know the first thing about me if you think I live through my ego. That is where you and I differ old friend, and unfortunately this path is hidden to those who cannot comprehend its existence so you will never understand where I am coming from until you humble yourself. When I referred to indigo children in the past I am speaking of almost every person who reads this sub on a regular basis, not just some group of elite spoiled children of average to superior intelligence and creativity. I speak of every person who stands against oppression of the many by the few. I speak of every person who is against genetically modified foods and government and corporate control of our food supply. I speak of every one of us. I'm not special. I just know what indigo really means and I am trying to share that message with everyone here. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, we are worth so much more than we are told. We have lost our way as a people. Let's find our way once again. This is what I meant. Stop taking me out of context and twisting my words to fit your story. The official policy is to ban you on sight, so I'm going to do that now, which I'm sure is going to start another hilarious 6 day mod mail conversation. We have had quite a few of those recently haven't we, cowz? Here goes. Peace.

       I'm just going to copy and paste some info that I found just now. I haven't had time to read through this specific article, so these are not neccissarily my opinions.

       Economic

      <p>
       Profit Incentive
      </p>
      <p>
       The potential for commercial gain through the use of biotechnology is evident through the large transnational corporations such as Monsanto, Dupont, and Novartis. Most private companies focus their research on staple products of western nations such as maize and wheat. Monsanto does not even produce rice, the number one crop in the world, because it is not profitable for them to do so. Labeling products that contain GMOs would place tremendous economic cost on these companies. (Klee, 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Research Funds
Funding for biotechnology has taxed the already waning agriculture research funds in the world (Shiva, 1999). Opponents of GMOs argue that alternative methods of agriculture can achieve the same things as biotechnology. They cite examples of iron and calcium fortified rice, salinity resistant rice, and nitrogen fixing legumes that have been created through the use of biodiversity and biological control in Third World countries(Shiva, 2000). Hans Herren, the director of the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Nairobi maintains society "shouldn't be driven by this unproven technology when there are many more efficient solutions to food problems." Herren ended a famine in Africa during the 1980's with an action plan based on biological control. If the same problem arose today he does not think he could find the funding for the research because biotechnology is drawing too much money (Pearce,1998). The Rockefeller Foundation, one of the largest private funds for agriculture research in the world spends more than half of their money on biotechnology (Pearce, 2000).

       Testing
      </p>
      <p>
       A scare related to the Monarch butterfly resulted in controversy over GMOs in the United Kingdom, but was recently shown to be false. Scientists really do not know the long-term effects of biotechnology on the natural world (Brown, 2000). The large number of variables, the constant change of the natural world and the relatively short time the technology has been around, make studies difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possible Benefits
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people say biotechnology will actually help the environment by lowering the amount of pesticides and herbicides used in farming because of insect and disease resistant strains of organisms. Advocates also say that GMOs help eliminate the need for slash-and-burn agriculture because of increased food production per acre.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biodiversity
      </p>
      <p>
       How will biotechnology alter evolution? Genetic modification in an organism usually occurs over thousands of years through mutations. Does one changed gene make the organism and entirely new species? Will "super crops" wipe out older strains of an organism and decreases biodiversity? These questions have yet to be answered.

       Track Record
      </p>
      <p>
       David Aaron of the United States Commerce Department states that Americans have eaten GMOs for more than 13 years and no health problems have occurred as a result. The long-term effects of GMOs on human body processes is unknown. "Genetic exchange between species can wake up dangerous, dormant viruses in the human genes," said Mae-Wan Ho, Ph. D, science advisor for the Third World Network, a coalition of groups involved in development issues (Biotech Aimed, 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Food Allergies 
One serious health uncertainty surrounding GMOs concerns food allergies. Since gene splicing allows a gene from any organism to be put in another, the opportunity for new combinations of genes to trigger allergic reactions exists. In opposition, some scientists believe that in the future they will identify the genes that cause the allergic reactions. The harmful gene in a organism, such as a Brazil nut, could then be removed. (Franken..., 2000).

       World Hunger
      </p>
      <p>
       Hunger Facts
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand whether biotechnology can actually help end hunger, it is necessary to examine the causes of world hunger. The World Bank states that the world food supply in 1994 could have fed 6.4 billion people so hunger stems not necessarily from lack of food, but also for economic and political reasons. The world produces enough grain to feed every person at least 3,500 calories a day yet 800 million people in the world are hungry (Toler, 2000). Fifteen percent of the world's population are chronically undernourished (vanWijk, 2000).Certain groups are hit the hardest by hunger including women, children, people in rural areas and those living in underdeveloped nations. Three fourths of people who are hungry live in Asia, Africa, or Latin America (Toler, 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moral Blackmail
      </p>
      <p>
       Many opponents argue that biotech companies are using world hunger as a form of "moral blackmail" to sell GMOs. Consumers feel they have to accept biotechnology or else they feel guilty about standing in the way of progress to help stop world hunger (Knee, 2000). The companies make themselves out to be the saviors of hungry people throughout the world, but do not actually use their expertise to help developing nations because they have no profit incentive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two Arguments
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the ethical questions about GMOs revolve around its potential ability to solve world hunger. Many people fear that the new technology would actually contribute to world hunger by making farmers dependent on private corporations for seeds or other agricultural necessities (vanWijk, 2000). A technology exists that can produce sterile seeds. Often called "terminator technology," the seeds prevent the spread of GMOs through cross pollination, but also require farmers to purchase new seeds every year. Since more than half the worlds farmers are poor, it is doubtful whether or not they could afford to buy new seeds every year (Franken...,1999). The political conflict in the West about GMOs has angered some advocates of biotechnology in developing countries. They feel it overshadows the benefits that the technology could have for the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Europe has a surplus of food production. They have so much food that they are being subsidized. They don't know hunger. They don't know poverty. They are talking with their stomachs full, and they think they know what is best for Africa. That's very wrong. We should be allowed to try technology and decide for ourselves." 
-Florence Wambugu, Nairobi based plant scientist (Tam,1999)
      </p>
      <p>
       Effective Solution
      </p>
      <p>
       The wide spread controversy surrounding biotechnology often makes it difficult to decipher facts from propaganda. Eliminating world hunger will take a integrated approach of solutions. In the end, solving world hunger is not an "inherent characteristic," of biotechnology, but it can help if its benefits are shared with those who need it most. Biotechnology has the potential to be part of the solution to world hunger if research occurs for crops beneficial to developing countries. In the 1960's and 70's the Green Revolution promised to end world hunger, but despite increased food production hunger persists today.

       Also BT toxin is being engineered into our corn. This toxin explodes the stomachs of any insects that eat it. Industry assures us that all traces of BT toxin are gone by the time it reaches consumers, but blood tests have confirmed the presence of he toxin in pregnant women.

       Compelling Evidence of Potential GMO Harm
      </p>
      <p>
       In his introduction, Smith cites the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) policy statement on GM food safety without a shred of evidence to back it. It supported GHW Bush's Executive Order that GMOs are "substantially equivalent" to ordinary seeds and crops and need no government regulation. The agency said it was "not aware of any information showing that foods derived by these new methods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way." That single statement meant no safety studies are needed and "Ultimately, it is the food producer" that bears responsibility "for assuring safety." As a consequence, foxes now guard our henhouse in a brave new dangerous world.
      </p>
      <p>
       FDA policy opened the floodgates, and Smith put it this way: It "set the stage for the rapid deployment of the new technology," allowed the seed industry to become "consolidated, millions of acres (to be) planted, hundreds of millions to be fed (these foods in spite of nations and consumers objecting, and) laws to be passed (to assure it)." The toll today is contaminated crops, billions of dollars lost, human health harmed, and it turns out the FDA lied.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agency knew GM crops are "meaningfully different" because their technical experts told them so. As a result, they recommended long-term studies, including on humans, to test for possible allergies, toxins, new diseases and nutritional problems. Instead, politics trumped science, the White House ordered the FDA to promote GM crops, and a former Monsanto vice-president went to FDA to assure it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the industry is unregulated, and when companies say their foods are safe, their views are unquestioned. Further, Smith noted that policy makers in other countries trust FDA and wrongly assume their assessments are valid. They're disproved when independent studies are matched against industry-run ones. The differences are startling. The former report adverse affects while the latter claim the opposite. It's no secret why. Agribusiness giants allow nothing to interfere with profits, safety is off the table, and all negative information is quashed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, their studies are substandard, adverse findings are hidden, and they typically "fail to investigate the impacts of GM food on gut function, liver function, kidney function, the immune system, endocrine system, blood composition, allergic response, effects on the unborn, the potential to cause cancer, or impacts on gut bacteria." In addition, industry-funded studies creatively avoid finding problems or conceal any uncovered. They cook the books by using older instead of younger more sensitive animals, keep sample sizes too low for statistical significance, dilute the GM component of feeds used, limit the duration of feeding trials, ignore animal deaths and sickness, and engage in other unscientific practices. It's to assure people never learn of the potential harm from these foods, and Smith says they can do it because "They've got 'bad science' down to a science."
      </p>
      <p>
       The real kinds show GMOs produce "massive changes in the natural functioning of (a) plant's DNA. Native genes can be mutated, deleted, permanently turned off or on....the inserted gene can become truncated, fragmented, mixed with other genes, inverted or multiplied, and the GM protein it produces may have unintended characteristics" that may be harmful.

       GMOs also pose other health risks. When a transgene functions in a new cell, it may produce different proteins than the ones intended. They may be harmful, but there's no way to know without scientific testing. Even if the protein is exactly the same, there are still problems. Consider corn varieties engineered to produce a pesticidal protein called Bt-toxin. Farmers use it in spray form, and companies falsely claim it's harmless to humans. In fact, people exposed to the spray develop allergic-type symptoms, mice ingesting Bt had powerful immune responses and abnormal and excessive cell growth, and a growing number of human and livestock illnesses are linked to Bt crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smith notes still another problem relating to inserted genes. Assuming they're destroyed by our digestive system, as industry claims, is false. In fact, they may move from food into gut bacteria or internal organs, and consider the potential harm. If corn genes with Bt-toxin get into gut bacteria, our intestinal flora may become pesticide factories. There's been no research done to prove if it's true or false. Agribusiness giants aren't looking, neither is FDA, consumers are left to play "Genetic Roulette," and the few animal feeding studies done show the odds are against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arpad Pusztai and other scientists were shocked at their results of animals fed GM foods. His results were cited above. Other independent studies showed stunted growth, impaired immune systems, bleeding stomachs, abnormal and potentially precancerous cell growth in the intestines, impaired blood cell development, misshaped cell structures in the liver, pancreas and testicles, altered gene expression and cell metabolism, liver and kidney lesions, partially atrophied livers, inflamed kidneys, less developed organs, reduced digestive enzymes, higher blood sugar, inflamed lung tissue, increased death rates and higher offspring mortality as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's more. Two dozen farmers reported their pigs and cows fed GM corn became sterile, 71 shepherds said 25% of their sheep fed Bt cotton plants died, and other reports showed the same effects on cows, chickens, water buffaloes and horses. After GM soy was introduced in the UK, allergies from the product skyrocketed by 50%, and in the US in the 1980s, a GM food supplement killed dozens and left five to ten thousand others sick or disabled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, Monsanto is the world's largest seed producer, and Smith notes how the company deals with reports like these. In response to the US Public Health Service concerning adverse reactions from its toxic PCBs, the company claims its experience "has been singularly free of difficulties." That's in spite of lawsuit-obtained records showing "this was part of a cover-up and denial that lasted decades" by a company with a long history of irresponsible behavior that includes "extensive bribery, highjacking of regulatory agencies, suppressing negative information about its products" and threatening journalists and scientists who dare report them. The company long ago proved it can't be trusted with protecting human health.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his book, "Seeds of Destruction," Engdahl names four dominant agribusiness giants - Monsanto, DuPont, Dow Agrisciences and Syngenta in Switzerland from the merger of the agriculture divisions of Novartis and AstraZeneca. Smith calls these companies Ag biotech and names a fifth - Germany-based Bayer CropScience AG (division of Bayer AG) with its Environmental Science and BioScience headquarters in France.

       Their business is to do the impossible and practically overnight - change the laws of nature and do them one better for profit. So far they haven't independent because genetic engineering doesn't work like natural breeding. It may or may not be a lot of things, but it isn't sex, says Smith. Michael Antoniou, a molecular geneticist involved in human gene therapy, explains that genetic modification "technically and conceptually bears no resemblance to natural breeding." The reproduction process works by both parents contributing thousands of genes to the offspring. They, in turn, get sorted naturally, and plant breeders have successfully worked this way for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genetic manipulation is different and so far fraught with danger. It works by forcibly inserting a single gene from a species' DNA into another unnaturally. Smith puts it this way: "A pig can mate with a pig and a tomato can mate with a tomato. But this is no way that a pig can mate with a tomato and vice versa." The process transfers genes across natural barriers that "separated species over millions of years of evolution" and managed to work. The biotech industry now wants us to believe it can do nature one better, and that genetic engineering is just an extension or superior alternative to natural breeding. It's unproved, indefensible pseudoscience mumbo jumbo, and that's the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biologist David Schubert explains that industry claims are "not only scientifically incorrect but exceptionally deceptive....to make the GE process sound similar to conventional plant breeding." It a smoke screen to hide the fact that what happens in laboratories can't duplicate nature, at least not up to now. Genetic engineering involves combining genes that never before existed together, the process defies natural breeding proved safe over thousands of years, and there's no way to assure the result won't be a deadly unrecallable Andromeda Strain, no longer the world of science fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The industry pooh-pooh's the suggestion of potential harm, and unscientifically claims millions of people in the US and worldwide have eaten GM food for a decade, and no one got sick. Smith's reply: How can we know as "GM foods might already be contributing to serious health problems, but since no one is monitoring for this, it could take decades" to find out. By then, it will be too late and some industry critics argue it already may be or dangerously close.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, most existing diseases have no effective surveillance systems in place. If GM foods create new ones, that potentially compounds the problem manyfold. Consider HIV/AIDS. It went unnoticed for decades and when identified, many thousands worldwide were infected or had died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the problem of linkage. In the US and many countries, GM foods are unlabeled so it's impossible tracing illness and diseases to specific substances ingested even if thousands of people are affected. It can plausibly be blamed on anything, especially when governments and regulatory agencies support industry claims of reliability and safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's rare that problems like the L-Tryptophan epidemic of the late 1980s are identified, but when it was thousands were already harmed. L-Tryptophan is a natural amino acid constituent of most proteins and for years was produced by many companies including Showa Denko in Japan. The company then got greedy, saw a way to increase profits from a product designed to induce sleep naturally, and gene-spliced a bacterium into the natural product to do it. The result was many dozens dead, over 1500 crippled, and up to 10,000 afflicted with a blood disorder from a new incurable disease called Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome or EMS.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a painful, multi-system disease that causes permanent scarring and fibrosis to nerve and muscle tissues, continuing inflammation, and a permanent change in a person's immune system. It cost the company two billion dollars to settle claims. Hundreds have since died, in all likelihood from contracting EMS.

       This is the known toll from a single product. Consider the potential harm with Ag biotech wanting all foods to be unlabeled GMOs worldwide and governments unable to balk because WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) rules deny them. They're also prevented under WTO's Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (SPS). It states that national laws banning GMO products are "unfair trade practices" even when they endanger human health. Other WTO rules also apply - called "Technical Barriers to Trade." They prohibit GMO labeling so consumers don't know what they're eating and can't avoid these potentially hazardous foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1996 Biosafety Protocol was drafted to prevent this problem, and it should be in place to do it. Public safety, however, was ambushed by Washington, the FDA and the agribusiness lobby. It sabotaged talks and insisted biosafety measures be subordinate to WTO trade rules that apply regardless of other considerations, including public health and safety. The path is thus cleared for the unrestricted spread of GMO seeds and foods worldwide unless a way is found to stop it.

       I had to make another throwaway just to respond to you again.

       <p>
        You constantly attack me with these throwaway accounts and talking of my ego.

        unfortunately this path is hidden to those who cannot comprehend its existence so you will never understand where I am coming from until you humble yourself
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yup. It's hidden to you if you keep sticking around here all the time and not doing what your main missions were....
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, If you were really humble enough then you wouldn't be going around saying how "enlightened" you are and how important you are as an "indigo". That's a load of crap and it's basically a distraction used by new agers.

       If this was true then you wouldn't be trying to censor me every time I try to post here right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where am I attacking you constantly? Ive only talked to you twice counting this one from the last time you guys ganged up on me to ban me for no reason at all. Also, you do have an ego if you keep constantly harping how you have to "stick with the boys" every time your friend is in trouble. Isn't that how secret societies work as well? Everyone covering each other asses even if they're wrong?

       You keep blaming everyone but yourself. Do you not realize that? When are you going to take responsibility for what you say and do?

      <p>
       Don't you mean censor people? Didn't you say earlier how you and I quote, "I speak of every person who stands against oppression of the many by the few." Isn't ironic that you keep talking about how you fight for those that are oppressed yet here we are you trying to oppress me? This is what I mean by hypocrisy coming from both sides bro. Your just as bad as
       <a href="/r/politics">

       One more thing...notice how me and crackduck might have some disagreements yet we still remain friends? Something you lack without having power cloud your mind.

       Lol. You keep telling me about myself as if I am a stranger. You have no idea who I am or what I am about. Apparently you have no concept of teamwork or solidarity if you don't understand how we do things as moderators. I'm done responding to your bullshit accusations which have no basis in reality. If you see a wise man and a fool arguing, you can't tell who is who.

       and you can tell just how "hands off" they are just by looking at how hard they upvote their bot (4061 comment karma) vs how hard they brigade against the bot they are calling out.  Seriouly, just click the link and check out that negative score.Now then, do you really think you can take them at their word when they say "we're totally not brigading we promise"?

       The reason people downvote the Alyosha bot is because we dislike Alyosha for mocking a suicidal redditor who was asking for help and subsequently dropped off the site.  We don't know if Alyosha contributed to a suicide, but it was a crummy thing to do.

Your logic is rejected.  Occam's razor suggests SRD is more likely brigading even 
though they don't realize they are brigading.  This leads to a high level of credibility 
from AlyoshaV's claims, which is why they downvote it so hard to suppress the truth.

Your logic is again flawed, one must only see the disparity of the scores between 
the bots to see the true "hands off" nature of SRD.

       There's no hands-off policy when it comes to downvoting AlyoshaV's bot that he/she created specifically in response to being exposed for mocking that suicidal redditor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each time that bot posts, it's an embodiment of resentment at SRD shining light on his/her tacitly possibly nudging someone towards killing themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       That bot gets the downvotes because a bad person is trying to use it to create FUD about the forum that showed him/her for what they are.

       Actually, I've been bullied by SRS.  If you support online bullying, then I guess I can see why you'd discard evidence like that study and employ tired memes.

       You're probably trolling; I choose not to believe that you're actually trying to excuse the sort of pain that group has caused to real people and families.

       Yeah. Right. I have a legitimate, licensed business selling Japanese toys to a mainly adult clientele and you want to lump me in with a moron who is stupid enough to post pics of the pounds of pot he has and then remains baffled as to how the cops caught on to him. Piss off, greenie.

       MTCONE, in general is full of shit. We will never get the real story here on what happened. At this point we can only speculate, unless someone can find a news article. However, if we do that, then the NoLibsWatch crew will claim we are hunting down his personal info, and then we risk getting banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'm speculating for fun here, but I really don't care what the whole story is. All I know is that a dude posted a big bag a weed online, then he goes away to jail for 6 months a week later, then he comes back claiming conspiracy. The whole thing is hilarious and that's all I care about it.
