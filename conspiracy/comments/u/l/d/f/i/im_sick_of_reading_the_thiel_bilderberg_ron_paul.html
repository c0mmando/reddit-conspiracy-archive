        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me put this into context that Tarpley [or any other idiot] never will and Alex can&#39;t articulate because he doesn&#39;t spend enough time in the specifics.</p>

<p>Ron Paul has received well over 30 MILLION in donations directly to the campaign 97% of which are individual donors. These are indisputable numbers from opensecrets. </p>

<p>And yet.. Tarpley paints Paul as shill for Bilderberg because Thiel set up his OWN Super PAC &quot;Endorse Liberty PAC&quot; and gave himself 2.4 million to spend how he choses. But, according to Tarpley, Thiel is Ron&#39;s &quot;largest donor&quot;. You see how that works?</p>

<p>This goes for every other person that falls for this simple minded disinformation perpetuated by the MSM and repeated by those who allow their philosophical differences to cloud their judgment, Itchy ears.</p>

<p>Think about who perpetuated this story to begin with.  MSM.. ... reporting on BILDERBERG?  That Ron Paul&#39;s &quot;top donor&quot; is a BB member??  This is in defiance of all logic, the decades old corporate media blackout on Bilderberg and to point out RON PAUL; the other fucking thing they live to blackout; at the same time is somehow connected to this shadowy group?  </p>

<p>What are the odds that they would break their blackouts to report on both of them at the same time?  It&#39;s like Optimus Prime riding Pegasus down Lollipop Lane.</p>

<p>Ron&#39;s not perfect, but he&#39;s the only shot (Politically) in the short term, you&#39;ve got at pulling this out of the fire.  Aside from may be Johnson who is worlds better than Obmaney, but has about as good as if not less of a shot than Dr. Paul.</p>

<p>Thiel &amp; Bilderberg: <strong>1</strong></p>

<p>You: <strong>0</strong></p>

<p>Regardless of whether this is correct or not, a &quot;short term &#39;shot&#39; politically&quot; is absolutely NOT what the United States or the world needs.  That&#39;s not in any way what&#39;s really going to make things better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On everything else I thought I was among others who knew that it was self-evident that the power resides in us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you&#39;re aware that the power <em>does</em> indeed reside in us, then you&#39;ll know that someone like Ron Paul, as attractive as he might seem on one level, is NOT the answer to any extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is instinctual pragmatism and self-preservation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it&#39;s not.  Instinctual pragmatism and self-preservation <em>lashes out</em> when its back is against the wall.  We are not yet, unfortunately, at the point where we understand just how dire things really are that we actually engage in instinctual pragmatism.  The cats in countries and places like Bahrain?  <em>Those</em> people are engaging in instinctual pragmatism and self-preservation.  We stupid Americans are still under the entirely deluded impression that doing anything within the completely corrupt system and voting for puppet shills is going to work or answer anything.</p>

<p>No.  We are not yet at the point of instinctual pragmatism.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  I would even say it is/was a noble attempt.</p>

<p>Shit gets complicated though.  Often one doesn&#39;t know who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong.  I feel that if there is <em>any</em> politician that stands a chance at being &quot;fair&quot;, it&#39;s RP . . . but, being that the whole of politics as it is practiced in this country seems putrid and rotten to the core, I have to say that I trust RP about as far as I can throw him.</p>

<p>He was campaigning at the time.</p>

<p>Can you imagine any politician, right after 9/11, voting against Afghanistan and being able to retain their position? In addition to that fact, when the vote was held there was very little evidence that the official story was a lie. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done my own research, which is how I know the claim of 62% is total BS. Cutting the operating budget of a department is not the same as cutting assistance to people actually receiving the benefits. I&#39;ve seen both of the links you provided before, and it looks like the operating budget will be cut and current spending will frozen. That is not even in the same ballpark as saying that the benefits people will receive will be cut by 62%.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I agree with you about Tarpley and his coverage of Libya and Syria, but the stuff he say&#39;s about Ron Paul is inaccurate at best and purposefully deceiving at worst. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless, the OP has my attention on this...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thiel set up his OWN Super PAC &quot;Endorse Liberty PAC&quot; and gave himself 2.4 million to spend how he choses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>does not necessarily mean that Thiel is Pauls &quot;biggest donor&quot; unless you&#39;re measuring donors and not donations.</p>

<p>And, on a related note, I enjoy the implied understanding that the conspiracy community has ... its a sort of wink-and-nudge circlejerk meta-language, just like any other in group. (Globalists = Reptilian Overlords = Illuminati -- we, on the inside, know who you&#39;re talking about because we speak the language.) But, that doesn&#39;t give &quot;our side&quot; the right to sensationalize to our own benefit, while criticising &quot;their side&quot; for doing it. That just makes us hypocrites. Sticking to the facts is more important than defending the in-group, in my opinion. But, like everyone, I&#39;m guilty (from time to time) of allowing my passionate patriotism to urge me to scoff &quot;how dare you?!&quot; ... which I later must resolve internally.</p>

<p>Ron Paul&#39;s &quot;biggest donor&quot; should be (and should be measured as) the single donor who made the single largest contribution to Ron Paul&#39;s campaign. If this is the fact about Thiel, then he is that. But, if it isn&#39;t the fact (e.g., if those moneys are not Thiel&#39;s, but someone else&#39;s being managed by Thiel) , then it is irresponsible for the media to report it as though it were.</p>

<p>That having been said, I really have no idea what exactly happened here. But, it seems to be some kind of media spin doctoring if only Ron Paul is being isolated as receiving Bilderberg-related money. I mean... seriously... the owners of the political system are, for the most part, the Bilderbergers. So, you know the two candidates from the two-in-one party system are outright owned by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron Paul&#39;s &quot;biggest donor&quot; by the total numbers given to the campaign are individuals with the average donation of 50$, when divided by their profession the top three are Army, Airforce, Navy.</p>

<p>When you give to a campaign directly you have a limit of 5k.  I&#39;m sure there are quite a few suppoters who maxed out.  May be Thiel gave that much, though I seriously doubt he gave any to the campaign because this is just a tar baby campaign to soil Ron&#39;s image with his base.</p>

<p>Claiming Thiel is Ron&#39;s &quot;biggest donor&quot; as the MSM and hapless alternatives like Madison and Tarpley is disingenuous at very best. </p>

<p>I was a state delegate so I paid attention to every piece of news that came out during the campaign, especially during the large gaps where they concerted their efforts on completely ignoring Ron.</p>

<p>OH, and stop defending Tarpley, do you know HOW EASY it is to disprove you saying that my accusation that Tarpley has been &quot;painting Ron Paul as a shill for Bilderberg&quot; as...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>blatantly untrue and fallacious</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is?</p>

<p>It&#39;s easier than proving the source of this whole story, since he spent the better part of last weekened repeating it over and over on video, on twitter and on his website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PAULBOTS: this is for you.</p>

<p>Ron Paul is a creationist who thinks the earth is 6,000 years old</p>

<p>He&#39;s a fundamental Christian who doesn&#39;t believe in the separation of Church and State</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to put the links here because they are out there and you can find them easily (the 2nd one is on his website, the first is a youtube video of him saying it out loud)</p>

<p>Anybody who votes for Ron Paul supports his delusional magical thinking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the other guy is better.  He is not.  Wearing magic underwear and thinking that when you die you end up in the planet Kolub is just as fucked up as the Christian myth, just less mainstream.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He&#39;s not aggressive enough in the public arena about things he should have some righteous indignation on.</p></li>
<li><p>His overly forgiving nepotism which breeds issues like Jesse Benton and the Ghostwriter responsible for the controversial newsletters</p></li>
<li><p>His refusal to personally, verbally attack his opponents rather choosing to discuss his ideas (can you really blame him?)</p></li>

<p>Huntsman is a fellow traveler Mormon running left cover for Romney and is pretty much the only guy besides Romney that the Paul attack machine wasn&#39;t vicious towards.</p>

<p>We&#39;re very obviously looking at a Scottish Rite centered conspiracy here.  Paul is a known freemason, runs around making satanic hand signs, has an eastern star wife, rainbow daughters, comes from a family of freemasons, etc.  It&#39;s 100% straight con Paulbots - sorry, but your hero is fake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here comes the nonsense, Huntsman was RESPONSIBLE for the fake racist Huntsman attack ad that he claimed Ron Paul supporters made.</p>

<p>There were ads calling Romney and Perry &quot;Plastic Men&quot; as far back as August.  Ron Was trying to get rid of all the &quot;Not Romney&quot; clones they had thrown in as chaff to keep focus off of Paul, worked well.</p>

<p>Everything else you are just regurgitating word for word what Tarpley says.  Most of which is circumstantial or completely baseless.</p>
