    <div class="md"><p>My interests include smoking lots of pot, playing lots of guitar and hardware engineering. I&#39;m not very active at night because I work a full time job in the mornings. I never really go out to rallies or protests. My area doesn&#39;t have a very active scene when it comes to activism, so I have been keeping low and helping the world one person at a time. I have been thinking of starting a local chapter of We Are Change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made an ill received post about something similar a while-back, but my approach is to not be overt in my views. This system forces us to occult knowledge; keeping it to ourselves, lest we be blacklisted from our peers. I&#39;ve influenced the mind-set of my own wife and several of my friends from revealing certain information over time and in relation to relevant topics as the conversation flows. Typically, there has been a breaking point where the previous understanding of the world bows to the &quot;realization of unknowing&quot;. This realization hits them, and they ask as many questions and want you to connect as many dots as possible. This is the breakthrough. I personally feel that this breakthrough does not come about from overtly and flamboyantly sharing your deep esoteric understanding of reality. I feel that it must be contained and then revealed at the <em>perfect</em> moment. </p>

<p>Anyway, this is my perspective. I&#39;ve found it rewarding to lead conversations into discussions of generalized topics, (politics, the economy, hot-issue topics, ect) openly talking about less controversial material and then flowing that into the crux of it all as time goes on. I would suggest not getting into the heavy stuff until after a few conversations, and your audience is very, very comfortable around you.(preferably after a J-bird). ;)</p>

<p>Keep on truckin, duder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never really talk about this stuff to girls I&#39;m trying to impress. It just kind of seeps from every pore of my being. I am very different than my peers in many ways. Most girls are looking for the guy that everybody thinks is the shit, not the quiet nerdy guy who spends all day on reddit and playing guitar. I did an experiment a while back with okcupid. I made myself a wingman profile. I got the idea from a reddit post a few years back, and it was an eye opener. All I had to do was use a picture of some douchebag fraternity kid with his collar popped and said my interests included getting wasted and playing beer pong. His inbox was overflowed with young hotties who just wanted a piece of this retarded action. Meanwhile my real profile has sat there for over 2 years now with only about 2 or 3 messages from girls that I have interest in meeting. I am really starting to hate my country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I agree with you in that <em>most girls</em> want that doucher guy who is this jock-esque &quot;bro&quot;. I&#39;m personally repulsed by stupidity, and I feel that a female&#39;s attractiveness comes from her ability to intelligently and coherently converse with me, especially about important topics of the day. Anyway, I&#39;d just tell you to be yourself and make sure you don&#39;t settle for someone who isn&#39;t your absolute ideal. It&#39;ll happen, just let the universe bring her to you. </p>

<p>You rule, mayne. You have this really awesome super-power called knowledge. You are a superhero and none of these women know it. Use that perspective as your confidence-base and your approach to women. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called Depression. Seems you&#39;re letting the whole economic/geopolitical landscape affecting your positive outlook on life.</p>

<p>You need to start learning to be happy with life again. People can detect the telltale signs of negativity, and that can put off people around you. Women like humorous, confident and secure minded men who are positive charged. Especially for a marriage partner. Women after the teen years begin subconsciously looking and sizing you up as the potential father of her children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question should be, do you want to be around a bubbly, clueless bobble head for more than a hook-up? I would say that depression is a pretty normal reaction to the spectrum of bullshit we are discovering about our over lords. </p>

<p>If OP is telling &quot;Nancy normal&quot; about his views on 9-11, financial slavery of the masses, Bilderburgs, de-population, etc. he will just scare the shit out of his new lady friend. I suspect fear dries up a vagina like a sponge.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, got to find a girl who shares the same interests. Fastest path to that is meeting one at some political rally. Second fastest way is to put a Personals ad on Craigslist stating: &quot;Wanted: girl who knows how to treat tear gas trauma, loves quiet walks in the rain, pina coladas, and  has gunsmithing skills.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t mix conspiracies or actual world issues and getting laid. I saw some issues as well when I went through a period of telling girls and people how &quot;IT IS&quot; and how the world works during a social setting. Even if you get through to a girl that things are messed up in the country or indoctrinate them on how the genders differ and how they work, they don&#39;t care and will not reward you for opening them up to truth. Flat out women want to have fun and they want to have it with the most confident non worrying alpha they desire. Be yourself, so yes you fight for liberty but you do it with the confidence in knowing you know the truth and she will follow. Ignorance is bliss for some losers have normal girlfriends and some successful men can&#39;t find a date because they think too much.</p>

Oh ya, the girl stuff...well the people you meet there are all very nice people who want to make a difference, so you&#39;ll be surrounded by good hearted people who won&#39;t only give you the time of day but get you coffee.  Best yet, if you&#39;re in a position where you have no choice to interact with people the honeys have no choice but to talk to you.  Mind you this hasn&#39;t worked for me yet, but I&#39;ve gotten a number and met plenty of new friends.  Just have to ask the group if anyone wants to go for a friendly beer afterwards...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just all because of your knowledge. Think about how much time you have to meet that someone between work, writing, playing music and working on computers. That takes a great a great deal of your time. When do you put yourself in a position to meet women? If you&#39;re waiting for her to just show up it&#39;s gonna take some time, you need to go on the hunt like you do for information. It&#39;s tough out there though but this is why we have so many dating sites, which I think is a good idea for a guy who doesn&#39;t have much time for the hunt. It could also help narrow down your choices to mainly women who wants and knows the truth. Your knowledge is a gift not a curse, maybe it;s just how you convey it. You have to be careful how you approach the sheep or you&#39;re going to spook them all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could just be the constant pressure and feelings you obtain from being &quot;woken up&quot; could be affecting you in ways that it didn&#39;t before. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re doomed to be alone, I just think your ideal woman isn&#39;t in a broad range, so you&#39;re going to have to look harder. Fortunately, I think it&#39;ll be good for you because you&#39;ll have someone much more unique than the average girl.</p>

<p>Also what hanahou said.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if this is seen as an obsession; people spend too much of their lives catering to their own sexuality. Indulge, then spend the other 90+% of your time pursuing your real interests</p>
