    <div class="md"><p>Another good movie is The Light Bulb Conspiracy.</p>

<p>The thing is, this isn&#39;t a conspiracy. Planned Obsolesce is a fully disclosed known thing that they each in economics classes at Unis. Apple was sued in the late 90s because they refused to sell replacement batteries for their eyePods and told people to just buy a new one (which is why they&#39;re required to sell batteries, even though you&#39;ve gotta take the damn thing apart yourself to replace it).</p>

<p>Very few things are really made to last today. Some high end things like expensive knives, non-US cars and (sadly) firearms actually are designed to have a long lifespan. If consumers would be willing to pay more for higher quality stuff, and not buy the shit at Sprawl-Mart, then this would change. But with the way things have been going, there isn&#39;t even that much high end quality stuff left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because if you make one light bulb you can sell it for a high price once...every 30-50 years. Shit if you watch the light bulb conspiracy documentary it will answer your question, but long story short...it&#39;s more profitable for the customer to keep coming back consistently and in short periods of time rather than them buying one nice expensive bulb and not needing to buy another one for decades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to work in a point-of-sale manufacturing company back in the early 90s. Our system used a CRT with a touch-screen overlay. There was a single component inside the CRT (a flyback coil) that was driven above its operational specifications and it made the part fail consistently right after the warranty expired. This was planned obsolescence by the monitor manufacturer.</p>

<p>As soon as we discovered this, we changed monitor sourcing, and we offered our customers an extended monitor warranty exchange policy. I repaired dozens of otherwise totally dead monitors by replacing this single over-driven part. In many cases I actually ended up replacing this flyback coil a second time (after my original replacement provided another year&#39;s service). There was no easy way to put a beefier part in place of the overdriven one (without other design changes).</p>

<p>Many companies sell products that are not intended to last and some sell products with kill-switches and other failure triggers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve suspected the same thing for a while now; in the automotive industry in particular. Cars just have a really annoying tendency to give up and die after a certain amount of years.</p>

<p>My mother bought only Subaru hatchbacks all while I was growing up, and after having three in a row break down utterly almost immediately after the warranty expired, I think she wised up.</p>

<p>Cell phones and other electronics follow this trend as well. The original 1989 Gameboy could be dropped, smashed, run over by a car and left in damp basement for a decade, and the one I have still works as well as it did the day I got it. A typical new model cell phone today can barely weather having a someone make a funny face at it without it needed replacement or repairs.</p>

<p>Could be a business model that is meant to force consumers into spending money on replacement devices more often than they would otherwise, or it could be a product of ever increasing push toward small and sensitive components, and cheap materials.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t proof, but it&#39;s yet another anecdote that points to something most people figure as common sense.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, are there any trade or consumer protection laws that disallow this type of &quot;lifespan by design&quot; a lot of modern electronic goods seem to have with them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of our electronic gadgets and personal possessions are made in China, and the Chinese don&#39;t mind selling we round eyes complete and utter crap that falls apart in your hand the second time you go to use it. I just had a power supply (made in China) fail on my router. A capacitor swelled and elongated to such an extent, it actually pushed a large patch of the plastic casing off the block, exposing its open interior, and creating a fire hazard behind my desk, for however long it continued to function with a hole in it.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t get well-made items again until they start being made in Europe and North America. As long as they are made in China, they are going to be trash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That made me wonder about the laptop fires... perhaps a few batteries that were over-driven failed catastrophically instead of steadily?</p>

<p>Also - the way the ink manufacturers argue about planned obsolescence &quot;our products have an optimum shelf life, which when passed can degrade quality and damage components, therefore we protect our consumers by using in built protections to ensure your experience is of the highest quality when using our products.&quot;</p>

<p>The same could be argued about laptop batteries... &quot;We want to ensure you get the longest battery life, and also we don&#39;t want people telling others that their laptops last 1.5 hours between charges when they&#39;ve had them 2 years. Therefore after a year, we ensure the batteries discharge too quickly to use, so that a new full-life battery can be bought.&quot;</p>

<p>At the special marked up price of that particular laptop case design... (SONY!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many things have been designed to fail. When lightbulbs first came into existence they were capable of burning for over 100 years. There is a lightbulb in a firehouse in America that has been burning for over 100 years. They even celebrate it every year with a small lighting festival. Anyhow, so long ago they created a committee to discuss the enormous lifespan of these light-bulbs.  </p>

<p>They called it, The One Thousand Hour Commitee. They aimed to reduce the lifespan of bulbs to one thousand hours, and they did it. They even managed to conveniently &quot;lose&quot; the alloy that was able to last so long...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Commodity hard drives coming in laptops over the last 5 or so years are simply garbage. WD&#39;s carry a 5 year warranty when you buy them OEM, 3 on the WD blacks I believe (or maybe it&#39;s blues 3 years and blacks 5, that&#39;s probably more likely). The first thing I tell anyone buying a new laptop, is to have an effective backup solution because you -will- be replacing the hdd within 2 years, no questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just marketing as usual. Plus they don&#39;t tell you all the specifics behind batteries. </p>

<p>The more times you plug it in to recharge the more you boil the chemical inside the battery. Eventually reducing the charge capacity of the chemical. If you run your electronics frequently than their recommend usage time. The faster you burn through the battery.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t leave it on the charger all night. Take it off as soon as the charge light comes on.</p>

<p>Also after a period of charges your chemicals capacity to hold a charge is reduced. Your charge indicator will show full, but it&#39;s reading that the battery is full of the current amount of electrons inside the battery. Which after a few months would be half of what it once was. Then you get mad as it shuts down earlier, and you go back into the vicious cycles of recharging again, and again thus eventually reducing the charge capacity of the chemical.</p>

<p>Always buy a larger capacity battery, and don&#39;t keep charging all night long. They don&#39;t shut off, but continue to cook the chemical. </p>

<p>I learned this from a battery tech on tips to sustaining longer life out of my battery for my cell and laptop on lithiums. </p>

<p>Are you for real?  It&#39;s called &quot;built-in obsolescense&quot;.  It&#39;s been around as long as consumer goods have been.  You&#39;re justified in being pissed off about it, but not for thinking this is something new or that you just discovered it!  Welcome to the marketplace. </p>

<p>If the cost of labor to fix/replace parts/etc is greater then the cost of a new device, and you take into account increases in speed/reduction in size (productivity, etc) than you shoot for that.</p>

<p>Otherwise if you spend too much money upfront your device is too expensive and no one buys it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fucking battery. It&#39;s their nature for performance to degrade, and every single battery in existence will need to be replaced as a part of normal maintenance. </p>

<p>You should be so lucky that your using a lithium ion battery, where performance only degrades about 5% a month compared to 20% monthly degradation of nimh batteries. </p>

<p>They dont have a 12mo warranty because the battery is going to fail after that, they have a 12mo warranty because they want you to have a battery that lasts at least that long. </p>

<p>Expecting more than that is just not doable, because the technology doesn&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>If you take care of your battery, don&#39;t fully discharge it all the time, etc. you can make it last much longer, but companies can&#39;t err on the side of customers knowing how batteries work, because most don&#39;t. </p>

<p>You need to read up on how batteries work, and do a little simple math, and you&#39;ll see why it&#39;s literally impossible to warranty a laptop battery for more than 12 months. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, downvoted without reason. Typical. </p>

<p>Ok, I&#39;ll go over this again. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take apple as an example. They warranty their battery for 12 months, and say that the battery should work at least 50% as good as new during those 12 months. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/batteries/replacements.html">http://www.apple.com/batteries/replacements.html</a></p>

<p>Lithium-ion batteries typically have a performance degradation of about 5% per month. </p>

<p><a href="http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/lithium-ion-battery.htm">http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/everyday-tech/lithium-ion-battery.htm</a></p>

<p>So, assuming typical performance, a lithium-ion battery should perform only 40% as well as it did new after 12 months. </p>

<p>Meaning that even under standard conditions most people could be able to replace their batteries due to normal wear and tear. </p>

<p>For a company to offer any warranty beyond 12 months on a battery is ridiculous. </p>

I&#39;m buying new batteries at least once per laptop simply because the rest of the machine is functional and I like being able to take it places without cords dangling all over. I had a business level HP N3438 or something, it came out in 1998 and I acquired it in about 2002, I was still using it in 2006-2007 with an hour and a half battery life, consistently. 6-12 months of the same treatment with any laptop I&#39;ve had since that HP renders the battery completely toast, and with most manufactures only warrantying their batteries for 6 months I&#39;m out about 90 dollars OEM or 60 dollars for a higher capacity chinese knockoff, each of which will only last about 6-12 months again at best anyways.</p>
