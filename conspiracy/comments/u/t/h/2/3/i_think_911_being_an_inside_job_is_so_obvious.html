       Granted, there's allot of people who are just misinformed, or, in denial. I was one of those people for many years, and suffered from a bit of both. Though, for the experienced researcher it's cut and dry, and totally transparent. 9/11 was an inside job, there isn't a doubt in my mind, and there hasn't been even the trace of a doubt for 3 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any one of you that have invested any significant portion of yourselves, your time, your analysis, your logic and reason to shedding light on the darkest corners of deep politics, knows what I'm talking about. It is the grim, stark truth, that I'm sure none of us wanted to ever conclude. But, we are not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's thousands of self confessed architects, engineers, demolition experts, and industry experts ON OUR SIDE. They all know, as sure as the sun shines, that 9/11 was an inside job. Many of which have dedicated their own time, energy, resources, THEIR VERY LIVES, to spreading the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not let 9/11 be the yardstick we use to measure other researchers on this forum and others? We certainly would have to make room for new minds in the process, and it would be a fine line between the two. One would have to apply careful analysis to posing such questions to people, as, we don't want to scare away new minds still incapable of thinking outside of the box, but, genuinely interested..

       Can you read? I thought I made it clear that allot of people are simply misinformed, and that I myself was one of them for MANY FUCKING YEARS.

       You are trolling when you consistently use "allot" aren't you? I mean, if I were a conspiracist I'd start to think that your poor comprehension and diction were intentional to make conspiracists look like ill-educated nut jobs.

       You used "allot" in the first sentence of the post. I am sure you are aware of the ridicule this particular spelling mistake receives on reddit which is why I am so surprised you made it, it's almost as if you used "allot" on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you assume I am aware comprehension of language has nothing to do with the message? I actually think being able to accurately articulate the message is very important indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was 9/11 an inside job? At this point it is incredibly difficult to disseminate what actually happend. Unfortunately we will probably never know for sure since all the crucial evidence was apparently shipped off to China. To be honest with you I really haven't had the time to form a properly informed opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have yet to come across anything that removes all reasonable doubt from my mind, I am certainly open to the possibility though. I don't think it's too crazy an idea for governments to do something like this, I mean the scale would have been unprecedented but I don't think the underlying motive would be particularly novel.

       If you must know the truth I'm 34 years old, and I haven't been in school in in 16 years. However, I make very few errors of any sort. Recently, I've noticed a trend, of people using
       <em>
        allot
       </em>
       in place of
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       . I saw it so frequently in fact, that I began to question my own use of the two. It's always pissed me off that there isn't a single word for "a lot". Why not just put the two together and get it over with for Christs sake. I'm making a new fucking word, it means
       <em>
        a fucking lot
       </em>
       , it is spelled
       <em>
        alot
       </em>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for helping to bring this new, wonderful fucking word into existence...

       Financial Transactions in the days before the attacks suggest certain individuals used their foreknowledge to make money off the attacks through insider trading:
      </p>
      <p>
       Unusual amounts of put options the two airlines stock used in the attack – United Airlines and American Airlines
      </p>
      <p>
       An excess of put options placed on reinsurance companies expected to pay out billions to cover losses from the attack – Munich Re and the AXA Group
      </p>
      <p>
       Erratic rise in put options on financial services companies stock hurt by the attack – Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., and Morgan Stanley and Bank of America

       Unusual spike in call options of a weapons manufacturer expected to gain (business) from the attack – Raytheon

       Personally, I am still amazed by the looks on the faces of people when I tell them that 3 towers collapsed in NY that day. Ignorance about the facts is what the official story relies upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am shocked at the volumes of people who have no idea that there was a 3rd tower "pulled". The response is either pure enlightenment, like a light bulb turning on or it is sheer terror.

       dieselphiend I'm on your side but people like you seriously harm our cause, you only make one sided arguments and then refute anyone willing to question them. Yes there are over 1500 qualified architects and engineers openly refuting the official story as part of the ae911 movement but there are much more professionals who don't, do you see where that's a problem using that statistic as evidence (I've done it before that's why I'm saying this)? We need to rely on hard facts like the WTC 7 collapsing at freefall speed for 1/3 of its descent as stated in the official NIST report. Any engineer will tell you a building can't fall at freefall speed unless all of it's support columns have been severely compromised. They are more or less putting down the "first tall building to ever fall from fire" at "hundreds of degrees below the current fire rating for serious structural compromise to occur" to some form of one in a billion random event but still, the types of people who will argue using the information in the NIST report will forever continue to do so until their own government say otherwise, this is just the way it is, sad I know but make sure you aren't using easily refuted arguments when you claim to be using proof or evidence.

       Non 9/11 believers should be ridiculed. Either 1: they aren't doing the work (to find the truth). Or, 2: they are a government agent. There is no three, and there is no grey area. IT'S THAT OBVIOUS.

       No there isn't. There is not more "professionals" who say the official explanation was right. Show me some.

      <p>
       "I could be a self confessed wizard from the fifth realm of Hullaballooland", What? I think you're confused. If I'm a demolition expert claiming 9/11 was an inside job, that has weight, that means something. Now, if I can go even further and prove that I'm an expert it carries even more weight, and that is the case with these people. They are proven industry experts, not people making false claims...

       No one should be ridiculed, people should be educated and if they refuse to be educated that's their own decision, leave them be. Ridiculing them only pushes them further away, doesn't help your cause.

       I believe if you look up the number of professional architects and engineers in the world the number will be up somewhere in the hundreds of thousands if not higher. It just so happens only
       <del>
        1500
       </del>
       1700 (ae911 official figure) have officially put their name to the cause (that's not saying there's not more but until they all put their name to the cause any guess as to the numbers is simply speculation)

       I'm not confused, you're uneducated as to the meaning of the term. Self confessed means you confess something to/by yourself. Anyone can be a self confessed ANYTHING, doctor/lawyer/wizard/proctologist doesn't make it true. I see what you were trying to say but you used a term that completely destroyed any validity to the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I do value the stance you are taking, the ability to think for oneself and question things is of immeasurable value but there are certain ways to provide the information you have if you want your point to have an effect on those who aren't already convinced

       They have a religion that is unlike most other religions in that it condones lying, cheating, stealing, and murder.  It sounds so outrageous that you initially think it can't be true, but you look into it and it is.

       I think you mean zionism, for to blame all jewish people would be nothing more than a basic racist sentiment. If you look through the christian bible it condones all sorts of atrocities but to say every born christian believes and follows them would be completely unfounded.

       You're conveniently ignoring the parts of my original post emphasizing careful judgement when applying this test.

       People are apathetic, they simply don't want to be bothered because they literally feel powerless. Yes, they should be ridiculed, because they are not powerless, but powerful. Them standing idly by the wayside is what's damaging this country, we need their numbers.

It just so happens only 1500 1700 (ae911 official figure) have officially put their name to the cause (that's not saying there's not more but until they all put their name to the cause any guess as to the numbers is simply speculation)"

       That doesn't mean any industry expert which hasn't signed on to A&amp;E For 9/11 Truth, DOESN'T BELIEVE, THAT'S TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

Total failure of critical thinking on your part right there.

       The second video is really getting to me. They show a list of all the "professionals" that are part of their group. Most of which are architects. I work in this industry and architects don't know shit about structural integrity of a building. That's why structural engineers are hired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Architects are sort of like interior designers, except more interested in building code.

       Joel Miller speaks at 5:44 and is an architect. They try to validate him by showing he worked on high rise buildings (I've worked on bigger). As an architect, his time was probably spent determining egress routes and the directions that doors will inevitably open. Oh and let's not forget the amount of handicap washrooms required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strike 3

       Then they go off onto Building 7. The word phrase "experienced minor damage" was used. I don't know. That sounds like an assumption.

       It was also mentioned that all the towers fell "symmetrically". Annoying, I know. It's like these people don't understand that the structural design of a building that holds it up straight, is the same means that allows it to collapse straight down.

       That's all I can really say after 7.5 mins of watching this crap. I won't watch anymore. I expect that they'll talk about melting steel, which if brought up means they know jack shit about things.

       It made sense to me. The structural integrity of the buildings was harmed greatly with the plane crashing into them. The fires burned for a while, which simple chemistry will tell you that the structural frame of the building lost integrity. Steel doesn't have to melt for it to lose most of its structural integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the enormous weight above, the support gave out and the building pancaked down to the next floor, and that force creates the chain reaction because the building isn't designed for a chunk of the building to pancake down.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have to remember that the internal structure (shown in that picture) is unharmed on the floors below. The collapsing building is creating a pushing force on it, cause the rest of the floors to come down quickly (giving the impression of a free fall).

       I worked in the building trades for my whole life also... what finally made me realize that our government had a hand in it, and didnt just have "knowledge" of the event was the perfectly precise cuts on the 2'x2' columns. Yes they are cut on different angles, you'd have to to get them to stack neatly side by side. The excuse for these perfect precise cuts was clearing debris to rescue possible survivors ....
       <strong>
        BULLSHIT!
       </strong>
       If I or any person who has worked in demo or worked any REAL job would NEVER take the extra time and care it would take to do these precise cuts while they are "supposedly" trying to clear the debris as fast as they can to maybe rescue some people. Look closely at the images of the cut columns, if your in the trades you should say,"WTF? Who would waste all this time cutting those so precisely while people may be fighting for life below their feet??!?" I can get you the images I am talking about. Here they are in this:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTIFmcE8ZjY">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTIFmcE8ZjY
       </a>
       . They also discuss the "Burning Woman", (who was NOT standing in that "cool breeze" when the plane struck) basic physics, the molten steel under building 7 many days later, and a few images of the precision cut columns. Please use your knowledge of construction while you watch. TY, enjoy.

       I've spoken to engineers and architects and they say a similar thing. I agree it does make sense. The only point I would push back on is the pancake effect giving any kind of impression of free-fall. Each floor which is impacted during the collapse provides resistance (unless they are all compromised at once) therefore the resistance of each floor slows the collapse. Of course, as the weight above increases, the resistance provided decreases. Anyway, I don't know. It's an interesting but never-ending debate.

       So an old decrepit wood and stucco building and a building destroyed in a massive 5.6 earthquake that still don't look anything like what we saw is really the closest?  Yet it happened 3 times in the same day within hours on 9/11, and I am expected to think "there is no reason to question what we are told or ask for an independent investigation that actually follows national standard?"

       It fell in the direction it went mainly for gravity. The structural supports of the building are designed to hold the building up straight. It is essentially an anti-"moment of inertia" design, so a big gust of wind doesn't blow over the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume your "greatest resistance" argument is an attempt to imply that the top would tip off or something like that? I think it's up to you to show where the moment of inertia would occur and whether it would have the force to actually move the massive amount of weight.

       You admit that nothing like this has ever happened, and then ask for me to prove that 47 stories of reinforced structural steel crumbling straight down makes more sense than it crumbling in the direction of the supposed fire that allegedly consumed a whole side of the building?  Un-fucking-real. I would love to get some sort of proof to show you one way or another, but they refuse to release the modeling data or building blueprints so NO ONE can prove shit either way, relevant information is classified because "disclosure may jeopardize public safety".  Yet I need to do the proving that they are lying and without any of the needed data while they don't need to prove this utter nonsense?
      </p>
      <p>
       You really expect me to believe that they cannot allow engineers to learn how to make sure this never happens again... for my own safety? How fucking insulting. People like you defending this absurd nonsense are so highly suspicious it makes my skin crawl.

       9/11 was the catalyst our government needed really get things in motion to start the take-over of our country.  Since 9/11, our rights have slowly been disappearing, police have become more militarized and more brutal, the HUGE building in Utah being built to store massive amounts of data, etc etc etc. The list goes on, but if nothing is done soon, we are in deep, deep shit.

       Some decent stuff in there, its the simple things that really make me question 9/11. These so called terrorists take over passenger airliners and fly them into their targets with masterful precision (seems legit). No interceptions from fighter jets (seems legit) hey its ok the lads were a bit busy that day, was anyone held accountable for such a miserable fail in national defense? Meanwhile the commander in chief is innocently reading a book to school children..hahahahahaha seems legit. Then these steel framed towers collapse at free fall speed from fire, the first in history to ever accomplish such a feat, then building 7 having not even been hit decides to go along for the ride, seems quite legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Bin Laden was offered up as the mastermind behind it all, even tho he said he supported the attacks but never took responsibility, something a terrorist organization would most certainly do had they pulled off such an attack. So they invade Iraq, ahh a country that had nothing to do with the attacks, but the terrorists are there right? Meh fuck the terrorists, theres weapons of mass destruction here! We are going to find them and save America! Wait wait, cant find any, doesnt matter because there is an evil dictator Saddam Hussein here! We shall have this motherfucker hanged so we can take over the country (behind the curtains) and save America! These series of events seem quite legit to say the least.

       Then there are people like me that have a very well rounded education, and realize that large planes crashing into buildings, whose support super structure is severely damaged by the spine of the plane crashing through it, might make the building fall down the way it did, as the building was originally designed to do.

       A plane didn't even hit building 7 but it still just crumbled to dust. It still is beyond my cognitive abilities to fathom how anyone could watch the film of building 7 falling and think "yup, this is clearly just normal office fires and there is no reason to think otherwise". There are hundreds of reasons to question the official story, but this is the biggest one to me. This is just so clearly and obviously not "normal office fires", how could anyone be so gullible?
      </p>

       If you have not seen building 7 falling take a moment please, most people don't even know that building 7 existed let alone have seen it fall.

       WTC 7 was one of the most damaged buildings by the fall of WTC 1, and had uncontrolled fires throughout.  I'm thinking that could have done it in pretty easily if the bottom supports we're severely damaged.

       yes, but the aftermath of that collapse will help determine if it was due to damage from falling debris or not. Saying it

       Citation NEEDED. Because in order for those towers to be built they had to submit a demolition plan before they could start construction on them to safely remove them... the "plan" for demolition that was submitted AND APPROVED! was using a nuke. Yes this is the way these towers were "DESIGNED" originally. SO as far as these structures were "DESIGNED" to collapse inside themselves... I NEED (and have looked for for years) your proof of this claim. Because your insinuation sounds NOTHING like the nuke they were "DESIGNED" to require.

       Look at the design of the building, and look at where the planes hit.  If the super structure in the center of the building was damaged, then warped and weakened by the burning jet fuel, and buckled under the weight of the floors above them, which direction will it fall?  It will fall down, being pulled by gravity, as large chunks fell off the sides of the building as well, into the streets below.  This is by no means hard to comprehend, unless you don't understand physics or gravity, but you probably think the  government paid them off too.

       What extra weight? This structure held that weight for years. The plane was not 10 times the weight of the entire structure, like the floors were DESIGNED to be able to hold. "Buckled" interesting word choice, it implies a movement you dont see in the collapse, you see fatiguing from a fire that didnt exist (but for a few moments (the massive fire ball was 95% of the fuel)) and a principle that items falling always travel the path of
       <strong>
        most
       </strong>
       resistance. (You call it "gravity" in this scenario)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain it this way, if I drop a marble on top of a stack of books, does the marble (still following REAL gravity) go THROUGH the books? Or does it roll off to the side and fall? One is the path of
       <strong>
        most
       </strong>
       resistance, one is just following gravity and physics. There are MANY examples of steel structure buildings collapsing sideways from damage. And the freefall speeds of the top of the structure means that nothing impeded its fall, meaning that the entire bottom of this structure just "gave up" and offered no opposition to the tops descent. Then when this incredible heavy and indestructible top section got to the ground and it itself gave up and crumbled apart... who doesnt understand physics?

       You really don't understand how following the path of least resistance works.  You are comparing a marble and books, to broken concrete and re-bar with a lot of weight and support structures that have been broken and/or fractured.  Following a path of least resistance is better used when describing fluid dynamics, not large buildings and concrete, which are experiencing the pull of gravity, and dealing with heat and friction.  Even though you say the plane was destroyed pretty much on impact, the spine of the plane, which runs it's entire length, would have been thrust through the support columns, doing massive damage to the super structure.  Also, the towers were designed to withstand a plane impact...  From a smaller prop plane, not a fully loaded jet liner.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fuel was gone in the first 10 minutes?  Yes, but the rest of the fuel within the building was still there.  Desks, papers, computers, personal items.  You name it, it was on fire.  And it was spreading.  Fire went blasting through the elevator shafts, and spread to other floors, weakening other supports as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example of how a building could buckle like this is by watching a martial artist break a stack of bricks.  Imagine, instead of a fist coming down on top of the bricks, you have a massive amount of weight falling towards it.  If you have spacers in between the bricks, aka the floors of the buildings, the kinetic energy from the top brick breaking pretty much breaks the rest of them with very little effort.
      </p>

       I think you are overestimating the actual stability and strength of skyscrapers.

       Oh

       explain to me how straight up and down 2'x2' steel columns is the easiest path to go straight down on... lets try this thought experiment (try it real life if it helps (-;) take a pencil stand it straight up and down, and put your hand on top of it, then push down REAL HARD... then tell me how going the direction straight down the pencil is the path of LEAST resistance. (Your theory is gonna hurt if you can REALLY shove your hand down through that direction... also proving the center core would still be standing after the "pancake theory" of your all knowing Gods have told you to trust.) unless by some miracle the pencil "buckles" like in your "Official theory" says.

      <p>
       NO! Fluid dynamics FOLLOWS the "path of least resistance" principle of physics. This is why we place steel columns DIRECTLY on top of steel columns. Same for house construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       No it was designed to withstand the impact of a jetliner, just not specifically for a jetliner that didnt exist yet... derrr! It would have withstood just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Office fires (as you admitted was all that remained) CANNOT create the temperatures your talking about.. NEVER EVER EVER has this happened ... look up the Madrid hotel fire.. 22 hours, didnt fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no matter what, tell me why the bottom section just "gave up and surrendered" and offered not even the slightest resistance... ever hear of "equal and opposite reaction" it states that whatever destroyed the bottom sections would have equally destroyed the top sections. As they underwent the same forces (if the official theory is true) meaning that as it collapsed one floor below the floor above applying the force would also receive a "floor destroying" impact and be self destroyed. This basic principle is evident in using a hammer and a nail, would you use a soft hammer? No you want something that can withstand the force and survive. Here the top floors are made of the EXACT SAME material, yet only the lower sections are destroyed until the entire top section destroys all the lower sections then it itself destroys itself??? NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE!!!!

       "Inside job" is such a broad term, and means so many things to different people. I'm convinced that the Israelis knew about the attack before it happened, and that very likely they had agents planted inside the terrorist organization that planned and carried out the attack. I'd say that the first is 100% likely, and the second maybe 80% likely. But I wouldn't say that makes it an inside job. I doubt anyone in the Bush administration or the CIA or the Pentagon knew about the attacks in advance. Does that make me suspicious? It's simply what I believe, based on my best judgment.

       It is one of many valuable litmus tests you can apply to someone, especially those who profess to be truth tellers.  If you don't know by now that 9/11 was a false flag operation you're either a deceitful shill or lacking in intelligence.  Both are very unfortunate failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Failing this litmus test makes you untrustworthy.  Try it on this thread.  You'll quickly get a list of people you cannot trust.

       Hello! I've arrived to announce that I don't believe that 9/11 was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I know that I'm not a deceitful shill, clearly I must possess incredibly low intelligence, presumably way below an IQ of one hundred. It's a wonder I can even open a door!
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously I will have to be fired from my job, which requires a high level of intelligence, and which I seem mysteriously to somehow be able to do, despite my alleged lack of mental integrity.

       For those types, we have more litmus tests.  However 9/11 is still a good first-pass filter.  Look at all the hasbarats on this thread that have exposed themselves by failing.

       I look at it like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say it was a false-flag operation which is a possibility based on a previous planned operation but against Cuba. [Operation Northwoods]
      </p>
      <p>
       Say it was a massive cover up operation, perhaps the largest this country has ever known.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you going to do about it? Stand on a soapbox and speak about the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Scream it at the top of your lungs until your throat ruptures and your voice becomes hoarse and you're forced to carry signs?
      </p>
      <p>
       People will walk by and look at you like the person you act like-an insane nutjob.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you didn't spout it about as if you are some sort of epicenter sending out waves of truth, maybe people would listen and think about what you are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you call someone who doesn't believe it was a false-flag operation untrustworthy, that invokes a reaction in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will think "Oh, he already thinks I'm either an untrustworthy shill or an untrustworthy person who lacks intelligence. Fuck him, Now I'm never going to change my mind"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entertaining, You set it up to where most everyone will fail so you'll be able to keep your worldview that you are this beacon of truth and light, the only person in the world with open eyes in a sea of ignorance and stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes incredible arrogance to think that you can merely state what you believe and it'll change people's minds and magically fix everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that isn't what you are trying to do, Please enlighten me on what it is that you intend.

       Might be, might not be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the likelihood of it being closer to something that was allowed to happen is more than it being a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know, it was all planned out from a long time ago. The government pisses off Al-Qaeda and then wait for them to do something and when they start to move the government watches them and keeps information on them but does nothing to allow it to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether I think it was or not is irrelevant, if I don't think it was I'll get labeled untrustworthy and a shill and all that would do is dig my heels deeper into not thinking it was. If I think it was, what am I going to do? Go out and look like a nut because no one will believe me? I'd look like one of those fundamentalist zealots preaching about the end times on the streetcorner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damned if I do, damned if I don't. That's why I really don't give a fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I will be absolute on is the fact that 9/11 was used as justification to go into a country where it was used as a stepping stone to invade another country under the pretense of "WMD'S!"

       I will agree there. Take all words with suspicion and think about them for yourself, come to your own conclusion. If it doesn't change what you have already concluded about your beliefs beforehand, all that means is that you disagree and can begin to think about debating said person.

       "Allot" is not a word. And proper grammar is "there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       a lot of people who are just misinformed". You need to learn when to use 'are' and when to use 'is'. If you're going to be going around the internet, speaking on the topic of 9/11 truth, you need to sound as intelligent and coherent as possible. I don't want anyone representing us badly.

       Your comment got caught in the filter. Here is why that happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have been shadowbanned by an admin (I am not an admin. I am a lowly subreddit moderator. I have no idea why this happened).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, until you resolve this matter, you have been banned from this subreddit.

       No telling, but please read the link. If you have an issue, I assure you it isn't with me... it is with an admin (one of the reddit, inc. employees who actually get paid). Moderators cannot shadowban. Please, read the link, because at present (despite your sockpuppet votes), you're just being an ass (unnecessarily, to the wrong person).

       So do I blow this admin or what. I read the link before commenting and it doesn't explain anything to me in terms of how to get unbanned or how to get the admin's dick in my mouth.

      <p>
       Far from as being an ass, I think I was echoing cometparty's comment not attacking him or anyone else. But I guess appearing to be wrong is just as bad as being wrong. Notice I'm using a 2nd sock puppet, as the first was instantly banned as well. Nice!

       Another r/conspiracy mod here. Maybe the reason you were shadow banned to begin with is due to your less than intelligent analysis and your less than cordial responses to people when they try to help you out. We have decided amongst ourselves (the mods in r/conspiracy) that we should immediately ban users when they are shadow banned (I.e their comments go straight to the spam filter and no one can see them any way.) to alert that user as their shadow ban status. You would have now way of knowing if you were shadow banned or not unless a moderator lets you know. The reddit admins might not like our policy of telling shadow banned users of their ban status, but it's not like we care about them anyways. So long story short, be nice here. And everywhere for that matter. The Internet isn't some other dimension where you can talk to people however you want and not expect some kind of waves to come back at you. I've never been shadow banned and I talk about some of the craziest stuff. The difference? Respect. Learn it.

       I have only gotten less than cordial after being banned. So sorry if I am so sensitive, but I don't think one funny, but RIGHT ON TARGET comment was too far out of line. I suppose being conspitarded makes you all extremely sensitive and after making one comment you felt I had to be banned. BANNED I SAY. Forever more to the hinterlands of the dimensions where those who are not nice must go to sit and think about what they did wrong and whatnot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference? Get over it. But if someone will look at my orginal comment and tell me exactly what is so ungodly wrong with it, then fine I'll move on. But people who are so thin-skinned they cannot take one barb of truth are not worthy of my respect.

       So basically, you're implying a very Christian mindset to this... "We shall discuss this and take in new minds, but anyone who doesn't think as we do is obviously wrong, and so we shall mock them and assume their intelligence to be null because they don't hold the same beliefs."
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying I lean one way or the other, I don't know many facts. I think there are veiled truths that neither side may have taken into perspective that haven't been considered, but w/e. I'm just gonna read through the comments to increase my base of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought I'd share how funny I thought your narrow minded statement was. Unless I read it wrong, in which case, my apologies.

       Don't think I did though =P

       Dieselphiend is being pragmatic.  9/11 doesn't really need to be debated anymore, because it's been figured out already.  We know it was a false flag, and we have the names of the people who were responsible.

       If you're not able to pass the 9/11 litmus test at this late stage in the game, I'm sorry, but you need to either get up to speed or stay out of the way.

       Why do people keep asking me this in different forms? Could you not glean from the many other responses to similar questions what my answer would be?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I must be so damn technical then I'd say, literally, if the person has seen "this, or this (documentary)" yet, still
       <em>
        adamantly
       </em>
       denies 9/11 was an inside job, is very questionable at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really all depends on how much research they've done. It would be easy to ask someone if they've seen The Truth and Lies Of 9/11, or another similar doc, would it not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like with the user Broc-Lee (brok-lee?). I'm familiar enough with his posts and opinions to feel very comfortable calling him a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at the alternative shall we: we allow not only potential disinformation agents into out community, but people damaging to spreading
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       truth...

       You do understand, however, that conspiracy theorists have been all over the largest terrorist attack in America since it happened over a decade ago, and a lot of false views and information has been put out into the media and across the internet, only to be spread and built upon by more and more conspiracy theorists until the truth is misconstrued and bent into whatever shape the minds of the individuals working with this information want it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who have issues with their government will obviously do everything in their power to put out discriminating evidence that they pull out of any small fact they can find until it all becomes a blur of facts, both true and untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you call 'real' truth is only your view and the view of many who may agree. There are those that have just as much proof against you as they do for you, that's just the way this thing works. When you discriminate against anything that could disprove your theories and call it false, then you're limiting the amount of truth that you are given, and in the end your knowledge becomes more opinion than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media twists the free thinkers as much as it does the sheeple. Once you finally realize that an organization built on stupidity is not full of only stupid people, and that there is an intelligent mind behind every even pseudo-successful organization or ploy, then you will realize that information can be false from any angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that any information you may have is true or false, I'm saying that you're limiting your capacity to understand these truths by discriminating against and belittling the concepts of those that may also have relevant information that you have not yet considered.

       Afghanistan has 70% of the world's opium don't forget. And anyway it's more than acquisition of natural resources, it's the systematic and ruthless destruction of the middle east (Iran being the next in line although the trade embargoes currently in place are already all out warfare even if it is
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       economic warfare.) The creation of fear from terrorists who can and will strike at any time given half a chance, the irrational fear this creates is so primal people lose all common sense and are throwing away their rights and freedoms all in the name of the "war

        of
       </del>

I usually type fast and if I am distracted while typing when I restart my current and previous thought might not coincide.

       If you want to get support for military efforts in the Middle East, the last place you want to go into is Afghanistan. It's a military hellhole that will bury you if you underestimate it which the American government clearly did. Unless the USA and NATO figure out a way to get out of Afghanistan cleanly, the USA as we know it will fall. Take a short look at Afghan history and you know you shouldn't be going there militarily unless forced to. So Afghanistan is still a horrible place to further your efforts because it will lead to your demise. Current events seem to suggest that this is already well underway for the US.

       I can't really agree with that, the US seems only to be increasing its ferocity and military prowess as time goes on and still they're only acting mostly within what's deemed acceptable to have reported in the mass media as to not cause up to much a stir, it could all get a lot, lot worse if it "needed" to.

       Yes, but they're never going to be able to get past Afghanistan, Afghanistan is going to be a thorn in their side unless they sit down and put major effort into dealing with the situation. The USA is stuck in a prolonged conflict it can't get out of and unless they miraculously manage to deal with it, it's going to drain funds and resources from other possible conflicts. Also, with no one learning from the financial crisis, there's another big shock heading for us in the very near future which might just be the final nail in the coffin for the system we have now.

       The plan all along has been to destroy this nation. They just spent the last 100 years acquiring OUR wealth. The deed is now done, the turkey is cooked. We are just witnessing the crumb snatchers stealing what remains. They are greedy internationalists with loyalty to no country. They literally have a vested interest in our destruction...

They have allegiance to no nation because they have an estate on each one, and bounce around to which ever country they aren't currently assaulting.

       Thanks for the info.

       The conversations here have been enlightening. I'm personally leaning toward not believing it's an inside job, at least not in the way that people discuss with controlled explosions and such. For me it would rather be a question of whether there was collusion with members of the American government and the hijackers to orchestrate the events of that day which to me could be entirely plausible from the level of contempt many governmental officials show towards their citizens. I do however wonder as to the motives behind this as anyone who sets up events where their country is forced into conflict in Afghanistan is either an idiot or extremely dangerous and insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to stay neutral on this matter for now, on two accounts. One, because I do not feel fully convinced yet one way or the other. Two, I'd rather put my focus on trying to combat the aftermath, such as the ridiculous invasion of privacy which has occurred since.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been a pleasure discussing with you fellows, even though by the looks of how my comments have been voted, I'm not sure whether you feel the same. I'll probably stop by this subreddit on and off, but not sure how much I'll comment.

       The day before 9/11 Rumsfeld announced the Pentagon couldn't account for $2.3 trillion dollars in defense appropriations. The Pentagons accounting department was expected to get to the bottom of it, unfortunately, the very next day that department, and most of the documents (pertaining to the investigation) were destroyed. The other portion of the documents which could have proven where the money went, were in the WTC complex.

       What's more? The Trans Afghan Pipeline (to be completed in 2014 with "troop withdrawal")is/was expected to transport trillions of dollars of oil and natural gas through Afghanistan, Pakistan and to ports on it's shores (for the 7 Sisters)...
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more? Opium production has skyrocketed (10 to 20 fold).

       The first two parts I'm not so sure of, will have to do some reading. The third part is a natural occurrence of the conflict, with people going to the most profitable cash crop.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the fourth point, if they want to go into Iran and surrounding areas through Afghanistan, they're fucking idiots. Nothing has done more to damage the view of American expansionism like Afghanistan. Hell, Afghanistan is the last place you want to go into if you want any form of support for future military efforts as a conflict in Afghanistan is going to be long and disastrous if you don't do it right.

       The last two directly correspond to the views of others. If you want power and control, you're not going to get very far if your allies and your own people start to oppose you. The American political infrastructure is crumbling and it won't be long before it implodes and something else comes in its place.

       When there is a fire in a steel tower, the heat needed to bend or warp the beams to the point of failure is IMPOSSIBLE. The structure acts as a gigantic heat-sink,  and it spreads out in a grid pattern from the source. This negates the temperatures needed to reach the point of failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, that's just the two main towers. Building 7 had very minor damage, yet literally imploded in a very controlled fashion. It fell at free fall speed because THERE WAS NO SUPPORT.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was explosions in the basement of the two main towers:

       If the jet fuel (which mostly burned on initial impact) was "atomized", then what forced it down the elevator shafts? The building had massive holes in it, it was a low pressure environment. Explosions take the path of least resistance, and that is out of the windows. All of the atomized fuel would have burned on impact, as we saw in the massive fireball...
      </p>
      <p>
       There was much more than "dust puffs". Look for yourself:

       I am aware of the 911 cover up myth as much as all others to be. However the government is not covering up an inside job, the government is covering up an extra-planetary attack. The evidentiary evidences are most clear that a cosmic weaponry was utilized forthwith in said attack. My research has indicated even the 911 cover up legend is a government creation to draw attention away from interstellar attack truth.

       While i do not think that 9/11 was an inside job, it was definitely not backed financially by the people we think did it... I have it on high authority that 9/11 was an operation funded in large by china.  This does not deflect the guilt of the bush administration.  They did have knowledge of the attacks prior to them being carried out.  There are several people in the FBI and CIA who tried to warn the higher ups about it and it was ignored because they wanted it to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 9/11 was an inside job many people who knew about it or even the workers who installed the explosives would have spoken up by now.

       Yeah, organized crime networks and government employees are of two different creeds.   I have to think that if it was an inside job atleast one person would have said something by now... But I am not saying the office of the president didn't have foreknowledge of the event, I think they did and just ignored it.  Doesnt mean they planned it.   Someone else planned and paid for it, they just let it happen.  Still an impeachable offense.

       Truthers make me laugh. They are passionate about their cause much like the freaks on "My Strange Obsession" and "Toddlers &amp; Tiaras". They revel in being the only ones who are the real keepers of the flame. They all have a need to not just be unique but to make sure everyone knows it. I'm guessing a lot of mommy or daddy issues from childhood.

       Well then if that's truly the case you are the holder of some very controversial opinions! Ties and posts relating to identifiable personal information. When you actively speak out against governments, big corporations and mechanical war machines sometimes it's best to have at least an outer layer of anonymity. Though I've probably already made enough slips on this account to be identified, oh well. In other words, paranoia.

       Literally right above, brock_lee said that you'd arranged your post in such a manner that doesn't allow for open discussion (true as you made very closed statements) your response? Called him a shill. That is by definition an ad hominem attack.

       No one should be ridiculed, people should be educated and if they refuse to be educated that's their own decision, leave them be. Ridiculing them only pushes them further away, doesn't help your cause.

       I believe if you look up the number of professional architects and engineers in the world the number will be up somewhere in the hundreds of thousands if not higher. It just so happens only

        1500

      <p>
       I'm not confused, you're uneducated as to the meaning of the term. Self confessed means you confess something to/by yourself. Anyone can be a self confessed ANYTHING, doctor/lawyer/wizard/proctologist doesn't make it true. I see what you were trying to say but you used a term that completely destroyed any validity to the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I do value the stance you are taking, the ability to think for oneself and question things is of immeasurable value but there are certain ways to provide the information you have if you want your point to have an effect on those who aren't already convinced

       People are apathetic, they simply don't want to be bothered because they literally feel powerless. Yes, they should be ridiculed, because they are not powerless, but powerful. Them standing idly by the wayside is what's damaging this country, we need their numbers.

       That doesn't mean any industry expert which hasn't signed on to A&amp;E For 9/11 Truth, DOESN'T BELIEVE, THAT'S TOTALLY RIDICULOUS. People from all classes in all fields are very fucking busy focusing on survival. Very few people have the time to research these things, and they unfortunately get their news from the MMS. Total failure of critical thinking on your part right there.

       There is a term for the form of argument you engage in, it's called
       <em>
        discourse
       </em>
       . Please don't waste any more of my time.

       I see two basically good people wasting their energy fighting each other over a minor tactical disagreement.

       Let's fight the enemy instead.

       That's the same old tired rhetoric a shill would spew forth. I hear it over and over again from your type. I don't give a fuck what you think, we don't need people like you. You are NOT a real person...
