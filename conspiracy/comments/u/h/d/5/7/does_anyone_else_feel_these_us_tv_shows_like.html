    <div class="md"><p>America has doctors who are among the best in the world.</p>

<p>That&#39;s different from having the best doctors, as a profession, in the world. Not only do we have a problem with access, we have problems with financial fraud and quality of care. We pay as if every visit were to a stellar doctor, but the reality is many doctors should not be practicing.</p>

<p>Similarly, we have police investigators, backed by forensic labs, who can turn solving a crime into a science - a real quest for the truth. But 99% of criminal cases are &quot;resolved&quot; by throwing a brown person in a jail cell, assigning them an overworked, mediocre public defender, and asking them how they like their chances, or would they rather negotiate a guilty plea.</p>

<p>Worrying about what others think of you has become more commonplace.  Just look at facebook and parts of reddit with people submitting photos of themselves seeking approval from others.  There&#39;s a subconscious fear that arises when one questions authority or goes against the way they&#39;re supposed to think like with 9-11 truth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While we&#39;re all here, does anyone else notice stark behavioral  differences between their TV watching friends and non-TV watching friends?</p>

<p>E.g: my TV watching friend always gets all co-dependent with his S/o&#39;s. Goes into debt for stupid shit(still paying off his ipad1), and works a 9-5 where he&#39;s treated like a sub- human every day. </p>

<p>While my non-TV watching friend trusts his S/O, has sworn off debt,  makes a little money on the side contracting out his talents, and spends the rest of his time learning things relevant to his interests.</p>

<p>I know correlation is not causation, but I&#39;m quite convinced that TV alters your perception of the world, and thus the choices your make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can confirm your theory. Moved a few months back and didn&#39;t get cable at my new apartment. Spend most of my time reading books,  learning new things, going for long runs/walks, and generally enjoying life more.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I still enjoy a good netflix session. I&#39;ll throw on a few episodes of a show for background noise or a lazy night in, but I don&#39;t have a DVR to set to watch the latest Jersey Shore or Apprentice. And it&#39;s amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit surprises me with that.  On one hand, redditors are against Christianity and Islam because it&#39;s what ancient societies used to control the masses and there&#39;s no proof of deities. (I agree)  </p>

<p>On the other hand, what TV says is doctrine to them.  For example: Oswald killed JFK, Bin Laden did 9-11, pancake theory brought down the buildings, McVeigh did <del>Columbine</del> the Oklahoma Bombing*, Iraq and Afghanistan were complicit in 9-11, and we&#39;re constantly under threat of terrorism.  </p>

<p>Ironically, they don&#39;t see that TV has been the new mechanism for societal control.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s great to have hindsight by realizing that religion was BS but it&#39;s unfortunate that people don&#39;t learn from that and apply it to today.  </p>

<p>TV anchors and salesmen are the new preachers.  If you want to join the cult of the flickering box go ahead but leave me out of it. </p>

<p>I hate to have to say this, but not everything is a conspiracy. When you start thinking like that it has the opposite effect: it makes you closed minded. And TV is a business, like any other, it appeals to demographics, tries to make popular &quot;products&quot;, etc. Now maybe some of these programs will appeal to those who like to be reassured of blatant lies, in which case they work similar to propaganda, but I doubt that everything on tv is like that.</p>

Broadcasters want shows that people will watch so that advertisers will pay them money or people will subscribe to their services or both. Both of the formats mentioned by OP originated in the UK - yeah we&#39;re pretty good at coming up with shitty shows - so I&#39;d say thinking of them as part of some grand conspiracy to shape societal values in the US is pretty far off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  Shows like family guy somehow attract the following audience with obnoxious &quot;we are smarter than everyone else&quot; type humor: (1) democrat that thinks almost exclusively within the paradigm of republican=dumb, democrat=smart, yet doesnt understand the concept of divide and conquer; (2) vocally anti-religious, except when it pertains to the Jews; (3) pro diversity and pro distribution of wealth but has no minority or poor friends, would never date or marry outside of their own race, and does not contribute to charity; (4) pro central banking and debt based currency, if they have any opinion about economic policy whatsoever.</p>

<p>This has been my general experience with family guy watchers.  They are usually ignorant, but think they are sharp as a razor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Repo Games and similar shows (Operation Repo, Lizard Lick Towing, etc.) are propaganda IMO. They portray the economically disenfranchised as stupid and violent in order to generate the impression that these people somehow deserve to get their shit took.</p>

<p>Repo Games is particularly guilty of this- for those who don&#39;t watch this show, it is conducted like a game show: the &quot;contestant&quot; must answer three out of five questions correctly. If they succeed, their vehicle is paid off in full; if not, their vehicle is repossessed. The questions are designed to highlight the ignorance of the contestant (i.e., what body part is the Venus de Milo statue missing, what were the three enemy countries in WWII) with the result that when someone&#39;s livelihood is on the line, the viewer is instilled with a feeling of antipathy instead of pity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what it is. On the one hand <strong>the show seems to indicate</strong> that <em>preppers</em> are legitimate in their &#39;prepping&#39; for rougher times.

    <div class="md"><p>Well like Undercover Boss. I believe to be legit. As a retired owner of several Subways. They showed an episode of Don Fertman Chief Development officer for Subway. Now in 1990  as an owner when Development would come up, and put pressure on increasing stores within 2 miles of current locations. This ticked me off big time. All they want is more gross revenue, and collecting 6% royalty. Not caring how it affects the primary store, and it&#39;s profitability. Then I met him at a Subway Convention in 1993. Fuck what an idiot douchebag. Never stepped in a store, and never knew how it worked. He couldn&#39;t make a simple sandwich. Just a party boy sitting behind a desk making decisions off the top of his head. </p>

<p>So yeah when they reiterated this on that episode and watching him operate in a Subway just to make a sandwich. That was him too a tee. The show is legit.</p>

<p>BTW when I watched what they offered the Subway employees. It&#39;s typical DeLuca (CEO). Cheap and not much giving.</p>

Corporations consolidate wealth and power to wield against the democratic process, thereby diverting the interests of the people away from responsible democracy and toward insatiable consumerism.

In lieu of personal responsibility, the masses pin their hopes on becoming the Cinderella darlings of benevolent robber barons. 300 million people all wishing--no, hoping--for the opportunity to be saved by a millionaire.

How can you be so cynical? these Millionaires have taken one entire week from their busy lives to make a <strong>TV program to self-promote and congratulate themselves</strong> for being so generous and so compassionate towards the very people that they despise and screw over every day.</p>

<p>The ruling class has spent the last 30 years vigorously buying Congress to ensure that it serves their selfish needs first. Today, they&#39;ve taken the time to pretend that the needs of other people suddenly matter. They shed a few crocodile tears on camera, but I don&#39;t think that they are conflicted. The tears aren&#39;t real. They are a prop used to ensure their ability to continue with their agenda.</p>

<p>Sure, the rich elite have been working to dismantle the middle class in America. They&#39;ve been stomping on your throats for decades, but in this TV show, they are making things better damn it! These simple acts of self-righteous giving, their boastful displays of  - fully tax deductible - donations and the way that they suppress any outward displays of revulsion for poor people while they are in their midst is indeed meant to soften your view. <strong>These TV programs are ADVERTISEMENTS before they are offerings.</strong> If they really wanted to do something to help others then they can do it in a far less shameful and arrogant manner. </p>

I literally stood up and shouted at the point when he walked into a suspect&#39;s house and attempted to beat a confession out of him.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not mocking, I&#39;m honestly wondering what you believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, but I lack the faith in human kind to believe that the quality of the programs is as good as it is despite the variety of parties involved with their production.</p>

<p>I mean, by saying that it&#39;s propaganda, you&#39;re implying that the government is in on the production somehow, reviewing scripts and episodes concepts, etc. And then you have the production crew themselves, the corporations that air the thing, and finally, the companies and CEO/Executives themselves who star in each episode. I find it hard to believe that that many people can all operate together and be on the same page.</p>

<p>The main dent in any propaganda theory is that the show features private companies from many different areas. You&#39;ll have chains like Subway, of course, but then you sometimes see comparatively smaller companies also get featured. Sure, you could reference the fact that most of those companies may have lobbyists or something implanted in Washington, but I don&#39;t really think that effects a CEO&#39;s private ideology that much, things like that are usually handled by a Board of Directors or the PR department.</p>

<p>Really, I just like to think that there are people at the top who genuinely care about their employees (especially when it effects their own bottom line, to be fair). I&#39;m of the mind that being the head of some corporation doesn&#39;t stop you from being human. You might get a case of an inflated ego, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>But maybe I&#39;m just brainwashed too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Secret Millionaire is actually a bit of a con.  The millionaires don&#39;t actually stay in the shitty rundown houses they claim to and in actual fact stay in nearby hotels.  <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/london/secret-millionaire-goes-home-and-is-carjacked-7734204.html">http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/london/secret-millionaire-goes-home-and-is-carjacked-7734204.html</a> - I saw another version of this article on the Daily Mail website in which it clearly said this guy was waiting to go back to his hotel.  The commenters picked up on this, there were many questions asked and the article was mysteriously edited to remove the mention of the car journey&#39;s original purpose.  I can confirm that the Edinburgh UK version of Secret Millionaire, in which the millionaire grew up in one of the shittiest parts of the city, led to the man himself being sighted in a top city centre hotel in the evenings during the filming period.  Scam, but makes for good television.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like Bear Grylls never goes on his extreme survival missions without a large film crew, off-camera catering facilities, mountain rescue teams on speed dial and a nearby luxury ski resort.  The sad truth is that people have died trying to emulate him without realising this.</p>

<p>There is usually much more to these things than meets the eye, and some critical thinking is often required.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Television is filled with social propaganda designed to change the way people look at various issues, such as socialism, abortion, woman&#39;s rights, homosexuality, debt, welfare, the military, race relations, capital punishment, and a host of other issues. Television is a tool for social engineering -- the changing of society to suit the agenda of those who control television. It has been so successful that most people will stoutly defend its various propaganda points, never realizing that they have been implanted in their minds, and that they have never actually considered them at all.</p>
