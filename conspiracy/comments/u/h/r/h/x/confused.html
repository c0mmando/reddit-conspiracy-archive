       Hi, I started reading about conspiracies on accident when I was 15(5 years ago) and everyone was always saying how the dollar was gonna be worthless, martial law, and whatnot. Along with other predictions every other week or so. And I stopped reading on those sites, because none of them ever came true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I read about them on and off, and I see the same predictions for this year.. My question is, do you guys really think we don't have a future anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this is a smaller uestion, but It just popped in my head. If all money is going to be worthless soon, why are there bills popping up having to do with the internet and whatnot? Nobody will be able to use internet without money..
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you, guys.

       There is a future. No one knows what it will be. The realm of possibilities is endless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most internet sites earn money based on how many people visit their sites and additional income if you then go to the site of one of their sponsors. One way to attract people is with extraordinary content. The best way to influence people is through fear. "
       <em>
        The-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it
       </em>
       " is both extraordinary and frightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most sites describe the future in terms of what they are selling. Sites that sell survival gear and/or gold will have the most dire forecasts and predictions. Sites that sell financial services will tell you how you can avoid what others will surely suffer by being smarter than everyone else and following their advice. Sites that sell alternative health will have articles that are soothing and hopeful. If the future were bright they would be selling shades.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a cycle to economics (human transactions). The downward part of that cycle is being manipulated in financial markets (money managers) and not successfully. Some people think it is because the edifice of (keynesian) economics is built on a false foundation. They want to abandon the whole system and try another one (austrian). Some people think if we just keep tinkering with the levers of control we can return to those thrilling days of yesteryear when everyone got richer.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the ways of tinkering is to "print" money (make entries into a computer). All the people and countries that borrowed money they can't repay can just make a new consolidation loan to pay off their old debts. The problem is that has been tried and didn't work. So it was tried again and it didn't work again. Now the people who print the money say we will give you a new consolidation loan but you have to promise to pay back your old debts and not spend the money on anything else (austerity). The people and countries who made the loans don't want to agree to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the value of the money decreases because there is so much of it. There is a concern that so much money has been put into circulation that the value will drop precipitously. The people who printed it are planning to take much of it out of circulation if that looks like it will happen. All these
       <del>
        shenanigans
       </del>
       decisions are deliberated in secret by unknown and unaccountable private parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from all this, people like yourself who are scouring the internet for information, are finding out that history is a lie, religion is mythology, education is a control systems, and government is a for-profit corporation. This is where the confusion arises: what is the most important thing to worry about?
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to avoid this confusion most people pick a favorite. Here are some suggestions: the US and Israel have exacerbated a natural disaster by their release of malware that caused the Fukushima extinction level event; Anglo-Americans are perpetuating endless war to expand their power and control; Zionists are trying to ignite a new "holocaust" so that their god will return to earth; the weather might change by a few degrees in a hundred years and force everyone to have to move to a new neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suggest you find a product or service that you can provide. Plumbing, gardening and similar skills may be more valuable in the future than information technology skills (especially if there is little or no electricity).

       Do you understand anything about stuxnet? It doesn't 'infect' siemens computers. It infects any windows pc and uses that to find potential targets
      </p>
      <p>
       It contains a payload specially designed to render a specific type of siemens
       <em>
        centrifuge
       </em>
       physically inoperable. It does this be exploiting the siemens control software to force the centrifuge into conditions the software would otherwise not allow.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the fuck does any of that have to do with the
       <strong>
        meltdown
       </strong>
       at fukushima?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuxnet only attacks a certain type of centrifuge and does damage to nothing else

       Do you have a harder source to look at on this, Julian? Also, do you think this is a form of technological blowback or an intended result for the designers?

       Edit: found the RT article you posted earlier.

       So the consensus seems to be that Israel was behind the modificaitions which changed stuxnet from a single shot thing to a spreading and self replicating siemens warbox hunter. Seems nefarious.

       No it's not. That isn't how stuxnet works. Stuxnet only has one payload for one type of device, which is the iranian centrifuge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuxnet spreads like wildfire in order to ensure it can propagate over the air-gapped network in a nuclear power plant.

       Honestly, don't waste your time telling the truth about Stuxnet to these morons, they don't want to hear it. I watched a report from a team of software engineers that investigated Stuxnet so they could find out what it could do and they were surprised that it didn't do any damage to any system that they unleashed it on. It infected the systems but wasn't interested in messing with things. They eventually discovered that the payload it was carrying was designed to attack the specific centrifuge in the Iranian plant so while you are correct expect downvotes because the vast majority of conspiracy nuts who search for 'the truth' disregard the truth when it contradicts their own deluded fantasies.

       Exactly.

       It infects any windows pc the same as it does siemens controllers. It's only the iranian model that gets the payload.

       Just because you and I would not commit the time, energy, money and man/hours to create a weapon like this does not mean others would not do it. Their intention was clandestine sabotage. The more damage they could do the better. They were so focused on doing as much damage as possible that they did not think about unintended consequences enough to prevent what has happened.

       The zionists (anglo-american as well as israeli) are in an endless war that must be constantly stoked to engulf the world. They don't care who dies - not you, not me, not even themselves.

       If someone claims a secret source gave them the info and they can't provide you anything more then their word of what they saw/heard they are probably bull shitting you, secret sources aren't going to risk getting caught for a niche conspiracy theory blog.  Also when you read a story and it lists someones name as an expert spend some time googling them.  9 out of 10 times on here I've found that the person doesn't actually exist outside of reposts of the same story(they are made up).

       to be fair in 2008 (5 years ago) when people were talking about currency collapse, it did come true, except the fed had a trump card of Quantitative easing that no Conspiracy buff ever expected. They have played that hand as well as they could have for the past 5 years, but the bills are coming due again, and more QE would mean the death of the US dollar.

       We are headed for some kind of economic crash though, there's no way the US government can continue the way it is forever, considering it already has over $15 trillion in debt.

       The theory is if they control everything, then they will (try) to control the collapse. If they can save all of your Facebook/tweet/email/SMS/grindr onto one big hard drive moments before the pear shaped event happens it will be easier to sort you in the FEMA camps, right? All those lives saved on servers, virtual peeps. If people are planning this 'population reduction', they are doing a shit job.

       Any prediction that gives a date is disinformation since the real timelines are subject to change at any moment.  Also, these folks spend lifetimes accomplishing a single goal, so things will happen, just much slower than you think.   The world will be a vastly different place, in 30-50 years.

       There are few examples of currency collapses in recent history.  Weimar Germany, Argentina, and Zimbabwe come to mind.  It's easy to think it can't happen here, but I would rather be safe than sorry.

       With that said, there is a lot of "fear porn" being spread in the conspiracy community, and it is good to be wary of people trying to scare you without offering real solutions.  Beware of people trying a bit too hard to sell you something.

       Logically, experts predict a huge collapse ~2030, but this "everything is gonna hit the fan this year" shit has been being said for a century, so if it ever comes true, everyone who says that will be right all along!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the conspiracy theories are pretty nuts, they involve such highly intricate planning that it is completely illogical to think that they could ever be pulled off. Those are what unfortunately make up the "popular" ones and give theorists a bad name.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're worried about an economic collapse, take up skills that every human should have... the ability to cook, fish, garden, and any sort of craft, and just live your life. There's no reason to live your life in a constant fear of what might happen, in a really cliche statement; it's simply too short to spend all of your time worrying.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can be prepared for something to happen, without letting it run your life.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Real conspiracies are a rarity at sites like GLP, ATS, infowars, and even around here. Alternative news sites run stories based on fear, and not on logic and critical thinking, because they say things that are "anti-establishment" but the viewers don't realize that the more viewers they get (guys like Alex Jones) the more money they're dumping in their pockets, so they aren't all that innocent either.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be amazing for logical and critical discussion across the board, but unfortunately there are people who follow the herd mentality just as much in the conspiracy community as they are in the MSM media follower community.
      </p>
      <p>
       They see a story from some backwater alternative news site, and assume because it's not MSM, it must be true, believing every word.. Or googling it, finding a bunch of other backwater alternative news sites and going "well these sites say it too, so it must be true."
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many stories circling around the conspiracy community that are such complete utter bs, but people blindly follow it, so you really need to look through everything and research yourself and come to your own conclusion, rather than simply being told what you should think.

       Fair enough. I don't know enough about it to argue on it either way...like most things in my life. I don't think anything is impossible and I think anything could happen so maybe me keeping an open mind allows me to easier get behind or understand some of the off the wall conspiracies out there.
