<p>Here&#39;s the last <del>month</del> eight weeks of numbers.</p>

<hr/>

<p>UPDATES and maintenance of this post.</p>

<p>I&#39;m updating the numbers daily.</p>

<p>I have boldfaced two dates:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the last normal &quot;trough&quot; (low): 2012-05-22</p></li>
<li><p>the point at which the subsequent increase would have normally crested based on previous trends: 2012-05-26</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Everything after that appears to be aberrant/outside-the-norm for this subreddit (for the first week, about 50% above normal; and everything since then, about double the normal rate, if not more).</p>

<p><sup>*Wednesdays</sup> <sup>have</sup> <sup>their</sup> <sup>dates</sup> <sup>italicized,</sup> <sup>just</sup> <sup>because.</sup></p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>2012-06-03&#39;s 270 subscriptions are both:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the current record for number of subscriptions in a recorded day for this subreddit, and...</p></li>
<li><p>the first time ever to break 200 subcriptions in a single day.</p></li>

<p>2012-06-06&#39;s 292 is now the new record.</p>

<p>i think plenty of people just had no idea bildergberg existed, or some people have heard of it but deny it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know people don&#39;t like me saying this around here, but a big part of the reason is, the way people &quot;present&quot; this information. The WeAreChange guys make theorists look nuts, so when they start telling people who are uninformed, they make it seem like the idea is crazy.. When you present things like that, people only assume the worst.</p>

<p>The only way you can educate people is through critical thinking, logic, and cohesiveness. You can&#39;t force people to think your way by yelling at them.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people who don&#39;t know Bilderberg meetings exist, and there are plenty whom upon finding out, wouldn&#39;t care.</p>

<p>There are some who would deny it, but only because of the outlet they receive the information. The main stream media doesn&#39;t cover it, but not because they&#39;re scared of it, but because it&#39;s not a subject that would bring them anything. MSM covers what brings them money, and Bilderberg wouldn&#39;t draw interest.</p>

<p>Now that more than alternative news sites and clowns like the guys in WeAreChange are no longer the only places covering this, the more word will come up, and hopefully transparency will come through.</p>

<p>The most important thing is that people need to leave their objective bullshit at the door, and just promote the meetings with the main goal being transparency. When people spout nonsense and &quot;The NWO and the lizards are in that room&quot; and crap like that, it gives good reason for them to be meeting in private. We have a vague idea of what is said inside based on a couple near half century old documents, but everything else is kept completely confidential. Assuming the worst, or the best, leads to biased outcomes. People need to go into it without an agenda of what they &quot;want&quot; to learn, and look at the facts, and don&#39;t let your previous emotions or feelings guide your opinion. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t try to educate people the way alternative news sites are doing now, trying to scare people into learning things only leads to blind followers who don&#39;t come up with any conclusions themselves. People need to be encouraged to question everything, and leave what objectivity behind, and concentrate on what the most likely truth is, instead of fantasizing about the &quot;could be&quot; truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how do you suggest people get educated instead? I think this is the only way, although it is semi-awkward and intrusive to the people being questioned. It will always be that way too when the person being questioned just ignores the question completely. Them ignoring the question and running away implies guilt and everyone knows it. </p>

<p>I would argue that they&#39;re method of questioning is working from a numbers standpoint. Obviously the word is getting out as evidenced by these numbers. </p>

<p>I commend We Are Change for at least trying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Running from what? I&#39;ve expressed how I feel about these guys, it&#39;s not a secret. You can check by reading my above post, or my post history. Here, you can have another write-up if you&#39;d like.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather have people not vote than people go out and vote just because they CAN.</p>

<p>Here you go friend, I love you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Them ignoring the question and running away implies guilt and everyone knows it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it implies that people are busy. There&#39;s no running away, they don&#39;t want to speak to them, because they ask them questions in such a ridiculous manner. If you truthfully think the way they&#39;re conducting the interviews is GOOD, then that&#39;s your opinion, but there&#39;s a reason no one wants to deal with their questions, and it isn&#39;t a conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It will always be that way too when the person being questioned just ignores the question completely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the way they ask the questions, they get ignored. The Press are hated, hard, and you can see it in everything. Just because they state they&#39;re from a news organization (which they make up) doesn&#39;t mean the people they&#39;re questioning HAVE to answer them. </p>

<p>Ignoring a question doesn&#39;t imply guilt at all in the context of the interviews they&#39;re doing. The video of them questioning Senator Boxer, they don&#39;t even let her respond.. That&#39;s not an uncommon theme in their videos.</p>

<p>She goes to respond to them, and they interrupt her, and then again, and then again.. And then when she doesn&#39;t say anything, they accuse her of being a coward.. How the hell is that a good thing? How is that HELPING?</p>

<p>Just because they&#39;re going out and harassing people, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re doing &quot;more&quot; it just means they&#39;re out doing SOMETHING. Don&#39;t see how creating a negative image for activists and theorists is a good thing, but hey, at least they&#39;re doing something. Word of mouth travels, and you&#39;ll get less and less answers the more these guys keep doing interviews like this.</p>

<p>They need to be professional and they need to be rational, and it seems like those things are an incapability for them.</p>

<p>You&#39;re being an imbecile if you think in all of those videos they are simply asking a question. If they are as educated as people around here give them credit for, then they&#39;re fucking trolling.</p>

<p>They&#39;re asking what goes on in a SECRET meeting, which is pointed out by a body guard for fucks sake.. They know they aren&#39;t going to get an answer, they&#39;re instigating every single person they interview. They ask something they know that the person can&#39;t speak about if they went to the meetings, and then yell at them for not speaking about it. And if the person doesn&#39;t know or simply doesn&#39;t want to speak to them, they&#39;re a lying coward and they should be followed around and yelled at, because THAT is a good way to do things.</p>

<p>When people don&#39;t know, or they don&#39;t like the answer, they call them names.. Like that&#39;s the solution.</p>

<p>Watch the Senator Boxer video, and take out the circlejerking and just watch the video. The woman tries to answer their question, they don&#39;t allow it. And then when she goes to speak to the security guard, they take the mic away so you can&#39;t even hear what she was trying to say, they don&#39;t let her finish what she&#39;s saying.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have an immediate suggestion, but I don&#39;t need one to point out that the current way isn&#39;t working. What they&#39;re doing is making activists look nuts, and they&#39;re not actually gaining any information, they&#39;re just conducting shitty interviews. They get one good interview about Bilderberg, and even that guy won&#39;t give them more time. Why? Because of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yup, so busy they can&#39;t answer one question, give me a fucking break. Nobody is that busy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&#39;re on your way to a meeting, would you want to stop and answer a question from a random press that you&#39;ve never seen before, dressed like a high school teen? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re not going to convince me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, so, you&#39;re not a theorist, you&#39;re a conspiracy nut. The golden words for nuts; &quot;you&#39;re not going to convince me.&quot; So why even bother asking me questions, if no matter what I say, you can&#39;t be convinced?</p>

<p>They know they won&#39;t get an answer, their intention is to make them look guilty, which is why they cut off the video so many times, and why they don&#39;t let people answer the questions they ask and just let them freely speak. </p>

<p>Alex Jones gets people&#39;s attention, but it doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s not an idiot. Guys like Jones/Icke create herds of misinformed idiots who just live by their every word.. And that is what gets the media discrediting every conspiracy theorist, because when they see how people like these guys act, they get it in their head that everyone will act like that. They reaffirm the negative belief people have about theorists.</p>

<p>Yeah you could, but I look at things non-objectively. I see that she tried to say I don&#39;t know, and then was interrupted. I saw that she tried to say something when speaking to the security guard, but they took the mic away from her. </p>

<p>I am more than open-minded, I was raised that way. I question anything and everything my entire life, I would delve more into this if you wanted to speak to me on a more secure line, but until then, unfortunately we&#39;re just two people speaking on Reddit. If I saw convincing proof in their videos that people they interview were &quot;guilty&quot; of something, I would say something. They make people feel uncomfortable because of the way they act, not because of what they&#39;re being asked.</p>

<p>Because these people are around the press all day, every day, and they can recognize when someone isn&#39;t a part of the &quot;normal&quot; press. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>She was on her way to something, and she made it clear when asked, she didn&#39;t know. If politicians had the ability to answer every question they&#39;re asked, they would be time lords, and then we&#39;d have a whole different problem on our hands.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for transparency, but we&#39;re not going to get that by conducting spontaneous interviews the way that Luke &amp; friends do.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that getting a politician or somebody in the know to sit down and talk about a bilderberg meeting would be next to impossible. But I, like you, think of myself as open-minded, and who doesn&#39;t really. So I&#39;d like to know a suggestion to getting full transparency instead of criticism.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right man, I&#39;m not disagreeing with you. I&#39;m not doing better than them, but they&#39;re not doing better than me, and that&#39;s my point. The way they&#39;re doing it isn&#39;t correct. I don&#39;t have a magic answer, I wish I did, I just know one way that doesn&#39;t work, and it&#39;s what they&#39;re doing. They may be getting out there and asking them questions, but the way they&#39;re doing the interviews isn&#39;t helping, and in all honesty, seems to be hurting the cause.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s insanely hard to meet with politicians, and &quot;ambush&quot; methods make politicians afraid to deal with any form of walk-and-talk interviews. The questions need to be a lot better than just &quot;Can you tell me about the Bilderberg meeting?&quot; and then getting mad when they say no and shouting at them. That won&#39;t work, ever.</p>

<p>And based on a statement below, also with trending out 28 days from now (though obviously the last few days of data would be considered anomalous and should probably be removed to get a better trend, but I&#39;m tired now and fairly certain the linear trends would end up reasonably flat anyways):</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The last 3 or 4 months look pretty much like everything above, minus the last 8 or 10 days (which are aberrant). We&#39;ve been consistently averaging about 100-125 new subscriptions per day since the new admins were selected in January. I looked at that time, and prior to mid-December 2011, it was averaging below 100 per day.</p>

<p>Anything over 145 is a [small] spike compared to average.</p>

<p>As for what the next four weeks will look like, that&#39;s kind of a cheap shot question which bears no relevance to anything other than to distract from the data that <strong>is</strong> available.. right here, right now.</p>

<p>196, 270, 253, 215 in four consecutive days, following five or six days of 150+ ...    when the record, prior to ten days ago, was <del>150</del> 173 and the average was 115 or 120.</p>

<p>I saw the link of this subreddit in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. I thought to myself that this might be a place to see weather the people here are thinking of what our enemies of democracy are planning. To my surprise, it turned out to be the opposite.</p>

<p>This place is full of dissidents that seek to revolutionize our country. Since people love our enemies media, i guess this place is full of communists who lack morality and willing to live under oppression and free speech restrictions.</p>

<p>We need more people like me who are patriotic and willing to defend the land of the free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Running from what? I&#39;ve expressed how I feel about these guys, it&#39;s not a secret. You can check by reading my above post, or my post history. Here, you can have another write-up if you&#39;d like.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather have people not vote than people go out and vote just because they CAN.</p>

<p>Here you go friend, I love you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Them ignoring the question and running away implies guilt and everyone knows it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it implies that people are busy. There&#39;s no running away, they don&#39;t want to speak to them, because they ask them questions in such a ridiculous manner. If you truthfully think the way they&#39;re conducting the interviews is GOOD, then that&#39;s your opinion, but there&#39;s a reason no one wants to deal with their questions, and it isn&#39;t a conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It will always be that way too when the person being questioned just ignores the question completely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the way they ask the questions, they get ignored. The Press are hated, hard, and you can see it in everything. Just because they state they&#39;re from a news organization (which they make up) doesn&#39;t mean the people they&#39;re questioning HAVE to answer them. </p>

<p>Ignoring a question doesn&#39;t imply guilt at all in the context of the interviews they&#39;re doing. The video of them questioning Senator Boxer, they don&#39;t even let her respond.. That&#39;s not an uncommon theme in their videos.</p>

<p>She goes to respond to them, and they interrupt her, and then again, and then again.. And then when she doesn&#39;t say anything, they accuse her of being a coward.. How the hell is that a good thing? How is that HELPING?</p>

<p>Just because they&#39;re going out and harassing people, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re doing &quot;more&quot; it just means they&#39;re out doing SOMETHING. Don&#39;t see how creating a negative image for activists and theorists is a good thing, but hey, at least they&#39;re doing something. Word of mouth travels, and you&#39;ll get less and less answers the more these guys keep doing interviews like this.</p>

<p>They need to be professional and they need to be rational, and it seems like those things are an incapability for them.</p>
