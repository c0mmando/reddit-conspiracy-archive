    <div class="md"><p>From my research into holocaust denier claims, most holocaust &quot;deniers&quot; believe that the numbers are inflated (not that concentration camps / deaths did not occur). Like most conspiracy theories, there is no evidence so solid that one can draw a conclusion. But we should look for holes in the official story. 
For example, at Auschwitz, it used to state 4 million people were killed. Now the official number is 1.5 million. See:
<a href="http://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/auschwitz_b4nafter_1989.jpg">http://socioecohistory.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/auschwitz_b4nafter_1989.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Israeli-Historians-Welcome-Revision-Of-Auschwitz-Death-Toll/id-9764d9bef773d2587e6ef26aba13d587">http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Israeli-Historians-Welcome-Revision-Of-Auschwitz-Death-Toll/id-9764d9bef773d2587e6ef26aba13d587</a>
If the Auschwitz estimate is reduced by 2.5 million, why isn&#39;t the 6 million murdered Jews number reduced to 4 million or something like that? 
That is a simple question that has not been adequately answered in my opinion. But if you bring something like this up, you must obviously be an anti-Semite!
I&#39;m no expert but there are some interesting questions about the whole issue, if you are willing to do some research (but be warned you will probably end up on a couple Neo-Nazis&#39; websites).</p>

<p>For those who don&#39;t care to click through: the original, higher figure for the camp wasn&#39;t used to determine the 6M figure,which can be determined from other sources. And the lower figure was not a &quot;revelation&quot; and was, in fact, calculated as early as 1950.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>problem is not 2 or 6 million in my opinion. Is horrifying anyway. Problem is the exclusive focus of all the &quot;remember&quot; events on jewish victims. Those were dark times and many people died, prisoner of war, homosexuals, gypsy, mentally ill people, yet the only thing we should remember is the jewish deaths.</p>

<p>This is very damaging since people will think all those camps and racial killing was some sort of exclusivity of the nazi hate against jews, and it can&#39;t happen again or didn&#39;t happen before or after.</p>

<p>so you are saying that for 2 years the plan was scuttled?  your theory doesn&#39;t hold water.

    <div class="md"><p>So I read your article and it just confirmed my Nazi-Zionism theories even more. They could have preserved Jewish artifacts for a multitude or reasons (Hitler was Jewish, Austrians are known to be &quot;well mannered&quot; quote the article). The most heinous of reasons is to leave &quot;evidence&quot; behind of the horrors that were committed to the Jews. Which is how they pressed majority of the world to create a safe place for all Jews to live (Israel). This museum was their backup plan centuries to come when all people that lived during WW2 die off. It&#39;s a historical pawn. I&#39;m very curious to visit the museum myself. I didn&#39;t know it existed. Thank you for that information. </p>

<p>When you have some free time I suggest you check out the 5 hour long film &quot;The Ring of Power&quot;. It goes into great detail of the Zionist motives, and how Hitler was actually a Rothschild. I believe his grandfather or great grandfather was. A user submitted a very interesting link below &quot;This explains the tattoos&quot; you should check out and we can critique and pick it apart together :)</p>

<p>also</p>

<p>&quot;As for the Jews, well, I can tell you quite frankly that one way or another we have to put an end to them. The Führer once put it this way: if the combined forces of Judaism should again succeed in unleashing a world war, that would mean the end of the Jews in Europe. ...I urge you: Stand together with me ... on this idea at least: Save your sympathy for the German people alone. Don&#39;t waste it on anyone else in the world, ... I would therefore be guided by the basic expectation that they are going to disappear. They have to be gotten rid of. At present I am involved in discussions aimed at having them moved away to the east. In January there is going to be an important meeting in Berlin to discuss this question. I am going to send State Secretary Dr. Buhler to this meeting. It is scheduled to take place in the offices of the RSHA in the presence of Obergruppenführer Heydrich. Whatever its outcome, a great Jewish emigration will commence. But what is going to happen to these Jews? Do you imagine there will be settlement villages for them in the Ostland? In Berlin we were told: Why are you making all this trouble for us? There is nothing we can do with them here in the Ostland or in the Reich Commissariat. Liquidate them yourselves! ... Here are 3.5 million Jews that we can&#39;t shoot, we can&#39;t poison. But there are some things we can do, and one way or another these measures will successfully lead to a liquidation. They are related to the measures under discussion with the Reich.... Where and how this will all take place will be a matter for offices that we will have to establish and operate here. I will report to you on their operation at the appropriate time.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you realize what you just cited?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t legitimate Nazi documentation, in fact, this is about as far removed from actual, credible evidence as one can possibly get.  So, congrats on that feat.</p>

<p>This is a known fake and was <a href="http://www.ghwk.de/engl/texts/eichmanns-testimony.htm">admitted to be fake by the testimony of Adolf Eichmann</a>, who faked the documents at the command of Reinhard Heydrich, (chief of the RSHA - Reich Security Head Office).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that even though there is no proof (or lost of) the existence of &quot;god&quot; and the &quot;devil&quot;, many, many people believe in their existence. So their true existence is ... irrelative? Not sure if that is the word I&#39;m looking for. It may be a fake god, but that is the god majority of the population worship and trust in. </p>

<p>I am posting to this subreddit for a reason. Take what I say with a grain of salt and not fact. Make your own decision.</p>

<p>So onto my tangent about the Vatican. Many things I have read point to major influential religions being infiltrated with false information. What I have read is that there is something very evil about the Vatican. I&#39;ve even heard and read stories about the Vatican being the biggest producers of child pornography. Tip of the iceberg, the pope isn&#39;t human. </p>

<p>Take what you may. I just want us to help each other. Rest and be kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For those too lazy to read the link, the number six million is a magic number in Jewish mysticism. It has no actual meaning, any more than the assertion that God created the world in six days in the book of Genesis (which is part of the Jewish Torah) has any actual physical meaning. Read this quote (the reference is to a commentory on the Torah):</p>

<p><em>Regarding the &#39;six million&#39; number you should know the following: In the Hebrew text of the Torah prophesies, one can read &quot;you shall return&quot;. In the text the letter &quot;V&quot; or &quot;VAU&quot; is absent, as Hebrew does not have any numbers; the letter V stands for the number 6. Ben Weintraub, a religious scientist, learned from rabbis that the meaning of the missing letter means the number is &#39;6 million&#39;. The prophesy then reads: You will return, but with 6 million less. See Ben Weintraub: &quot;The Holocaust Dogma of Judaism&quot;, Cosmo Publishing, Washington 1995, page 3. The missing 6 million must be so before the Jews can return to the Promised Land. Jahweh sees this as a cleaning of the souls of the sinful people. The Jews must, on the return to the Promised Land, be clean -- the cleaning shall be done in burning stokes. --A Correspondent</em></p>

<p>You can also find newspapers clips of the outrageous  lies. </p>

<p>NY Times reports in 1906 that Russia&#39;s &quot;6,000,00 jews&quot; facing a final &quot;solution&quot; of &quot;systematic and murderous extermination&quot;

<p>7 years before end of war, NY Times in 1938 claims &quot;6,000,000&quot; European jews are &quot;victims&quot; of &quot;anti-semitic persecution&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Idk, I usually group holocaust deniers in with the &quot;Flat-earth&quot; society people. I know people who actually went through it during the war and actually had their numbers tattooed onto them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to be into conspiracy theories, but denying and even a complete revision of history is way off the deep end man. </p>

<p>Like conspiracy theorist who deny that we went to the moon, when we have proof we did because there are reflectors on the moon that we use lasers to shoot beams at and measure the exact distance of the moon from earth. </p>

<p>Like I&#39;m into conspiracy theories and can totally believe ones with valid points, but to deny something that is totally provable is like denying gravity and there are some people who are just way out of their minds it makes us look silly and makes people not take seriously the theories we have lots of evidence on like JFK and 9/11. </p>

<p>I believe the holocaust happen cuz I&#39;ve seen more than enough evidence in person to make an informed decision, I guess some conspiracy theorist will just believe anything...</p>

<p>Nobody is claiming that neither camps or tattoos are imaginary.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let me stop you from ignoring the mountains of objective evidence which defy the subjective accounts you are basing your assertions upon.  After all, that would be logical and it appears you are only capable of fallacious arguments.</p>

<p>If you were truly objective, you would understand that those who blindly accept the official account of the holohoax are more akin to these so-called &quot;Flat Earthers&quot;, while revisionists more closely resemble Magellan.  That said, there are no accounts of anyone believing the earth was truly &quot;flat&quot;, but you would have needed to do a minimal amount of research to discover that.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve also heard from some on here that Hitler was working with the NWO/Illuminati and decided to make an omelette of the Jews. Six million or so sacrificed before the world, hitler escapes to South America, and the survivors are with no question or doubt, handed their land back. </p>

1. Why would anyone exaggerate the accounts of the Holocaust? That&#39;s a pretty sick thing to exaggerate. Such an accusation would carry some pretty negative implications regarding the character of those giving account of the Holocaust.
2. How do you manage such a large conspiracy with thousands of former German soldiers running around (I&#39;m sure most of them have passed at this point)?
3. The Nazis were unabashedly anti-Semitic.  Why wouldn&#39;t they have engaged in a Holocaust?

    <div class="md"><p>I learned in my science classes about this number concept called &quot;significant figures&quot;.  So when you have 6 million people died it can be written as 6.0x10<sup>6</sup> instead.  There is only one significant figure there.  So if you had 5.9x10<sup>6</sup> or 6.1x10<sup>6</sup> than you would have two significant figures.</p>

<p>Well the number 6 million is not allowed to be modified at all and a number that large with only one sig fig is not terribly accurate at all.  We are beat over the head with it and if a historian attempts to figure out exactly how many people died then it is either said to be irrelevant or that person is demonized for asking the question.  The number of dead Jews is put through a very powerful rounding function that always returns 6,000,000.</p>

<p>It sounds like you believe that we (the Western Allies) on the <strong>Second Front</strong>, which started when German defeat became inevitable, could have taken on the Russian army that just kicked Nazis out of Russia and much of Europe.  The question is why Russia stopped in Germany and did not go after the rest of the Nazis?  Why did “we” help Nazis hide their identities and brought them out of Germany?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I believe it possible, and so did General Patton.  One fact you conveniently neglect to mention, is at that time, the US was the only nuclear state.  Had the allies acted soon enough, they would not have had China to deal with either, as well as preventing the Cold War (a conflict which was merely a Neocon stunt, but I digress).</p>

<p>The allies would have had near complete air superiority, a fresh stockpile of German engineered armor and momentum.  The Russian Army was already in close proximity and their ranks exhausted.   Before a massive loss of allied life, a nuclear strike would have been probable, all but ensuring victory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.realzionistnews.com/?p=594">The reason the allies did not invade Russia, is the same reason Patton was &quot;accidented&quot;.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In his book, “Target Patton,” author Robert Wilcox describes his interviews with WWII sharpshooter, Douglas Bazata, a Lebanese Jew, who died in 1999.</em></p>

<p><em>Based on these interviews, (Bazata, with declining health, was tormented by qualms of conscience), Wilcox details how the marksman staged the car crash by getting a troop truck to plough into Patton’s Cadillac.</em></p>

<p><em>He then arranged for the General to be shot with a low-velocity projectile which entered Patton’s neck while his fellow passengers escaped without a scratch. (The impact theory is less likely since the vehicles were advancing at only 20 miles per hour, both being hardly damaged.)</em></p>

<p><em>Bazata said that the order “to silence Patton” was given by the head of the OSS, (forerunner to the CIA), General “Wild Bill” Donovan, who was pursuing close ties with Communist intelligence officers.</em>         </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>(cont.)</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bazata said, “Many high-ranking military persons hated Patton. I know who killed him because I was hired to set up the accident by General William Donovan for $10,000. But since Patton didn’t die in the accident, he was kept in isolation in the hospital where he was killed with an injection.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>&quot;...I think things will come out for the best and may result in my getting lined up with the Anti-Communists because it is they (the Communists) and the Jews who are back of it and succeeded due to the lack of spine of D.D.&quot;  2 ~Patton</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who said that I learned from the dead? My parents are alive and well. My father, who was an officer in the Russian Army, fought in many major battles of WWII, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sevastopol_%281941%E2%80%931942%29">Siege of Sevastopol</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad">Siege of Leningrad</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalingrad_%28battle%29">Battle of Stalingrad</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a> (where he was wounded and lost his brother), all the way to Germany. I know firsthand accounts of both my grandmothers and my mother who lived through it. I also know history. For example, Russia at the end of the war out produced Germany and Western Allies put together. If it was not for the Russians, you would be speaking German, and if Western Allies attacked the Russian Army, you would be speaking Russian since nukes are ineffective against an army in the field.</p>

<p>Russian people do not blame Germans they blame Hitler, Nazis, and those who followed them. This is why they built the largest statue in the World at <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/RIAN_archive_642884_%22The_Motherland_Calls!%2C%22_central_part_of_memorial_complex_on_Mamayev_Kurgan.jpg">Mamayev Kurgan</a> to remind all would-be Nazis.</p>

<p>As for General Patton, he was a nut. The fact that he was assassinated was assumed to begin with since that was the only logical conclusion. War with Russia was not seriously considered. Instead, the Cold War was designed there and then to feed the <a href="http://youtu.be/c_VD0pE37vo">Military Industrial Complex</a>.</p>
