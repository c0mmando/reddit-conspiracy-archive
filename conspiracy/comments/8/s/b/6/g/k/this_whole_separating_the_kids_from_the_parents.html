<p>However, I believe that was the beginning of this whole media blitz on immigration and kids. After living in America for so many years, I have come to know the trends of a presidential race.  Every term the same issues will be discussed. They are immigration, terrorism, guns, drugs, taxes, and health insurance.</p>

<p>Same ole song. Next term will be the same thing. </p>

<p>There was a recent policy change under Trump to consider crossing the border illegally a criminal offense (rather than a civil offense).

<p>Yes, and the MSM was not covering the Obama administration in an objective way.  They did damage control and pr for his administration and foreign policy he wanted to pursue.</p>

<p>Or maybe its the obvious, that institutional constraints that limited what the media can talk about have been shifted and now this issue can be discussed. </p>

<p>Why does this matter, at all??  This is obviously a despicable situation, that is a violation of international law, and the universal deceleration of human rights, and if Trump has the ability to end this now, that would be the ethical choice. </p>

<p>Well there actually is, as in they are literally artificial and drawn up as a consequence of the development of the state form.

<p>It should be obvious to anyone with elementary thinking ability that liking being in a place does not entails that there are no problems, nor that thinking there are problems which needs to be fixed  entails that one does not like a place.  </p>

<p>This is a special occasion, I get to quote a Jew, that is a woman and an anarcho-communist to a fascist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is patriotism? Is it love of one&#39;s birthplace, the place of childhood&#39;s recollections and hopes, dreams and aspirations? Is it the place where, in childlike naivete, we would watch the passing clouds, and wonder why we, too, could not float so swiftly? The place where we would count the milliard glittering stars, terror-stricken lest each one &quot;an eye should be,&quot; piercing the very depths of our little souls? Is it the place where we would listen to the music of the birds and long to have wings to fly, even as they, to distant lands? Or is it the place where we would sit on Mother&#39;s knee, enraptured by tales of great deeds and conquests? In short, is it love for the spot, every inch representing dear and precious recollections of a happy, joyous and playful childhood?</p>

<p>If that were patriotism, few American men of today would be called upon to be patriotic, since the place of play has been turned into factory, mill, and mine, while deepening sounds of machinery have replaced the music of the birds. No longer can we hear the tales of great deeds, for the stories our mothers tell today are but those of sorrow, tears and grief.</p>

<p>There is no redundancy.   Let me cover something that you missed in your fascist education.   There is such a thing called quantification referring to natural language.  So a statement like all Jews are communists is false, while a statement some Jews are communists is true. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t particularly care about peoples education levels other than the fact that we should be creating a culture where knowledge is valued and the pursuit of education is encouraged as a life time commitment and as a good in-itself, nor do I care that they are poor, nor do I think their presence makes a society good or bad. </p>

<p>This is a global systems problem that is a scandal in-itself, and needs to end.  But I fail to see how this is related to  what is happening to people that cross the border, nor how lack of political concern about child labor, somehow invalidates this border problem. </p>

<p>Perhaps your outrage is misplaced, instead of worrying about what other people might be exploiting for political gain, you should worry about what is happening to the children being placed in internment camps by the US government. </p>

<p>No, you are right, I much more prefer managerial speak.  Lets see, we will call concentration camps...detention centers, brown people, will call human traffickers .</p>

<p>Let see how this works out, the US has placed victims of human trafficking/underage human traffickers  into luxurious detention centers.    Is that more palpable to your &#39;law-and-order&#39; sensibilities?</p>

<p>The only thing that is obvious is there is a segment of the right that refuses to acknowledge that something horrible is happening in how the US government is treating immigrants, that are brown.  I am 100 percent positive, that if this was happening to  European immigrants you too would be outraged. </p>

<p>This is not true.  Not only are 98 percent of applications not fraudulent,  the ones that are denied are done so by officers who exercise their judgment and find them not credible.  Fraudulent is not synonymous with credible. </p>

<p>Yes, let me one up you though, how about the following after the US destroys Mexican agricultural sector through Nafta and is actively supporting right wing led violence in El-salvador millions of people leave those areas and see asylum in the US, only to now have children be separated from their parents and placed in internment camps. </p>

<p>If you are saying that we have to make sure that there are reforms in Mexico and other countries which would make people not need to escape dire situation than I am in total agreement. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Look, there is absolutely no reason to defend the practice of separating children from their parents or their relatives and putting them in internment camps.   There are better and more humane ways to address this issue, without a knee-jerk reaction to defend right wing policies. </p>

<p>Here is the part that I never said: &quot;in 2018 the Republicans did some evil stuff, it was so bad&quot;,  in fact my point was that it does not matter that this started under Obama as the practice is egregious in-itself. </p>

<p>Sure, if we are considering hypothetical possible worlds, we are not, we are talking about this one, where not only is it not true that 98 percent of applicants are denied, they are not denied because their claims are fraudulent, their claims are judged as non-credible by immigration officers, I hope you understand the difference. </p>

<p>I am not denying that I have a position, it is explicit.  This is a violation of human rights, it is unethical and those defending it are bootlickers.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course the logical non-bootlicker position is to separate kids and put them in concentration camps.  Seriously, this is an indefensible position. </p>

<p>Again, to repeat the point that you miss, an immigration agent finding denying an application, does not imply that 98 percent of them are fraudulent.  It does not even entail that there was false information on the application, all it means is that an immigration officer thought it not credible.  </p>

<p>Yes, if that is the amount of families that have no relatives to stay with we should provide them with housing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You got room in your house? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already have too many illegals in my house.</p>

<p>If you wanted to discuss this issue seriously it wouldn&#39;t start with &#39;in 2018 the Republicans did some evil stuff, it was so bad&#39;.. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is the part that I never said: &quot;in 2018 the Republicans did some evil stuff, it was so bad&quot;,  in fact my point was that it does not matter that this started under Obama as the practice is egregious in-itself. </p>

<p>But for some reason,  it is right wingers attempting to deflect from Trump continuing it and intensifying it.  Why do you think that is? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you wanted a serious discussion the fact that 98% of asylum seekers from Mexico are frauds would be important to consider. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, if we are considering hypothetical possible worlds, we are not, we are talking about this one, where not only is it not true that 98 percent of applicants are denied, they are not denied because their claims are fraudulent, their claims are judged as non-credible by immigration officers, I hope you understand the difference. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And most importantly, if you wanted a serious discussion your comments wouldn&#39;t be littered with buzz words and inflammatory language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right because to make the point for the 10th time, neutral managerial speak is so much more better for human rights violations. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Your position is clearly a partisan one, no denying that. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not denying that I have a position, it is explicit.  This is a violation of human rights, it is unethical and those defending it are bootlickers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like I said, after a while when the system isn’t working, and when 98% of claims are fraudulent it’s clearly not working, something has to change. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course the logical non-bootlicker position is to separate kids and put them in concentration camps.  Seriously, this is an indefensible position. </p>

<p>Again, to repeat the point that you miss, an immigration agent finding denying an application, does not imply that 98 percent of them are fraudulent.  It does not even entail that there was false information on the application, all it means is that an immigration officer thought it not credible.  </p>
