Its shitty and my empathy is being replaced by hatred and frustration with peoples complete lack of common sense when approaching these issues now. The guardians have shown a complete lack of ability to properly care for their kids and most the time when separated its because they cannot prove they are the parents of the child. So they are forced into this position of handing back kids to traffickers or a guardian who will risk the life of the kid at the next given chance. And instead of coming up with real solutions we get debbie wasserman schultz doing photo ops and Kaine hoping around like a useful little puppet when just a few years ago he was preaching in my state about how immigrants must follow the laws. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all. They are separated because Trump is choosing to prosecute their parents and children are not allowed in gaols. Being able to prove parentage has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not &quot;common sense&quot; to rip babies away from their parents. It&#39;s inhuman.</p>

<p>You realize you can be upset about more than one thing at a time, right?

<p>You can make that point without getting into the fact that children are being mistreated in African and Asian countries, thus drawing a parallel, which helps no one.</p>

<p>I agree that I find it shocking and upsetting that people were given those orders and physically took these children from their parents without asking questions. I agree that&#39;s worrying for the morality of our nation. But when it comes down to it, I&#39;m a LOT more outraged at Trump and Sessions and co - they can stop this. Neither of them are living paycheck to paycheck and know that if they speak out, they will lose their jobs. The grunts on the ground have circumstances I don&#39;t know but Trump? He can end this anytime he wants.</p>

<p>Everyone can be guilty but expecting the people who have the most to lose (i.e. their jobs and thus everything they have) to be the ones to first stand up to power is unrealistic.</p>

<p>Trump is the reason this is happening. We should put pressure on people at all levels of these actions, but the number one person is the person who started this and who can stop it with a word.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The New York AG (state office) filed a civil suit alleging illegal borrowing/gifts from the Trump Foundation to pay off various lawsuits and to give to his presidential campaign.  This lawsuit not only targets Trump, but his kids who are board members on the charity.  Because these are tax fraud/campaign finance allegations, NY cannot pursue criminal charges, but they laid out very carefully in their civil complaint how the IRS/FEC could charge the Trump Foundation.</p>

<p>The suit got filed the same day as the IG report was published.  Barely anything has been heard about it since between IG/Comey stuff and the immigration debate.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all. They are separated because Trump is choosing to prosecute their parents and children are not allowed in gaols. Being able to prove parentage has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not &quot;common sense&quot; to rip babies away from their parents. It&#39;s inhuman.</p>
