       You have to convince the people that the politicians/law enforcement/education system/media etc.  suck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also America is the continent. The United States Government is what you think sucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a interesting quote by Jordan Maxwell.
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <strong>
        There are three kinds of citizens in America. However, the people of America have only been told about one. We have purposely been kept ignorant about the other two. The first citizenship that a person can hold in this country is to be a citizen of the United States. That is what we are all told that we should be. There is a second one, and that is to be a citizen of the United States of America, which is totally different. A legally, constitutionally established difference in a court of law. If you are citizen of the United States, you are not a citizen of the United States of America. When you understand that this country was founded and the constitution was written, it was based on something called international maritime admiralty law. We call this law today, world law. The World Court is what the United Nations operates under and is international maritime admiralty law today. Our government was founded as a business corporation, as a company. All corporate law says that you have to have a president and a vice president. That is why we have a President and a Vice President. We are told that we have the right to elect, and that is true, but we don't have a right to select, because the corporations decide who is going to run the business. We are experiencing that dilemma right now, in that we can elect, but we cannot select. There is a very real difference in where the power is, and in thinking we know what is going on in our national elections. We have been given the candidates that the corporations selected, of whom they want us to elect."

       If you do not like your home country, if you are "American," you could just move to one you prefer and your bias will be satisfied. I hear Justin Castro--see "Fidelito's" suicide note--has streamlined immigration to his country.

       You do realize that millennial are the first generation making less than the one before them, wages have stagnated in America while the wealthy continue to accumulate insane amounts of money. America has a lot of major economic issues. Tell me why we’re supposed to be the greatest country in the world, but have our healthcare system is the shits?

       Combined incomes. If you make $2000 a month and your rent is $1000, you can do more when you have a partner contributing to the household income. You can do more with an extra $3000 than you can $1000 alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world has changed. Living expenses are high. I doubt you could live comfortably making $20/hour as a single person these days. You need a partner unless you make a high income.

       Ok, don’t have to be married for combined incomes. I understand you need a higher income to survive, do you understand that since the Reagan administration the majority of new wealth has gone toward the wealthy. Wages haven’t grown with inflation but companies are posting record profits. The American economic system is broken

       Also, given the argument that your making, that you really need 2 spouses working to really make it in the US, isn’t it repugnant we don’t have any sort of paid maternity leave? You know how many women have a kid and then also immediately have to go back to work. Funny how the party of family values doesn’t give a shit if a mom stays home with her newborn.

       Standards of living are higher than they've ever been. There is poverty of course but even the homeless are better off now than they were. Our food and restaurants are unquestionably the best. My opinion of course but I've traveled all around the world and always miss the food back home because unlike anywhere else in the world you can pretty much have any kind of food you desire in most US cities. Everything you need or want is within your reach either by car or online in most US cities. Everyone has the opportunity to live in an actual house with a yard. If you travel a lot too you would know what I mean. Our religious freedom is and has always been a beacon to most of the world. I can be an open atheist anywhere I like and have nothing to fear. You might argue that other countries have these as well and that's fine because it still doesn't take away from the fact the America is an amazing place to live and grow up.

       You act as though you think I have not traveled.  I've traveled quite a lot, and your list is BS.  Just the standard Rush Limbaugh mindset that claims everything is just fine.  Everything I needed was within my reach in Cambodia, and my cost of living was almost nothing.  Food?  You're seriously going to say this country is great because of restaurants?  So freedom of religion is about the only thing I can agree with you on.

       Rush doesn't talk about everything being fine. He is regurgitating the same bullshit you are. Maybe in Cambodia youh didn't need anything but that's you. Yiu want to live life like that.. that's your freedom. Keep following your right wing talking heads and keep believing in then when they tell you America is going down the drain if you want to but don't even dare try to claim America isn't a great place. And fuck your trumps slogan if make America great again because thats bullshit. Make America great again like before the civil rights? Make America great again when we had child labor? Make America great again before we had the most powerful military in the world? You and the rest of trump's base should just leave our country if you think things are so bad here. Fuck it go move back to Cambodia.. I mean you had everything you need there right? What's stopping you?

       Citizenship.  You do know that renewing visas gets expensive?  Making border runs for the stamp, gets expensive.  You do know you can't just pick a country and move there?  It doesn't work that way except for billionaires.  And here I thought you knew everything about travel.

       You failed to come up with anything that truly makes this country exceptional.  It
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       once, but it isn't any longer.  People like you, who claim nothing is wrong hold us all back from that truth.  The USA is an empire in decline.  A failing empire that is now taking your previous rights away, one by one.  Lull yourself to sleep with the star spangled banner tonight.

       I'm not claiming nothing is wrong. And the yhe fact that you close mindedly assume that I do shows me that you'll never be able to look at anyone else's perspective other than your own and I honestly feel bad for that. Also I came up with great reasons that I cherish. Yiu didn't understand though because you're unable to look at life through the eyes of another. Good luck with trying to move to Cambodia and don't let the door hit you on the way out.

       I don't support trump and fight with his base all the time and I'm still standing here telling you that America doesn't suck. You take so much shit for granted. It can always get better, and it will keep getting better, but you should consider yourself damn lucky to live here.

       You won't have to.  I'm starting to see the cracks.  All it takes is for zionists to keep putting things like that stipulation, the loyalty oath to Israel into the hurricane relief money for Texans that happened a couple years ago.

       If America is so bad and "sucks' why do all these people from other countries desire to come here?  There are people that want you to think America 'sucks", and there are people that want to sow discord in America. There goal is to make you hate your own country. Why would they do that? What better way to aid in destroying a country than to convince it's own people to hate it?

       Or maybe the goal is to improve the country, improve the situation for the majority of Americans. Of course people come from other countries, because America provides more or better opportunities than many other places. But America has serious issues. It’s laughable how bad our healthcare system is. You know how many other countries have mandatory paid maternity or even paternity leave? We’d rather line the pockets of shareholders and the call anyone who criticizes the system unpatriotic

       People don't want the illusion broken.  The american dream is a fucking nightmare for most, but just look at these apologists.  America does suck.  It sucks for many reasons, and don't even get me started, I'll be here all day.  This is a failing empire.  It's nothing but propaganda, wars and distractions.  Fuck these people who claim there is nothing wrong.  Every fucking thing is wrong.  There is hardly anything you can point to that's

       Our leaders suck. Our leaders are not "america"...quite the opposite. They are owned by Zionism and Israel. There are still many unique qualities that make america a fantastic place. I'm no flag waving patriot either, I have never even owned a flag. But life in america is objectively better than almost all of the rest of the world.

       You can tell most of the responders against the American Ideal here have not spent much time abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start in Europe and you will see why America is better. End in any third world shit hole and you will see why America may be the last and safest bastion of individual liberties in our life time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t prescribe to nationalism in the sense that we should dominate the world  but our American ideals of the individual through life and liberty is unmatched.  To that end I am proud to live in a country that accomplished a system that was largely unmatched and I consider myself deeply patriotic to the American Ideal, not the US government. Despite its spots and tarnishes which the naysayers can only trip on themselves to point out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many of you socialist-lights think your owed something in life.  It’s called the pursuit of happiness for a reason.  That pursuit is a struggle, and it should be, so you know what you have achieved.

       Wealth and assets accumulate to a small group in every system of governance.  It’s the pareto principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is inherently full of suffering and unfair.  Once you accept that, you better appreciate what you have and are less envious of what you don’t have.

       Our poorest poor in the US are far better off than the abject poverty you see in the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       How fortunate are we to live in a country that is one of the safest and wealthiest in recorded history.

       Nope.  I don’t begrudge those more wealthy than I and I don’t dwell on those in more dire straights than I because I come from a very poor and uneducated family and know it’s not a lifetime ball and chain.

       I grew up in a very poor low income housing development surrounded my middle and upper class families.  The lesson it taught me is one, I don’t have to live like this, and two, if you want something you better get out and earn a living.

       No one around me ever complained about someone else’s wealth.   It’s a cop out.

       They pay taxes.  That’s absurd.  They just don’t pay what you feel is right.  Even though their 15% is significantly more paid in dollars than 99% of the population.  Far greater than the 50% of the US population that pays an effective rate of 0%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxes are a bullshit thing to be upset about.   EVERYONE who actually pays taxes pays far more than they should.  As far as I am concerned every US citizen should take advantage of every tax loophole they can.

       You have to convince the people that the politicians/law enforcement/education system/media etc.  suck.

      <p>
       Also America is the continent. The United States Government is what you think sucks.

       Here's a interesting quote by Jordan Maxwell.
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <strong>
        There are three kinds of citizens in America. However, the people of America have only been told about one. We have purposely been kept ignorant about the other two. The first citizenship that a person can hold in this country is to be a citizen of the United States. That is what we are all told that we should be. There is a second one, and that is to be a citizen of the United States of America, which is totally different. A legally, constitutionally established difference in a court of law. If you are citizen of the United States, you are not a citizen of the United States of America. When you understand that this country was founded and the constitution was written, it was based on something called international maritime admiralty law. We call this law today, world law. The World Court is what the United Nations operates under and is international maritime admiralty law today. Our government was founded as a business corporation, as a company. All corporate law says that you have to have a president and a vice president. That is why we have a President and a Vice President. We are told that we have the right to elect, and that is true, but we don't have a right to select, because the corporations decide who is going to run the business. We are experiencing that dilemma right now, in that we can elect, but we cannot select. There is a very real difference in where the power is, and in thinking we know what is going on in our national elections. We have been given the candidates that the corporations selected, of whom they want us to elect."
