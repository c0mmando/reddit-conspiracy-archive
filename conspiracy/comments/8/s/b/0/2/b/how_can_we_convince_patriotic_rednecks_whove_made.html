    <div class="md"><p>exactly.  </p>

<p>You have to convince the people that the politicians/law enforcement/education system/media etc.  suck.</p>

<p>Also America is the continent. The United States Government is what you think sucks.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a interesting quote by Jordan Maxwell.  </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>There are three kinds of citizens in America. However, the people of America have only been told about one. We have purposely been kept ignorant about the other two. The first citizenship that a person can hold in this country is to be a citizen of the United States. That is what we are all told that we should be. There is a second one, and that is to be a citizen of the United States of America, which is totally different. A legally, constitutionally established difference in a court of law. If you are citizen of the United States, you are not a citizen of the United States of America. When you understand that this country was founded and the constitution was written, it was based on something called international maritime admiralty law. We call this law today, world law. The World Court is what the United Nations operates under and is international maritime admiralty law today. Our government was founded as a business corporation, as a company. All corporate law says that you have to have a president and a vice president. That is why we have a President and a Vice President. We are told that we have the right to elect, and that is true, but we don&#39;t have a right to select, because the corporations decide who is going to run the business. We are experiencing that dilemma right now, in that we can elect, but we cannot select. There is a very real difference in where the power is, and in thinking we know what is going on in our national elections. We have been given the candidates that the corporations selected, of whom they want us to elect.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>You do realize that millennial are the first generation making less than the one before them, wages have stagnated in America while the wealthy continue to accumulate insane amounts of money.

<p>Americans have been brainwashed to fear any notion of socialism, even when it benefits them. Decades of the Cold War and propaganda will do that </p>

Our food and restaurants are unquestionably the best. My opinion of course but I&#39;ve traveled all around the world and always miss the food back home because unlike anywhere else in the world you can pretty much have any kind of food you desire in most US cities. Everything you need or want is within your reach either by car or online in most US cities. Everyone has the opportunity to live in an actual house with a yard. If you travel a lot too you would know what I mean. Our religious freedom is and has always been a beacon to most of the world. I can be an open atheist anywhere I like and have nothing to fear. You might argue that other countries have these as well and that&#39;s fine because it still doesn&#39;t take away from the fact the America is an amazing place to live and grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You act as though you think I have not traveled.  I&#39;ve traveled quite a lot, and your list is BS.  Just the standard Rush Limbaugh mindset that claims everything is just fine.  Everything I needed was within my reach in Cambodia, and my cost of living was almost nothing.  Food?  You&#39;re seriously going to say this country is great because of restaurants?  So freedom of religion is about the only thing I can agree with you on.</p>

Yiu want to live life like that.. that&#39;s your freedom. Keep following your right wing talking heads and keep believing in then when they tell you America is going down the drain if you want to but don&#39;t even dare try to claim America isn&#39;t a great place. And fuck your trumps slogan if make America great again because thats bullshit. Make America great again like before the civil rights? Make America great again when we had child labor? Make America great again before we had the most powerful military in the world? You and the rest of trump&#39;s base should just leave our country if you think things are so bad here. Fuck it go move back to Cambodia.. I mean you had everything you need there right? What&#39;s stopping you? </p>

<p>Citizenship.  You do know that renewing visas gets expensive?  Making border runs for the stamp, gets expensive.  You do know you can&#39;t just pick a country and move there?  It doesn&#39;t work that way except for billionaires.  And here I thought you knew everything about travel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They pay taxes.  That’s absurd.  They just don’t pay what you feel is right.  Even though their 15% is significantly more paid in dollars than 99% of the population.  Far greater than the 50% of the US population that pays an effective rate of 0%. </p>

<p>Taxes are a bullshit thing to be upset about.   EVERYONE who actually pays taxes pays far more than they should.  As far as I am concerned every US citizen should take advantage of every tax loophole they can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly.  </p>

<p>You have to convince the people that the politicians/law enforcement/education system/media etc.  suck.</p>

<p>Also America is the continent. The United States Government is what you think sucks.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a interesting quote by Jordan Maxwell.  </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>There are three kinds of citizens in America. However, the people of America have only been told about one. We have purposely been kept ignorant about the other two. The first citizenship that a person can hold in this country is to be a citizen of the United States. That is what we are all told that we should be. There is a second one, and that is to be a citizen of the United States of America, which is totally different. A legally, constitutionally established difference in a court of law. If you are citizen of the United States, you are not a citizen of the United States of America. When you understand that this country was founded and the constitution was written, it was based on something called international maritime admiralty law. We call this law today, world law. The World Court is what the United Nations operates under and is international maritime admiralty law today. Our government was founded as a business corporation, as a company. All corporate law says that you have to have a president and a vice president. That is why we have a President and a Vice President. We are told that we have the right to elect, and that is true, but we don&#39;t have a right to select, because the corporations decide who is going to run the business. We are experiencing that dilemma right now, in that we can elect, but we cannot select. There is a very real difference in where the power is, and in thinking we know what is going on in our national elections. We have been given the candidates that the corporations selected, of whom they want us to elect.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Says every apologist for this country.   </p>

<p>&quot;America, mile after mile of mall after mall.&quot;  </p>

<p>Keep telling yourself nothing is wrong.  The world is scary out there.  At least you&#39;ve noticed homeless people once in a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  I don’t begrudge those more wealthy than I and I don’t dwell on those in more dire straights than I because I come from a very poor and uneducated family and know it’s not a lifetime ball and chain. </p>

<p>I grew up in a very poor low income housing development surrounded my middle and upper class families.  The lesson it taught me is one, I don’t have to live like this, and two, if you want something you better get out and earn a living.  </p>

<p>No one around me ever complained about someone else’s wealth.   It’s a cop out. </p>
