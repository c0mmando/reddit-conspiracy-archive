<p>James Alefantis and Hillary Clinton know eachother. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8HMlXse">James held a fundraiser for Hillary at Comet Ping Pong hosted by Tony and John Podesta.</a> As you can see he even received a personal letter from Hillary! #CookingForHillary!</p>

<p>Tony Podesta is good friends with James Alefantis. He even attends his birthday parties. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8p9urw/this_is_tony_podesta_he_has_painting_of_dead/e09i9nt/">This post</a> on Tony Podesta shows proof of that and highlights ever dirty pedo shit we found on him. And I think we all know John Podesta was Hillary&#39;s right hand in her 2016 presidential campaign.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/rIUQidB">In this Instagram post by James you can see Moloch.</a></p>

<p>Hillary Clinton received an email by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/w-lewis-amselem-01690430">W. Lewis Amselem, retired Senior U.S. Foreign Service Officer</a>.</p>

<p>It states: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">With fingers crossed, the old rabbit&#39;s foot out of the box in the attic, I will be sacrificing a chicken in the backyard to Moloch . . .</a></p>

<p>Coincidences? </p>

<p>You can tell what’s going on when you consider the fact that none of the characters in these stories are ever associates of his, and literally all of them are people who have spoken out against him.</p>

<p>Oh wow, the ignorance is strong with you. 
&quot;You imagine&quot; So you didn&#39;t even look at any of the dozens of articles that show exactly the pieces of art he has in his home?</p>

<p><em>Having pictures of naked teenagers isn&#39;t a crime</em> No, haha, BUT my friend it is something, that a pedophile would do and that was my point, not that it is a crime itself. An adult man who isn&#39;t interested in naked teenagers, wouldn&#39;t put photgraphs of naked teenagers in his home, would he? Also why would he put pictures of children in his home that clearly evolve around the theme of child abuse? Even colleagues of him who visited him expressed being shocked about all this disturbing art, that I think is save to call 
PEDO ART.</p>

<p><em>He was speaker of the House anyway, he knew everyone in DC.</em></p>

<p>Yeah, but there are no photos of everyone in DC together with Hastert in a boyscout camp in Japan, when they were still teenagers, but there is a photo of John and Tony Podesta with Hastert that proves that they were together in a boyscout camp in Japan when they were still teens. Best friends for ever. Not everyone in DC, but John, Dennis and Tony are bff. Also did not everyone in DC express being sorry for him to be locked away, nor did everyone in DC suggest that &quot;Danny&quot; should better &quot;move to an undisclosed Island&quot; in order to escape charges. That was Tony or John, not everyone in DC.</p>

<p>And Hastert abused boys later on as well. Ask ex FBI agent Sybille Edmonds, who spent 12 years of her life to get this guy locked up for his child abuse.</p>
