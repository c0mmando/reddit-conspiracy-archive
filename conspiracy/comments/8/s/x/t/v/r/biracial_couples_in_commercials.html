       Anyone notice how many biracial couples you see in commercials? What is the purpose behind this? We all know they are trying to create an androgynous slave for the NWO, but is racial mixing an aspect of it too?

       I think you're looking a bit too much into this. There is no movement to create an androgynous slave, or a biracial one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have an issue with biracial families, or non-heterosexual people, appearing on your television more often, take a look at yourself and ask why it bothers you before blaming the NWO.

       I've noticed this too. I've also noticed that some commercials portray white people as stupid (for not having a certain insurance, etc.), while showing black people or hispanic people as smarter because they had the foresight to purchase said insurance.

       Yes, I’ve noticed that kind of thing too. I think commercials are an important part of mind programming because people tend to pay only half attention while they’re watching so it goes straight to the unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this all point to? An attack on white racial identity or perhaps racial identity itself. Unfortunately you can’t even bring up a topic without being called racist, alt-right, etc... I’ve already been called racist multiple times in this thread, which is ridiculous. I’m just pointing something out that is obvious.

       No problem whatsoever with people of different races being in love.  The problem is with those who exploit it to influence people to both buy something and to play on some people's resentment of inter-racial love. (This is not aimed at you.)

       Bonus round: there is an agenda called the Kalergi plan which openly calls for race mixing in order to create people that are easier to control. Fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway,  I've noticed that it is always a white woman with a darker skinned man. Has anyone seen a commercial with a white man and a darker skinned woman? I don't watch much TV but I have noticed that trend.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for all the people that want to call me racist, save it. I absolutely love other cultures and judge people individually on how they behave and interact with me. Judging and hating an entire race for whatever reason is fucking idiotic. I don't give a shit who is fucking who and have no problem dating outside my own race.

       When you couple the statements "I don't watch TV much" with any claim as to what television commercials are/are not doing, I think you defeat any chance of your opinion having any real value. If you haven't seen enough to gauge effectively...how can you gauge effectively?

       I should rephrase. I haven't watched much TV in the past year. I noticed the trend op is talking about a few years ago. I still watch a little. That's why I asked the question that I did.

       Ridiculous that a biracial couple is seen as an attack on white racial identity. And yet you fail to see how that is racist. You wish to keep the white race “pure” and untainted. Out of genuine curiosity, why do you believe racial identity is that important?

       I don't believe it's that important. I just know when I am seeing an agenda put forth. I don't care about keeping the white race "pure." I just believe the Elite are conditioning us to become racially mixed while
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       obsessively interbreed to maintain their bloodline. If anyone is trying to maintain racial purity, it's them.

       Blatantly racist overtones from your post aside, there was an
       <a href="http://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2018/06/15/advertising-interracial-lgbt-diversity">
        segment on NPR
       </a>
       I caught about it the other day. The TL;DL is that there is a big demographic out there and advertisers often take a strategy of seeing how far they can push a particular image without turning off, well, bigots. So, an ad that prtrays an ambiguously gay couple will instantly resonate with the gay population while not necessarily even keying in with the heterosexual population. And a lot of people not in e.g. a biracial relationship will still respond positively to the message of inclusiveness portrayed in the ad.

       A racist is just someone who thinks other races are inferior to their own, it's only a pejorative if you think the races are equal.

       If someone genuinely believes other races are inferior and that racism isn't a bad thing they should wear "racist" as a badge of honour in my opinion. Otherwise they're just being a coward.

       I suppose that would still count as racial prejudice which is also part of the definition of racism. I've never encountered someone hate a race because they believe they're superior.

      <p>
       If racism is true then it stands to reason that there's nothing wrong with being racist. Since racists believe racism is true they must also believe that there is nothing wrong with being a racist, so they should declare it with pride. Hiding their true nature is cowardly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other groups with unpopular beliefs don't have this same cowardice towards using the appropriate labels for themselves.

       Racism implies prejudice which can include hatred. In-group bias could be your country, your friends, your subculture, etc.

       Racism is a form of in-group bias, I'm not saying you can't use in-group bias to describe it but racism is a much less ambiguous term because we know specific which in-group is being referred to.

       You have to look at it from a world perspective. America has 320 million people and 245 million are White (could include 'white' Hispanics.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe in 2015 was estimated to be 741 million according to the United Nations,[1] which was slightly less than 11 % of the world population.
105 million are minorities.

       As of 2016, the total population of Africa is estimated at estimated at 1.225 billion, representing 17% of the world's population. According to UN estimates, the population of Africa may reach 2.5 billion by 2050 (about 26% of the world's total) and nearly 4.5 billion by 2100 (about 40% of the world's total
      </p>
      <p>
       China's population is 1.411 billion[1], the largest of any country in the world. According to the 2010 census, 91.51% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.49% were minorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       India is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world's population. According to the 2017 revision of the World Population Prospects[1], the population stood at 1,324,171,354.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there are 881 million people living in Europe and America (Europe's population counts "minorities" in it) (Tongans and Samoans are real minorities, Mexicans are also a world minority at 120 million people in the country) I would guess that 881 would turn to 600-700 million after dropping the "minorities."
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia has 25 million people and , 495,757 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 31,407 declared they were Torres Strait Islander, and a further 21,206 declared they were both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.[9] that's not counting the Asians flooding in too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in total Europeans make up about 625 to 725 million worldwide. Any of the three countries eclipse Europeans just in there home countries (not counting them abroad.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Canada is basically a non factor at 35 million. Mexico has more people.
      </p>
      <p>
       See my point? And Europeans are being outbred on a crazy scale. Where I live the population is like two right angle triangles. One long end is 65+ white people and goes down to nothing for newborns. For blacks its the opposite. The long end is newborns and the short end is 65+. !/ /!

       I did that along time ago. Do you think the people with that money give a shit about the general white populace other than keeping them alive as cannon fodder and workers.

       Why are all those countries being invaded by refugees and immigrants?

       Also something I realized over time (being homeless for two years) those wealthy people do not give a flick about some homeless guy sleeping in the woods. Maybe if they were a little more racist I wouldn't have been homeless that long.

       Those with the money are white people!! The government, the MIC, it's always all old, Christian, wealthy white guys. The current president is exactly that. The people with the most power and wealth in the world are on average, white people

       And they're not being invaded lmao. I hear this meme all the time yet its terribly not true and disrespectful to actual war. I've had several friends and family visit Europe over the past few years, and they all had an absolute blast. Some of the best times of their lives. If I were to go on far right sites however, then apparently they're all Muslim hell holes and I'll get raped the second I step in there.

       You don't necessarily have to hate "minorities" to think whites are superior. I think whites overall are superior, but I'm not one of them. I used to be but I got sick (probably bioterrored)

       Thinking a race is superior to others is racist, yes, I don't see why you need me to explain this. It means you believe that the color of ones skin inherently makes them better than someone else based on the color of their skin. So you're discriminating, based on race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is racist. Don't really care what you claim to be, I can go by what you're actually saying

       Now what? In supposed to feel white and guilty? Its not just skin color btw. There's alot of variables. And don't pretend you don't have a superiority complex. You almost sound Jewish, butyou could be anyone these days.

       Did he have to marry the woman in commercial?  I mean there would be much better reasons to protest marrying the woman in the commercial.  Like we've never meet.  Or you are holding out for the Toyotathon lady.  I mean, you saw that look she gave me.

       You gotta be kidding right? Do you know how much time and money is spent on marketing these days? With whole departments and big budgets, theyre not gonna gloss over something important like the visual make up of the actors in a commercial.  They actually do research and market data, plan and meet, do test promos etc before deciding. And a big tippy top marketing manager gives the direction and approval for everything. Kind of strange that you didnt consider that.

       Four as in two separate couples. But that did put a funny image in my head of like a viagra commercial where the couple is in the bedroom talking to the camera, and then as they're wrapping up another couple opens the bathroom door and is just like "We're just finishing cleaning up!" and then the first couple just give a sly wink to the camera.

       I think I look at this differently. I am friends with a number of people in bi-racial relationships and I never understood why I never saw any bi-racial couples in commercials. And it never really occured to me there were bi-racial couples in commercials now, and when I thought about it I realized maybe commercials are beginning to reflect reality.

       I think you'll find the logical answer is that the Jews are trying to wipe out white people with (((Cultural Marxism))) by putting interracial couples in adverts. It's literally white genocide but remember, I'm not racist even though this whole theory hinges on the "one-drop" narrative.

       Would those studies conclude that the reason for the correlation is solely due to being biracial? That it was causal? Because I highly doubt any such study exists. They would probably conclude that it could he a variety of factors, probably social pressure as well

       Poor health because of social pressure is entirely a thing. Depression causes people to eat unhealthly, not work out, not leave their home, etc. All of that is unhealthy and causes poor health, and is due to the person suffering from a social pressures.

       Honestly this really is the first of heard of that. Any links handy? Or even just links to abstracts? Seeing as, in spite of most research being funded by our taxes, it gets locked behind the paywalls of privately owned journals it means the truth is easily hidden.

       So that's a link to an apparently
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       racist site where they say two separate species of gorilla means that different races of humans should be separate species of human, disregarding the magnitudes of genetic research done demonstrating the opposite. And their "evidence" page is just a link to their podcast talking about something Muhammad Ali said.

      <p>
       Yeah, totes real scientific.

       Except with a cursory search everything they claim is the opposite of what is found in academia.

       Just say "I'm a racist" and quit hiding behind this blatant anti-science pseudo intellectual veneer of obvious racism.

       I had to follow two links to get to research, which is what I requested, and ultimately only found one study, you claimed studies. But anyway...
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the conclusions of that research
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nevertheless, most mixed-race adolescents are at low risk. Most of the risk items we assessed may be interpreted as related to stress, so we may therefore choose to interpret mixed race as a source of stress. We cannot identify further the source of the stress
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So there is a slight issue seemingly related to stress over identify. Sounds to me like the issue is social attitudes, not anything genetic or biological.

       I’m half Mexican and I’ve noticed how they never market towards Hispanics. Also, the majority of mixed couples are white/Hispanic but when you see mixed couples on TV or ads they’re usually black/white like in that Cheerios commercial.

       For anyone wondering this guy is being a shithead, on purpose. InterFAITH marriages
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       “illegal” in Israel, in that the state will not perform a marriage. Interfaith and same-sex couples married elsewhere have their marriages recognized by the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is obviously a blatant attempt by the Jewish people to keep their tribe going along, which is pretty fucking weird and problematic to a lot of the rest of the world, but to imply that interracial marriage is illegal in Israel (which is a lie) serves solely to stir shit in this context. It is completely fucking irrelevant to anything.

       It's not because they are trying to steer people or society in any direction. What they are selling is an attitude- a flashy new color/perspective/attitude that the majority of their customers seem to be attractive. It's Woke Inc. Most of the people in the focus groups that they are trying to appeal to, won't ever marry someone who is not of their race; but they want to be a part of what that imagery represents (not the thing itself). When you consider that women control 20 trillion in worldwide purchasing (they may not make the money, but they are decision makers on most purchases...)- you can see how this comes to be something that focus groups highlight as desirable.  The sad truth is this is how adverts in our society work and have always worked since Bernays (and probably well before that). Mixed race couples in these ads are just props.

       There really isn't. I've worked in advertising and commercial film production for 15 years and you realize that it's not that organized. There are tons of real conspiracies out there but the racial engineering one is up there with Jesus being real. We want someone or something to be in charged- order is very appealing to most of us- but it's just not what it is. And if you fall down the rabbit hole of how this shit works and why it works, it's much more fucked up than whatever nonsense is in this thread. (But then again, I'm not 19)

       TV shows are almost always about distorting reality lmao. I know tons of people that really watch too much tv and they don't think LGBT make up 40% of the population

       Are you that influenced by your sitcoms? When friends and Seinfeld were on the air did you assume the country was entirely white and half-Jewish? Do you truly believe that all media should represent a mathematically accurate portrayal of all races or sexual orientations or hair colors or eye colors or shoe size or what? Are you upset that you can’t differentiate what shows are trying to appeal to you anymore by whether or not the characters are gay? Like what is the
       <em>

       They wanna get rid of unique nationalities while the ones in power stay “pure bred” it’s illegal to mix in Israel.. with unique bloodlines come unique power, creativity, drive, passion. They are really pushing the melting pot. This is exactly what Adolf Hitler wanted to protect, being pure to ones own country. But no, so many people can’t let go of their indoctrination that Hitler was evil and he killed a bunch of Jews. Fucking get over your ego, you’ve been lied to by movies games memes shows and more. Wake up.

       I agree with the first part of your answer but Hitler was just another bloodline member of the Illuminati. He’s part of the same overall agenda that is now subverting the white race with this biracial crap. Remember the Nazis were
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to (officially) lose WW2, so they could go underground and start manipulating the world through Project Paperclip, etc... It all fits into the grander narrative that’s playing out now.

       Race mixing works counter to incest. Which is what yiu are advocating. Small genepool leads to lower IQ's, fewer resistances to diseases and a generally poor appearance (premature baldness, crooked teeth).
The british royalty have horrid teeth because they refuse to allow mixing outside the family.

       Neither of those things are true. This narrative always relies on sneaky half-truths and deliberate obtuseness, you'll notice nobody pushing this narrative ever admits that a photo of a white person is less likely to include the word American than a photo of an African-
       <em>
        American
       </em>
       for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim Google wants to promote interracial couples but conveniently ignore the fact that searching things like "family" and "couple" brings up results that are overwhelming intraracial and white.

       It's all a conspiracy for white people to steal black people's ability to jump. They will do this by normalizing the theft of black genes through mixed relationships McDonald's ads. The movie was predictive programming. White men CAN jump.....  Soon.

       I don’t know what it means, I’ve just noticed a lot of commercials and other media with white men and black women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect it has something to do with the fact that a large majority of famous black men choose white women to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn’t the Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman just get chastised for this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever I see mixed race couples in public, it is usually a black man and a white woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is some sort of effort to distort reality again and make it seem as though these relationships are common.

       I've noticed that, as well as a huge increase in the number of black women in tv commercials.  But you'll notice that 99% of the biracial couples in commercials are a white male with a minority female, so they're still afraid to show a black male in a biracial couple.

       They show biracial couples to piss off white people and to brainwash young people. It probably pisses off some black people too.

       I agree with the first part of your answer but Hitler was just another bloodline member of the Illuminati. He’s part of the same overall agenda that is now subverting the white race with this biracial crap. Remember the Nazis were
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to (officially) lose WW2, so they could go underground and start manipulating the world through Project Paperclip, etc... It all fits into the grander narrative that’s playing out now.

       Race mixing works counter to incest. Which is what yiu are advocating. Small genepool leads to lower IQ's, fewer resistances to diseases and a generally poor appearance (premature baldness, crooked teeth).
The british royalty have horrid teeth because they refuse to allow mixing outside the family.

       You have to look at it from a world perspective. America has 320 million people and 245 million are White (could include 'white' Hispanics.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe in 2015 was estimated to be 741 million according to the United Nations,[1] which was slightly less than 11 % of the world population.
105 million are minorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of 2016, the total population of Africa is estimated at estimated at 1.225 billion, representing 17% of the world's population. According to UN estimates, the population of Africa may reach 2.5 billion by 2050 (about 26% of the world's total) and nearly 4.5 billion by 2100 (about 40% of the world's total
      </p>
      <p>
       China's population is 1.411 billion[1], the largest of any country in the world. According to the 2010 census, 91.51% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.49% were minorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       India is the second most populated country in the world with nearly a fifth of the world's population. According to the 2017 revision of the World Population Prospects[1], the population stood at 1,324,171,354.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there are 881 million people living in Europe and America (Europe's population counts "minorities" in it) (Tongans and Samoans are real minorities, Mexicans are also a world minority at 120 million people in the country) I would guess that 881 would turn to 600-700 million after dropping the "minorities."
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia has 25 million people and , 495,757 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 31,407 declared they were Torres Strait Islander, and a further 21,206 declared they were both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.[9] that's not counting the Asians flooding in too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in total Europeans make up about 625 to 725 million worldwide. Any of the three countries eclipse Europeans just in there home countries (not counting them abroad.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Canada is basically a non factor at 35 million. Mexico has more people.
      </p>
      <p>
       See my point? And Europeans are being outbred on a crazy scale. Where I live the population is like two right angle triangles. One long end is 65+ white people and goes down to nothing for newborns. For blacks its the opposite. The long end is newborns and the short end is 65+. !/ /!
