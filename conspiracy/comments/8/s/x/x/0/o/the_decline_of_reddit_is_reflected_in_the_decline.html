<p>When I saw the headline on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>, I naturally assumed it came from the unparalleled cesspool that is <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, but I had to do a double take when I saw <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> instead.</p>

<p>Not only that, but this is currently a featured story on the <em>BBC</em>!</p>

<p>Tabloid hackery appears to have replaced actual journalism, and the clear intent is to infuriate and distract the masses.</p>

<p>What a fascinating era to be alive, that&#39;s for sure...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone, but my own personal view is that is more the frustration over the tactics of the left, the dishonesty, the constantly spreading manufactured crap, and the lies.</p>

<p>That is troll like behavior. It is not debating in good faith. It has gone way beyond simply disagreeing in viewpoints or opinions. They are flat out lying. Someone spends the time to correct them, and they just stop responding and go on making the same claims again elsewhere.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the tactics of ganging up. You don&#39;t usually see that on the right, either. When I correct someone on the left, my inbox literally fills with leftist either trying to move the goalposts, outright trolling me, or simply ignoring what I posted and making the same claims over and over and over again.</p>

<p>Three posts in the last two days from leftists here have made claims and posted articles that don&#39;t even have any facts in them at all.</p>

<p>My problem is the tactics. I have no problem with someone of a different opinion debating in good faith. That&#39;s not what is happening here. That&#39;s not what is happening anywhere on social media. That is not what is happening in the MSM. </p>

<p>And I reject people demanding that the right be civil while the left are not operating in good faith. I am smart enough to figure out when someone is just ignorant on a subject and when they are intentionally lying.</p>

<p>Even the media is intentionally lying. There are tons of examples, but one that caught a lot of people&#39;s attention was the &quot;Japanese fish-feeding incident&quot; where the totality of the media suggested Trump just threw the entire box of fish food in the water when that was clearly not what happened. Another was using pictures from 2014 detention camps. They are lying. They know that they are lying. These are bad actors and they don&#39;t deserve civility.</p>

<p>I find it unreasonable if these actions DON&#39;T anger people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yes, it&#39;s just Fox! Doesn&#39;t matter how much war propaganda the NYT, WaPo, MSNBC, etc. put out. Just focus on FOX guys. Doesn&#39;t matter that the outlets I mentioned were cheerleaders for every war we&#39;ve been, as well as propping up terrorist groups like the White Helmets and painting them as heroes.</p>

<p>Recently, MSNBC put out their &quot;coverage&quot; of Venezuela which was probably the most disgusting spin piece I&#39;ve seen recently. Painted the &quot;opposition,&quot; which are the more right-wing faction supported by the US government, as &quot;heroes&quot; trying to oust the current regime. </p>

<p>What we are seeing is that self-proclaimed leftist outlets have become cheerleaders for war and neoliberal policies. That is far, far more dangerous than Fox because those outlets are, by in large, considered reputable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is one side is lying as a rule, not an exception and have the majority of the media doing it too. They also have every major social media network helping them promote it while censoring the other side.</p>

<p>So, you claiming that the other side is doing this and it is just a &#39;perspective issue&#39; really just furthers my point. It&#39;s not a perspective issue.</p>

<p>Sure there are cons that create propaganda, lie, etc... but it happens no where near is often and certainly not in mainstream.</p>

<p>Liberals claim cons lie, but their &#39;proof&#39; of the lie is just lies. 9 times out 10.</p>

<p>Photoshopping Obama into a satanic outfit is a lie. Go look at that thread and see how many cons actually participated in those threads. It&#39;s really not much. Look at how many cons in those threads pointed out it was fake.</p>

<p>The left almost never do that. When their propaganda is pointed out they say it doesn&#39;t matter if it is fake because whatever was being faked really happens. They defend it.</p>

<p>When the allegations against Trump raping a 13yo spread around, libs admitted they didn&#39;t believe it was true, but said it was justified to spread it because Trump is Hitler.</p>

<p>This is not a side acting in good faith. It is a side that is being subversive because they know their ideology is not popular and they think they are smarter than everyone else, so people need to be lied to for their own good.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of perspective.</p>

<p>Stop right there. The repeal of the 1948 act that banned domestic propaganda was introduced by Republican Mac Thornberry and &quot;New Democrat&quot; Adam Smith. The bill was sponsored by Donald Trump cohort Dana Rohrbacher. </p>

<p>Stop right there. The defense authorization is a must-pass bill or things begin to shut down.  There does not appear to be <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5736/details">any vote at all</a> on the propaganda amendment.</p>

<p>That means someone with the power to slip it into the final defense authorization just put it there. That could be Republican Mac Thornberry, who has worked on these bills for years, or it could be the Republican John Boehner who was the Speaker of the House.</p>

<p>So, both the NDAA and the propaganda amendment were under the control of Republicans. It should not be surprising then that most Republicans voted for it, and most Democrats voted against it.</p>

<p>Barack Obama signed it for an obvious reason: no terrible amendment could be worse than cutting military funding.</p>

<p>Essentially, you&#39;ve been fooled by Fake News. Republicans caused propaganda to be legal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Stop right there. BUT Ronald Reagan is the king of media deregulation. He started it and he did the most. As long as Ronald Reagan gets a free pass for his deregulation agenda, others will continue taking pieces out of it.</p>

<p>Boom - we have this border kerfluffle. It&#39;s a form of emotional catharsis for the left, where they reassure themselves that yes, Trump is the evil man they know him to be, <em>stealing babies from mothers and imprisoning them - oh, the humanity</em>!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think her wearing that jacket is a deliberate tactic to derail the current news cycle. It&#39;s classic Trump -- he screws up, or gets caught out, so either he tweets something outrageous, or finds uses a family member to do something stupid, and the media latch onto that, taking the pressure of him.</p>

<p>Right now he&#39;s swinging for breathing space over a news cycle focused in his zero tolerance policy, and the negative impact that has had. Like the OP says, the jacket story exists <em>to infuriate and distract the masses</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s truly amazing how low the President would sink, sending his own wife like a canary into coal-mine, just to divert attention from his own incompetency. But it&#39;s worked - air-time that could have focused on the scandal has been eaten up by debates over a damn jacket. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s pretty fertile as a conspiracy -- the President of the USA making his trophy wife wear something offensive to distract the media from his policy of tearing children from their parents and locking them in cages.</p>

<p>Dystopias just kinda sneak up on us all like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Decline of Reddit is reflected in the prevalence of pro-Trump bots and shills invading all reasonable discussions, with their stupid authoritarian viewpoints. Once T_D is dismantled and all the vile creatures neutralized, then we can expect to read real conspiracies like his endless corruption, connections with the Russian mob, his love for his pre-teen daughter and Miss Teen Universe kids, his connections to convicted pedophiles, real charges of sexual abuse against him including by a 13 year old girl, affirmed by another brutalized 14 year girl, connections to corporate and unethical influences of all his slimy administration - Wilbur Ross, Betsy Devo&#39;s, Erik Prince, Ajit Pai, Mick Mulvaney, Scott Pruitt and so on.</p>

<p>MSM is a generic and intentionally vague term. Fox is one of the larger media outlets and rants about MSM while licking the presidents balls and smearing his shit on their viewers. This ridiculous propaganda shit is the real media conspiracy, in addition to Sinclair, Rush Limbaugh&#39;s made up shit, Alex Jones and all the plethora of con artists pretending to be caring about brainless supporters, while actually making money through illicit connections or through shitty supplements. </p>

<p>Shame on you guys for letting this happen to Reddit... Let us all rid this site of the pro-Trump scourge and strive towards a more enlightened community. </p>

<p>Applying skepticism and critical thinking to MSM narratives on Reddit is not &#39;pro-trump&#39;. Those claims are used as a way to shut down critical thinking, to foment unwavering support of &lt;insert_current_talking_points_here&gt;. Actual meaningful discussion is buried with rage and ridicule, helping to keep others from stepping out of line. </p>

<p>You push those exact same MSM talking points that flood r/news, r/worldnews, and r/politics. Your gaslighting is a giant red flag that identifies you as part of that machine. Brigade all you want, you&#39;re not fooling many.</p>

<p>Once again: applying skepticism and critical thinking to media does make someone &#39;pro-trump&#39; or &#39;pro Fox News&#39; or &#39;pro-Infowars&#39;. I&#39;m not a fan of <em>any</em> of those, but, regardless, what you&#39;re <em>still doing</em> is attempting to gaslight.</p>

<p>Yes, that is part of your shtick, your script, to foment fear via ridicule and derision. &#39;You poor thing, you&#39;re just delusional and misinformed.&#39; </p>

<p>Seriously, you&#39;re not fooling many, and for you to bring that lame attempt at compassionate gaslighting <em>here</em> of all places lights you up for everyone to see, makes your tactics apparent to all.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not very good at what you do. Without your brigades you&#39;d be nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peach mint is only a temporary cure. The country needs a major detox from the bullshit sprayed by Trump and his shit hole administration. But thanks for introducing me to r/russialago... Looks like an interesting community. Not that I am so interested in the content that is out there. For discerning observers, the truth of Russias involvement in Brexit, Trump&#39;s election and meddling in ongoing US and global politics is obvious. I am more concerned about the ongoing blatant corruption, utter lack of regard to truth, notions, facts and compassion from the administration. It starts with us spreading the real truth and countering the pro-Trump and pro-Russia gaslighters. Then we can take on the corporate shills and lobbyists shittibg on our democracy. Then we can address the lack of compassion and reason in our policies. A lot of good work to do. Join us ✋</p>

I like a little bit of both policies given that I&#39;m in Finance. But this is not about liberal or conservative. I&#39;m talking about gaslighters on the conservative and alt right spectrum who are subordinate to Trump and are manipulating people for their own agenda. </p>

<p>The detox already in progress is the legal process against Trump, his businesses, associates and cabinet members. But a long way to go. May Truth and Compassion win in the end!! 💚</p>

<p>That&#39;s super awesome and totally a smart move. When you don&#39;t care about the media so much that you wear things specifically just to fuck with them, especially when the general public will look at it like you don&#39;t care for the situation your dealing with.</p>

<p>If she doesn&#39;t care about the media, then why would she need to send them a message. If she didn&#39;t care about them she could not talk to them, tell them to leave her alone, or just bullshit about wherever if she did talk to them.</p>

<p>Why would she go through the trouble for the media when the public would see this as not caring for the immigrants?</p>

<p>That is troll like behavior. It is not debating in good faith. It has gone way beyond simply disagreeing in viewpoints or opinions. They are flat out lying.</p>

<p>This answer would be more convincing except:</p>

<ol>
<li>You provide no actual examples of these lies</li>
<li>The President of the United States, a very right-wing person, is such a blatant liar that he can&#39;t even keep his story straight <em>in a single interview.</em></li>

<p>You said <em>In This Thread</em>. I don&#39;t see any removed comments of mine. What ones are you referring to?</p>

<p>Incorrect again, you literally are replying to a moderator (me) with a distinguished comment informing you of your rule violations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s distinguished now. If this is a warning, fair enough. Point taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The difference is one side is lying as a rule, not an exception and have the majority of the media doing it too. They also have every major social media network helping them promote it while censoring the other side.</p>

<p>So, you claiming that the other side is doing this and it is just a &#39;perspective issue&#39; really just furthers my point. It&#39;s not a perspective issue.</p>

<p>Sure there are cons that create propaganda, lie, etc... but it happens no where near is often and certainly not in mainstream.</p>

<p>Liberals claim cons lie, but their &#39;proof&#39; of the lie is just lies. 9 times out 10.</p>

<p>Photoshopping Obama into a satanic outfit is a lie. Go look at that thread and see how many cons actually participated in those threads. It&#39;s really not much. Look at how many cons in those threads pointed out it was fake.</p>

<p>The left almost never do that. When their propaganda is pointed out they say it doesn&#39;t matter if it is fake because whatever was being faked really happens. They defend it.</p>

<p>When the allegations against Trump raping a 13yo spread around, libs admitted they didn&#39;t believe it was true, but said it was justified to spread it because Trump is Hitler.</p>

<p>This is not a side acting in good faith. It is a side that is being subversive because they know their ideology is not popular and they think they are smarter than everyone else, so people need to be lied to for their own good.</p>

<p>It is not a matter of perspective.</p>
