        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As all of you are aware, Florida rapper XXX Tentacion has passed... I am not a fan of his music nor any new age rap but there are some interesting things about this incident.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is a previous video of XXX Tentacion speaking about, ‚ÄúIf I get sacrificed or killed or what ever, I‚Äôm just happy to touch so many peoples lives...‚Äù so on and so forth.  Now the interesting thing about this video is that he is in the same vehicle and clothing he was found dead in.  ü§î</p>

<p>Secondly, the news and all media are saying that he was shot.  Okay, from the screenshots I have reviewed, there is a dead XXX Tentacion. True.  But, his lips are white, like completely chapped white.  His clothes are prestigious and no blood stains anywhere.  His body could not have sat overnight or for a long duration for his lips to turn white regardless, could they?  The guy was wearing a white and blue jacket if I recall, no blood stains, no blood anywhere.  Not only that, his ride didn‚Äôt have any bullet holes.</p>

<p>My closing statement:
Was XXX Tentacion murdered as a sacrifice and covered up to look like a homicide?  Or, was XXX Tentacion so tied into the Illuminati that they had to remove him from fame and displace him elsewhere? Or did he factually get shot and not have any blood in his body?  (That‚Äôs the only explanation I could come up with for the bloodless videos and pictures.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, basically just that. That entire scene was manufactured for the purpose of the counterculture. If you look at the current SoundCloud rap scene they all are basically pushing this counterculture agenda of popping pills, sippin lean, basically just not giving a fuck about anything. XXX was the only one of these rappers from this scene talking about self empowerment and other conscious things , which is why I think he was taken out. I don‚Äôt have any links to anything but the fact that they all come from the same county which just also had this big shooting which seems to be the main one that really started the whole gun control push, plus the infamously corrupt politician with the initials DWS is in charge of the county. Seems extremely sketchy and it would not surprise me if this whole music scene being from there isn‚Äôt a coincidence either. It is only a theory of mine but anyone with any tips or leads, please comment and share </p>

    <div class="md"><p>XXX seems to be embodying a sort of Lucifer type archetype, as he is constantly talking about being ‚Äúthe light‚Äù and seems to be constantly speaking knowledge and getting people to rise up and empower themselves. So as far as ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù goes I believe you would have to apply the principle of duality. Also the gematria of his full birth name adds up to 216, which is 6 x 6 x 6. There is also a member of XXX‚Äôs crew that goes by the name Tankhead666, he claims that he is X‚Äôs ‚Äúguardian‚Äù and literally says ‚ÄúI am a light bearer, I am Luciferian‚Äù. XXX‚Äôs old manager was a porn star named Bruno Dickemz who is apparently very into the dark occult, literally has a giant mural of demons having sex with girls in his house. Take a look at this from a few months ago:</p>
