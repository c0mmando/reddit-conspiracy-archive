       Personally, high doses of vitamin d and any attempt to decalcify your pineal gland seems worth it. Obviously keto is nice, primarily for low sugar. Paleo can be helpful in the mantra of eating whole natural foods. Obviously organics better if you can afford it, or Even home made! Home made probiotics, mainly sauerkraut can be life changing. Intermittent fasting is great for me. 7 to 9 hours of sleep seems completely necessary, along with turning screens off awhile before bed. Wim Hof method is real and effective and needs more research.

       Any other tips you guys practice or recommend?

       I'd like to state that while red meat doesn't help, most offal, foul, fish help my stomach, and I suffer from Crohns, IBS, and EPI. I wouldn't necessarily say cut all meat. But yes your diet should mainly subsist of veggies

       pretty difficult to find really clean chicken nowadays, I live in Germany and can only eat the ones from the local bio (organic) farmer with a peace of mind. Everywhere else, even local chicken farmers put a lot of growing hormones and antibacterial medicine into the chicken's diet. So I can't imagine how difficult it must be in the states if you aren't able to find a local organic producer

       I think in the states they can only use hormones in the beef industry, antibiotics are used pretty heavily from my understanding.

       Not sure about the NWO bit, but veganism absolutely is a ploy to make people unhealthy. Our ancestors ate meat-based diets, sometimes supplemented by mostly fermented/soaked/sprouted plants (as opposed to fresh, unprocessed), and they were healthier than any of us could ever dream to be.

       Really?  What I've found is eliminating sugar and carbohydrates and fasting is very liberating.  Eating nothing but meat and fat is very satiating, only requiring one meal a day or even going for a day or two without food is a great improvement in overall health and well being.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that nobody wants you to know this because it revolutionizes the amount of food you need to eat and liberates he mind from thoughts of food.  The food industry is based on over consumption of food to the point of extremely poor health.

       Well that remains a mystery.  HDL/LDL ratio is much improved, weight stable, strength up, sleep better, blood pressure lower, energy levels up, mental concentration and focus way up.

       I won't say it's the answer for everyone but I will say that I look around now at what people are eating, putting in their carts, lining up for during their day and can say that I am liberated from that shit.

       Yep outside of all the physical improvements I'm also blown away with how much my memory improved.  I find programming to be so much easier and natural where as before my keto diet.  I can just write code, without having to stop and relook up example code to what I want to write multiple times.

       I didnt do keto, went straight to an all meat diet because that works for where I live.  But the effects have been very noticeable and positive.  I'm at the same weight as high school.  But the most profound impact has been not thinking about food.  I am now a believer that food is energy not pleasure.  So I'm no longer addicted to it.  Not that I was over weight, but standard diet keeps food on the mind all the time.  I enjoy the mind cleansing effect of fasting as well.  Anyway, not trying to push this on anyone just relating my experience.

       I like to read this sub occasionally because I like alternate views of the mainstream.  I find that it helps me be more critical of our "I'm so right - because look here" additude that we're guilty of, including myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your first link shows evidence of a diet effect on a particular ailment, some positive results and some negative effects.  GI issues are obviously directly related to a change in diet.  Things adapt, they may improve they may not.  But many years of the same food followed by a sharp change will cause the body to go though a transformation period.  What we considered normal levels for X or Y are based on our modern diet because that is how these normals have been derived, from millions of samples of blood tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I choose to look at societal effects from what we do and how we consume, I don't disregard modern medicine but it fails many people.  It's obvious that some people do well with an active lifestyle and standard diet.  Others don't, we simplify things and say well it's because of this or that.  As do scientific studies like your first example - test x against y, relate to normal.  But much like in life, different things do better under certain conditions.  That's how we got here, all the diversity created an environment for an advantage of one trait over another.  I accept that many different truths can exist and that grey might be the predominate one, over pure white or black.

       Except a lot of people on keto diet get blood work and including myself, found our ldl/hdl levels improved ten fold, my testosterone went up, and my vitamins and minerals I didn't need to take supplements anymore.

      <p>
       It's almost like people's biology is different and what works for some doesn't work for others.  For me keto improved my life and health ten-fold.

       I am just now getting into essential oils myself,  so dont have much experience to relate.  I know the molecules of volatile organic compounds (the good healing stuff) in essential oils are very tiny and are readily absorbed into our tissues, right into the cells.   Some can even cross the blood-brain barrier. Essential oils are extracts of large amounts of plant matter,  so a small amount of oil may contain the healing compounds from hundreds of pounds of flower or bark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally,  I have used peppermint oil to heal wounds 4 times faster than usual (apply directly to the wound) and get rid of headaches (rub on the temples).  Lavender oil (massaged into painful muscles) stopped extremely painful spasms when I threw my back out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly,  lavender oil on wounds can help them to heal without scar tissue.  The wounds I put peppermint oil on also healed with almost no scar tissue.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to get at least food grade oils to ensure purity, therapeutic grade is even better.

       There isn't much scientific info about this,  because it flies in the face of Western  medicine understanding.  Basically,  food high in bioactivity (bacteria, specifically aerobic bacteria in the case of high meat) is like a boost of probiotics for your system.   Even though the meat I was eating (only about a teaspoon in one sitting) was so putrid I had to do it outside or I'd ruin the air in the house,  I never once became Ill or got food poisoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       My eczema  was so bad I was ready to try anything... it was ruining my life.   Had it all over my body,  even on my face.   A month after I started having a bit of high meat at night,  my skin cleared up and never went rashy again.  I haven't touched high meat in years and my eczema is still gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many cultures that consume rotten meat intentionally.

       Really the best gut healing is combination of low sugar and probiotics. If you have an otherwise well rounded diet, this seems to do the trick. Imo

       That's also true. But remember you really have to do the research on what probiotics to use. Don't just buy the stuff you see on ads or TV.

       Home made sauerkraut my friend. Seems to be the best bet all around. Easy, cheap, trillions of probiotics (plenty of types , nearly all Alive, very bioavailable, has prebiotics to consume)

       I'm convinced that the whole 'low carb' diet fad/trend was designed to keep people lethargic so they dont exercise or stay as active as they could be so that they slowly become shitblob couch slobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, carbs are energy. If you dont have carbs, you wont have energy. How are you supposed to be active and fit and live meaningfully without energy? That just seems like common sense to me.

       Low carb brings you to ketosis, where you use a more sustainable, available, and efficient source for energy, and that's fat. Not to mention there are plenty of keto styles that implement heavy carb usage for athletic purposes. Please go to

       I think posture is worth a mention. Poor posture leads to fighting gravity and losing. We've all seen older hunchbacks struggling to move around. When your posture is correct and your spine is straight it physically feels better to me. Rolfing is a procedure that manipulates the body to achieve this. Some people claim that when they are in the correct posture they can feel gravity for the first time on the top of their head.

       Health isn’t about a diet but rather a lifestyle. One of the largest threats to large scale food industry is the realization most lifestyle changes are typically for the better - “better” being subjective but as more information becomes increasingly available, big industry is working overtime to cover their shenanigans (ie. finding new names for sugar etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       The other tip commonly covered up is the fact that our bodies were never made to sustain the ingestion of synthetic and/or processed foods or ingredients. This is a fact and will never change - people are learning this in troves, particularly as the children of baby boomers are caring for their aging parents who have miserable, non acute, medical conditions. Think cigarettes. Think processed foods.

       I honestly don’t know. For me it’s more of a circumstance where instead of introducing a psychoactive, an environment elicits a different state. The difference is there is no ingestion of chemicals. Just me though.

       But if you ingest dmt and it produces dmt, it's not all that different from something else producing dmt. Tho I do understand your wanting to do it as naturally as possible. Either way, this has all been over semantics lol we both love floating

       Man that's a great deal. Unfortunately, I live nowhere near a facility that offers it, so the only time I can is when I go to my friends house, who's dad built them a float tank. I'm looking into moving away for school so I'm gonna hold off on building my own til then!

       I didn't know that sub was a thing! Nice! Yeah, I'd highly recommend it. Very easy blueprint and list to things needed on a website. I'm on my phone otherwise I'd link it, but just Google diy float tank. Works like a charm, I can't imagine how a 10,000 dollar one would be any better (besides quality of mechanics and quality of life features)

Excessive masturbation is bad for you, fuck yeah it is. But masturbation in moderation is healthy, normal, and harmless as long as you aren’t like jacking it to snuff

       No I can't afford my own tank. I get naked at the spa and float in the tank. Zero sound, zero light, zero gravity. I meditate on my breath using Mindfulness techniques. I run several meditation groups so I am somewhat experienced with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea behind the tank is that you are with nothing but your thoughts in water the same temp as your body. The first time I floated, it was tough to be still. The second time, my body was so still and relaxed I lost all sense of where my body ended and the rest of the world began. It was just me and my consciousness, and it was a terrifying introspection at how much my thoughts race and worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I walked out of it in an intensely relaxed state with some element of my conscious connection to my body severed. I notice more how my body operates separately from my thoughts, and had a better understanding of their relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oddly, during my deepest states in the tank I tend to hallucinate the sound of crickets from my childhood home backyard. I do not experience psychosis otherwise, and I'm aware there are no crickets, but it's like this sound that wouldn't otherwise be there without deep meditative beta waves.

       It's great but quite expensive at $70 an hour. You need to give it a few tries before it clicks with you, especially if you've never meditated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also don't rub your eyes after leaving the tank. The salt is so concentrated they will burn for hours.

       For autistic kids clothes or blankets with little weights spread out  help “ ground” the kids.   If they are spastic and all over it helps a little to “ center” them.    I can’t think of better words or ways to describe how it helps ,  but I see a difference.

       Weighted blankets help almost everyone. It’s like being tucked in or having a big thick comfort blanket without the excess heat. It replicates being held or swaddled. Same way thunder jackets work to calm pets.

       I think it's hard to say "this works" about anything because all of us are different. I think people should just be aware that a doctor is usually going to give you medicine for something wrong with you. I think more people should look into what's worked for other people even without the medicine. Just Google it and you'll find forums about whatever you're dealing with. When it comes to serious shit like cancer, dont listen to the hippies on the internet. But if its depression or skin care pr weight loss, theres a lot of people out there with a story to tell on what's worked for them.

       The list can certainly go on.  Just be happy you’re not in a country that sells it’s good natural water to large international companies for profit (

       I have been slowly cutting back my portions for maybe 2 years, and I am honestly appalled at the serving sizes when we go out to eat any more. My wife and I split everything. One dish/meal feeds us both, usually with leftovers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't wrap my head around how large the portions are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if its a local thing, being in the south. But a meal intended to feed 1 person is almost laughably huge. I don't know how one person can eat all that in one sitting. But apparently it's the norm.

       Its just seen as normal to gorge yourself.

       I start by sitting on it and rolling around on my gluteus. If this part is unusually tight, I use a lacrosse ball.

       Next I roll the entire length of the spine, paying most attentiontp the low back. You can feel and hear your spine cracking and smoothing out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I roll out my legs. Every large muscle group, and IT bands. There are YouTube videos that describe exactly how to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s important to remember, the first few times can be excruciatingly painful. That’s normal, but eventually you’ll be able to do this with almost no pain.

       Stretch every day, especially if sitting a lot, or muscles/tendons/ligaments will shrink and the result is a hunched over posture
      </p>
      <p>
       Do squats instead of bending over to avoid hurting the spine and have a full core workout. Squats need just standing space, no equipment and can be done in a couple seconds. Both heels on the ground, small of the back arched, head straight.

       Zinc oxide is a great sunblock, Wikipedia describes it as the widest UV ray blocker in existence. One pharmacist I talked to described it as "impenetrable". It also soothes burns, rashes, herpes etc. but if there's an actual skin condition it might not be enough and you might have to treat the underlying condition.

       Sunburns are (skin) cells that became FUBAR afther staying to long in the sun.
To mutch of this and the cells will become cancer cells aka you get skin cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       African people and people around the equiter andwhat not in places with a lot of (burning) sun are darker. This due to pigment.
Eli5 pigment is a natural protection against sunburn. Yet for "white" people this isnt there untill its needed. Aldo this is a a slow progress and never will be able to protect 100%.

       Try both and see which one is more comfortable but you eventually want to have a full range of motion and become able-bodied. Always try things out gradually since tendons/muscles/ligaments don't appreciate jerky movements.

       Melatonin isn't addicting, it's habit forming. Melatonin isn't something you crave or need to have (a fix) but a crutch you think you need to sleep. "Oh I forgot to take it, that's why I'm having trouble sleeping!" An addiction is a compulson to do something, a habbit is something that can be controlled or modified. Kind of like Nicotine vs THC, one is addicting and the other is habit forming.

       Zinc oxide is very well known as a sun blocker and almost all cream style sunblocks contain either that or Titanium dioxide (which is almost as good, but lacks a bit of UVA protection). And what you're describing for rashes is the antibacterial properties of ZnO mixed with a small % of Iron oxide, making calamine lotion, which has been known and used for hundreds of years and widely commercially available.

       . The recipe calls for preheating a skillet in the oven and despite wearing a mitten I grabbed the handle with my other hand and burned my fingers. I quickly rubbed on some ZnO and the pain subsided within 10-15 minutes. There's no swelling though the skin is slightly redder where the burns were meant to be. It works, I don't know how or why, and people should know about it.

       I'm not an expert, but my guess why it worked would be:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        How quickly you applied it
       </li>
       <li>
        Sealing/coating of the ointment (hydrates the area, keeps out bacteria)
       </li>
       <li>
        Heat capacity of the ointment (removes excess heat, cools the area, same reason they say to run fresh burns under cool water)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It would have probably been the same if you applied aloe vera. I'm not discounting ZnO, I think it's a very useful chemical, just wanted to give some context.

       Melatonin only works if the reason you can't fall asleep is due to a disturbed circadian rhythm. That means getting blue light exposure too late at night, jet lag, and a few other specific causes. If your inability to sleep is due to other factors melatonin won't help anymore than a placebo.

       As you get older, your body produces less melatonin over time. When I was younger, The stuff was useless. Now that I'm older, it helps me fall asleep and stay asleep, even when my sleeping patterns are very regular.

       Stretching is not activating muscles. All muscles contract when they are 'in use'- they do not stretch when trying to bear a load.  stretching is healthy, but muscles shorten  (atrophy) due to not being used and has nothing to do with stretching.

       Yeah.  Meat, dairy, and sugar (especially processed sugar) leads to an absolute shit ton of very serious health problems.  Fruits, nuts, and vegetables (as well as regular moderate exercise) are the best way to go if you want to be as healthy as possible.

       I second this wholeheartedly. Everyone should know about how unhealthy (and even dangerous) meat and dairy are. Animal protein is not good for your body, and most leading causes of death in the USA (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, even cancer) are completely preventable by eating a whole foods, plant based diet. Eliminate dairy. Eliminate meat. Eat whole foods. You will be surprised at the mental clarity and health improvements.

       Maybe it's time to educate yourself then? There are different types of carbs, the stuff they "make"(more like your choice to be addicted to) u addicted to are straight up additives and high fructose sugars. Complex carbs are good for humans and the body uses glucose as main fuel source anyway.

       Your body eventually decides "oh shit I need a new source of energy." It then starts going off of fat instead of glucose. Burns fat. Excess glucose doesn't get converted to fat. There is a power band where this is effective. There is also one where it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: this is pretty useful. Doesn't matter if it doesn't work for you.

       No, they are losing weight on keto because whether intentional or not they are restricting calories, that's how weight loss works, calories in vs calories out. U don't know this neither do i expect you to know this, that's why i tried to taught you this with shapes and colors but seems like it was too difficult to grasp.

       I think it's genetic. I do fine on a diet with much carbs. My GF, who has a lot of genes from an indiginous arctic people, gain 5 kg just looking at bread or potatos. She has been eating only meat, butter, eggs and leafy non carb veggies for a year now. Lost 33kg and so healthy she is glowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have primarily genes from the indo european farmer population you propbably do fine on a healthy mix of carbs. If there is some hunter gatherer in your genes you might end up fat and diabetic from what everyone else calls healthy food.

       Not only are so many misinformed, but when you try to inform them, they crucify you for attempting to get them off the poison they're consuming.  Then they wonder why so many people are dying of Alzheimer's and a bunch of other lifestyle-oriented diseases that they think are just "genetic and unavoidable".

       Ive said a few times when this subject has came up that in almost everyway you look at our body it just doesnt match that of a meat eater. Teeth and mouth arent right, bowels are far to long.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to limit meat to a couple times a week and have a bit of fish aswell. Most of the time I find myself naturally gravitating towards fruit though, it seems so easy for me to eat where as everything else is a bit of a struggle. Avocados are my perfect food, tasteful, low sugar, good amount of good fats

       I dont care how animals in the wild live nor do I care what we used to eat. I have the opportunity to make a moral choice and take responsibility over my own actions. Or I can be a coward and blame stuff like history, biology, it tastes good etc. Seems like you made your choice.

       You need to look at his tone, to which I was responding to - he was being quite passive agressive with me. I was a meat eater as well, not too long ago, but I was honest enough to say that I just didnt care enough about animals and apathetic. No blaming other factors. Own up to your own actions!

       A balanced meal is what you need. And it's pretentious to think that your morality being applied to food would have bettered our society as it developed. Ever heard the term "Hunter/Gatherer"?  That's because people ate both. That's also how we learned to be the Masters of our own domain.

       Yeah and humans killed humans, i guess that's okay aswell but oh no, a reporter was killed now it's suddenly a bad thing, CONSPIRACY!!

       Oh no someone killed a dog, elephant or any other exotic animal now i suddenly care.

       Dude plz, we are way past that time where people killed for survival, if we supposedly were meant to kill/eat other things then why are people getting upset when chinese people eat dogs? Just nature bro.

       You are assuming your morals on the matter are superior to a meat-eater's morals by default, when that is entirely a matter of belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally (I'm not the guy you replied to), I tend to think of myself as an animist, believing that consciousness is fundamental to matter, meaning that everything there is has life and consciousness. We certainly know this about plants, but I see no non-arbitrary reason to draw the line there and not elsewhere. I don't think the line exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that in mind, whatever I may decide eat is something that was and is alive to me. So morally, I see no reason to abstain from one living creature over another. My goal in life is to minimise suffering, my own as well as in general. Eating well-sourced, healthy meat has proven to reduce my suffering, and as long as humane livestock and slaughtering practices that equally seek to minimise suffering are upheld as they tend to be in my country, eating meat in responsible amounts can be morally justified in my estimation.

       The part about plant life, plant experience, plant communication, what together can comfortably thought of as a kind of plant consciousness is not. It's

       according to Wikipedia, that is.

      <p>
       A plant that can detect a predator's smell and then react by making themselves inedible to the specific predator or by releasing a dedicated smell to which other plants in turn can react in their own ways. In my view, that actually goes a bit beyond the definition of Sentience and wanders into the definition of Consciousness.

       Where did the desire arise from if not from external stimuli? I'm not saying that reacting to stimuli is all that you do, but it's the primary function of our brain. How you react is defined by your programming, which in turn is a function of past external stimuli and your accumulated reactions to them.
      </p>

       It's simply a vastly more complex version of the same underlying condition of consciousness, is what I'm trying to say. The difference between a plant's consciousness, and the consciousness of animals and humans is merely a question of complexity. At least that is my fundamental presupposition on the matter.

       Every country kills the animals the same way, being an animal specifically breed for food is already suffering.

       Bias has nothing to do with it. I'm not a news station. I have views which I have mostly formed through careful consideration, trying to ridding them of unfounded assumptions, and I represent my conclusions as honestly as I can. 
I may be wrong in whole or in part, and I may be hypocritical in whole or in parts of my view, but believing in a living, conscious Universe and feeding off that same Universe in a manner that sustains and develops me, to me, is not in disagreement. Believing in a living Universe and then torturing that Universe would be a wholly different matter.

       The spirit doesn't disappear, it's still there. Part of it is part of me now, part of it lives on through and with others, part of it lives on in the animal whose meat I ate's young. I also "take away" the spirit of a tomato when I eat it in my salad. And when I die, I'll be eaten by maggots, if I'm not eaten alive by a bear before then. As a forward thinking human I can reasonably avoid the latter, but certainly not the former. What comes around goes around, and I'll feed the circle of life just as well as everything else in due time.

      <p>
       No. That is a judgement you made. I claim that eating meat can be responsibly done and morally justified, provided that every conceivable effort to reduce the animal's suffering in life and in death is taken, which is the case for practically all of my meat (unless I buy an occasional burger at McD perhaps). I do not claim that you have to be an animist to be "allowed" to eat meat or something. I don't claim to have higher morals than anybody, but I will represent my morals honestly and defend them if I have to (and adapt them when they reveal themselves to be flawed).

      <p>
       That's a meaningless statement. Meat alone is not a healthy diet, no. But a general diet based on meat and vegetables is a pretty well-established basis for a functioning and healthy diet. It has been for thousands of years. I'd be more concerned about the things that are in the meat because of corrupted industrial live-stock practices, like antibiotics and residual stress hormones.

       That is patently false as well. Cows die very differently in India than they do in China, or in Argentina, or in Spain or in Germany, or in the US. Some of those practices inflict significant amounts of suffering, not only in life, but also in death.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally know the farmer who breeds the cows from which I try to eat (I do make occasional exceptions when necessary and buy meat in shops), and they are happy as fuck. The breeding standards here in Central Europe have gone up so much that the animals can live with little meaningful restriction, with space to move and play and rest, with great grasslands to feed off, until the day they get taken outside and drop dead painlessly. Again, I treat my tomatoes the same way, because I see no non-arbitrary difference between the life of a plant and the life of an animal.

      <p>
       I fail to see what you're trying to say with your final sentence. I do not want the animals to suffer. That would be a sin. In fact, the meaning of sin is supposedly derived from hunting with bow and arrow, where it is a sin to hit your prey in such a manner that it doesn't kill it quickly.

       You misunderstood the concept of sin. It is not a sin to kill an animal for nutrition, it is a sin to make it suffer by incompetence. Letting a professional do the killing with dedicated tools is the most reasonable decision. A bolt to the brain is better than a clever to the neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also stand by what I said about happy cows. I live in a region where cows spend about half the year roaming freely in the mountains, and the rest of the year on the meadows except for 3 months in Winter, where they roam as freely as possible in roaming stables.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are worse conditions around here too, but not significantly. But then, I don't have to buy from those places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another thought, meant in good spirit. How many cows do you think would be left to roam the alps (or the world for that matter) if we stopped eating them? Unless we collectively start calling them holy, like the Hindus do, we'd have to limit their numbers another way by hunting them like we hunt deer and invasive species, lest we want all our crops eaten by roaming hoards of wild cows.

       I know the argument, classic, but the only reason we have so many cows is because we specifically breed to have as many as possible, if we never intervened, they would be just like any other wild animal roaming the earth.

       You are presupposing that killing (in general) is a sin. I claim it is not. I claim it is part of life. That does not mean that I think all killing is justified, far from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also doesn't mean that I like killing. It's a heavy burden, if you recall the archer who considers it a sin to cause his prey avoidable suffering. Someone who thinks that way doesn't hunt because he gets a kick out of it. And why are humans "supposed to like it"? According to whom? There's a difference between being at peace with a harsh dynamic of give and take in nature, and navigating that space humanely and responsibly as best we can, and getting a kick out of skinning baby seals, you know? One is a recent symptom of some cultural pathology that thrives on cruelty, while the other is a practice that has been a part of every human culture ever discovered (to the best of my knowledge), living or past.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that we can't improve our practices and limit our waste and throughput, as it relates to living things and resources in general, but to consider meat consumption – no matter the method or practices – to be immoral, wrong, or hypocritical in general is not a rational, reasonable, or morally superior position in my view.

       Whenever the topic of eating meat comes up the people in this subreddit show their true nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       They might pretend to be open minded or truth seekers or whatever else they say to massage their egos, but that illusion is shattered when the idea that animals are not ours to exploit and kill as we please comes up.

       So what do we do? Do we try to minimize the killing? Does this affect the animals we currently breed? How so? Could it be detrimental? Do we stay the same? What ramifications does that have? Can humans truly change? Is there some biologically programmed instinct for meat that most people have? And if so, what then?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the answers. All I can say is that our current way of getting food is by stealing(milk, fruits, hell even caveman 1 stealing caveman 2's food) or killing (plants, animals, fungi, etc.) I think it's imortant to discuss the ramifications of changing to a different diet vs staying on the same one, so thank you :)

       Would you rather live in captivity for 20 years, in a cage where you could not even lie down? Being overfed for all of those years with horrible food, only to be killed? Would you choose that over not existing in that environment?

       Ahh yes, where someone watches a video and it convinces them 100&amp;#37; of something and they're automatically an expert after watching said video. I'd love to debate someone like you after my years of study on this, but considering your comment history, I usually know when stuff like that is a waste of effort. Where someone is to lazy to do proper research regarding such topics, I think I will just spare you from making you look even more dumb.

       Yea well some of us actually do  realresearch  rather than take any video at face value just because it sounds intelligent. Congratulations, you're a genius and know all things meat and dairy after your video. Lets ignore those that lived past 100 eating meat consistently. Lets also ignore that fact that their aren't any concrete studies showing meat or dairy being the prime reasons leading to various diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now do us all a solid and post something else that led you to your conclusions instead of videos. And before you do your google search just remember, correlation does not equal causation. Good luck. Looking forward to your findings!

       It's less the juice and more the fasting. Your body starts burning your fat stores, which are healthy fats and begin to heal you. Low calorie fasting also increases autophagy, which is the destruction of damaged or dysfunctional cells.

       yes but its both.... your essentially getting nutrition while fasting.... the body goes into hyper cleanse/heal mode with the added benefit of not feeling the hunger/weakness.  plus a shit ton of vitamins and minerals.

       Not really a "shit ton". Plants have anti-nutrients that prevent most of the vitamins and minerals from being absorbed by your body. You're mostly just getting the flavor.

       loads....    look up lemon ginger blast.  it is the king of all juices.   but even orange or carrot or apple are great.  just get as much alive juice in as often as possible you will feel the benefits immediately.
add lemon  and ginger for a boost.  then your greens like kale spinach etc etc... will take it to the next level.  :D

works on joint pain but also for skin problems...   can be taken in a capsule as a much safer than antibiotic.

       Keto has been the biggest improvement to my life overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never felt better.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you absolutely need to follow the macronutrient profile of keto. If you get low carbs without the high fat content you will fail and feel really Terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that enjoy feeling better, looking better, and using your body to a higher potential. On keto I don't feel like movements are a labor Intensive task after a meal, I just float through movements without even realizing it. It's amazing.

       Yea well then you weren't counting your calories because I hate to break it to you but the laws of thermodynamics aren't different in your body than anyone else. And if you're really that afraid of carbohydrates I have some good news for you, science doesn't support carbs as being the enemy in almost every direction!

       It may also interest you to learn that dietary fat is what is stored as bodily fat, when a caloric excess is consumed. And that for dietary carbohydrates to be stored as fat (which requires conversion through the process called 'de novo lipogenesis' the carbohydrate portion of one's diet alone must approach or exceed one's TDEE.

       I say the biggest mistake people make who think keto isn't good, is stopping before they become keto adapted.  I got extremely low energy first couple weeks, most likely cause I had a high carb, low fat diet beforehand.  But after I got keto adapted holy shit I never felt better in my life.  Even when got blood tested and physical every year and my doctor now believes keto as something to recommend to others.

       there can be alternatives to super harmful antibiotics, for example women of childbearing age can often get bv for mysterious reasons, a Dr. will prescribe antibiotics but simply soaking in hot salt water twice daily for twenty minutes will cure it.

       No it's really not. The whole point of it is self improvement. After a while, your control over your sexual urges becomes so strong that even sex is not something that would influence your decision making process.

       I'm going to need a source on that. I'm pretty sure if you look at it from a logical standpoint, practicing anything makes you better at it. If you are constantly training your brain to avoid any and all sexual thoughts and urges, those neural pathways will mylenate over time and you will become better at it. If this statistic you are talking about it true, then I suspect it only happens because the people in question already happen to be addicted to porn. Of course feeding their addiction is going to suppress their withdrawal symptoms. I'll leave you with

       Ted Bundy blamed porn because the man interviewing him was a staunch anti-porn crusader. Nobody really knows his motivations, but he told quite a few lies in that interview to try to charm the interviewer. It could be that that was just his nature. Regardless, the raw truth of the matter is that he craved sexual violence because he was an abused and corrupted human being. Unfortunately for his victims the porn alone wasn't enough to quench his thirst, but for most people,

       Processed carbs. Fruits, beans, lentils, oats, honey, etc are just fine. I know Keto is all the craze right now but what most people don’t realize is the benefit they feel is going from a shit diet to a mostly raw, organic, whole food diet. That can also be done with carbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But processed carbs....my god. It’s insane how terrible one serving of that shit can make you feel. And even more insane is how I’ll still crave it knowing how terrible I’ll feel.

       Drink warm or hot water instead of cold, and avoid any sweetened and unsweetened beverages - they don't do anything for you. But don't drink hot water from the tap (or use it for cooking). The hot water system in our houses are gross. Heat it up for a half minute in a tea kettle.

       Take magnesium glycinate.  It's nature's Xanax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have a magnesium deficiency. Taking up to the max per day of 400mg of Magnesium Glycinate will make you feel incredibly refreshed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drastic effects wear off after about a month of using it because the body will be operating at a healthy level of magnesium, but that just means it's not straining to function. Overall your anxiety levels will be much reduced.

       Magnesium threonate is the strongest form of magnesium for sedative effects because it is most capable of crossing the blood brain barrier.  Glycine is a sedative for probably 90% of people but for some people who have high levels of glutamate in their brains, it is a stimulant.

       Water fasting is extremely good for your health, a lot of research out there. One obese man was able to to 382 days on just water and supplements (but he was obese and had a lot of fat to burn off, an average weight person can go up to a month without food). This will never be in the media because water fasting doesn't make any companies any money.

       Your body is conditioned to get hungry constantly. It's your hormones causing these hunger pangs, not true hunger. I find that hunger pangs come and go like a wave in the first 3 days. Once you get past 3 days, the hunger goes away and the cravings/boredom become the real battle. I get really really hungry, wait an hour or two, then the hunger goes away. You just have to get mentally through it and realize it's a hormonal response and you won't die if you don't eat this instance. Lots of water helps. Many people start with intermittent fasting 16-18 hours a day then eating all of their calories in a 6-8 eating window and get their bodies adjusted to not eating for a long period of time. I've been intermittent fasting for 2 years now and my hunger pangs start about 18-20 hours of not eating (I used to eat like every few hours)

       Generally speaking, start paying A LOT more attention to your diet. We already talk about water purity, but food somehow slips under the radar for a lot of people. Cancer, heart disease, and other organ failures are a toxicity issue; TOXICITY INPUT vs TOXICITY OUTPUT. Food is the biggest source of toxicity for most people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in the fruitarian camp -- I think (by lack of body hair) humans are obviously a tropical species, wherein raw fruit + some veggies and eggs should be the primary diet. Avoid meat, dairy, grains. This is arguably opposed to the keto camp, although anything's better than the standard processed crap. Switching to whole foods is an excellent first step for most people -- if you can't look at it and tell what it is... don't eat it! (I personally think keto is a psyop -- high-lipids are hard on the body, long-term.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My own approach is to base my diet on raw fruit + veggies + some eggs -- the ideal, I think -- but hedge that by the deviations of my more recent ancestors. For me, that's Germanic/Scandinavian, so I add fish, potatoes, stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gotten really into "food combining" the past few months. In essence, the digestion process for fruits is very different than the process for, say, starches or fats. So I end up having, say, two fruit days, then a starch day, then two fruit days, a meat/fish day... that sort of thing. This is as opposed to eating starches then fruits -- the starches take too long to digest and the fruits will ferment, giving you bad gas. (Note that you can clear out or "reset" from starches or fats by eating a bunch of raw veggies such as cabbage, broccoli, or carrots to kind of scrape the starches/fats off your intestinal walls.) But it's not the FRUIT that gives you gas, per se -- it's eating it at the wrong time, with the wrong other foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that protein intake is not a problem with this diet whatsoever. Gorillas, hyper-muscular fruit-eaters, are the obvious counter-example. And I see this in myself -- just 10-20 pushups/day has me well-muscled. The concerns about fruit causing tooth decay are 
unfounded too -- I don't see fruit-eating monkeys losing all their teeth. There's something very different about fruit-sugars and refined sugars I've yet to nail down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then use light exercise to increase the toxicity processing and OUTPUT. Think of your skin as a huge kidney. When you move and sweat, you're outputting lots of toxins -- so take a shower right after so they don't reabsorb! But if you exercise too hard, like cross-fit or whatever, you're generating more interstitial acid and actually hurting yourself. Something like hot yoga is ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can use your body odor as a gauge. If your toxicity level is low, you will have no B.O. and no need for deodorant. Ya really; your pits won't stink. (Coffee makes B.O. as well, FYI -- but if you drink coffee
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       you sweat, you're good.) So if you want to go hard-core, stop using deodorant and use B.O. or lack thereof to keep your diet straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond all that, keep in mind that your skin absorbs toxicity too. So try to switch to natural everything for skin care (coconut oil) , hair care, deodorant (cheap vinegar works great), etc. Try to wear natural fabrics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and turn off wifi when you sleep. I started sleeping way better and dreaming much more when I did this.

       Because sex is a real connection between two people. It is a reward for being a loving partner. Masturbation is an instant, easy spike of dopamine, not very far from a drug. Not to mention that porn is basically the definition of objectification of women, among a list of other issues.

Just match the mg to your needs. There is usually no need to pay what passes for a doctor, these days, $200 for information you already know.

       For Medicinal Herbs... Spagyrics!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it goes without saying that the plant kingdom is our medicine chest (or poison). Every culture on earth has a tradition of using plants to keep us healthy and alive. 
But how do we prepare them so that we can actually take into our bodies all of the beneficial compounds? The human digestive system is not always up to the task of breaking down plant fibers. All of these compounds are essentially locked up within the body of the plant. How can we release them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people would make a tea out of the herb. The problem with this is that many of the compounds within plants (i.e. essential oils) are not water soluble. So, no matter how long you let it steep, only water soluble compounds will dissolve into the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next best thing is to make a tincture. This is the same thing as making tea, except a solution of ethanol (grape alcohol) and water is used. The alcohol has an affinity for all the compounds hidden inside the plant material and pulls it out. Then it's strained to get rid of the plant material and you now have a tincture containing all the compounds that had been locked up in the plant. Many people think this is the most potent form of herbal medicine, however there is more...
      </p>
      <p>
       The mineral salts! Instead of throwing out the plant material it's incinerated to white ash, washed with distilled water, filtered then the water evaporated away. 
Pure, white crystals form. The are the water soluble mineral salts the of plant. They are purified by repeating the process. Each time, the salt becomes whiter. A pound of plant material produces about a teaspoon of salts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So. Because the salts are
       <em>
        alkaline
       </em>
       .
       <strong>
        When the mineral salts of the plant are added back into the tincture it raises the PH level converting the oily compounds into water soluble compounds that the body can easily absorb
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I tested this once by evaporating a teaspoon of cannabis tincture alongside a teaspoon of the cannabis Spagyric (after the salts have been added) on a plate.  When they were dry I added distilled water.  The Spagyric immediately washed away into the water while the goo left by the tincture would not wash away no matter how long it stood.
      </p>
      <p>
       So adding back the mineral salts is the missing key. It truly makes the extraction complete. The result is called a "Spagyric" (Greek.  meaning to take apart and put back together). This process was written down by the famous Paracelsus in the 16th century but somehow we forgot all about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first learned about this method when I began my study in Alchemy. There is more. Much, more.

       Black walnut is great at ridding the body of parasites (If I remember correctly) so that would be awesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find detailed instructions online about how to extract the mineral salts by searching for "calcination plant alchemy" but if you have any questions please ask away.

       I am primarily interested in spreading this information to herbalists who may not be aware of Spagyrics.  Most people are not.  I'm happy you are interested.  I think we need to get back to plant based medicine and Spagyrics really are the best thing available (to the non alchemist anyway).

       It's not what you're doing that makes one unhealthy, it's what you aren't doing overall. The people saying avoid meat, dairy, and sugar like the plague because it's the cause of everyone's problems knows very very little on this subject. The studies have been done. One can watch all the youtube videos or podcasts they want, it doesn't make something fact. Someone is always lacking something else which is the real root cause of their problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow the 80/20 rule. For everything in life. That means eat 80&amp;#37; healthy. Yes 20&amp;#37; of it can come from 400 calories of cake per day given you're eating other foods your body needs, and getting some physical activity, along with some mental exercise such as meditation or reading. Those people with mass amounts of health problems, guess what, they are following their own 20/80 rule instead. Get enough complete protein, and good source of fats, fiber, water, and the rest is negligible when following 80/20. If you feel guilty after eating a cookie and feel like you ruined your diet, you have an eating disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously if you can't live your like enjoying the little things such as icecream, cake, whatever, then life is really not worth living. Unless of course you hate these types of foods. Exercise daily, eat/drink sufficiently, meditate, eat some nutella, guess what? You're healthier already than 90&amp;#37; of earths population and you can live to 60 before getting hit by a truck.

       Get sunshine! It converts cholesterol into vitamin D. All the media is distributed on screens indoors, so obviously they aren't going to tell us to go in the sun. They tell us it's harmful because they want us sitting indoors to be subjected to more advertising. A nice tan feels amazing. I don't care what the science says.

       In any case, I'll bite. I've learned one of the best foods for decalcifying pineal gland is beets. It's a remarkable food that I try to drink because I don't like eating it raw or cooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in Seattle an I've eaten a lot of foods from many different countries and cultures. The only country that seems to be passionate about beets is Russia. I visit my local Russian market and I have no problems finding a selection of beets or beet related product. During winter time I like to have borscht which is a Russian beet soup. I also find that after drinking beet juice it seems to assist in my Clash Royale play.

       Iodine and magnesium supplements work wonders. Your body is a super sophisticated machine. Giving it what it needs is paramount. There was a time when every bakery used iodine to sanitize and we got enough. Now they iodize salt and you cant get enough without the negatives. Thats a conspiracy unto itself. Distilled water too. Your body is a closed system, what kind of water does any other closed system require, distilled.

       Edible thc oil applied topically vastly reduces pain, inflammation and relaxes muscles and tendons. Alleviates arthritis symptoms and can get rid of migraines.

       And you don’t get high from topical thc.

       FOOD combinations. EX: Do not mix dairy with say bananas. Think of the different rates of absorption and time it takes to completely digest one thing. A better way is that eat the fruit first wait 20-30mins then consume the dairy. Hopefully this helps.

       Yes, fats slow the absorption of other macros and micros that are eaten around the same time. A lot of interesting things happen like that with minerals, blocking one an other.

       Low carb brings you to ketosis, where you use a more sustainable, available, and efficient source for energy, and that's fat. Not to mention there are plenty of keto styles that implement heavy carb usage for athletic purposes. Please go to

       I like the travel size roller, same girth (heh), but about a third the length.
      </p>
      <p>
       I start by sitting on it and rolling around on my gluteus. If this part is unusually tight, I use a lacrosse ball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next I roll the entire length of the spine, paying most attentiontp the low back. You can feel and hear your spine cracking and smoothing out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I roll out my legs. Every large muscle group, and IT bands. There are YouTube videos that describe exactly how to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s important to remember, the first few times can be excruciatingly painful. That’s normal, but eventually you’ll be able to do this with almost no pain.

       Because sex is a real connection between two people. It is a reward for being a loving partner. Masturbation is an instant, easy spike of dopamine, not very far from a drug. Not to mention that porn is basically the definition of objectification of women, among a list of other issues.

       I'll finish that sentence.  maybe look at what a keto diet
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        is used for

       Don't make it a sandwich. Don't put salt on the meat. It's basically an "anti-white diet"
      </p>
      <p>
       Your body eventually decides "oh shit I need a new source of energy." It then starts going off of fat instead of glucose. Burns fat. Excess glucose doesn't get converted to fat. There is a power band where this is effective. There is also one where it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: this is pretty useful. Doesn't matter if it doesn't work for you.

       You misunderstood the concept of sin. It is not a sin to kill an animal for nutrition, it is a sin to make it suffer by incompetence. Letting a professional do the killing with dedicated tools is the most reasonable decision. A bolt to the brain is better than a clever to the neck.

       I also stand by what I said about happy cows. I live in a region where cows spend about half the year roaming freely in the mountains, and the rest of the year on the meadows except for 3 months in Winter, where they roam as freely as possible in roaming stables.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are worse conditions around here too, but not significantly. But then, I don't have to buy from those places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another thought, meant in good spirit. How many cows do you think would be left to roam the alps (or the world for that matter) if we stopped eating them? Unless we collectively start calling them holy, like the Hindus do, we'd have to limit their numbers another way by hunting them like we hunt deer and invasive species, lest we want all our crops eaten by roaming hoards of wild cows.

       You lose 40lbs by being in a caloric deficit. Eliminating carbs most likely just helped you greatly.

       Not sure about the NWO bit, but veganism absolutely is a ploy to make people unhealthy. Our ancestors ate meat-based diets, sometimes supplemented by mostly fermented/soaked/sprouted plants (as opposed to fresh, unprocessed), and they were healthier than any of us could ever dream to be.

       It's not. This nofap nonsense is meant to push people into risky casual sex instead of satisfying their urges in safer, healthier ways.

       Barely any women watch porn, and those women are a product of recent media heavily encouraging it. If you ask the vast majority of women, their honest opinion will be that porn disgusts them.
