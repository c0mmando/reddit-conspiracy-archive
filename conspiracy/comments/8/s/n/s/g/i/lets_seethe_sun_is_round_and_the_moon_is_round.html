       Lete help you out here bud. Or rather others who happen upon this bullhorn.  It's a dinner shut slinging fest with this flat earth bullshit. The earth areany (not all)  other heavily bodies are multidimensional obloidal tesseracts. I had to make that shot up as I couldn't find better verbiage. Without dosing you massive amounts of hallucinogens and forcing through an intense crash course in physics I'll have to simplify this greatly and pray that it makes sense. Since this rock we are on is multidimensional it stands to reason that it exists in multiple dimensions. Duh. One of those dimensions will present one or more flat earths. As well as concave and convex earths. Round ones. Donut ones. Hollow ones. Wet ones, dry ones. In the end the heaviest vibrations will coeless into reality as YOU know it. Personally my earth is a living thing that's currently throwing a tantrum and shutting diamonds.

       Oh shit! You're onto it man. I've been seeing a lot of data about DNA being comprised of proteins ordered into spirals withing spirals (hence the subsequent double helix/quadra helix) which are arranged by way of a vibration occurring within the coding cell. These vibrations are ordered in such a way that that wave form stacks on itself.  It looks like a wave within a wave. Within a wave. It goes through this funnel mechanism. Beyond that I couldn't understand the doctorate babble about the names of the proteins and other chemicals or the mathematics involved. HOLY SHIT THE math! I digress; the dude mentioned that it was all organized by the Fibonacci sequence. From there I was able to deduce that the parts of things can be manifested in such a way that one would need to find a requisite frequency then "charge" or "program" said vibration in such a way that it stacks into a 3 dimensional reality. This is of course extremely basic. There are evidently a multitude of dimensions so working in the confines of only three of them seems almost pointless. Wow I'm high.

       Dark? I mean, it's no wonder we have a similar rotational timing with the moon. We're both spun from the same yawning yarn. More to the outer space, why do all the photos of the other planets in our solar system show the same pancake at the same angle? Is the only way to frame a pancake from 1 and always the same angle? Absolutely not.

       If you believe that the earth is flat, keep that to yourself unless you want people to believe you're dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the fact people are so gullible is scary. If someone can literally make them think the round earth is flat, what other nonsense can they get them to believe.

       Your statement is based on the jesuit-scientific presumption that the sun and moon and earth are all in the same 'category' of object. Take that presumption/prejudice/brainwashing away and you'll realise that what you're comparing are apples and oranges. There is no reason why the sun and the moon being spherical would have any significance for the shape of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the earth is in fact flat. And verifiably so. There can really be no argument about this anymore, the information is out there and it is conclusive.

       I've recently learned that it was Jesuits who brought modern cosmology (bullshit) to china. Not freemasons. Therefore I think that when it comes to the spacehoax, Jesuits is actually the more accurate culprit group.

       The verifiable, undeniable, conclusive proof/evidence is always “out there” somewhere in these discussions but never right here. I wonder why that is?

       Because there's a whole bunch of misinformation, disinformation and laughable bullshit out there too. But if you care to research this subject, eventually you'll start piecing together the conclusive info and you'll start spotting what's bullshit. It's a complex model, there's no way I could type it down here in a manner that would do it justice or satisfy you.

       Although if you're still walking in baby shoes through conspiracytown, start with moon landing material and research the influence of freemasonry on Nasa and the relationship between MIC, Nasa, Hollywood and Kubrick. I can point you out in the right direction here as well but I cannot spoon feed you bulletpoints (I'm not smart enough anyway).

       Yes, obviously. The moon and the sun can be observed to wander across our sky. They are similar in visual size and trajectory. Every single day of your life you've been able to watch them circle the sky. Can you say any of that for earth? No, of course not. The fact that you see rhinos and crocodiles outside, which are arguably in the same 'category' doesn't mean you live on a turtle. But you seem to believe so, which I think is incredibly stupid.

       No, you sound like a moron. You have no idea what the sun and the moon are made of. You can put it into google and get what mainstream science proposes but you'll still have no idea. I outlined several very primary attributes which clearly put the sun and the moon in the same category, relative to earth and while taking into consideration our position here on earth. Low iq people like you struggle with basic concepts like this and it's incredibly irritating to have to explain the simplest issues to them. Over and over I take the time to lay them out clearly and concisely only for my efforts to go to waste because said low iq person is nowhere near intellectually capable to understand the matter.

       We're sitting inside the SUV. You claim our SUV is spherical because the baseball and tennisball are spherical and your jesuit-judeo-masonic-approved textbook says so. I tell you that's nonsense, and claim that the we can put the tennisball and the baseball in the same category because visually they appear the same size, are both visually circular and behave comparably (both are lying there infront of us). These are all observations we require no authority for, we can all confirm them ourselves. And none of these observations are applicable to the SUV. Are you starting to get it? I'm so tired of arguing with idiots online please just fuck off if you're struggling with this.

       This would actually solve a few conspiracies: hollow earth, aliens in Antarctica,  flat earth, what ever Byrd flew over the north pole.  Someone start a $50k kickstarter to fly straight over both poles.

       Watching the commercial for Uncle Drew as I read your post, heh. I wish he wouldn't have redacted his sentiments in this subject. He got that biggest backlash possible for just entertaining the idea that maybe the earth is not what we have been told... Come to L.A., baby!

       Well when I watched this video of him on Kimmel, it sounded like he said he had been trying to take it back but it just won't go away. He kind of acquiesces to peer pressure and shyly tries to take it back but after watching more videos, I think he does really have an pen mind to that idea and others, which is really wonderful to see in the entertainment arena.

       Without reading the comments i'm gonna guess they say the Earth is a round disc with a dome over it. Domes are round. Or, that the sun and moon just aren't real, because space isn't real. Because wtf Copernicus LIED. Or something.

       Bruh.. I've got one word for 'flat earthers'. Its called accretion. Are you telling me that particles of matter form conglomerates in a flat circle shape spinning in the middle of space. Just stop already. Hollow Earth.. maybe. I'm open to that. Antarctica Pyramids.. probably Nazi bases there.. ok with that.. But Flat Earthers make me want to vomit my brain out my mouth. The level of stupidity it takes to believe flat earth is the only thing utterly mind-blowing about the whole hypothesis.

       Well, firstly your statement is quite rhetorical. Yes we see a ROUND sun and moon, not spherical like we are told they are, quite frankly if you weren't told we live on a sphere you would undoubtedly KNOW we are living on a flat stationary something.... It could still be ROUND when we have a proper view that we will never be shown. Anywhoo, I believe my eyes way before I believe Nasa. I work with microwave transmission dishes that need line of sight to be capable of performing at peak efficiency. Check out the new record for longest ptp shot, it's over 300km. This is absolutely not possible on a globe earth, whether it's pear shaped, perfectly round or whether "atmospheric refraction" take precedent with these frequencies. These radios need line of sight, even with the 1700m height you'll still have curvature of over 1900m, this is straight Nasa data and its flawed... But these frequencies cannot shoot THROUGH any water or land mass. You put your tiny pecker in front of this dish and she ain't gonna work, so sorry bud, no curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just fathom the idea that you are wrong for two hours, put your ego in the locker and all the "science" bs you have memorized just like I do, you will come out with an overwhelming feeling of distrust for your beloved Nasa.
