       It all depends on if you ever incarnated as an original native American. Only then do you have rightful claim. But outs of souls that are in native bodies it's their first time as a native so they don't have rightful ownership

       That’s luck of the draw not a way to identify as NA or culturally. (Aside from the fact that we have now have examples of 24k year old NA ancestors with 1/3 Western Europe dna pre migration to N.A.) The western tribes did not see major expansion until 300-400 years after the east had been fighting/assimilating with everything that came over before then. Why it’s a farce to look at the Cherokee, who were able to blend into early economic society as a people’s and are more assimilated gene wise by product of that and trade relationships. They are still Cherokee and are still a people’s with language and culture. Addressing them by a white mans definition (blood quantum) has no bearing on that except for ignorance to the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are one of the only peoples on the planet that judge ourselves by a percentage from a definition created and instilled by white men as identity. You don’t ask your black friends how much black are you, when you gavel about them or their culture? There are no 100% tribal members, it’s not possible. It’s a sham to end culture. If we were all still 100% x by the definition, we would be inbred beyond function. 100%rs were given to
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       members on the rolls at inception, from fathers tribe only no matter what. Tribes didn’t generally intermarry even going back in the “stone ages.” So by the definition given you can not be 100% that has no bearing on being a legit member of a tribe. A
       <em>
        full blooded
       </em>
       grandfather can have a /64th offspring. So if you use that white mans logic to define yourself or your people’s. You surrender to the extinction of your people’s. Cause when those few hundred years of expansion catch up in the next few generations, all your people’s will be fractions. Not considered Native American, by the definition instilled upon them by colonialism.

       Blood degree is a bullshit talking point for the most part. Tribes didn’t intermarry going thousands of years back. A people’s are defined by culture and language. Blood decorum is a colonial idea to eradicate culture. Hence camps, reservations, or territories and assimilation tactics worldwide.

       By killing language and assimilating, you kill the ability to pass culture.

       From the Olmec all the way to the infant,  as far as I have researched no less than 7 "native American" claim to have to come from "a land of white" further to the south. It's highly likely that other than than the mullungens in middle and southern USA there were never any native peoples here. Welcome to the new world.

       I can read Olmec. I absolutely will not tell you how I figured it out. I will however give the hint that it's based on another language MANY scholars have had trouble with. Look into the manuscripts of the past. You're bound to stumble upon it too if you're diligent.

       The only thing the really makes an American is the US Constitution anyway, at lest when it comes to the United States. The migrants are of Spanish decent who also have no claim to the land just like the whites.

       Hey again.  Not stalking.  But remember the Constitution does not mention immigration powers only naturalization ones.  They are not equal terms and the letters of Jefferson state that the right to relocate is a personal right or as they liked to say a "natural law".

       While it does not mention immigration power but like we talked about before its the 14th Amendment. With its first sentence of section 1,clause 1, reads  as follows:  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. This is called the Citizenship Clause. This in fact is how Congress has the power to enact the United States nationality law or otherwise known as Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the last major change to that was done in 2001 just to summarize. 
Yes you are totally right, that is all we have in the US Constitution, is the Birthright pathway, everything else is listed under the Immigration and Nationality Act.

       This is why there was never anything about naturalization and immigration originally in the US Constitution and look where its gotten us.  Dont your think it would better just to have an Amendment that lays out a Path for Citizenship.
