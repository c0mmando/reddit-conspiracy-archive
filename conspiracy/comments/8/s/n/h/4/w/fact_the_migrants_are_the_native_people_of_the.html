    <div class="md"><p>That’s luck of the draw not a way to identify as NA or culturally. (Aside from the fact that we have now have examples of 24k year old NA ancestors with 1/3 Western Europe dna pre migration to N.A.) The western tribes did not see major expansion until 300-400 years after the east had been fighting/assimilating with everything that came over before then. Why it’s a farce to look at the Cherokee, who were able to blend into early economic society as a people’s and are more assimilated gene wise by product of that and trade relationships. They are still Cherokee and are still a people’s with language and culture. Addressing them by a white mans definition (blood quantum) has no bearing on that except for ignorance to the facts. </p>

<p>We are one of the only peoples on the planet that judge ourselves by a percentage from a definition created and instilled by white men as identity. You don’t ask your black friends how much black are you, when you gavel about them or their culture? There are no 100% tribal members, it’s not possible. It’s a sham to end culture. If we were all still 100% x by the definition, we would be inbred beyond function. 100%rs were given to <em>all</em> members on the rolls at inception, from fathers tribe only no matter what. Tribes didn’t generally intermarry even going back in the “stone ages.” So by the definition given you can not be 100% that has no bearing on being a legit member of a tribe. A <em>full blooded</em> grandfather can have a /64th offspring. So if you use that white mans logic to define yourself or your people’s. You surrender to the extinction of your people’s. Cause when those few hundred years of expansion catch up in the next few generations, all your people’s will be fractions. Not considered Native American, by the definition instilled upon them by colonialism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it does not mention immigration power but like we talked about before its the 14th Amendment. With its first sentence of section 1,clause 1, reads  as follows:  All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. This is called the Citizenship Clause. This in fact is how Congress has the power to enact the United States nationality law or otherwise known as Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the last major change to that was done in 2001 just to summarize. 
Yes you are totally right, that is all we have in the US Constitution, is the Birthright pathway, everything else is listed under the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>
