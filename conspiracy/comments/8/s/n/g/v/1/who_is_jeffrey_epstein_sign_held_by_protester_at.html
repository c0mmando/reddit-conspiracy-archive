<p>Apparently not Trump, since he thought Epstein was a great guy despite knowing his preference for women on the &quot;younger side&quot;.</p>

<p>Plus, there are rumors about an incident at Mar-a-Lago in 1999, which made some people claim Trump kicked Epstein out of there, yet we have a photo of Epstein at a Mar-a-Lago party in 2000.  He probably just waited for the heat to die down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure...and now that he&#39;s president. Do you think his preferences have changed?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s have a look at some of his quotes over the years: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You know, it doesn‚Äôt really matter what [the media] write as long as you‚Äôve got a young and beautiful piece of ass,‚Äù </p>

<p>‚ÄúCause I like kids, I mean, I won‚Äôt do anything to take care of them. I‚Äôll supply funds and she‚Äôll take care of the kids. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna be walking the kids down Central Park.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>On Sexual Assaults of Women in the Military</em></p>

<p>‚ÄúWhat did these geniuses expect when they put men &amp; women together?‚Äù </p>

<p>Yeah, that‚Äôs her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I‚Äôm automatically attracted to beautiful ‚Äî I just start kissing them. It‚Äôs like a magnet. Just kiss. I don‚Äôt even wait. And when you‚Äôre a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab ‚Äôem by the pussy. You can do anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you can go get fucked if you think that now he&#39;s president all of this part of his character disappeared. He just threw candy at the chancellor of Germany. </p>

<p>If he&#39;s friends with Epstein and they&#39;ve traveled together, I can connect the dots. Especially with his views on women. </p>

<p>His own wife can&#39;t fucking stand him. </p>

<p>You belong to a cult, plain and simple.</p>

<p>If it was Obama you&#39;d be tearing his head off. </p>

<p>But.....it&#39;s Trump and he can do no wrong.</p>

<p>So answer me this, after all I&#39;ve presented, much of which you&#39;ve agreed with, you think having a President who doesn&#39;t respect woman and has had multiple allegations of rape brought up against him is OK just because it was.....more than 2 years ago????</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no evidence that trump ever went to Epsteins Island, please show me anything?</p>

<p>the only proof of Trump on epsteins plane is testimony from Epsteins brother about a flight from florida to NY.  There is no other evidence of trump on the island or on his plane.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You - makes a claim - &quot;You know Trump went on Epsteins plane multiple time, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Me - please show me evidence of multiple trips. I looked and only found one reference to Trump on an Epstein plane, made by Epsteins brother. But, there is no record of trump on any of Epsteins flight logs, while President Clinton is clearly listed several times.  The evidence seems to point to there being no record of Trump ever on an Epstien plane,   </p>

<p>You - Mock, impugn character, false association.  but no response to my Question, shpw me the evidence to back your initial claim...... crickets.</p>

<p>And i never said anything to you about &quot;crazy left&quot;, but if you have any questions about my reasoning or proof  for anything  I have posted ,please ask away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I&#39;m not convinced on Trump either way, but that case stinks to high heaven. It came from an anonymous person , with an identity that nobody ever could verify, never showed up to court or police, address was fake, and after the election it just dropped. Not to mention that the origin of the story was an extremely biased borderline fake nes website, with no verification by any even mildly reputable publishers makes the whole thing very suspect. </p>

<p>Trump knew Epstein, and just because he wasn&#39;t in the flight logs doesn&#39;t make him innocent at ALL, because at best he heard or knew something and kept his mouth shut. So he could be a monster just like E, but this case in particular just doesn&#39;t hold up.</p>

<p>Some sources (Snopes, because they don&#39;t have a pro-trump bias)/
This one was last updated 4 nov 2016</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/">https://www.snopes.com/news/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In late April 2016, rumors began to circulate online holding that Republican presidential Donald Trump had either been sued over, or arrested for, raping a teenaged girl. One of the earliest versions of the rumor was published on 2 May 2016 by the Winning Democrats web site, which reported that woman using the name Katie Johnson had named Trump and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in a $100 million lawsuit, accusing them of having solicited sex acts from her at sex parties held at the Manhattan homes of Epstein and Trump back in 1994 (when Johnson was just 13 years old)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>origin of the reporting: winningdemocrats.com</p>

<p><a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/winning-democrats/">https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/winning-democrats/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notes: Winning Democrats is an over the top extreme left wing website.  Demonstrates severe bias in wording and story choices.  Has a very poor record of factual reporting. Winning Democrats produces left wing propaganda. (11/18/2016)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>from the Snopes article again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to RadarOnline‚Äôs initial reporting, the lawsuit filed in California on 26 April 2016 was dismissed over technical filing errors (the address listed in court documents was a foreclosed home that has been vacant since its owner died), with the plaintiff failing in her attempt to avoid incurring the cost of the litigation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the suit was dropped because she listed a vacant lot as an adress and a phonenumber that went straight to voicemail.</p>

<p>Conclusion on the matter from this Snopes article from Okt 2016, updated Dec 2017:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/are-we-not-going-to-talk-about-trump/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/are-we-not-going-to-talk-about-trump/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>s our article on the lawsuit notes, ‚ÄúKatie Johnson‚Äù alone is the source for all claims contained in the lawsuit, she has not been identified or interviewed, and she has not provided any information or evidence outside of her court filing. Donald Trump hasn‚Äôt been afforded any opportunity to confront his accuser or the evidence against him in court, and the case may never get that far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah, Trump may be a satanic pedophilic POS still, but this case is  dead end and is easily debunked imo.</p>

<p>Both original articles are gone, and nothing has happened with this case since 2016, with no articles appearing on google from a later date or anything new besides peope mentioning it in opinion articles from MotherJones or HuffPo, every time with the caveat that KJ is still unidentified and there is no evidence whatsoever besides an anonymous report from a fake identity/alias.</p>

<p>Of course I did only google for a second so maybe I missed something, open to new info.</p>

<p>Trump flew once, BC flew 26 times on Lolita Express.</p>

<p>Trump banned Epstein from his hotel, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2906981/Bill-Clinton-pictured-Jeffrey-Epstein-s-social-fixer-Chelsea-s-wedding.html">Epstein&#39;s madam has a front row seat at Chelsea&#39;s wedding.</a></p>

<p>Anyone wants to go after Trump for his Epstein connections, that&#39;s fine.  But were the same people currently going after Trump as worried about an Epstein pal getting the Dem nom in &#39;16?  And, overwhelmingly, the people pointing fingers at Trump were crapping on both pizzagate and the larger pedogate.</p>

<p>This sht is so obviously political. DAE constantly find themselves defending DJT just out of a sense of basic fairness?  I&#39;ll never vote for the guy, but...  The constant slander and hyperbole against Obama &amp; Bill by AM radio isn&#39;t OK now that its an R in the Oval.</p>

<p>Apparently not Trump, since he thought Epstein was a great guy despite knowing his preference for women on the &quot;younger side&quot;.</p>

<p>Plus, there are rumors about an incident at Mar-a-Lago in 1999, which made some people claim Trump kicked Epstein out of there, yet we have a photo of Epstein at a Mar-a-Lago party in 2000.  He probably just waited for the heat to die down.</p>
