    <div class="md"><p>Its not about making money for the government, it&#39;s about making money for the private institutions who will &quot;fight&quot; illegal immigration. How they are connected to Trump, and how they are repaying him is yet to be known. But He has a large amount of channels trough which funds could be funneled to Trump legally.</p>

<p>On average, we spend $168K a year per inmate inside prisons.
We don&#39;t have the numbers for these private institutions detaining illegal immigrants but they will also be high.</p>

<p>Much of the gear and tools used by border patrol, ICE, etc... Comes from the same manufacturers and distributors that serve the military complex. They have a lot of influence.</p>

The county doesn&#39;t have money to build another one so they&#39;re stretching what they have, and a substantial part of the population is illegal immigrants (this county is the little Mexico of Atlanta)</p>

<p>In 2016 there were 211,133 illegal immigrants who had committed at least one felony or two misdemeanors and spent at least four consecutive days in prison.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=86">https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=86</a></p>

<p>I haven&#39;t yet found the amount who are in all correctional institutions. Considering of all American citizens only 5.1% will spend a night in jail but in 2016 1.7% of illegal immigrants did it&#39;s obvious they spend a disproportionately higher amount of time jailed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Legal immigrants commit few crimes and with good reason. They&#39;ve already shown a predilection for wishing to follow the law even when it&#39;s potentially easier to disregard it and the results come more quickly. Once they&#39;re here legally committing a crime and having that revoked only to have all their work and time wasted is also a huge incentive to not commit crimes. </p>

<p>Illegal immigrants on the other hand do commit more crimes, despite what the media keeps reporting. SCAAP numbers for some years show as many as 290,000 unique prisoners in a year. In 2016 there were 211,133 unique SCAAP reimbursements. In order to qualify the person in custody had to have committed either one felony or two misdemeanors and been jailed for four consecutive days. References here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=86">https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=86</a></p>

<p>Other studies show that the illegal immigrants who do commit crimes have an exorbitant rate of reoffending. In one study of 251,000 illegal immigrants who committed a crime they accounted for 1,700,000 arrests and 3,000,000 offenses.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/320/316959.pdf">http://www.gao.gov/assets/320/316959.pdf</a></p>

<p>The serious crimes they commit are also done at a rate higher than legal residents, citizen or not. They were found to be 45% more likely to be gang members. Illegal immigrants from 15 to 35 are 2% of the population in Arizona but were 8% of the prison population.

<p>OP is basically saying it will be allowed to go on because it&#39;s profitable for the enforcement agencies and the prisons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. This also makes me consider a &quot;foot in the door&quot; scenario where all of these private military contractors and concentration camps ramping up for the &quot;war on immigrants&quot; can easily be repurposed for whomever this administration decides to demonize next. You already see the bootlickers specifically using language meant to dehumanize immigrants as a means of justifying, you guessed it, inhuman and inhumane actions. Soon that same rhetoric and dehumanization that is working so easily on the simple minded will be turned against the next group of boogeymen, which will be comprised of our friends and neighbors instead of immigrants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh this problem can be solved, in a number of ways. The conspiracy was that republicans (and Californians) wanted their slave labor underclass and democrats wanted them to pump out voters that consistently vote left. Trump is the first person to come along in decades and actually do something about <em>because</em> he isn’t tied up with interests that benefit it. He’s been desperately trying to find his wall and since that IS a permanent solution that can’t be voted away in the future the democrats are freaking out.</p>

<p>Trump is not congress. He doesn&#39;t have authority to fund his own wall. Maybe you&#39;re new to this but that&#39;s not how this works.</p>

<p>Perhaps he should weaponize the IRS and the Intelligence Community like Obama did? Then he could make these <em>two</em> things happen for you...</p>

<p>I thought one of his big selling points was that he&#39;s such a successful billionaire that he didn&#39;t even need the Presidental salary. He could just gather a few of his rich friends and pay for the wall himself. Because it&#39;s pretty obvious that Mexico isn&#39;t going to.</p>

<p>Do you really believe that? Nobody says it will cut illegal crossing to <em>zero</em>. It will cut it down substantially. It will make crossing much much more difficult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy gets it. So nice to see some clear-eyed thinking on this sub and not more QAnon folklore. Gen. Butler saw that war was a racket and that has pretty much continued unabated as such. People are starting to wake up to the other rackets and that gives me some hope. Poverty will continue to be a racket until both parties stop taking money from pay-day lenders and Walmart. Debt, both student and credit card, is another. Opioids. Processed food. Drug laws targeted to minorities and the poor. We’re starting to wake up and when the top 1% finds another racket to slide its efforts into, we need to see it coming. Immigration is potentially a perfect system to exploit. It runs on a visceral hatred of an “other”, the likes of which is no longer widely acceptable with established minorities. It requires the capture, storage, and processing of potentially millions of people. When the State expounds on the cost of this system the people will not object to a little private sector participation.</p>
