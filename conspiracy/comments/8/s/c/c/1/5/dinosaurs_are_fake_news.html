        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve been catching a lot of flak ever since spreading the truth that dinosaurs are 100% fiction and made up. For all those who are not disinfo agents trying to hide an enormous lie, I invite you to do some simple googling. Google and record every renowned dinosaur discovery noting the location where they were found. I am willing to bet you that at least 85% of them were found on government land. The remaining 15% either on private property belonging to someone tied to this conspiracy. </p>

<p>Now to be clear, I’m not saying I am certain that they don’t exist, I’m saying that what the media and education system (also establishment) claims to be proof is 100% fabricated. It’s like a big lie and they keep it going by every once in a while making a new discovery. Also never do normal citizens discover them, it’s always some renowned, well regarded and always talked about in a positive light scientist (establishment). </p>

<p>As with any major conspiracy, it’s tough to find good evidence to refute as it is instantly shut down. But if you google search the locations they are found and search the diggers history you will see what I’m saying. <a href="https://www.doi.gov/interiormuseum/videos/discoveringdinosaurs">Here is a US Department of Interior article about how 8!! Dinosaurs discoveries were made in Utah on government owned Land in 2018 alone.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control of your mind.  If one believes in dinosaurs and a spinning ball in a place called outer space then one can logically conclude that everything is random and there is no God.  If one instead knows that dinosaurs are fake and the earth is flat, fixed and &quot;outer space&quot; is a complete hoax then it becomes very clear we are created and in some kind of terrarium.  One can no longer logically be an atheist or an agnostic.  It also cuts out everything to do with aliens (seeding).</p>

<p>So if there is a God, why would this kind of worldwide conspiracy exist?  All you need to do is actually read the King James Bible for yourself to find out.  All the answers are there.  The great deceiver (Lucifer) who has been given control of this realm wants  you to die without ever knowing the truth of what you are and what you need.</p>

<p>Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading the KJV as authoritative is a non starter for me, sorry. Also, it’s ironic that you’re using god as a basis for an argument against mind control, when the church is the biggest mind control bodies on the planet. If we believe we were created and are in a terrarium, then we should expect to have to follow church commandments. But for some reason that’s acceptable while free will is not?  The same arguments you make can be flipped and, I posit, made even stronger in a case against flat earth etc. </p>

<p>However I also recognize this is a debate that neither of us will likely budge in, so I’ll politely acknowledge your position and move on. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>You are confused because you have never read the KJV for yourself.  There is no place called &quot;church&quot; that people are suppose to go to.  That&#39;s just another lie.</p>

<p>You asked why they would lie about Dinos and The shape of the Earth and outer space.  The answer is to discredit the Bible and hide God from people.  It&#39;s very simple.  Your notions about the KJV prove this point because you believe in dinosaurs, a spinning ball in outer space etc.  If you knew those were all lies the KJV would not be a &quot;non starter&quot; for you.  Your entire reality is based on these fundamental lies.  Lucifer is heading to an eternal lake of fire and he wants to drag as many (could have been) God&#39;s children with him as possible.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs don&#39;t <em>cost</em> money, they <em>make</em> money, and that is the point of any fraud. Funding for universities, fame and fortune for archaeologists and authors, museum ticket sales, movies, endless dinosaur games and merchandise on and on all relying on the original premise that they ever existed in the first place and weren&#39;t just science fiction. As usual, it takes very few insiders. The rest are useful idiots or victims of the fraud.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not brigading when you’re trolling!  There’s no way that you can rationally believe this. Here’s one easy way to “disprove” your theory:</p>

<p>The reason that governments or famous archeologists find these is pretty simple—it costs a lot of money to dig those out of the ground in a way that you won’t deteriorate them. If you break all the bones and can’t put it back together, you aren’t making any research or money off it. When homeowners or excavators realize they’ve stumbled upon these, they call in the professionals.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found no end of fossils over the years, and not on government land. If i was to go and sift through the gravel in my garden I could find fossils.</p>

<p>Most have heard dragons = Dino bones but there’s quite a cool theory that Cyclops were thought to be real because of giant mammoth skulls found by Greeks. When the trunk decays, it leaves a huge central cavity in the skull - the big mono eye of a cyclops,</p>

<p>Dinosaur bones have been discovered for ages before 1800. They were called dragon bones, cyclopes etc. </p>

<p>By that logic, infectious diseases didn&#39;t exist until the Germ Theory was proposed. </p>

<p>Dinosaurs don&#39;t <em>cost</em> money, they <em>make</em> money, and that is the point of any fraud. Funding for universities, fame and fortune for archaeologists and authors, museum ticket sales, movies, endless dinosaur games and merchandise on and on all relying on the original premise that they ever existed in the first place and weren&#39;t just science fiction. As usual, it takes very few insiders. The rest are useful idiots or victims of the fraud.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of archeologists in America alone and not one has ever seen a fossilized bone? </p>
