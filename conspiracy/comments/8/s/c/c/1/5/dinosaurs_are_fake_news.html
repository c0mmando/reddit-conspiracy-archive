       I’ve been catching a lot of flak ever since spreading the truth that dinosaurs are 100% fiction and made up. For all those who are not disinfo agents trying to hide an enormous lie, I invite you to do some simple googling. Google and record every renowned dinosaur discovery noting the location where they were found. I am willing to bet you that at least 85% of them were found on government land. The remaining 15% either on private property belonging to someone tied to this conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to be clear, I’m not saying I am certain that they don’t exist, I’m saying that what the media and education system (also establishment) claims to be proof is 100% fabricated. It’s like a big lie and they keep it going by every once in a while making a new discovery. Also never do normal citizens discover them, it’s always some renowned, well regarded and always talked about in a positive light scientist (establishment).
      </p>
      <p>
       As with any major conspiracy, it’s tough to find good evidence to refute as it is instantly shut down. But if you google search the locations they are found and search the diggers history you will see what I’m saying.
       <a href="https://www.doi.gov/interiormuseum/videos/discoveringdinosaurs">
        Here is a US Department of Interior article about how 8!! Dinosaurs discoveries were made in Utah on government owned Land in 2018 alone.

       Well, I guess it is an interesting idea. And yes, I can see that it would be possible to create false fossil evidence. It would be a rather large and international conspiracy that would involve a large number of “insiders” creating false information and “dupes” spreading it.

       Control of your mind.  If one believes in dinosaurs and a spinning ball in a place called outer space then one can logically conclude that everything is random and there is no God.  If one instead knows that dinosaurs are fake and the earth is flat, fixed and "outer space" is a complete hoax then it becomes very clear we are created and in some kind of terrarium.  One can no longer logically be an atheist or an agnostic.  It also cuts out everything to do with aliens (seeding).
      </p>
      <p>
       So if there is a God, why would this kind of worldwide conspiracy exist?  All you need to do is actually read the King James Bible for yourself to find out.  All the answers are there.  The great deceiver (Lucifer) who has been given control of this realm wants  you to die without ever knowing the truth of what you are and what you need.

      <p>
       Repent and believe this to be saved:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       Reading the KJV as authoritative is a non starter for me, sorry. Also, it’s ironic that you’re using god as a basis for an argument against mind control, when the church is the biggest mind control bodies on the planet. If we believe we were created and are in a terrarium, then we should expect to have to follow church commandments. But for some reason that’s acceptable while free will is not?  The same arguments you make can be flipped and, I posit, made even stronger in a case against flat earth etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I also recognize this is a debate that neither of us will likely budge in, so I’ll politely acknowledge your position and move on.

       You are confused because you have never read the KJV for yourself.  There is no place called "church" that people are suppose to go to.  That's just another lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked why they would lie about Dinos and The shape of the Earth and outer space.  The answer is to discredit the Bible and hide God from people.  It's very simple.  Your notions about the KJV prove this point because you believe in dinosaurs, a spinning ball in outer space etc.  If you knew those were all lies the KJV would not be a "non starter" for you.  Your entire reality is based on these fundamental lies.  Lucifer is heading to an eternal lake of fire and he wants to drag as many (could have been) God's children with him as possible.

Funding for universities, fame and fortune for archaeologists and authors, museum ticket sales, movies, endless dinosaur games and merchandise on and on all relying on the original premise that they ever existed in the first place and weren't just science fiction. As usual, it takes very few insiders. The rest are useful idiots or victims of the fraud.

       With the Electric Universe model they claim high voltage discharges can fossilize material do dinosaurs could have been more recent. On the Youtube channel for the Thunderbolts Project they have a few videos about it.They also think gravity has increased over the years because the largest dinos could not have walked on dry land and huge sauropods had feet not designed for walking on muddy lake or river beds.

       One makes it out of plaster or resin from an original mold made from anything. Go to any science or dinosaur museum and look closely on the little card by any dinosaur bone. It will be a fake replica, guaranteed. But they'll tell you, "we swear we're hiding the original, and we

       swear it's really a dinosaur bone."

       I've seen original bones. In more than one museum. Not the ones on display, the real ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe the bones I saw preserved are actual bones. I don't really care whether anyone else believes or not.

       Tens of thousands of archeologists in America alone and not one has ever seen a fossilized bone?

       It’s not brigading when you’re trolling!  There’s no way that you can rationally believe this. Here’s one easy way to “disprove” your theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason that governments or famous archeologists find these is pretty simple—it costs a lot of money to dig those out of the ground in a way that you won’t deteriorate them. If you break all the bones and can’t put it back together, you aren’t making any research or money off it. When homeowners or excavators realize they’ve stumbled upon these, they call in the professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know what’s more lacking in simple common sense—FE or Dino denyers.

       I don't think that's true at all. Making some arbitrary statement that it's automatically brigading/manipulation JUST because it falls below any specific number is, IMO, making a claim that isn't going to be easily backed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is the sort of thing that makes me -want- to downvote this post. Because I'm tired of assumptions getting made as 'fact', and I think it happens a lot on Reddit in general. (Note: I actually HAVEN'T downvoted this post. I haven't upvoted it either.)

       You should visit an area like say central Oregon and Washington, where there is practically a fossil under every rock.  It just happens to be that a lot of the area is government owned by organizations like the BLM and USFS because where fossils are easily found are in areas of high erosion and varied terrains (but mostly sedimentary rock) and are otherwise unfit for farming and building cities.

       Why would you fake dinosaur fossils but not other ones? That's even more bizarre. Dinosaurs were real, there is plenty of fossil evidence for them. Geology can date the rocks that their remains are found in.

       Most have heard dragons = Dino bones but there’s quite a cool theory that Cyclops were thought to be real because of giant mammoth skulls found by Greeks. When the trunk decays, it leaves a huge central cavity in the skull - the big mono eye of a cyclops,

       Dinosaur bones have been discovered for ages before 1800. They were called dragon bones, cyclopes etc.

       Dinosaurs aren’t fake and I’m a Christian. The theory I been thinking about recently is that maybe the dinosaurs are a result of the fallen angels experimenting on animals and creating abominations that we call dinosaurs. The fallen angels did create giants so it wouldn’t much of a stretch.

       What they say about flak is true- you catch most of it when you're right over the target.

       Dinosaurs don't
       <em>
        cost
       </em>
       money, they
       <em>
        make
       </em>
       money, and that is the point of any fraud. Funding for universities, fame and fortune for archaeologists and authors, museum ticket sales, movies, endless dinosaur games and merchandise on and on all relying on the original premise that they ever existed in the first place and weren't just science fiction. As usual, it takes very few insiders. The rest are useful idiots or victims of the fraud.

       Youre ignoring my question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tens of thousands of archeologists in America alone and not one has ever seen a fossilized bone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a quick google search and I found many museums with original bones on display, Ive seen several.

      <p>
       Why would you lie?
