        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just copying from the <a href="https://8ch.net/pol/res/11744265.html#q11744265">chan</a>:</p>

<p>A week ago TEDx Talks YouTube channel uploaded a talk where a woman tried explaining that &quot;pedophilia is a natural sexual orientation, just like heterosexuality&quot;. The video went viral and got 6 gorillion thumbs down, and the comment section was full of people sharing ideas for how to construct gas chambers.</p>

<p>They shoahd the video, trying to quietly sweep it under the rug. After they did that, a video mirror was uploaded and the video had almost 15k views in under 24 hours. It had gone viral and outrage was spreading all across the Internet. It was waking normies up hard, civic nationalist cucks were even commenting on the video saying things like &quot;I didn&#39;t understand the whole nazi thing, but I get it now. We need to stop this.&quot; The fire was rising, fast.</p>

<p>Youtube just completely deleted the video at the request of TED.com representatives. Here are their emails (why don&#39;t you shoot them an email and ask them why they are promoting pedophilia as a &quot;natural sexual orientation&quot;?):</p>

<p><a href="mailto:frederica@ted.com">frederica@ted.com</a></p>

<p><a href="mailto:cynamen@ted.com">cynamen@ted.com</a></p>

<p><a href="mailto:distribution@ted.com">distribution@ted.com</a></p>

<p>TED Talks are all licensed under the Creative Commons license, which means it is not a copyright violation to reupload and share them, which many youtube channels regularly do.</p>

<p>This is a clear indication of censorship and an attempt to scrub this pro-pedophilia TEDx Talk under the rug. It&#39;s time to unleash the Streisand Effect and let the world know that TED is helping push a pedophile normalization agenda that includes reclassifying pedophilia as a &quot;natural sexual orientation&quot;.</p>

<p>We are holding TED&#39;s feet to the fire on this one. They realized they pushed too hard and too soon with their pedophile agenda and that the backlash was radicalizing normies. We are going to force TED to either officially disavow the video (rather than just quietly sweeping it under the rug), or force them to reinstate the video. We aren&#39;t going to let them just pretend this never happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not illegal to make a copyright claim. That&#39;s not how the law works. The law wasn&#39;t even involved. They asked, and YouTube did it without being forced to. If it&#39;s completely under Creative Commons, which I&#39;ll  take your word about, YouTube could have just ignored the request.  Do I like it? No. But it&#39;s not illegal to ask. YouTube takedown requests are not legally binding actions or court orders. Plus, YouTube can keep up or take down any video they want for any reason. It&#39;s a private sight. Nobody has the &quot;right&quot; to have a video there (even if, again, I do disagree with the takedown).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t come at me about reading when you&#39;re making nonsensical claims about breaking the law.</p>
