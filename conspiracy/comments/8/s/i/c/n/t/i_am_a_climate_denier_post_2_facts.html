<p>No I do not deny the climate changes. Of course it does.</p>

<p>Also do I mix this with anything resulting from pollution or environmental damage. I am very much against both of those.</p>

<p>No Climate Denier means I do not feel there has been sufficient proof to:</p>

<p>1.Show that human produced CO2 is the &#39;knob&#39; that controls the planet&#39;s temperature.</p>

<p>2.Show that if the planet were to warm a bit (notice how this is different from number 1) that is a bad thing.</p>

<p>original post from u/Runner_one</p>

<p><strong>The Earth has never been this warm. Wrong.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.co2science.org/articles/V16/N50/EDIT.php">http://www.co2science.org/articles/V16/N50/EDIT.php</a></p>

<p><strong>Temperature has never changed this fast. Wrong.</strong></p>

<p>The Younger Dryas he end of the Younger Dryas, about 11,500 years ago, was particularly abrupt. In Greenland, temperatures rose 10°C (18°F) in a decade</p>

<p>8.2 kiloyear event.</p>

<p>There&#39;s two times it&#39;s changed faster in the last 12k years.</p>

<p><strong>Polar bears dying off. Oops, once again wrong.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So global warming will cause food shortages. Oops wrong again.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So global warming will result in more desertification as temperatures rise. Nope, wrong.</strong></p>

<p>The mean sea level has not appreciably changed in the last 130 years, and at current melt rates it would take 300,000 years for Antarctica to melt. <a href="https://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/05/01/if-sea-level-was-rising-wouldnt-someone-have-noticed/">https://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/05/01/if-sea-level-was-rising-wouldnt-someone-have-noticed/</a></p>

<p><strong>The increase in Co2 is will kill us. No.</strong></p>

<p>Basic high school botany indicates just the opposite. Even NASA has been forced to agree that the earth is actually getting greener. Of course they had to add the ever present &quot;For Now&quot; And then they add &quot;The beneficial impacts of carbon dioxide on plants may be limited,&quot; MAY BE, so they actually don&#39;t know and are expecting the worse.</p>

<p>And just to show how wrong the doom and gloom crowd is.</p>

<p>Just two years ago these were the headlines:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/thanks-el-nino-californias-drought-probably-forever/">Thanks El Niño, But California’s Drought Is Probably Forever</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/us/california-drought-water-restrictions-permanent.html">California drought water restrictions permanent</a></p>

<p>Now look at the headlines:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/us/california-drought.html">California, Drenched by Winter Rain, Is Told ‘Drought’s Over’</a></p>

<p><strong>Always they are wrong with their predictions, so why should we put any trust in them?</strong></p>

<p>Here are just a few more.</p>

<p>Mar 29, 2001: In ten years Tuvalu&#39;s nine islands in the South Pacific Ocean will be submerged under water. Director of the UN Environment Program.</p>

<p><strong>Oops wrong.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/02/150213-tuvalu-sopoaga-kench-kiribati-maldives-cyclone-marshall-islands/">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/02/150213-tuvalu-sopoaga-kench-kiribati-maldives-cyclone-marshall-islands/</a></p>

<p>Princeton professor and lead UN IPCC author Michael Oppenheimer said the following in 1990: <strong>By 1995,</strong> the greenhouse effect will desolating the heartlands of North America and Eurasia with horrific drought, causing crop failures and food riots. <strong>By 1996</strong> the Platte River of Nebraska will be dry, while a continent-wide black blizzard of prairie topsoil will stop traffic on interstates, strip paint from houses and shut down computers. <strong>The situation will so bad that Mexican police will round up illegal American migrants surging into Mexico seeking work as field hands...</strong> WOW, can we say WRONG!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Within a few years winter snowfall will become a very rare and exciting even. Children just aren&#39;t going to know what snow is.</strong> Dr David Viner, Senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia - Mar 20, 2000.... </p>

<p>WRONG! </p>

<p>The National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center data showed U.S. snow cover on the morning of Dec. 1, 2015 is the highest on record for this day of the year. In all, 38.7 percent of the United States was covered in snow, surpassing the previous record — 36.5 percent — set in 2006. Worldwide, similar trends have been observed. Global Snow Lab data also shows Eurasian autumn snow cover has grown by 50 percent since records began in 1979.</p>

<p><strong>In New York City by 2008, the West Side Highway which runs along the Hudson River will be under water.</strong> James Hansen testimony before Congress in June 1988</p>

<p><strong>Environmental refugees to top 50 million in 5 years.</strong> UNU-EHS Director Janos Bogardi. - United Nations University news release - October 11, 2005</p>

<p><strong>Wrong, wrong, wrong, always they are wrong with their predictions.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know that Russia is claiming that climate change is not man made?  They are claiming that it&#39;s due to a recent tilt in the Earth&#39;s axis.  I believe it.  Here in Canada, the sun is totally out of place for our season and latitude.  Total silence by media and government.  Lots of chemtrails and global dimming at sunrise and sunset, though!</p>

<p>If the powers that be knew that a Poleshift and global flood were imminent on this planet, I think they would try to cover it up.  They never let a good crisis go to waste!  Besides, most elite believe the world is overpopulated.  What a great opportunity for them to cull the herd!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I assume all governments would be responding, if indeed there was a short-period-disruption event such as pole shift and the possibility of severe geo instability.</p>

<p>The reaction of Russia might be enabling at-risk europeans to rapidly translocate into a very large safe zone in Central Asia. China would be making empty cities, etc. America would get behind both migration scenarios and high technology to attempt more immediate defense measures. Strangely, all these action items seem to be somewhat in play right now.</p>

<p>1990 IPCC FAR: “Under the IPCC ‘Business as Usual’ emissions of greenhouse gases the average rate of increase of global mean temperature during the next century is estimated to be 0.3°C per decade (with an uncertainty range of 0.2°C – 0.5°C).” See here, page xi.</p>

<p>Reality check: Since 1990 the warming rate has been from 0.12 to 0.19°C per decade depending on the database used, outside the uncertainty range of 1990. CO2 emissions have tracked the “Business as Usual” scenario. An interesting discussion of the 1990 FAR report warming predictions and an analysis of them through April of 2015 can be seen here. A list of official warming rates from various datasets and for various time spans can be seen here.</p>

<li>Temperature predictions</li>
</ol>

<p>1990 IPCC FAR: “Under the IPCC ‘Business as Usual’ emissions of greenhouse gases … this will result in a likely increase in global mean temperature of about 1°C above the present value by 2025.” See here, page xi.</p>

<p>Reality check: From 1990 to 2017 (first 8 months) the increase in temperatures has been 0.31 to 0.49°C depending on the database used. CO2 emissions have tracked the Business as Usual scenario.</p>

<ol>
<li>Winter predictions</li>
</ol>

<p>2001 IPCC TAR (AR3) predicts that milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms, see here.</p>

<p>2014 Dr. John Holdren, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy for the Obama administration said: “a growing body of evidence suggests that the kind of extreme cold being experienced by much of the United States as we speak is a pattern we can expect to see with increasing frequency, as global warming continues.” See here.</p>

<p>Reality check: By predicting both milder winters and colder winters the probability of getting it right increases. Now, to cover all possibilities they simply need to predict no change in winters.</p>

<ol>
<li>Snow predictions</li>
</ol>

<p>2000 Dr. David Viner, a senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, predicts that within a few years winter snowfall will become “a very rare and exciting event”. “Children just aren’t going to know what snow is.” See here.</p>

<p>2001 IPCC TAR (AR3) predicts that milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms. See here.</p>

<p>2004 Adam Watson, from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, said the Scottish skiing industry had no more than 20 years left. See here.</p>

<p>Reality check: 2014 had the snowiest Scottish mountains in 69 years. One ski resort’s problem was having some of the lifts buried in snow. See here.</p>

<p>Reality check: Northern Hemisphere snow area shows remarkable little change since 1967. See here. The 2012-2013 winter was the fourth largest winter snow cover extent on record for the Northern Hemisphere. See here.</p>

<ol>
<li>Precipitation predictions</li>
</ol>

<p>2007 IPCC AR4 predicts that by 2020, between 75 and 250 million of people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress due to climate change. In some countries, yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50%. See here.</p>

<p>Reality check: Only six years later, IPPC acknowledges that confidence is low for a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century, and that AR4 conclusions regarding global increasing trends in drought since the 1970s were probably overstated. See here, page 162.</p>

<ol>
<li>Extreme weather predictions</li>
</ol>

<p>2010 Dr. Morris Bender, from NOAA, and coauthors predict that “the U.S. Southeast and the Bahamas will be pounded by more very intense hurricanes in the coming decades due to global warming.” They say the strongest hurricanes may double in frequency. See here.</p>

<p>Reality check: After 40 years of global warming no increase in hurricanes has been detected. NOAA U.S. Landfalling Tropical System index shows no increase, and in fact, a very unusual 11-year drought in strong hurricane US landfalls took place from 2005-2016. See NOAA statistics here.</p>
