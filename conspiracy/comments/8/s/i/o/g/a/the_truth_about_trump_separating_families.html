       I am going to chalk this up to ignorance. Once it is explained, you are now willfully ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the weekend, the media went insane over the supposed Trump administration policy of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children. According to the media, Trump could with one quick fix simply prevent the separation of children from their parents; according to the media, all Trump has to do is wave his magic wand, and all will be well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This is a lie.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       More specifically, it’s several lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Lie 1. Trump Created Separation Of Children From Illegal Immigrant Parents.
       </strong>
       -This is plainly false. In 1997, the federal government made an agreement in a case called Flores not to keep unaccompanied illegal immigrant children in custody beyond twenty days. The settlement said nothing about accompanied illegal immigrant children – children who crossed the border with their parents. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then ruled that accompanied children also could not be held in custody under the terms of the settlement. This meant that the government either had to release whole families, or that the government had to separate parents from children.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Lie 2. Immigrants Seeking Asylum Are Being Punished For Seeking Asylum.
       </strong>
       -This is plainly untrue as well. Immigrants who come to points of entry to seek asylum aren’t actually illegally in the country – they’re not arrested. They’re processed through ICE, and their children stay with them. If, however, illegal immigrants cross the border illegally, the Trump administration now treats them as criminals. If they choose deportation, they aren’t separated from their kids; if they choose to apply for asylum, they stay in the country longer than 20 days, and their kids have to be removed by operation of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Lie 3. The Trump Facilities Are Awful Thanks To Trump.
       </strong>
       -They may be awful, but they were just as awful under President Obama. These are pictures from Brandon Darby of Breitbart circa 2014:

        https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Df7rwMXVAAESMpQ?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=small
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Df7sKVrVMAEqOXZ?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=small">
        https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Df7sKVrVMAEqOXZ?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=small
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The big mistake made by the Trump administration here came courtesy of Stephen Miller and John Kelly, both of whom reportedly stated that the administration was separating kids from parents as a sort of deterrent. That’s idiotic.
       <strong>
        The deterrent is arrest and deportation, not separating children from parents. That’s why the House is attempting to pass some sort of fix here to keep kids with their parents.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       But with that said, the media coverage of this issue has been patently irresponsible.
       <strong>
        Trump isn’t forcing children away from parents. He’s enforcing the law on the books. The legislature can fix that law at any time. The facilities he’s using are the same facilities Obama used.
       </strong>
       Pretending that this is Japanese internment (as Laura Bush suggested) or the Holocaust (as General Michael Hayden suggested) is ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        This policy ought to be fixed. But lying about it isn’t designed to fix it.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It’s designed to prevent a fix by allowing Democrats to play political football with children, believing they’re winning a victory by holding Trump’s feet to the fire with pictures of crying children.
       </strong>

       I thought trum poo supporters didn't approve of spending taxes on illegal immigration. Now suddenly, they're all for paying to keep these kids interned. The only explanation I can come up with is that they expect that these kids will be providing them with some sort of service in the future. The question is, what might that service be?

       Yes. Usually jail. Breaking laws puts parents at risk of losing their kids by jail or child protective services even for citizens born in the US.

       Makeshift temporary detention centers are used when too many people break the law while bringing their children in one specific area. They will soon be transported to better facilities. This isn't as bad as the mindless exaggerations make it out to be.

       Isn’t this a misdemeanor in many cases? I did t lose my kids when I got a speeding ticket last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it that this is complicated by the legal citizenship status but the treatment really doesn’t fit the crime. I understand also that the catch and release process doesn’t work for trump since he believes these kids are all about to rape true Americans next week but if detainment is their approach it should be done in a better way. Oh that’s not a deterrent you are right. Well living in shit and having you kids and life threatened all the time outweigh any deterrent Sessions can come up with except maybe immediate execution. Is that the way we want to go?

       Don’t bring your ass here expecting a free ride? Idk, if I was thinking about going somewhere, and I knew they would take my kids from me as soon as I got there, and lock my ass up, I would probably think twice about taking that trip. That’s just common sense to me.

       There are definitely some that think that but many more that are leaving a worse condition so as usual it’s not black and white.

       Even the foster care and being separated is still probably better for many.

       I don’t think so but I would be okay with the system that was in place before for first time misdemeanor level folks. Send them off and they probably join their extended families and expect them to show up in court. The numbers that did follow the rules was actually pretty good. Some won’t but what can you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those coming with drug dealers or repeat they should pulled aside and queued up for foster care and or return to their families.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current overcrowding event is completely due to the change in catch/release to zero tolerance. It shows lack of foresight and planning imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I go back to the deterrent short of death is probably still better in many cases so stopping this type of behavior is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a waste of time and resources and that’s the very reason the previous protocols were in place.

       True. There is a wide range of punishment for misdemeanors.

       Regardless Trump owns this because his lack of planning and understanding that the policy change from catch and release to zero tolerance had consequences and they clearly did not plan for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For whatever reason trump and his nationalists have deemed this type of criminality a high risk. It is all on them.

       Well if they are arrested, don’t have a home and are here illegally, yes. Hell they don’t even need to be here illegally. How many times has CPS taken children from homes where the parents are arrested? Are they just supposed to let the kids run free? Who takes care of the kids when the parents are arrested?

       If the families are seeking asylum, why don't they go to a point of entry and declare their desire to seek asylum?

       Yes, why spin it?  This is simply a hard-line stance by the Trump admin.  They could have kept the children with their families in the poor conditions of the detention centers like Obama and others did.  But this isn't about that.  This is about a hard-line stance, almost cruel, to be a "deterrent."
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think it will be a deterrent.  It changes the incentives.  Bringing children with you on your dangerous illegal border crossing makes much more sense under an Obama administration who will keep you together in a center until you are deported or granted entry.  That situation was "heads I win, tails at worst I'm sheltered with my children until we're deported."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the situation is "heads I win, tails I end up in Federal prison away from my children until we're deported."

       I don't even know that it would be much of a deterrent.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of these people from countries like El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras would even be in a position to be "deterred"?
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of these people would even hear about the policy?

      <p>
       How many would even believe that the United States would have such a policy?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's not gonna do much to deter anyone. There must be another reason for the policy ...

       I think the deterrent is around:

      <p>
       1) Crossing illegally (and then claiming asylum if/when you are caught) rather than following the protocol for asylum seekers.

       and/or
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Bringing your children on the journey.

       They are not criminals. They are asylum seekers. Even if you were to make the case that they were crossing illegally, it's not a criminal offense, it's a civil infraction. Robbing a bank makes you a criminal, getting a speeding ticket doesn't. 
You all are trying to inflate the infraction to justify the kidnapping of abuse of children. It's pretty disgusting and I hope to never here any bullshit pizza gate type shit again from you all.

       Have any of them been in custody over 20 days?  I'm somewhat out of the loop on this issue.  It seems like it just popped up out of nowhere and now everyone is up in arms.  How long has this been going on at the border?  Why does it seem like 1000s of people just all the sudden went to the border and tried getting asylum?  Is there a head count where we can see the ratio of adults to children?

       No, that is not what is happening now. You still don't get arrested for seeking asylum. You always got arrested for illegally crossing the border, which is different. Now they just don't let anyone go that gets busted illegally crossing the border. Before, child smugglers were too much of a pain to deal with their children, so they just let them go when they caught them. You couldn't discern the child smugglers from the parents illegally crossing with their children, so you assumed they were all families and just let them go. Smuggling children was a free pass into the US illegally.

       There are definitely some that think that but many more that are leaving a worse condition so as usual it’s not black and white.

       Even the foster care and being separated is still probably better for many.

       It comes down to how we want to be as a people. Nationalists are afraid and want to throw up walls it’s that simple.
