<p>My last big thread (partly) exposing the occult sacrifice of XXXTentacion was removed by the mods with no explanation. This is much more than what the media is making it out to be. The drake/soldier kidd story is a cover story being pushed in order to distract people. This was an occult ritual sacrifice done by a group in which symbolism and archetypes mean everything. This picture of the Snapchat XXX posted is being scrubbed from the internet and is something that they don’t want people knowing he spoke about. This very well could have a direct connection as to why he was murdered. Please repost this picture and consider the fact that XXXTentacion was vocally active about chemtrails being sprayed, this is an aspect that NEEDS to be considered when looking into his suspicious murder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When have you ever seen someone in his field of entertainment mention chemtrails?? Not talking about B.O.B., who is a whole different story, XXX was arguably the most influential rapper out right now of this new generation.  He had millions of followers, most of them kids in high school who have probably never even heard of chemtrails. With a cult-like influence like he had, even mentioning something like spraying could impact a good percentage of his followers, and get them to start thinking. I even said in my post that this MAY be a reason why he was murdered. Not THE reason but one of them. In a case like this, someone speaking on a topic like this is extremely crucial to the investigation of what really happened. Nothing can be ruled out, every theory must be examined</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s because X was woke to these things, as well as speaking on things such as astral projection. This was a ritual sacrifice and a planned hit, NOT something to do with robbing him or someone that hated him for his accusations/charges. The drake and soldier kidd story is a distraction. There’s enough evidence pointing towards that to lead people into thinking they’re onto something, when really that’s what “they” who really did this want. As for who it was, whether it’s government, someone to do with his label, etc. we don’t know yet. But what people need to realize is that there is so much more to this case</p>
