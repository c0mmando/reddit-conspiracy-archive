       My last big thread (partly) exposing the occult sacrifice of XXXTentacion was removed by the mods with no explanation. This is much more than what the media is making it out to be. The drake/soldier kidd story is a cover story being pushed in order to distract people. This was an occult ritual sacrifice done by a group in which symbolism and archetypes mean everything. This picture of the Snapchat XXX posted is being scrubbed from the internet and is something that they don’t want people knowing he spoke about. This very well could have a direct connection as to why he was murdered. Please repost this picture and consider the fact that XXXTentacion was vocally active about chemtrails being sprayed, this is an aspect that NEEDS to be considered when looking into his suspicious murder.

       Not disagreeing with the fact he's woke. I just strongly disagree with the fact he mentioned chemtrails must mean his death is linked. If he had concrete proof, then yeah, sure it's a possibility. But mentioning it on Snapchat with nothing to back him up? Clutching at straws.

       When have you ever seen someone in his field of entertainment mention chemtrails?? Not talking about B.O.B., who is a whole different story, XXX was arguably the most influential rapper out right now of this new generation.  He had millions of followers, most of them kids in high school who have probably never even heard of chemtrails. With a cult-like influence like he had, even mentioning something like spraying could impact a good percentage of his followers, and get them to start thinking. I even said in my post that this MAY be a reason why he was murdered. Not THE reason but one of them. In a case like this, someone speaking on a topic like this is extremely crucial to the investigation of what really happened. Nothing can be ruled out, every theory must be examined

       Exactly.... it’s getting shilly in here. My last post that went into further detail about this was also shadowbanned and removed. It’s not even a reach as it’s literally something said by XXX himself, but yeah clearly we’re just gonna pretend they don’t spray and act like it’s nothing to see here

       I was actually looking for this, thanks. I typed on google xxxtentacion sick browsed county and it doesn’t show up kind of weird, not even in images. Seems like a mod called fuckaduckfuckaduck is deleting all the xxx posts. He deletes them and doesn’t even make a mega thread with all these theory’s popping up. It’s like they are trying to silence everything about this.

       I am so lucky that I screenshotted it because I remember when X posted it last year someone actually posted it to this sub that same day, but that post has of course been deleted too. Save and share it to everyone.... people need to know about this

       That’s because X was woke to these things, as well as speaking on things such as astral projection. This was a ritual sacrifice and a planned hit, NOT something to do with robbing him or someone that hated him for his accusations/charges. The drake and soldier kidd story is a distraction. There’s enough evidence pointing towards that to lead people into thinking they’re onto something, when really that’s what “they” who really did this want. As for who it was, whether it’s government, someone to do with his label, etc. we don’t know yet. But what people need to realize is that there is so much more to this case

       I have never heard of this 20 year old kid before he was murdered.  I highly doubt he was a sacrifice of any kind.  To think so makes you delusional.  I heard he had domestic issues.  Maybe made some enemies.  NOTHING to do with chem trails.

       Bro not to rain on your parade but he was pretty fat in terms of popularity for this generation. Not to mention he blew up out of no where with a cult like following. You’d be surprised

       If this is the only reference he made?  It's very possible he was talking about something else.  He doesn't mention trails or aircraft.
