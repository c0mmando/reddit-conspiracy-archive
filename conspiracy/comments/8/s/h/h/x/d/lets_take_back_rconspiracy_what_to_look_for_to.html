       So, in light of a popular discussion that's been going on recently, I'd definitely like to start a thread just so we can discuss the um... conventions of the way certain people operate in this sub in order to cause confusion, to diminish (or dispel) value of conversation and try to destroy any sense of community or understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who don't know (but I'm sure many do), as revealed over time and in a stickied post on the front page,
       <a href="https://xp.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8r766b/are_the_reddit_admins_helping_rtopmindsofreddit/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">
        this sub is most definitely being victimized by TMOR
       </a>
       and I definitely encourage you to check it out if you haven't done so. This sub is definitely under attack- but it's not just by those with an agenda, it's also under attack by narcissistic, sociopathic and psychopathic personalities that come under your threads, that read your comments and they deliberately want to cause chaos and confusion or to tear you down. I know I cannot be the only one who has experienced this. I see it happening too many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since reading what's been going on, I just wanted to compile a list of things to watch for as you navigate this sub (or any other online spaces, like Facebook, tumblr, YouTube- any online space where you feel free to start a discussion, really), so you can easily spot those who have the worst intentions for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below is a list of tactics that these shills, narcissists and psychos use in these threads. I got these wonderfully summarized explanations from other websites that I will link below. Sometimes, it's hard to spot their tactics, or it isn't easy to pull away once these people have engaged you. The list below will help you identify someone who's trying to manipulate you and how to deal with it effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1. GAS-LIGHTING
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I want to bring up gas-lighting first because I think it's one of the more frustrating things to deal with, and sometimes the hardest to spot...
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some warning signs to gas-lighting that include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          "Telling blatant lies."
         </em>
         (This one can be hard because it's the internet; however, I hope everyone takes what they read on here with a grain of salt and some common sense)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          "They deny they ever said something, even though you have proof."
         </em>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <em>
          They confuse you with positive reinforcement.
         </em>
         Statements like, "I was just trying to play devil's advocate," is sometimes code for "I'm just trying to push your buttons." Don't fall for it. The minute someone drops this line, I encourage you not to reply.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "They wear you down over time..." People are like that a lot of the time on reddit. They'll throw you bait- asking you about one thing you said. All of a sudden- you're trying to explain your worldviews when it had nothing to do with the original conversation. In my personal experience, hit the 'block user' button from the start. It'll save you so much time and it honestly feels liberating. I can't stop now that I've start.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       *They project... which brings me into number 2
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2. PROJECTION
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Projection is a defense mechanism used to displace responsibility of one’s negative behavior and traits by attributing them to someone else. It ultimately acts as a digression that avoids ownership and accountability."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Narcissistic abusers love to play the “blameshifting game.” Objectives of the game: they win, you lose, and you or the world at large is blamed for everything that’s wrong with them."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Solution? Don’t “project” your own sense of compassion or empathy onto a toxic person and don’t own any of the toxic person’s projections either. As manipulation expert and author Dr. George Simon (2010) notes in his book, "projecting our own conscience and value system onto others has the potential consequence of being met with further exploitation.""
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2016/06/20-diversion-tactics-highly-manipulative-narcissists-sociopaths-and-psychopaths-use-to-silence-you/">
        More details here, from the original website
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3. NONSENSICAL CONVERSATIONS
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Sociopaths use circular conversations, ad hominem arguments, projection and gaslighting to disorient you and get you off track should you ever disagree with them or challenge them in any way. They do this in order to discredit, confuse and frustrate you, distract you from the main problem and make you feel guilty for being a human being with actual thoughts and feelings that might differ from their own. In their eyes, you are the problem if you happen to exist."
      </p>
      <p>
       This happens
       <em>
        far too often.
       </em>
       You'll go into a thread to talk about one thing- all of a sudden it's your "tone" you need to explain to someone, or they way you "worded" your statements offended someone. In my personal experience, again, once someone is trying to tell you about yourself, "block user."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        5. DELIBERATELY MISREPRESENTING YOUR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS TO THE POINT OF ABSURDITY.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the hands of a malignant narcissist or sociopath, your differing opinions, legitimate emotions and lived experiences get translated into character flaws and evidence of your irrationality."
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is also a popular form of diversion and cognitive distortion that is known as Toxic people often presume they know what you’re thinking and feeling. They chronically jump to conclusions based on their own triggers rather than stepping back to evaluate the situation mindfully."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Notorious for putting words in your mouth, they depict you as having an intention or outlandish viewpoint you didn’t possess."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        9. NAME-CALLING
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Name-calling can also be used to criticize your beliefs, opinions and insights. A well-researched perspective or informed opinion suddenly becomes “silly” or “idiotic” in the hands of a malignant narcissist or sociopath who feels threatened by it and cannot make a respectful, convincing rebuttal."
      </p>
      <p>
       "It’s important to end any interaction that consists of name-calling and communicate that you won’t tolerate it. Don’t internalize it: realize that they are resorting to name-calling because they are deficient in higher level methods."
      </p>
      <p>
       I must admit- I've fallen guilty of this when I've been gas-lighted to level where I even can't bother to keep my decorum, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. It can be hard- but if someone is quick to call you out of your name, especially with vile words-
       <em>
        report them.
       </em>
       It's crazy, every time I use the report button, it's as if I'm using some rare, last-resort feature- but the report button is there and accessible for a reason. Use it whenever you can, especially if you feel you're being trolled.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        18. CONDESCENDING SARCASM AND PATRONIZING
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Belittling and degrading a person is a toxic person’s forte and their tone of voice is only one tool in their toolbox."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Whenever you are met with a condescending demeanor or tone, call it out firmly and assertively. You don’t deserve to be spoken down to like a child – nor should you ever silence yourself to meet the expectation of someone else’s superiority complex."
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone words sounds reminiscent of something off r/iamverysmart, don't try to prove your intelligence to them. If you really want- encourage them to use simpler terms, but if it looks like they feel the need to "educate you," and they're insulting your intelligence, I recommend just ignoring them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trolls, shills, and psychos are heavy in this sub- sometimes they're a mix of all three. Sometimes they're easy to spot- other times, they're good at hiding- either way, they can be stopped. I encourage everyone to give this list a quick read, and if you want, check out
       <a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/shahida-arabi/2016/06/20-diversion-tactics-highly-manipulative-narcissists-sociopaths-and-psychopaths-use-to-silence-you/">
        "20 Diversion Tactics Highly Manipulative Narcissists, Sociopaths And Psychopaths Use To Silence You"
       </a>
       , I got a lot of the information from there and the article is a good read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's clean up this sub a bit. I do wanna reiterate, the block user and report buttons: amazing. I don't know why it took me so long, but I just started using those, and it feels great! If anyone else hasn't been using those and someone's gas-lighting you, projecting, calling you out your name- try out that block button. It's great.

       Ironically, I think these account and post itself was a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is, the shilling and manipulation from places like share blue won’t stop until the money drys up.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, more people are getting fed up with shit and the tide is turning more and more against the shills so majority could end up winning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing for sure is that this subreddit in particular needs constant shilling as the premise itself is critical thinking, which shills don’t do.  Their damage is only ever temporary.

       So this person's sage advice after identifying all the ways this place is harassed is use the block button? I guess that's a legitimate way of looking at it. Especially, since it seems they get their marching orders from higher ups on this site or at least tacit permission to break the rules to harass people on this sub. But I prefer just to confront them point it out and fight back
