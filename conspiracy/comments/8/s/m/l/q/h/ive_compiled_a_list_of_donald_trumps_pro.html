        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/GreenIDLady.html">GreenIDLady</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To me, it seems as if the elite chose him as a populist to appeal to theorists and subvert our effectiveness as the truth movement.  We are  traditionally skeptical of politicians, especially the presidency.</p>

<p>It seem as if the trust for Trump spread once the &quot;alternative media&quot;  started to endorse him. Alex jones, PJW, cernovich,ect. Couldn&#39;t these  guys be gatekeepers that &quot;flipped&quot; on us? Do you really want to get sucked into the partisan vaccum? </p>

<p>Here are a few concerns I have..</p>

<ul>
<li>Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project.</li>
</ul>

<p>When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; <strong>&quot;the trump name is still very much a future asset for us&quot;...</strong></p>

<p>How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren&#39;t the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty? </p>

<p>Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>After singing the harms of Wall Street and corrupt bankers, he makes several Goldman Sachs and wealthy billionaires his cabinet members. The  point is, he lied to you, turned around, and &quot;got the band back  together&quot; so to speak, appointing many of the former bush era cronies in positions of power. Why is this good for us ? Do you trust a Goldman Sachs cabinet? Do you trust Jeff Sessions and John Bolton? </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/trump/goldman-sachs-hogging-trump-cabinet-appointments">https://www.thewealthadvisor.com/trump/goldman-sachs-hogging-trump-cabinet-appointments</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Why did trump meet in private, and visited the home of known globalist Henry Kissinger? These first 3 alone reveal to me, a very establishment friendly puppet. Can anybody explain this? Are you OK with this and why? </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trump-to-meet-with-henry-kissinger-gops-foreign-policy-eminence-2/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/05/16/donald-trump-to-meet-with-henry-kissinger-gops-foreign-policy-eminence-2/</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the &quot;terrorism boogeyman&quot;  in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, &quot;bomb the  shit out of them and take the oil&quot;. Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war? </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did  he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them? </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8">https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8YouTube</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Why Is trump saying that the CIA is &quot;great&quot; and  &quot;terrific&quot;? Why did he say that he was behind them &quot;1000&amp;#37;&quot;? </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/T4Ej4wXR7cM">https://youtu.be/T4Ej4wXR7cMYouTube</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Why was his Bombing of Syria a strategic move for the betterment of  US citizens? Was it not allowed to occur under false pretenses? </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, after criticizing Obama&#39;s policies, how are the continued drone strikes helping make America great again? </p>

<p>Trump also has a slew of rape and sexual abuse allegations against him, some of them from children. One of these allegations that went to court was against a 13 year old girl, and allegedly took place at one of Jeffery Epstein&#39;s properties. Epstein is a convicted pedophile and long friend of Trump&#39;s.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-alleged-rape-lawsuit">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/12/donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-alleged-rape-lawsuit</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Finally after criticizing  Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips,  is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000  dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these anti establishment policies? </li>
</ul>

<p>These questions should be very easy for Trump supporters to explain. How do these moves, which many of us consider to be terrible overreaches of power and authoritarianism, benefit our country and help take down TPTB?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel sorry for you. I honestly do. </p>

<p>I wrote this in another post, it seems relevant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still to this day I can&#39;t tell you what Hillarys political message was during the election. It was so vague, based on some sort of &quot;I am the decent choice&quot;, which - and everybody could see it even then - was akin to saying &quot;At least I am not as shitty as that guy&quot;.</p>

<p>Not a very strong message compared to Trumps demagogic approach that promised you the moon and a fantastical trip back to the &#39;good old days&quot;.</p>

<p>America have been bred, for more than three generations now, on a diet of fast food, political infused entertainment TV and poor education for the masses. That is a prime situation for a demagogue to enter the stage.</p>

<p>You can see it throughout history. Germany elected Hitler on the wild promise of ending a job recession gripping the whole world after World War I. He made some promises that the lesser educated people saw as true, ignoring the plethora of warnings.</p>

<p>Stalin rose to power with the promise of freeing the people from the hunger, while Mussolini took control with the empty promise of restoring a nationalistic Italy while going through a recession of their own.</p>

<p>Today we have leaders like Erdogan in Turkey, using the same strong man tactics as Putin, curbing democratic freedom and stomping on the press while promising a return to the glory days of old.</p>

<p>And people buy it. They buy it because they - on average - lack the education that enables them to think critically and objectively.</p>

<p>They even peddle the demagogue&#39;s promises as gospel to friends and family - with good intentions - because they have been fooled by a man with a far better education and with enough money to ensure you hear his messages loud and often.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to fool the uneducated. That&#39;s why you most often find dictatorships in countries that lack proper education for the poor.</p>

<p>A recent study concluded that the less you know about a complex problem, the more inclined you are to think you have the easy solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not really.  I skimmed through what you wrote, and it is not very well researched.  You are acting like it is...  </p>

<p>The question is &quot;Do I waste my time on this, or do I continue to research more important topics?&quot;  This is a reasonable question.  </p>

<p>I will start here and see how intelligent your response is.  Who put Hitler and Stalin into power?  They did not acquire power based on their own merits.  That is a fallacy. Hitler was a fascist and Stalin was a communist.  The same group of people invented fascism and communism.  Who are these people?  </p>

<p>Ha ha ha! So you are using this guy as some sort of person we should take serious? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztihh2d9xCE">The same guy who holds seminars on existence of UFO&#39;s?</a></p>

Just because he has unfounded beliefs in UFOs does not mean he is incompetent when it comes to Constitutional Law, right?  Is this you logic?

<p>It would definitely not be my go-to guy, lol!</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you see how far out you are when you have to resort to people that hold seminars on fucking UFO&#39;s and cosmic energy?</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s a complex problem and he has the easy solution to it, right?</p>

<p>That is called critical thinking. I searched for his credentials and found him not particular worthy to spend my time on. </p>

<p>I did not. I stopped taking you serious when you linked to that guy.</p>

<p>Maybe you could find a source, you said there were many, that doesn&#39;t go around spouting stuff about flying saucers... Then I&#39;d  be far more inclined to take you serious. </p>

<p>While I agree that it would be a boon to the people, I don&#39;t think she would have been able, or even wanting, to actually implement that. If you want someone to push for this, I&#39;d look towards someone with a more consistent voting record. I also don&#39;t agree that it&#39;s something the establishment would want, because it&#39;s mainly the establishment that benefits from having less competition (through less graduates) or from actually be on the recieving side of student debt and tuition money.</p>

<p>In absolute terms, you are correct. However in reality the low income earner is hurt much worse because of the concept of marginal value. IE a dollar is not worth the same amount to you and me and it is to Jeff Bezos. So while Jeff may lose $100 Million from tariffs, that won&#39;t matter to him as much as the fact that you or I will have to pay an extra dollar here for good X, and an extra 3% here on good y. Because the total increase on you and I, even though it is MUCH lower in absolute terms, is far greater in terms of our relative wealth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you don&#39;t think a Dem President would pursue that, since the last 4 have.. also I&#39;m not really sure what you are talking about re: Clinton&#39;s voting record on this particular?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The link you post also offered this nugget:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is true that wages for low-wage workers have declined — they fell 5 percent from 1979 to 2013. That may not seem like a huge drop, but during that same period, the hourly wages of high-wage workers rose 41 percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute.</p>

<p>However, <strong>economists disagree</strong> over whether an influx of immigrant labor caused or contributed to declining blue-collar jobs and wages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence, the article you post describes that the debate is not settled yet. There are logical grounds behind the reasoning, and depending on how you measure it, empirically, you notice the effect or you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Furthermore, there is very little research being done (surprisingly so) that specifically looks at the lower income workers that are in direct competition with the immigrants. </p>

<p><a href="http://pcsi.pa.go.kr/files/w12956.pdf">http://pcsi.pa.go.kr/files/w12956.pdf</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.9.2.23">https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.9.2.23</a> offer some data, but you can see an issue here. The effect on wages in the last 20 years or so is really depending on the education level of the individual. For High school graduates, wages have merely stagnated. For lower education than that (IE. the ones that would be in competition with unskilled labor) wage growth indeed has been negative. For higher education than that, immigration has indeed been a succes-story.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think, by looking merely at the data, you can see what you are suggesting, though I do have to agree that the effect on wages is essentially the effect of globalization in general (of which immigration is only a part of the story).</p>

<p>The second paper puts the numbers at a 0-1% decrease in wages among low-skilled workers. That&#39;s still a standstill in times where average wage has been growing, but they don&#39;t explain why progress left them behind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Righ that&#39;s why I said that NPR article goes too far in too seem balanced. Because if you click on those underlying studies what you see is one&#39;s claiming there is NO net effect, or ones claiming inconclusiveness, but NO studies actually claiming blue-collar jobs and wages are suppressed, thus the disagreement.</p>

<p>I am not agreeing with your 3rd 4th or last paragraphs, but there is no evidence to suggest that these effects are due to immigration or illegal immigration, there are however numerous Positive confirmed economics elements to immigration. Which is why I think it is hard to claim, from a economic policy making perspective, that restricting immigration makes sense. </p>

<p>One of the articles which I link shows that it has a net negative effect on the poor. So in effect, if you want to combat inequality (by itself that makes economic sense), you need to &#39;direct&#39; migration a little bit so as to not have a depressing effect on the lowest wages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which one of your studies say that? I read both as roundly rejecting that contention...</p>

<p>From the first study:  To the contrary,
as immigrants were imperfect substitutes for natives with similar education and age we find that they
stimulated, rather than harmed, the demand and wages of most U.S. native workers </p>

<p>From the second: Even those natives who are the closest substitutes with immigrant labor do not suffer significantly as a result of increased immigration. There is no evidence of economically significant reductions in native employment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The example you give proves the point perfectly. Median wage growth has grown by 4%, but we know higher educated workers have experienced wage growth that is easily triple to quadruple that. By necessity this means that either a majority of people had no real wage growth (IE 0 - 4%) or that a decent-sized minority have actually experienced wage decreases in said period.</p>

<p>&quot;even the least educated native workers gain 1.8% of their real wages and college dropouts gain 7.2%. These are remarkable gains. While in relative terms the group of native high school dropouts is still harmed by immigration, given wage boosts to
higher educated workers of 4 to 7%the high complementarity between natives and immigrants and the large in flow of immigrants increased wages in real terms for all native groups.&quot;</p>

<p>Not necessarily so. I simply notice that there is a gap between the data and what they claim, but I also know that the gap could be explained otherwise, even though they fail to do so.</p>

<p>If you want more detailed analysis, I suggest you read the papers more carefully. It contains a couple of gems like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Borjas, Freeman, and Katz (1992) use time-series data for the United States from 1967–1987. Their results suggest that immigration accounted for onequarter of the 10 percent decline in the relative earnings of high school dropouts from 1980–1988, a period when immigrants as a proportion of the labor force rose from 6.9 percent to 9.3 percent. This means a 1 percentage point increase in the proportion of immigrants reduces the absolute wage of dropouts by at most 1.2 percent, the same magnitude calculated by Altonji and Card.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in effect we do know that unskilled immigrants exert a downward pressure on the wage level of unskilled workers. The papers conclude the effect is SMALL, but they don&#39;t say it is non-existent.</p>

<p>In effect, perception also matters, and when your wage is stable while everyone else&#39;s wage goes up, you will think you are worse off. So stagnant wage is already significant enough, IMHO, to require explanation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>On average there&#39;s a wage gain yes. But as you see in the section, for some parts of the population there was a wage decline, which Borjas et al. attribute to different reasons, but also for a quarter to migration.</p>

<p>I think at this point, I&#39;m not so entrenched, I just see the evidence applies to some part of the populations and you seem to stick to population-wide effects.</p>

<p>And as I said, the fact that, population-wide wages increase only makes the fact that SOME wages did decrease worse.</p>

<p>WTF?   Trump was the conservative GOP candidate, which everybody on the planet knows means right-wing agenda.

<p>This is merely a quick way to guarantee that you become a lifetime loser.   It is not the way politics works at all.   The one and only chance of moving the overton window to the left is for Dems to win 3 elections is a row and/or win an election really big.  Which means you work really hard in the primary to get good progressive candidates and then <em>always</em> work to get Dems to win big in the general election.  Whenever Dems do not win elections both politicians and the media <em>always assume it was because they aren&#39;t centrist enough</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s really the whole gist of it. One attempt after another to pretend like people that support Trump aren&#39;t real people. When real people are shown they call them white supremacists, racists, nazis, etc.. All meant to dehumanize people and justify their violent fascist actions.</p>

<p>They claim Trump was voted in by Russia switching votes</p>

<p>They claim anyone on any forum that supports Trump is a Russian bot</p>

<p>They are now claiming Trump supporters are actually anti-Trump</p>

<p>The end goal is simply to give an impression that Trump isn&#39;t popular. It&#39;s some serious level of denial. They live in echo chambers where they have so isolated themselves from anyone with an opposing view that they simply can&#39;t fathom that there are people with opposing views. And they desperately attempt to turn every public space into their echo chambers to confirm their alternate reality.</p>

<p>To protect their echo chambers, they even toss out fellow democrats that don&#39;t toe the line on everything.</p>

<p>The liberal propaganda has gotten to a point where I can barely recognize when someone is truly ignorant or intentionally being dishonest.</p>

<p>When you see liberals defending things like what Peter Fonda said yesterday, it&#39;s hard to believe that they are just innocently ignorant.</p>

<p>Googling the user brought up some interesting things about how he left the mod team at T_D and deleted his account. A lot of accusations of him being transphobic too, and threatening to dox him. But nothing about a PR firm.</p>

<p>Got any links to that part? I have to agree, the fact that the same user that started T_D was also a top mod at <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> is certainly interesting enough to pique my interest.</p>

Forbes has published the fact that he is the first billionaire to become president, not that that is a good thing, but he actually was able to use this to his advantage in the campaign by making the argument that he was already rich so he could largely finance his campaign himself without being beholden to traditional campaign contributions from corporate donors. This was all conjecture though, as he has largely supported the same corporate masters Bush and Obama did and merely payed lipservice to common man causes.

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with that theory is that there is no evidence of him trying to beat them at their own game.  And when I say this people always point to the number of child trafficking arrests as of trump had anything at all to do with them.

When I ask them to point out how trump made it happen they just say some prefabricated line about the deepstate or pg.  </p>

<p>His rich buddies are making more money than ever. Corporate profits are skyhigh,  while us commoners salaries have either dropped or only risen 2%.

<p>There is no doubt that you don&#39;t get as successful or rich for as long as Trump has been without some sort of business acumen, which is to say that you know how to &#39;play the game&#39;. It&#39;s not always pretty. However, sometimes at the end of one&#39;s life, people also re-evaluate what they want to do with their legacy and their position. Maybe Trump is here to sell out the USA, but I don&#39;t see that thus far.

    <div class="md"><p>Ironic, I voted for Trump because I knew firsthand exactly how evil the democratic party had become. Frankly I am absolutely reviled with myself for having voting to elect a man capable of such evil deeds into office, but this goes to show why I renounced my belief in anything republican and refused to flip-flop once again, so I am back to my socialist views again. The Republicans literally have the power to, at any time, end this massive series of abuses going on at our border and specifically with immigrant children being mass-injected with psychiatric medications and toxic chemicals, also being seperated from their parents and sold off into child slavery by DynCorp. Now, people are walking out the door and letting it hit them on the way out. the cognitive dissonance is fucking massive, and frankly I am done with anything republican, democratic, or 2-party in the first place. While the Republican party continues to make excuses for it&#39;s inexcusable behavior, they have shown themselves to be as horrible as the democrats and socialist they demonize.</p>

<p>This was also the result of a massive religious experience, so it could be attributed to such a thing. However, it is better to be able to identify when one is in the wrong and appropriately respond, instead of making excuses for inexcusable behavior which inevitably is a horrible slipper slope to fascism itself.</p>

When it became clear that Hillary would face enormous opposition from both sides they settled on Trump. They&#39;ve successfully discredited their biggest critic in wikileaks.

But against Trump she completely bombed. Even went so far as to go on tv visibly sick and fainted. There&#39;s no way she wouldnt have gad a doctor give her something to hide her symptoms on tv if she was trying to win.

<p>Prior to 2016, his history clearly shows him as being this. He&#39;s been the most successful independent third party politician in national politics for decades. He&#39;s served as an independent in both the House of Reps and the Senate. Prior to 2016, he used this position as an independent politician to advocate for third parties, not that you would have heard about this since the corporate media would never give that kind of message any airtime. He&#39;s been extremely consistent on progressive policy throughout his career in politics, and he&#39;s been consistently considered generally decent, even by Republicans who he might disagree with politically. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Bernie intended to &quot;draw in the ultra-left&quot; and then tell them to fuck off. Bernie isn&#39;t even that far to the left, and if you talk to legitimate socialists, communists, etc., they&#39;ll tell you this even if they were willing to compromise and support Sanders against Clinton. I think what happened there was that he saw that Clinton was already set to be coronated, and he wanted to make sure that there was someone talking about popular &quot;left&quot; policies like universal healthcare and ending cannabis prohibition, just to ensure those topics got SOME attention during the primaries. The idea there would have been to encourage Clinton to take on better policy positions during the primary. I think he knew that he&#39;d never have been allowed to win regardless of how many people liked and voted for him, and that is why he didn&#39;t even try to fight it when he got cheated, but I don&#39;t think he was deliberately trying to fuck over the &quot;ultra-left&quot;. That&#39;s ridiculous to consider, because I&#39;m sure he would realize that pissing off hardcore lefties would actually have a deleterious effect. Millions of lefties have left the Democratic Party following the fraud that was committed in 2016. I&#39;d sooner think that he let himself get cheated to CAUSE those people to leave the corrupt party than to think that he was deliberately trying to fuck over the type of independent lefties who have been backing him for decades. </p>

<p>Also, the &quot;mansion&quot; you refer to is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/08/10/bernie-sanders-buys-a-half-million-dollar-vacation-home-and-the-internet-cries-hypocrisy/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;utm_term=.c27d45634711">a vacation home worth $575,000</a>. The guy has been making six figures as a member of Congress for over 2 decades. Why shouldn&#39;t he be &quot;allowed&quot; to own a home that has that value? What is he <em>allowed</em> to spend his acquired wealth on according to you? It&#39;s not even like that is an exorbitant amount for a house, and I believe I heard that they&#39;d bought that new house after coming into a sum of inheritance money too. What is Bernie Sanders supposed to do? It&#39;s not like he&#39;s one of the politicians who somehow becomes a millionaire/billionaire through corruption, it&#39;s not like you&#39;re railing against someone like the Clintons who are enormously wealthy from taking literally hundreds of millions in bribes, you&#39;re basically just mad at a Senator for owning a decent home in rural Vermont that he can easily afford with his six figure salary as a senator. </p>

But a two billion dollar campaign that couldn&#39;t see in the last few months before the vote the way all of that was breaking down, then make some adjustments, is so baffling to me that I&#39;m entertaining the idea of it being thrown. </p>

<p>Any other democratic candidate would have won that election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very accurate. Still to this day I can&#39;t tell you what her political message was during the election. It was so vague, based on some sort of &quot;I am the decent choice&quot;, which - and everybody could see it even then -  was akin to saying &quot;At least I am not as shitty as that guy&quot;. </p>

<p>Not a very strong message compared to Trumps demagogic approach that promised you the moon and a fantastical trip back to the &#39;good old days&quot;.</p>

<p>America have been bred, for more than three generations now, on a diet of fast food, political infused entertainment TV and poor education for the masses. That is a prime situation for a demagogue to enter the stage.</p>

<p>You can see it throughout history. Germany elected Hitler on the wild promise of ending a job recession gripping the whole world after World War I. He made some promises that the lesser educated people saw as true, ignoring the plethora of warnings.</p>

<p>Stalin rose to power with the promise of freeing the people from the hunger, while Mussolini took control with the empty promise of restoring a nationalistic Italy while going through a recession of their own. </p>

<p>Today we have leaders like Erdogan in Turkey, using the same strong man tactics as Putin, curbing democratic freedom and stomping on the press while promising a return to the glory days of old.</p>

<p>And people buy it. They buy it because they - on average - lack the education that enables them to think critically and objectively. </p>

<p>They even peddle the demagogue&#39;s promises as gospel to friends and family - with good intentions - because they have been fooled by a man with a far better education and with enough money to ensure you hear his messages loud and often. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to fool the uneducated. That&#39;s why you most often find dictatorships in countries that lack proper education for the poor. </p>

<p>A recent study concluded that the less you know about a complex problem, the more inclined you are to think you have the easy solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they planned on him being a fake &quot;anti establishment populist savior.&quot; I think they just set him up during Obama&#39;s administration as a political opponent in that specific regard. Trump had been a Democrat for years, friends with the Clintons and tied into that world, but when he opposed Obama, he did so from a position fully compatible with racist Democrats opposition to Obama. He attacked Obama over conspiracy theories regarding fake birth certificates, not really on specific policy. Probably because all of the terrible things Obama did as president, Trump has already shown to also do. E.g., bombing Syria without explicit Congressional authorization, something that Trump himself criticized Obama for doing. I have substantive policy disagreements with Obama, Trump just hated on him because Obama was allegedly born in Kenya or something. He took the &quot;birther&quot; angle that the 2008 Clinton campaign had started and drove it into the ground. If I&#39;m taking a position that Trump has been a puppet all along, I think that&#39;s what they were using him for. He was forwarding the Clintonite attack against Obama that Clinton couldn&#39;t continue forwarding after she lost the 2008 primaries. I don&#39;t think the powers that be foresaw what might happen in 2016 when Trump started down that &quot;birther&quot; path almost a decade prior. </p>

<p>When it comes to 2016, I would also say that Trump wasn&#39;t meant to win. Whether he&#39;s been acting independently while being manipulated or as a fully controlled puppet all along, I think the powers that be put him into position as a &quot;serious&quot; candidate ONLY to be a <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-2016-donald-trump-214428">pied piper</a>, ONLY to give Clinton a horrible Republican opponent that she MIGHT actually be able to win against (she couldn&#39;t). Trump wasn&#39;t supposed to inspire anyone really, he was supposed to be controlled opposition who lost to Queen Hillary. Look at how much money each campaign spent, the Trump campaign spent about HALF of what the Clinton campaign did. The Clinton camp burned over 2 billion dollars propping up Hillary, why would they have done that if the powers that be intended on her losing to a fake puppet in Trump? Why spend more than any other campaign in history to lose on purpose? Trump forwarding the deep state&#39;s agenda for the most part as we&#39;ve seen is almost definitely a non-ideal back-up plan. I can&#39;t say for certain whether he&#39;s completely controlled or if he&#39;s merely giving in to the heavy influence, but I do think it&#39;s clear that Trump forwarding that agenda isn&#39;t what they REALLY wanted to have happen in an ideal world. </p>

<p>Yes I&#39;m more conservative leaning, no I don&#39;t think the Rothschilds wanted Trump after pouring a billion  dollars into the Hillary campaign. How much the media and every actor/actress in Hollywood detests him is absolute proof of that. </p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m saving like $200 every paycheck from his tax cuts so to claim it only helps the super rich is disingenuous.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they poured millions into Hillary&#39;s campaign, but ask yourself what that says. Did they do it because they thought it would help her win? or to set themselves up in feigned opposition to the US for what they knew was coming for the next 8 years? Maybe they knew that the purpose of Hillary&#39;s campaign was never for her to be president, but to blue-ball the feminist left in the US after already blue-balling them with her loss to Obama in the 08 primaries, and divide this country along party lines in one of the most primal ways possible: by gender. This coming after 8 years of dividing this country by race, with radical racial ideologies pushed on the left and racist dog-whistling by politicians on the right. Maybe Trump is the wet dream of the powers that be, because now more than ever the country could permanently lose any semblance of real democracy, especially if democrats flop this midterm election which mark my words they fucking will, especially if Trump legalizes pot. The Republicans will be emboldened and they will not give a FLYING fuck what the media/coastal liberals say when they have it proven to them that their base will always outdo the apathetic liberals at the polls (that is if they don&#39;t decide to just start rigging like the Russians). The democrats provided controlled opposition to the creeping fascist takeover of this country since the days of Kennedy. These elections of this decade i predict will be their death blow, which is EXACTLY what the international banksters would love to see; and could lead to us being the new global bad guys in the next world war/cold war.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert, but I have followed conspiracy theories since my childhood and I&#39;ve never trusted either party. I&#39;m telling you, Trump is where he is to distract us while we get fucked by the same people who fucked us under Bush.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The president spoke at the CIA headquarters outside of Washington, D.C., where he arrived for a professional tour together with senior members of his administration. In an attempt to quell recent tensions between himself and the U.S. intelligence community over Russian interference in the election, Trump told the CIA officials who gathered to hear him - &quot;I&#39;m 1,000% behind you.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump literally just oversaw a 6 month $61 billion increase to military spending with a proposed increase to $710 billion next year.</p>

<p>Do you want to see how ridiculously bloated Space Force projects get? If you thought the F35 was expensive, you&#39;re in for a treat.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is the case for some, but I donate to churches and charities regardless (I took the standard married deduction last year).  If I am donating more this year than last year, and I took the deduction, why would other people start giving less just because they don’t see a specific effect on their tax form?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In The Washington Post’s article titled “Charitable Deduction Is Indispensable, But Shouldn’t Be Sole Motivation for Giving,” mentions the Dunham Company, a consulting firm for charitable organizations that compiled a survey regarding charitable giving.</p>

<p>According to the survey, people support the deduction, regardless of household income, education, age, race or gender. Thirty-three percent of donors in the survey said they “would reduce their giving if the charitable deduction didn’t exist.” When it came to the group between the ages of 40 and 59, 40 percent said they would reduce their giving.&quot;</p>

<p>No the tax bill was a tax increase for any not for profits that provide employee benefits.</p>

<p>Ron Paul was a threat to these people and they blacklisted him immediately. Just his comments about Federal Reserve were enough for them to act.

They are normalizing people being sold off into slavery by contractors, who have very little to no government oversight, and injecting them with 6-10 black-box warning psychotropic drugs that have very little to no effective use, especially in children, and most of them being mass-produced drugs from the fucking &#39;50s. This is way worse than anything we did during the cold war. I&#39;m pretty sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems likely. I find it hard to believe that any major player would back Donald Trump of all people when he had 15 other politicians to fight through before getting to the general.  The odds just seemed really long at the time. Of course, I figured he would win at the time (for reasons similar to what Scott Adams proposed regarding persuasion, and for the unique nature of his campaign), so it’s possible TPTB did too.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk where you’re getting the idea that this is his first executive order - he has signed over 40 thus far. Some highlights include the several iterations of the travel ban, tweaks to Obamacare, and amendments to a bunch of Obama’s previous executive orders. I guess you could argue that this was the first “major executive order against current law,” but given that several previous ones (like the travel ban) have controversial and challenged in court, I don’t see how you define this as the first major one. He has frequently bragged that his executive orders are among his major accomplishments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The GOP sort of laid out the plan for this a while back as well. All they needed was a useful puppet as a leader, going forward from Obama. It&#39;s hard to read this and not see a blueprint for the current leadership. </p>

<p>Grover Norquist at CPAC in 2012:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All we have to do is replace Obama. ... We are not auditioning for fearless leader. We don&#39;t need a president to tell us in what direction to go. We know what direction to go. We want the Ryan budget. ... We just need a president to sign this stuff. We don&#39;t need someone to think it up or design it. The leadership now for the modern conservative movement for the next 20 years will be coming out of the House and the Senate.</p>

<p>The requirement for president?</p>

<p>Pick a Republican with enough working digits to handle a pen to become president of the United States. This is a change for Republicans: the House and Senate doing the work with the president signing bills. His job is to be captain of the team, to sign the legislation that has already been prepared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>several possible reasons: I predict that something reeeeallly bad is going to happen under his term, and he will be the &#39;fall guy&#39; that the establishment can blame for decades. </p>

<p>Or, the intentional and painful collapse of the controlled opposition that is the democratic party, in such a way that leaves the liberals of america hopeless and angry, potentially violent (and disorganized) sufficient to bring in martial law in some cities (think Tienanmen square, but not nearly as deadly) This could put america poised to be the next global boogeyman to be warred against (cold or hot) by &#39;good guy china&#39; along with the EU. </p>

<p>Lastly, You have to remember that the media is definitely controlled by TPTB, but they do this by hiring people with certain desired ideological leanings and giving them select information, so that their mouthpieces earnestly believe they are telling the truth. Any good conspiracy relies on most people not realizing they are in on it and doing the bidding of it unwittingly. I predict that VERY few news hosts are knowingly acting as shills (my guesses are Hannity, Anderson Cooper, and Alex Jones to name some). My guess is hosts like O&#39;Rieley, Maddow, Larry King, etc don&#39;t know entirely what kind of agenda they are pushing, and certainly most low-level reporters have no idea and if they do they get shut up with financial, legal,  and eventually physical threats.</p>

<p>CNN is owned by Time Warner, same company that owns HBO, WB, and a ton of other stuff. They&#39;re the second biggest media conglomerate behind Disney. </p>

<p>FOX is still number 1 for cable news which isn&#39;t surprising since their demographic age is higher and more likely to watch TV as opposed to younger people who get their news online.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t feel like having to give you the entire backstory but FOX and the other major networks work in collusion. They&#39;re all corporate owned. They aren&#39;t left or right, they just pander to whichever target audience is dumb enough to watch their shit.</p>

<p>CNN tends to pander to the left, FOX panders to the right. At the executive level, the owners don&#39;t give a shit about any of the crap their employees are saying as long as it doesn&#39;t hurt them.</p>

<p>When Bill O&#39;Reilly and Keith Olberman got into a fight, the networks loved it because it was great ratings. All until it got dirty and both guys started dishing dirt on each other&#39;s bosses. Their bosses got together and told them to quash it because they didn&#39;t want the heat.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Olbermann#Feud_with_Bill_O&#x27;Reilly">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Olbermann#Feud_with_Bill_O&#39;Reilly</a></p>

<p>Trump worked for NBC for 13 years. Keith Olbermann was like one the most left leaning talking heads next to Colbert &amp; Stewart, and he was also on NBC.</p>

<p>You&#39;re nuts if you think that left vs right bullshit means anything to the networks. They&#39;re playing you guys like chumps.</p>

<p>In many ways Obama and Trump have the same role.</p>

<p>They are picking controversial presidents to create divide among the public.</p>

<p>These sorts of controversial figures are easy to create false narratives as to distract from what really matters.</p>

<p>They want people to think dumb shit like &#39;you oppose Obama you must be racist&#39; &#39; You support trump you must be an idiot (or racist)&#39;</p>

<p>It is all about divide and conquer and confusing/spreading misinformation. </p>

<p>Humans are tribal by nature and easy to manipulate.</p>

<p>Obama became president and the Right started to radicalize, Trump became president and the Left started to radicalize.</p>

<p>They want everyone to be forced into extremes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually he is. Forbes has published the fact that he is the first billionaire to become president, not that that is a good thing, but he actually was able to use this to his advantage in the campaign by making the argument that he was already rich so he could largely finance his campaign himself without being beholden to traditional campaign contributions from corporate donors. This was all conjecture though, as he has largely supported the same corporate masters Bush and Obama did and merely payed lipservice to common man causes. Remember how he made a big stink about prescription drug price gouging for like a day, and then we never heard about that again. That went away real quick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes no sense at all.   If Dems controlled congress, there was a 100% chance her policies would pass.   When GOP controlled congress, of course it was harder.  But the GOP would have fought 3 times harder against Sander&#39;s more progressive policies than Clinton&#39;s policies.  So even though Sander&#39;s policies were better, Clinton had a way higher chance of getting congress to pass her policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The example you give proves the point perfectly. Median wage growth has grown by 4%, but we know higher educated workers have experienced wage growth that is easily triple to quadruple that. By necessity this means that either a majority of people had no real wage growth (IE 0 - 4%) or that a decent-sized minority have actually experienced wage decreases in said period.</p>

<p>Because even in that section the study goes on to talk about how that pressure is swallowed by the real wage gain of all native born workers.</p>

<p>Thanks for the discussion.</p>
