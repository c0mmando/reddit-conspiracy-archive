With tge immigrant situation, juries can nullify the case and grant immigrants asylum without the government. If they really wanted change, the msm would be educating people. Instead, they just feed anger and contempt. You should share this concept with everyone you know because it is one of the biggest powers citizens have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously sarcasm, but do not let a judge hear you telling prospective jurors about jury nullification. What you can say (it&#39;ll 100% get you out of jury duty in my experience) when the lawyers ask if you&#39;ll base your decision solely on the law is &#39;no&#39;. They may ask you to explain. In that case you can say that if you don&#39;t believe that the law is right/good/moral/valid/whatever then you&#39;d base your decision on what you believe to be right, even if the law was broken. </p>

<p>Worst case, I choose to be the only one to nullify by going,  &quot;not guilty&quot; repeatedly until they get the point, it becomes a hung jury.  The state will probably try the poor sumbitch again, but that would be out of my hands at that point.   There&#39;s only so much one can do.</p>

Twice during voire dire for jury selection my response indicated that I was well aware I have this right. Both of those times the prosecution and defense gave each other puzzled looks, ala, &#39;this one won&#39;t do what we want&#39;. The right to serve on a jury, and to nullify when the facts call for it, are THE biggest foundations we have of democracy.You are correct that it&#39;s not popular in the courts.

So this wouldn&#39;t work in your immigration angle, unless there was a case brought up before a jury.  But even then, the jury&#39;s refusal to apply the law in this case would only apply to that singular case.  Juries can&#39;t repeal laws.  Interesting concept though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If every single juror voted based on whether or not they think the law is justified, there would be no law. Part of a functioning legal system is that sometimes there&#39;s a law you don&#39;t like. Hell, maybe it&#39;s just you don&#39;t like the defendant. Or the prosecutor. Maybe the defendant did something you don&#39;t like to someone you really hate, so you&#39;re looking the other way on it.</p>

<p>Jury nullification is dangerous. For every person using it to say slavery is wrong, you have a person using it to say lynching is okay. It is not in itself a right, but rather a side effect of how juries work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, juries exist to decide whether or not someone broke the law. Not to decide whether or not the law should exist. The fact that jury nullification exists is an unintended product of a few protections that are afforded juries, not as an intentional citizen check against the legislative branch. Supporting jury nullifcation may, in your eyes, protect people from unjust laws, but it also has a terribly ugly side in which the law can simply not be applied to certain groups. Are you comfortable enough giving a tool to jurors to protect from legislative oppression if it means that the same tool can also be used to protect corrupt cops from facing justice for their crimes or to prevent racists from going to prison for murder in racist areas? Because that&#39;s how it&#39;s used, and I&#39;m not okay with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So because its unintended it doesn&#39;t serve as a check on the government by the people? Crazy!</p>

<p>A jury deciding to nullify the law is no different than a jury saying not guilty. Its a citizens way to protect against tyranny. You really think it was just an accident they allowed it?</p>

<p>Can you all think of the real world for a second.  You have appeals and higher courts so that a small subset decision can be heard in a wider audience that keeps racism in your county from being the final say</p>

<p>Sure. In the real world, jury nullification has been used to not prosecute whites who lynched blacks. This is not a hypothetical, it&#39;s truth. It&#39;s why these &quot;simpletons&quot; bring it up, because it&#39;s &quot;historical evidence&quot; that is used to &quot;prove a point using facts&quot;.</p>

<p>What&#39;s kind of interesting is that the case doesn&#39;t exactly address <a href="/u/dinosauraus">/u/dinosauraus</a> question about why aliens can claim access to constitutional rights. <em>Clark v. Martinez</em> seems to come closer, implying that all persons within the United States are entitled to due process.</p>

<p>Although both cases seem to be related to indefinite detention as a cause, not constitutional rights generally, which is on the whole probably a good thing because it seems dangerous for the government to be able to claim the right to detain someone indefinitely without due process.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t judges have the ability to set aside jury verdicts when they believe that the jury has committed gross errors or ignored the rules they were given?  Or at a minimum, declare a mistrial?</p>

<p>I guess I see it working in situations where the stakes are small and the injustice of a specific case being significant, but I would expect a major case to wind up with some kind of judicial intervention unless it ran into some kind of significant and widespread negative publicity and political pressure.</p>
