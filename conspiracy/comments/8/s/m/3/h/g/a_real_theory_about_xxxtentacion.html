        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some people think I’m shitposting right now or trying to take attention from other theories but I really really seriously think there is something here other than a random robbery. First of all if you think he was a shitty person and that’s why we shouldn’t talk about him you’re dead wrong. Girlfriend dropped the charges and posted documents showing she was never pregnant. Nobody addresses the fact maybe XXX was defending himself from that gay person in prison? There’s only like I don’t know 50,000 male rape cases in prison every year? xxx death was not only anticipated by himself but he said several months before “if I die it was champagne(one of drakes supposed shooters) I’m snitching rn” and you mean to tell me this isn’t a conspiracy? Drake said In a song less than a month ago “SMS(send my shooters) XXX, that’s the only time I hit below the neck, why you keep on shooting when you know he dead? That’s the only type of shit that get you some respect” and it’s till NOT a theory? Keep in mind the last time I tried to prove a theory or invested in ANYTHING was that whole 4/18/18 ordeal. So really I don’t get involved unless there’s a lot to it. And this theory goes so deep but for some reason you don’t want us to talk about it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s the thing. At the end of the day there is literal proof this could be a conspiracy. A shit post would be intentional. When the fact is y intention is to talk about what exactly makes this a conspiracy. Instead you formed your own opinion and than tried to shove it down my throat. Your gross dude. Picking on people for what exactly? Having a different opinion than you? I honestly can’t fathom how you’ve reached this mindset where you think it’s ok to say shit about an entire generation based off one encounter. I feel like all the people you give your usual spiel too would say the same things about you. So therefore your just kind of wrong. Later bud enjoy popping a blood vessel over tiny shit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are dumb. The biggest narrative I was hearing about his death being fake was that the 17 tattoo on his forehead was missing because they saw the last video he made on Instagram talking about getting killed but failed to realize that front facing cameras flip images. A lot of people are also claiming his cheek tattoo is missing and bring up images of when he just got it with the ink still being fresh. Tattoos fade especially if you are exposed to the sun a majority of the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude this is literally the cover story and a distraction, it goes so much deeper than that. There is so much symbolism involved with his death that it’s clearly a ritual sacrifice. Please open your mind a little bit more to this as the whole drake/Soldier Kidd story is just scratching the surface of this. Look up at my post from yesterday that was shadowbanned and then removed without notice for exposing a portion what’s really going on, a lot is explained about this. The constant shitposting of drake connections is a distraction from what really happened </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its worthy of further exploratiion, but just repeating the same dumb Drake theories over and over is kind of dumb. At least put your own spin to it. First of all Drake doesnt strike me as that kind of dude. I doubt he&#39;s ever been in a fight, much less that he would kill somebody. He&#39;s a low budget Canadian actor best know for being in degrassi high. His whole thuggish persona is acomplete fabrication. I will say there are some very dangerous elements in the hip-hop industry that he associates with who probably helped him to achieve fame, but as far as him being a murderous thug himself, it just doesnt seem likely. For one thing he has too much to lose by getting involved in a petty twitter beef and killing someone over it.</p>

<p>I think there are legit questions that could be asked about X&#39;s murder though. Just more basic questions like the idea of the random robbery motive. Even if you believe it was just a robbery, how would they have known he had 100k in that Louis Viton bag? They would have at least had to have been following him to know he went to a bank first. Furthermore if you know anything about that immediate area, Pompano / deerfield beach is one of the safer areas in the whole south Florida region. It&#39;s not like Miami or even Ft Lauderdale. This area doesnt have a lot of shootings or armed robberies. Its a lot of retirees and golfers. That alone causes to question the idea that it was just some random locals who saw an opportunity and took it.</p>

<p>I believe he was targeted. But not by Drake. By who? its hard to say. Theres a lot of sketchy shit going on in hip hop that we never see. There are underworld characters that finance these guys careers, and they are basically indebted to them for life. Kind of a form of extortion. What happens is a lot of these rappers get big and their egos grow and they think their success is all about them, so they forget the people who got them there and the deals they agreed to, and they turn around and bite the hand that fed them. The gangs and criminal elements that used drug monies to finance their careers get really pissed and come back and take rappers out.</p>

<p>Couple that with the fact that they promote a thuggish image and they really start to believe the act they portray, that they are super thugs and no one can touch them. X was from Plantation. This is one of the richer areas in south florida. He grew up around rich suburban white kids in an affluent neighborhood. He had a lot of personal rage issues, but you could look in his eyes and tell he really truly wasnt about that life. And being around the hip hop industry underworld, he eventually crossed paths with people who WERE about that life. Just look at him getting knocked out in San Diego on stage.</p>

<p>The kid was clearly bipolar and he ran his mouth WAY too much. He probably said the wrong thing, to, or about, the wrong person and they felt they had to set an example. The streets work like that sometimes. Or like I said his ego got too big and he turned on the criminals that financed him. Either way he was a loose canon and judging by how he talked, I imagine it was his mouth that got him killed.</p>

<p>I dont think another rapper that people know did it though. </p>

<p>I feel for the kid, but he was being pretty stupid any way you look at it. I know he was young and naive, and I cant imagine I would have a lot of maturity either if I was a millionare by 20 years old, but if you have a number one album and you talk as much shit as he did to so many different people, why the fuck are you driving around in a $80,000 car with $100,000 in a louis viton bag, all by yourself with no security, or even just one friend to watch your back?</p>

<p>I hate to speak bad about him, but thats just dumb and careless. Thats an egregious tactical failure on his part, and unfortunately he paid for that error with his life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All day today at work and yesterday why I was thinking about this was “Drake ain’t like that”. Idk. A lot lines up that needs investigated wether Drake is capable of doing it or not tbh. Including the fact he threatened the exact thing that happened to X. And rapped lyrics that described the even that happened to X less than a month ago. The beef in the rap world is ridiculous. Chief kief and sixnine. Drake and Pusha T. This shit is so dumb. But you made my point. It needs to be talked about PERIOD. This kid died like Tupac man. I’m not saying he’s anything like tupac. I’m saying he died the same way. Also as far as X’s behavior think about this. If Malcolm X would’ve died at age 20 he wouldn’t even be in our history books</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This site has changed a lot. It&#39;s being targeted because they are probably afraid of the work that&#39;s being done here and the potential it has to completely change history. Keep up the good work, brother. Don&#39;t let some &#39;downvotes&#39; or opinions change how you see things. And yes, it&#39;s definitely &#39;very coincidental&#39; how Drake fits in the whole thing and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s true. The music industry is fucked up and I wouldn&#39;t put anything past them. </p>
