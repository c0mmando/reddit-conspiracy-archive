Perhaps in past decades wigs were more common? Maybe baldness is accepted more now and people don’t hide it? Maybe our diets have changed? Or maybe certain chemicals drugs have had an influence?</p>

<p>Creatine also increases production of DHT - but as far as I know DHT doesn&#39;t cause Male pattern baldness, it just speeds it up. So if you were never going to go bald, increasing DHT won&#39;t have an impact </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with you, but i&#39;ll put it another way. </p>

<p>Almost all older males in my family have had extreme balding on both sides of my parents.</p>

<p>When I was in my early twenties i was young &amp; uneducated. </p>

<p>I travelled to many foreign countries &amp; was shocked how little people ate during the day &amp; how unprocessed it was. People didn&#39;t gobble candy bars &amp; lots of bread.....so I tried to emulate it &amp; voila my super receding hairline &amp; semi balding spot grew in thick. </p>

<p>It didn&#39;t happen over a few weeks. Probably around a 1 1/2 years &amp; it the diet made me feel more energetic as well so I have ate that diet now for 90% of every week.</p>

<p>I am now 2 decades later with more hair than I had in my early 20&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Does lower testosterone cause baldness?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it does not.  DHT, not testosterone by itself, leads to baldness.  Higher testosterone means higher DHT.  This is why men who take steroids lose their hair faster than they otherwise would if they don&#39;t take a DHT blocker like finasteride or dutasteride.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good answer!</p>

<p>I just want to add in that DHT results in male pattern baldness only in men who have the receptor on their follicles that responds to DHT. Also, DHT only affects those hairs that have the receptor. Not all follicles do, which explains why men who go bald still tend to have plenty of hair on the sides and back of their head.</p>

<p>As a side note, if there&#39;s any research into twins with male pattern baldness. You&#39;d think that having identical genes would mean identical hair loss. If there were differences in the amount or rate of hair loss, it should be due to non-genetic (environmental) factors.</p>

<p>If you could id a list of things that made hair loss worse, you could reduce or avoid those things. If you had a list of things that reduced hair loss, you could increase or introduce those things and keep more of your hair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Baldness is caused by the conversion of testosterone into dihydrogentestosterone (DHT) so it would stand to reason that having less testosterone to convert would reduce your chances of baldness. Probably why women don&#39;t go bald except for other reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was diet or environmental at all, women would be going bald too. When men go bald and women don&#39;t it&#39;s genetic.</p>

<p>Until i was like 20, i thought bald men went bald in middle age. Older men were the only ones i saw with visible male pattern baldness (as in, not shaved). Then i learned that the 25 year old men with shaved heads were shaving them <em>because they were going bald</em>, i don&#39;t know why it never occurred to me, i just thought they didn&#39;t like having hair. And there were a lot of them. And my friends were dating them. It was weird. But anyway, no, it&#39;s always been common to start balding in your 20s if you&#39;ve got the MPB gene. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think that can be a factor. steroids do increase DHT which will lead to increased hair loss in males. but I don&#39;t think it is a common denominator in the increased (apparent) percentage of young males with hair loss. thanks though!</p>

<p>Anecdotally I&#39;m from the Midwest, a small farming community. While I haven&#39;t lost my hair I noticed a large amount of my former classmates have. Meanwhile I have moved around the country and not noticed nearly as much male pattern baldness. Because of this I have a suspicion that pesticides and fertilizers could have a part in it. Again, anecdotally I have noticed a large number of people getting cancer where I grew up as well. Could very will be linked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More medications with male-pattern baldness as a common side effects. More stress in day to day life and the awareness of the world in general.</p>

<p>In the older generation, smoking was often overlooked (But boy was it everywhere) ... sure some people could smoke and keep their hair, but the buildup of toxins from a pack a day habit can destroy your hair or at the very least accelerate your scalps aging process. Exponentially increases when you factor in a stressful lifestyle with inadequate nutrition and sleep hygiene.</p>

<p>Also maybe more and more men just decide they&#39;re going bald a little too early and ax the whole thing and get used to it, rather than deal with a widow&#39;s peak or whatever that they may not like.</p>

<p>Even though I&#39;ve got plenty of hair I still worry way too much about losing it. Its kind of like an identity thing, I would assume it would be the same with the folks actually balding ironically enough. The fear of losing something that you feel defines you.</p>
