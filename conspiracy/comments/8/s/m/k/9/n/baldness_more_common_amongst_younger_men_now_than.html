       This is probably pretty silly, but it seems that today we see a lot more males that go bald in their twenties and thirties than in previous generations. Perhaps in past decades wigs were more common? Maybe baldness is accepted more now and people donâ€™t hide it? Maybe our diets have changed? Or maybe certain chemicals drugs have had an influence?

       Short answer testosterone (DHT) is the main cause male pattern balding.  Woman do get thinning brittle hair (and it could fall out in clumps) but balding is rare in women.  They should put hair warning labels on testosterone booster supplements IMO, but i'm no Dr.

       Creatine also increases production of DHT - but as far as I know DHT doesn't cause Male pattern baldness, it just speeds it up. So if you were never going to go bald, increasing DHT won't have an impact

       I'm not sure why that guy linked it to service industry employment, but I do think people wear ball caps a lot more often than they used to, and all day long. I'm not that old but growing up people took their hats off indoors, at school, to eat...

       true. but rather doubt that to be the significant cause. maybe a combination of acceptance and hats...but i'm skeptical

       Sugar is an inflammatory. Go to countries where they don't eat so much processed sugar &amp; voila......very small amount of men are bald.

       I don't disagree with you, but i'll put it another way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all older males in my family have had extreme balding on both sides of my parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was in my early twenties i was young &amp; uneducated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I travelled to many foreign countries &amp; was shocked how little people ate during the day &amp; how unprocessed it was. People didn't gobble candy bars &amp; lots of bread.....so I tried to emulate it &amp; voila my super receding hairline &amp; semi balding spot grew in thick.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't happen over a few weeks. Probably around a 1 1/2 years &amp; it the diet made me feel more energetic as well so I have ate that diet now for 90% of every week.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am now 2 decades later with more hair than I had in my early 20's.

      <p>
       No it does not.  DHT, not testosterone by itself, leads to baldness.  Higher testosterone means higher DHT.  This is why men who take steroids lose their hair faster than they otherwise would if they don't take a DHT blocker like finasteride or dutasteride.

       Good answer!
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to add in that DHT results in male pattern baldness only in men who have the receptor on their follicles that responds to DHT. Also, DHT only affects those hairs that have the receptor. Not all follicles do, which explains why men who go bald still tend to have plenty of hair on the sides and back of their head.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, if there's any research into twins with male pattern baldness. You'd think that having identical genes would mean identical hair loss. If there were differences in the amount or rate of hair loss, it should be due to non-genetic (environmental) factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could id a list of things that made hair loss worse, you could reduce or avoid those things. If you had a list of things that reduced hair loss, you could increase or introduce those things and keep more of your hair.

       Baldness is caused by the conversion of testosterone into dihydrogentestosterone (DHT) so it would stand to reason that having less testosterone to convert would reduce your chances of baldness. Probably why women don't go bald except for other reasons.

       Hair loss is absolutely a symptom of low testosterone, as well.  Normally low testosterone males are in poor health and nutritionally deficient and those deficiencies lead to hair loss.

       If it was diet or environmental at all, women would be going bald too. When men go bald and women don't it's genetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until i was like 20, i thought bald men went bald in middle age. Older men were the only ones i saw with visible male pattern baldness (as in, not shaved). Then i learned that the 25 year old men with shaved heads were shaving them
       <em>
        because they were going bald
       </em>
       , i don't know why it never occurred to me, i just thought they didn't like having hair. And there were a lot of them. And my friends were dating them. It was weird. But anyway, no, it's always been common to start balding in your 20s if you've got the MPB gene.

       fair point. perhaps the societal acceptance of a shaved head leads to less men hiding it. thus the perceived prevalence of more younger men that are bald.

       Yeah it's probably a combination of faulty perceptions. my mom's brothers went bald young, and they came of age back in the 50-70s. I already know all my sons will go bald young when they grow up.

       I started going bald in my 20s from MPB, now lost most of it at 34. Iâ€™ve never gone full Bic shave, but it buzz it with the closest beard trimmer. It looks cool and is easy to deal with. My wife likes it and my friends think it just looks like me. I rock a beard as well.  I think there is much more of a stigma now with wearing wigs than there is with being bald.

       i think that can be a factor. steroids do increase DHT which will lead to increased hair loss in males. but I don't think it is a common denominator in the increased (apparent) percentage of young males with hair loss. thanks though!

       Hormonal imbalances caused by exposure to xenoestrogens in plastic, birth control in the water supply, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anecdotally I'm from the Midwest, a small farming community. While I haven't lost my hair I noticed a large amount of my former classmates have. Meanwhile I have moved around the country and not noticed nearly as much male pattern baldness. Because of this I have a suspicion that pesticides and fertilizers could have a part in it. Again, anecdotally I have noticed a large number of people getting cancer where I grew up as well. Could very will be linked.

       If I understand it correctly, the idea is that estrogen modulates receptors as well as conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotestosterone is what makes men grow more hair, have deep voices... And go bald.

       Anecdotally I can tell you people in the midwest are fucking huge. US average male height is supposed to be like 5'9" or some shit, and 1/10 people should be taller than exactly 6'0".
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is I hardly see any men that height on a daily basis, and certainly not 1/10 people. Went to the midwest and everybody is like 6'3".

       Lol, it's funny you should say that because I am also 6'3". When I came to the East Coast I thought everyone was tiny. It's because most of us are Scandinavian in the Midwest and Scandinavians are just bigger in general.

       Beat me too it. The fact that the current generation has the highest amounts of stress causes an increase in chemicals in the body and lower the bodies ability to grow hair.  Can be balanced out with proper stress management and diet and sleep.

       There is a hormone war being waged right now. If youre smart and apparently im not, you will get you a source of dht and hold on to it for dear life. Dht is mans best friend fuck what anyone says otherwise. Testosterone aint shit comoared to dht and id love to hear others comments on that considering i have 10 years plus studying endocrinology amd evwn then i cant fkinf figure out why we fear DHT.

       Women are balding. Statistics on thyroid issues in women are very high. As well as hormonal issues. This isnâ€™t only a mans problem. Women are certainly able to make it look like they have a lot of hair. On the contrary, this goes both ways.

       More medications with male-pattern baldness as a common side effects. More stress in day to day life and the awareness of the world in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the older generation, smoking was often overlooked (But boy was it everywhere) ... sure some people could smoke and keep their hair, but the buildup of toxins from a pack a day habit can destroy your hair or at the very least accelerate your scalps aging process. Exponentially increases when you factor in a stressful lifestyle with inadequate nutrition and sleep hygiene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also maybe more and more men just decide they're going bald a little too early and ax the whole thing and get used to it, rather than deal with a widow's peak or whatever that they may not like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I've got plenty of hair I still worry way too much about losing it. Its kind of like an identity thing, I would assume it would be the same with the folks actually balding ironically enough. The fear of losing something that you feel defines you.

       My opinion it is mostly a circulation issue but inflammation plays a role also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minoxidil works by increasing circulation to the scalp.There is a link between early hairloss and heart disease.Diet and lifestyle play a huge role, the genetic link is overhyped.

       I don't know if it is a geography thing, but where I am, I'm seeing the opposite trend. If anything baldness is disappearing. Many of my friends who have bald fathers/grandfathers are into their 30s and not balding yet. Not even showing signs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both my father and two grandfathers are/were bald. Both my brother and I (31, 32) are not balding or showing signs of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My observations alone led me to believe that MPB or baldness in general might be something from a previous generation. Of course it still exists, but I don't think it is as common as it was in the boomer generation.

       Is there any evidence that this is actually the case? Or are you just thinking that you see more bald, young people? My personal experience is counter to yours.

       it's purely anecdotal. also, it is much more acceptable for men to sport a shaved head look nowadays. so that could be adding to my perception

       Yeah it's probably a combination of faulty perceptions. my mom's brothers went bald young, and they came of age back in the 50-70s. I already know all my sons will go bald young when they grow up.
