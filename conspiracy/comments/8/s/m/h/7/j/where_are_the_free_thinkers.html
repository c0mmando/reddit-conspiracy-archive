<p>This is a forum for free thinking and discussing issues which have captured the public’s imagination.    </p>

<p>This forum is for free thinkers.  People who aren’t confined by the politics of an issue or confined by the scope of race, creed, nationality or any other defining characteristic.  They can see through propaganda and question narrative.   Their moral compass is not defined by religion or Hollywood or government.  </p>

<p>So what happened?    </p>

<p>A new policy has been implemented and children are being separated from their parents by the federal government.  Internment camps have been created for the children.   </p>

<p>This is objectively wrong.  It is.  There is no denying it.  It’s wrong yet many on here are defending it.  </p>

<p>“Well, it’s the law.”  or “They’re illegal” or “its better than prison” Says a person whose morality is defined by the government.    </p>

<p>Where are the free thinkers?  This forum used to look past politics.  A forum that used to criticize Guantanamo Bay cannot criticize an internment camp for children?  What happened?    </p>

<p>Under Obama family seperation happened once every “six months to a year.”  Over the past two months there were 2,000 family seperations.  <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna884856">source</a>.   </p>

<p>Article written from the senate report in 2016. Thousands of children were misplaced by the Department of HHS and given to human traffickers. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Majority%20&amp;amp;%20Minority%20Staff%20Report%20-%20Protecting%20Unaccompanied%20Alien%20Children%20from%20Trafficking%20and%20Other%20Abuses%202016-01-282.pdf">https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Majority%20&amp;amp;%20Minority%20Staff%20Report%20-%20Protecting%20Unaccompanied%20Alien%20Children%20from%20Trafficking%20and%20Other%20Abuses%202016-01-282.pdf</a></p>

<p>The majority of the children in the “detention centers” are victims of human trafficking. The DOJ has been separating all the children and collect DNA samples to confirm who the parents are. According the the HHS Secretary on Monday at a press conference, more then 4/5 children are victims of trafficking. </p>

<p>Wonder if this is related. </p>

<p>Are you refuting the argument or just upset it doesn’t have the usual MSM resist bias? </p>

<p>Considering Republicans control the House, senate, White House and Supreme Court, the only place to find out what’s actually happening is on “far right” media. </p>

<p>For example: the comey investigation, the Clinton Foundation investigation, leak investigations, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am glad.  However (as a conspiracy theorist) it makes you wonder, why did Donald Trump publicly state multiple times that he couldn’t do anything about it without the Democrats?  Obviously some people (like u/IanPhlegming) ate that up and immediately accepted the narrative.  Yet here we are.  </p>

<p>This could’ve been resolved with a single signature, but Trump decided to first convince the gullible that it was someone else’s fault.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The parents broke the law by entering illegally. They are in jail. They have claimed asylum which means that the cannot be deported until and unless their asylum claim is denied.  So what do we do in the meantime?  We are not going to release these children on their own into the US without a legal guardian, we are not going to deport them without their parents and we are not going to put them in jail with their parents.  So the children are housed separately, temporarily, until their parents asylum status is determined.  I don&#39;t see how that is disproportionate.</p>

<p>I completely disagree.  Selective enforcement of laws is one of the biggest problems with our justice system.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s inhumane about it?  CPS takes children from their families if their parents break the law and are arrested.  It&#39;s not inhumane then.  The only difference here is that these children are a political football for the Democrats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not losing their children.  They are housed separately because the parents are in jail.  When their asylum processing is completed, they will either be released into the US, together, or deported, together.  If you think they should be housed together in some sort of detention facility until the asylum process is complete, I think that would be better than the current situation as well, and I hope Trump signs an EO that does it.  However, the Democrats don&#39;t want that.  They may say they do, but what they really want is &quot;catch and release&quot;.  Both bills they have put forward recently have contained language stating that illegal aliens crossing with children should not be detained at all.  A &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card, basically.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the policy of separating asylum seekers/illegal migrants from their children is meant as a strong deterrent.  It is supposed to deter them from jumping borders.  They will tell their friends and family so they will think twice before crossing a border.  Parents hate to be separated from their children, and vice versa.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but my opinion is that until the core issue is fixed, there is a moral obligation to accept the people that show up (who has valid reasons).  If the welfare systems can&#39;t handle that then they have to be expanded.

Most people want to work and do something meaningful, so simply train them. It&#39;s only political will lacking.</p>
