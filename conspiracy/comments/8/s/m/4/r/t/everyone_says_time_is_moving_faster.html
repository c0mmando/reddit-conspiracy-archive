      <p>
       I'm sure you hear this all the time: where did the day go? Time is moving so fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       My father has been working for over 50 years and says that time is far faster now than ever before. He says that even young children with whom he works also say that it feels like everything is moving fast, and it never used to be this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The psychological explanation for it is that as we grow older, there's less big events or new things in our lives so not as much demarcates our days.  Some people blame technology, as there is science that shows that memory is not engaged as strongly via cellphone use.
      </p>
      <p>
       But personally, I think the truth is being hidden from us by scientists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assert that time is indeed going faster, and Physicists know it. Something is going on in space, with Earth's relative magnetic pull and balance, that is affecting how time passes. It could be as simple as our galaxy near a black hole, the ever so slight gravitational pull messing with our perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a colony of animals is threatened by changes to the environment, the animals react in an instinctual and coordinated fashion. Birds sense the change in weather and migrate. Flowers bud and bloom when the sun has shifted.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are animals. What if this collective sense of "time is moving fast" and the associated existential anxiety and dread is an instinctual Alarm System built into our genetics that some grand cosmic shift, about which we have not been told or are currently incapable of knowing, is occurring?

       There are NOT galaxy sized blackholes, you link is talking about a SMBH, which are at the center of lots of galaxies.  it's trillions of times smaller than the galaxy itself.

       It doesn't work like that. Your own perception of time doesn't change.

       See, they say that, but humans have two very potent magnets, their brains and their hearts. If there is a magnetic force powerful enough to affect a planet, surely it's going to affect what's on the surface as well.

       Your own perception of time could change as you get older. Is it possible that when you're 5 years old, 1 year is a 5th of the time you've been alive so it seems longer than when you're 60 and it's only 1/60th of you life?

       I believe it’s due to the prevalance of near light speed communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you consider Einstein’s special relativity and the fact that there are inertial reference frames being blasted all around us, it makes sense that time dilation would be occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I ask people I think would know the answer, I’m told that light doesn’t follow the same rules.

       I’m only a mech engineer, not a theoretical physicist but I am convinced this is what’s happening.

       As you get older time does seem to go by faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a kid summers seemed to last forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are 60+ summers go by quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed this and I think I know why.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are six years old, a summer is .04 % of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you are sixty years old, summers are .004 % of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a difference in magnitude of 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       So relative to ones experience, days, weeks, months, years all seem shorter as you get older because a unit of time is considerably smaller in relation to your age.

       I think the psychological explanation you gave is true and I don't know how children could tell now, that children few years ago percieved time as moving less fast. They couldn't know, so it's basically only that what people always experienced while growing older. (time passes faster the older you get) Old hat! What the kids today say doesnt't count since they can't compare. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like that I have a philosophical approach at hand as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       In physics it is known, that matter/ gravity slows down/ stretches time. If you fly away from earth in a spaceship, time will pass faster for you than for people on earth (when you come back, people on Earth aged more than you did)
Children are more connected to the world. Adults lose the connection to the world. One could say, children are closer to the world, thus they percieve time as moving slow. They experience life while we are only alive. In a spiritual way, we move away from this world, ever more the older we get and maybe this has for some reason the same effect as physically moving away from the planet, we percieve time as runing faster.

      <p>
       Other way around, time passes slower the farther from the core you get. Think of time like a waveform; the stronger the gravity is, the more compressed the waveform becomes.  Living on earth, you actally age slightly slower living at altitude because the gravity is slightly weaker than sea level.
      </p>
      <p>
       That leads to an interesting theory:  there's been an increase in gravitational forces either from the earth itself or an approaching astronomical body.

       There is this growing Earth theory, so that would make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It says something like the sun is sending a constant stream of tachyons to Earth and those tachyons, when reaching earths core will create new mass. Tachyons are hypothetical massless particles. The theory states that it might be possible, that the magnetic core of earth might be able to catch them and some physicall process could turn them into matter, which would cause the Earth to grow from the inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is even some pretty neat evidence, that Earth is indeed growing, ever since.

       humans create an equivalent amount of data to that held in the u.s. library of congress daily. the collected wisdom and records of hundreds of years can be stacked up to the same b.s. we pump out hour on hour, by volume.

       bees use the perceived speed differences between objects to understand their distance from those objects. like bees, perspective allows us to judge our temporal distance from other moments in our lives. well the tach just hit warp drive and our hundreds-of-thousands-of-years-old brains just can't process it in any other way than to tell us time is moving faster.

       I think you are legitimately on to something here. My job is very people-oriented and almost everyone I speak to has the notion that time is going faster. Young, old, unemployed, 9-5ers. Everyone. I don't think the dismissive skeptic crowd are right when they say 'oh it's just due to getting older'. It's young people just as much as old people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets really interesting although, because I read in a book a few months back that the Mayans claimed that as the 5th sun came to an end everyone's perception of time would speed up. Apparently it is due to the magnetic influence of the sun, symptoms of an upcoming solar change.
      </p>
      <p>
       So currently, we have rumours from ancient civilisations (Mayan, Hindu) that the current age is about to change, we have astrology saying the age is changing (Pisces to Aquarius), we have consistent signs of impending solar activity. And then on top of all of this we have an ancient civilisation (that had a memory of 4 of these events) telling us that everyone's perception of time will speed up the closer it gets to the event. Connect the dots guys.

       Count me in as someone who thinks that time feels faster, but how do you explain something like me cooking an old recipe I have (~40-odd years old) and it still turning out perfectly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooking is one of those things where you don't get the same results jacking up the temperature and decreasing the duration of exposure.  A frozen pizza that needs 20 minutes at 400F won't cook right at 500F for 15 minutes.

       If its relativistic time increase, how would we notice time was faster?

       I would guess that you're thinking about time too literally when it comes to pizza in an oven. What's really "speeding up" is everyone perception of time.

       Well if you want to start going there.. what exactly is time? Is it an actual
       <em>
        thing

       or is just the way our brain organizes our experiences in the universe? Is time nothing but a perception within each of our minds, I always wonder, does an hour for me feel the same as an hour to you?

       I think you have to start getting into some metaphysics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Time, at least right now, is mostly measured as "the number of cycles of radiation corresponding to the transition between two energy levels of the caesium-133 atom."  So it actually corresponds to an actual physical phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       For us to experience this phenomenon as faster or slower without a change in the measure of the physical phenomenon (ie, something other than 9,192,631,770 cycles of radiation in a cesium atom)
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       for this experience to be something other than a specific psychological experience unique to an individual would mean that the part of us that experiences time would somehow be
       <em>
        outside
       </em>
       the physical phenomenon of time, since our brains are subject to the same rules of atomic physics as an atomic clock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which would imply that our consciousness that experiences time is not part of our brain...

       Revelation 8:10-11 when the 4th Trumpet sounds, the Bible says the sun would not shine for one-third part of the day, the moon would not shine for one-third part of the night. Which seems to teach that the shortening of the days will occur by shortening the time the sun shines and shortening the times the moon shines, which would mean that the length of each day will be shortened.

       If you're talking about feeling like days or years are going by faster, that's just old age.  But i remember very clearly that a second was a longer interval.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember learning at what pace to count "mississippi's" to count seconds (this was important for touch football).  I have vivid memories of watching the schoolroom clock tick down those last few minutes till 3:00, because I did this every day (and so did everyone else).

       Also take into consideration, when you are a child life is full of firsts.... time goes slow because it is new up to a certain age. Then the switch flips and time seems to speed by. As an adult your "firsts" are a lot more few and far between.

       I think time is moving faster because we live in a digitised society that values increasing productivity and decreasing time allotted to thinking, relaxation and unplugging. Even if you personally don't spent that much time online or with the distractions, the culture is so imbibed with it that time still feels faster. Commutes take longer because you have more people and more traffic, and there you go, an hour or more gone, boom. Billboards everywhere with information to subconsciously take in, more money problems for everyone to worry about, even with kids from babyhood they're taught to multitask and switch between activities more quickly (at least the ones I interact with).
      </p>
      <p>
       My summer job involves going on a lot of hikes in the middle of nowhere with no people and no phone connection. Time definitely feels slower when you pull out of society like that.

       Let me spit in low IQ what this basically says. Earth has a frequency it gives off, we can read this and scale it. Apparently its increased in the last 20 years , it does fluctuate but its at a high right now. Some say we humans pick up on this frequency. Some also say we humans are tapped into this frequency and as a whole body somewhat direct its level. The more minds connected the more power we have over it. The internet came out big time about 30 years ago, and 9/11 about 20 years ago put all our minds together sub consciously as we worry for the future as a animal together. The higher that number the faster time seems to go apparently.

       We are literally moving faster through space, precession is actually speeding up. There's evidence that our solar system is in a binary orbit, with something, and that we are currently heading towards perihelion. My theory is that it's a solar mass black hole.

       a persons internal clock slows down so time seems faster.

       second perception is a major clue, when you are young its one thousand two thousand counting seconds off, years down the road its one two three four.

       When your bored, and working, time goes slow. When your  constantly stimulated, time goes fast. That’s all it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you have to wait an hour with nothing to do it’s not pleasent.
      </p>

       When you have four 15min intervals to watch or do shit online, it goes by like nothing.
