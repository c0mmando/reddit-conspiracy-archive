       The real reason? Human rights issue that is a win/win for everyone involved. Pharma and oil win with new patents. Populace wins with a nice fade. New revenue for the govt. everybody wins.

       I think ultimately black market dealers win too. The taxes in Nevada (havent purchased anywhere else yet) made me realize id be better off finding the people I used to find when it was verboten. The average local street dealer will appeal to people in terms of price and can even appeal to some as an alternative to the man selling weed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said last time I was in California I went to an old friend so I have no frame of reference but in Nevada I see a one shot tourist market and anyone with any common sense going to craigslist to avoid having their drivers license recorded and paying a ridiculous price for weed

       Do what I do, learn to make all the weed derivative products that are so popular yourself and sell those for all under market rate. I used to grow my own before I had a kid, but now I get $100 zips of shake from a guy I know and turn it into around $500 of canna caps and vape pen cartridges.

       Around here (D.C.), cartridges usually go for around $50 - $60/.5 gram. I'll usually sell homemade carts to my friends for $40/.5 gram. That being said the stuff you buy in a store here is obviously of higher quality, not stronger though, just better tasting. Usually if I don't fuck it up I can consistently get between 7.5 and 8.5 grams of extract per ounce that I then mix with EJ Mix, which is the stuff that keeps the extract stable and liquid so it can be Vaped. That adds some volume so I end up with enough for around 10 carts, maybe more? I do this more as a hobby and way to fund my weed habit while also helping out friends by getting them cheaper products, so I haven't ever really run any hard numbers.

       I actually use everclear to do extraction for the vape carts. For the canna caps I just decarb the flower and then heat it in a mixture of coconut oil and sunflower lecithin. Strain out the flower and use a blunt tip syringe to fill some empty capsuls and presto. I also have a heated press to do the Rosin method but my results are too inconsistent for me to steadily profit from it. Much safer than trying to do bho at home.

       thats awesome! Thanks for replying!

      <p>
       How do you market your product?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to do things like this for extra cash but it can be hard in a legal state because i got the big boys to compete with, but i am sure it wouldnt be hard to sell some on the side? Either way i love the cannabis industry and i learn new things every day

       We use to say if here in Colorado , then one day that if became reality , I remember the day it was announced here I felt an odd surreal sense of satisfaction, accomplishment and relief . I use to rally for the legalization on the stairs of the state capital with many others ,years before it became a reality . Now I can grow my own and live a normal paranoia of going to prison free life .

       You have a point. In Oregon, used to be when you were pulled over high or with weed you'd get a citation and they'd confiscate your drugs and paraphernalia. Sounds bad enough but now that it's legal, if you're suspected of smoking and driving they treat it like DUII and give the infamous Field Sobriety Test (that sober people have failed) to determine if you're unfit to drive. At that point you're at the mercy of the police officer and if they declare you unfit for driving you're arrested for DUII. They can also use a urine test to determine if marijuana is in your system, the limit is so miniscule that a regular smoker will fail even if they haven't smoked that day whatsoever. I've heard of it going both ways though. Some officers will do everything in their power to make an arrest, others will be reasonable with you and cut you a break. Either way, I am rather careful about my habits now.

       Government stands to make a lot of money on legal marijuana, like many others. It's interesting who stands to lose on legal marijuana - the judicial system. At the same time prisons are filling up and population isn't going down so maybe it's a nice compromise; the end of a long term plan?

       End Times.  Yup, hell is freezing over.  Wormwood is back in our solar system.  Sunrise ENE, sunset NW.  Not normal!  Powers that be probably just want to chill out and placate the masses.  Keep us relaxed and easier to manage, so we don't organize, bear arms, join an insurrection or become too much of a threat.  Colorado -- Denver -- is going to be the seat of the new US government when DC floods and is underwater.  Denver will be the new US Capitol.

       As for Canada, their plan is to throw open their borders to invite tens of millions of climate refugees from the developing world, courtesy of the highly secretive TPP - Trans Pacific Partnership.  Trump wisely pulled out of TPP.  Trudeau is still in.  Having cannabis legal in Canada will soothe and placate the masses of Canadians who won't be too thrilled when millions of undocumented climate refugees show up.  My 0.02c.

       Um. You do know that today is the summer solstice right? The sun being higher in latitude is normal, how else do you think the arctic gets the midnight sunlight it gets every single year and has for all of history?

       Yes, I'm aware.  Still, the azimuth is over 30 degrees off.  Canada has a border with the US at the 49th parallel latitude.  Sun is rising and setting much further north than this.  Not normal at all!  And our weather here has been crazy.  On some days, the sun is nearly directly overhead, and some provinces have been setting temperature records.  Also, the sun is no longer yellow and round to our eye.  It's white and streaky.  Not normal.  Definitely a Poleshift soon.  Don't expect any kind of warning or announcement, that's for certain!

       It seems to be one of those things that people don't notice until someone points it out.  Have you noticed chemtrail global dimming fog blocking our view of sunrise and sunset near cities?  Most people seem to need it pointed out to them before they notice.  Redpilled, if you will.  Most people lack critical thinking.

       I live near a very major airport. Sunsets every night, even when it's been cloudy all day. It dips below the clouds and lights up the evening. Costal life. I haven't seen anything alarming regarding the sun or anything nearby. I've done my due diligence when it comes to both chemtrails and any possibility of major eliptical orbit based celestial bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say chemtrails are a possibility and have definitely seen enough sunny prairie days cloud over after enough planes go by. Nibiru, I haven't anything substantial enough to say it's anywhere near if it does exist at all. You need to remember theres millions of amature astronomers and even more camera owners with sun filters. If something gigantic was out there no one could keep it quiet. No one.

       I don't understand this realm of thinking. Where have you been since 1996 when grassroots initiative in California created the nations first medically legal cannabis state? That's really what got the ball rolling, and it's taken 22 years of addition
       <em>
        grass roots effort
       </em>
       to get us this much farther.  Tens of millions of people have been fighting for this for many decades. Organic, human lead movements based on progressive thinking are a thing, ya know? That's what you are witnessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's infinitesimally better for society than turning 1/3 of the country into criminals for something with so many benefits. We're talking about much more than something that just gets you high. Cannabis has over 50,000 uses.

       When it comes to state level ballot initiatives, the people literally vote to make that happen. Legalization today is driven by corporate greed to grab hold of that new revenue stream, but the first steps were legitimately made with real grassroots movents.

       Yes, man, it's a grassroots movement led by hard-working people who see something wrong and wish to change it. I've been a part of this movement for a long time. It's better to tax and regulate it. I go to "recreational" weed stores almost daily here in Colorado. The tax revenue is good... it's not like that money goes to government officials' pockets, you realize.

       Grassroots movements also ended segregation, gave women the right to vote and produced the modest workers' rights that exist today.

       The conspiracy here is the influence of the US on Canadian law. Canada has been looking at legalization since the late 1960s. I think it would have happened much sooner without US interference. How exactly the US interfered, I don't know. That would be a good topic for some research.

       The guys that are set to make the most are the ones that have been preparing for this for a while, and they have.  They suppressed as long as it took to get the majority to say yes.  We live in a corporatocracy right?  Those guys control the laws, the ones that matter anyway.  Too many mom and pops making too much money off of weed.  Gotta take that income out of the peoples hands and put it into their pockets.  There will be good and bad that comes with it, like everything.

       It is my understanding that the huge pot market will continue to be watered down by the mass production in all of the west coast states.  To think that the track and trace programs will keep the product out of the black market is absurd.  Here is the trick: Switch out your mass produced crap grown illegally for the good stuff.  The crap will be written off as a loss and "destroyed" not really, because it will be used to make concentrate.  The good stuff goes onto the black market and gets top dollar in other states and the profits come in.  There are no longer profits to be made on the west coast unless you have an out of state connection.  How much longer will these connections remain viable as the push for legalization is countrywide continuing to push prices down down down until only corporations can profit.  This will in turn create a massive pot crash which is in the process now which will facilitate more wealth consolidation up to the top of the pyramid.  Cannabis was suppressed for such a long time for this exact purpose.  Watch how all of this will tie into the next big crash in this country.  This is obviously all my opinion and a wait and see.

       The drugs were used as a means of control against any political or social challenge. You can find the quote from the Nixon administration dude where he says that they tried to associate the blacks with pot as a means to keep down the black power movement.

       You're right that tides are turning, a clear majority wants to end prohibition now. There's never been so much support for ending it since it started.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not why this is happening. We don't live in a democracy it doesn't matter how many people want something. For example, an even greater majority of people wants "common sense" gun control reforms like universal background checks. But we don't get it. Because the people with money don't want that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll end cannabis prohibition ultimately, but it's not because the people want it. It's because the money wants it.

       I'm Canada it was decriminalized in 2003. They stopped finding people guilty of any possession under 30 grams.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like this legalization is two fold. First off rape the citizens of even more money that will be corruptly spend to friends and families of politicians. The second aspect is a massive crackdown on driving while stoned. This is the scarier aspect. They are granting unlimited roadside search rights to police. The are eliminating probably cause for roadside search. They are also going ahead with the unproven saliva test. So now every single car that gets pulled over can and most likely will get a mouth swab.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems like they are legalizing marijuana when in fact they are monetizing for themselves while simultaneously increasing the amount of arrest and prosecutions made because of the new unscientific roadside saliva test.

       Four plants per household will be legal, but individual provinces will have the right to override that part of the law.  So far, two of the ten provinces (QuÃ©bec and Manitoba) have said they will ban home growing.

       If you want the sinister conspiratorial explanation, by legalizing it, more people will find it to be acceptable, and the number of people consuming it increases. This promotes a more passive populace, and reduces resistance to future government policies, which are ultimately decided by corporations (in the case of Canada, this is primarily resource extraction for the purposes of raw export, ensuring no civilian economy exists. Call it 'soft-slavery'.

       I think it is generational.  I've read before that Boomers are fixated and principle.  GenX'ers are fixated on pragmatism.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Boomers legalization is capitulation on the War on Drugs and Boomers
       <em>
        do not capitulate
       </em>
       on anything.

       Now that they're all fucking off to their retirement pads paid for by their grandchildren's college debt and what not, GenX'ers are taking over and they're far more likely look for reasons beyond 'It's the LAW' for something to be illegal.

       I think it's that Colorado exercising it's constitutional states rights showed that ending cannabis prohibition was a revenue stream that hasn't been tapped by corporations yet. There's "legitimate" money backing the movement now, so it's picking up steam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The long term plan is corporations making profits. When cannabis is prohibited, only the black market can profit. With prohibition ended, massive corporations will get all the profit.

Donâ€™t be so paranoid you canâ€™t recognize victory when you see it.

       My opinion itâ€™s the insurance companies behind it. They will use driving under the influence of pot and people growing it at home to raise insurance costs and make even more money

       It's the new way to make you complacent.  If we smoke enough pot nobody will pay attention to what the government is really doing.  Society doesn't need lots of workers any more and if we all just smoke pot we won't care when they send us to the tent cities as long as we have reefer and Doritos there.

       The bottom line is prohibition only makes drugs more potent and creates black markets/cartels. Nobody wants cartels and the best way to eliminate them is to legalize drugs in general. Of course no major government in their right mind is going to do that in this day in age so the best way to ease into future is to normalize drug use over time, starting with weed. I personally hope mushrooms come next.

       It's being legalized by smart governments because it's a harmless drug when used in moderation. I read a poll in Canada that had over 68% people wanted it either decriminalized or legalized. Lots of people use pot, eventually the people vote someone in that says they will legalize it, it was part of Trudeau's election platform so it's nice to see a politician keeping a promise.

       Four plants per household will be legal, but individual provinces will have the right to override that part of the law.  So far, two of the ten provinces (QuÃ©bec and Manitoba) have said they will ban home growing.

       I've been from one coast to the other in the last week. Seen many a sun rise and sun set.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lived in Canada my whole life, nothing appears different beyond a couple degrees hotter than usual for this time of year; but then it ain't like the prairies and the Okanogan haven't gone through heatwaves before.

       You're... I guess seeing things, or something. I don't want to be insulting but my immediate thought was "nuts."
