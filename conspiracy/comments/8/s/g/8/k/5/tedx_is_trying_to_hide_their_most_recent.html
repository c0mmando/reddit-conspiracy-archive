       Oh trust me, there's a lot of gaslighting here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are actual people out there with limited resources, building case-files, asking questions, searching communities, building search parties- etc. Investigators... detectives... people who actually dedicate their lives to saving any child who may be in danger of being harmed or exploited, who have to sit down and infiltrate those illegal spaces-
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember reading the book "One Child At Time" years ago, even before I ever discovered reddit or r/conspiracy, and the book details what it means to have a job as an officer who actually dedicates their livelihood to stopping pedophiles who are exploiting children and saving those who are currently victimized... It's not "exciting" &amp; it's not a conspiracy... it's real fucking life. They see horrible images and it's just.. it's not a plaything. It's really not.
      </p>
      <p>
       but somehow gabbing about the fact that it's happening and saturating this particular forum and our minds day in, day out, is doing something.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is out here encouraging people to volunteer for neighborhood watch, or to check their regional registered list of sex offenders- not sharing a patreon for someone actually doing investigation into these matters- no... I don't see any of that... because at this point somehow they believe we still are not aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just... I'm over this very serious, very emotionally draining and demanding topic being used as just another headline, just something else for clicks.... sorry for the rant. I'm just done with the bullshit. I'm over it.

       Are you serious? Did you not see the countless posts on Tucson and people supporting the people who claim to actually be out  there on the ground, trying to make a difference? Tons of people encouraging donations (of supplies, not money) to their cause and what not.

       Good points. One day I was driving past a school by my house, at the worst time because school had just gotten out. Anyway, I see this man pulling along this little girl, around 12, and just had a sense that she was uncomfortable. So I turn off my turn signal I had on and start heading over to him but I'm blocked in by school traffic. The guy sees me staring at him trying to get to him and runs off. All of this happening a block away from this expensive catholic school and none of the parents/ teachers notice a thing. I mean, I wouldn't expect many parents to notice as they were focused on picking up their kids, but none of them? Anyway, it's too bad that nobody driving would give me any space (not that they knew what I was doing) because the guy got away and read in the news the same guy raped a woman later that night. The other crazy thing is the police just reported the incident as stalking, I would have thought attempted kid napping and/or attempted rape because he was trying to bring her to his van.

       I'd like to know how this was allowed in the first place. They should fucking own up, I have no doubt they signed off on this garbage. They put their name to it. Unless they can show that these talks are solely self-regulated and they had no knowledge of it they need to own up that they are pushing this garbage, as they have been pushing plenty of unscientific social justice garbage for years now.

       Okay. I’m with you so far. Their response could be better. I would rather they address it than cover up. But isn’t removing the talk better than leaving it up?

       I’m no expert on the program but right from their home page:

       Discredited?  By who?  TED has a reputation for hosting some rediculous shit, leading to parody.

       TEDx is different than a regular TED conference. It’s not overseen the same way. A private entity decides they’d like to host a TED talk and puts it on. TED does not screen the talks.

       More than that, it's not just "against feminism", it's also having the cultural knowledge of what type of person would be so angry about the wimmen that they spend their time online mocking them. For what it's worth I doubt most of the people posting there are neo Nazis, but it's the sort of place that would attract that crowd, and is just toxic in general

       You can define those terms such as to answer "yes" or "no" depending on what you want. I'm not interested into getting into yet another semantics discussion online where we probably don't really disagree anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was that someone who holds... Unsavory views about minorities and women are likely to go express them online among communities such as the ones above that will validate their views. Not that those communities are themselves Nazis, racist, or sexist, but that they are where those people are nevertheless likely to participate online

       It's propaganda to claim they were left wing, let's ask Hitler what he thinks about the left and right:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There are only two possibilities in Germany; do not imagine that the people will forever go with the middle party, the party of compromises; one day it will turn to those who have most consistently foretold the coming ruin and have sought to dissociate themselves from it. And that party is either
        <strong>
         the Left: and then God help us! for it will lead us to complete destruction - to Bolshevism, or else it is a party of the Right which at the last, when the people is in utter despair, when it has lost all its spirit and has no longer any faith in anything, is determined for its part ruthlessly to seize the reins of power - that is the beginning of resistance of which I spoke a few minutes ago.
        </strong>
        Here, too, there can be no compromise - there are only two possibilities: either victory of the Aryan, or annihilation of the Aryan and the victory of the Jew.

       Nothing says "I hate capitalism and I'm a leftist" quite like imprisoning and murdering all the leftists and trade union bosses and then banning unions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler turned the leftists of Germany (the not-national-just-regular socialists, the communists, trade union leaders) into slave labour for companies like Krupp or Hugo Boss.

       That's just the economic side, ignoring the extreme nationalism and traditionalism (to the point of removing women from the work force) and most importantly the fact they were pro-hierarchy and pro-private property, which are the common characteristics of all right-wing ideologies and mutually exclusive with left wing ideologies.

      <p>
       That's completely ridiculous. No society can function without hierarchies. Are you going to try and tell me Stalin didn't have hierarchies? Hitler murdered rivals, just like Stalin did. At least leftists admit Stalin was far leftist. The only difference between Hitler and Stalin is that Hitler kept around the bosses when he nationalized everything, and Stalin killed off the bosses and put his own buddies in control. It's a difference without a difference. Hitler kept the upper crust, Stalin created a new upper crust. Either way, they had privileged people.

       Don't talk to me about leftist idealism. They always talk about classless societies (whether it's a cynical power-grab or they really believe it), but it can't work that like, and it
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       turns into authoritarianism with a privileged class. See Venezuela for the latest example.

       There are social norms, though, that usually aim to resolve such matters. Those norms change over time, no doubt, but as far as we're concerned in a civilized society today, pedophilia isn't ok.

       I would say that "society" is an entity unto itself, and has its own perspective and POV.   It is a thing which is greater than the sum of its pieces, and is a thing which can have various degrees of health and can be strong or can be corrupt... in other words, it has many of the attributes we give to living things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society's POV is still subjective, though.  What may be good for "society" may be bad for a specific individual, again, because it depends on perspective.  Thinking about it as an entity, with its own POV, and its own motives is useful when that society prevents me (or
       <em>
        tries
       </em>
       to prevent me) from doing things I personally might think are good.

       "good" and "bad" can be easily defined as social and antisocial behavior.  It is very, VERY easy to sort actions into either of these two categories.  There may be argument over differences between morals based on religions, or societal norms, but social/antisocial is extremely clear-cut.

       Although I might wish that reality did not depend on the observer, I cannot.  Such a wish would not match what I have observed and perceived.

       The origin of the disease is a mystery for the time being. It's not chosen. It's literally the worst social/sexual problem one could have. I'd rather have breasts and a penis. At least I wouldn't instantly be seen as a monster to almost everyone without doing anything wrong, even while doing the best possible in the situation, and remaining all alone throughout life.

       What bothers me is that it could have happened to any of us if it is not derived from choice. It's not like we'd tell anyone it happened either. It's a rather crappy card to have in the deck of life. It's like being seen as bad as a murderer without ever committing murder.

       Maybe it's a genetic mod by space bullies that want to laugh at others in misery. It works just great for generating fear and suffering. Maybe it's part of a suite of misery modifications they made to us in order to farm our emotional energy.

       These beings are no joke. They are often called demons, but they are much more weak, cowardly and juvenile than they appear or get credit for in myths. They feel powerless to other bullies and then, instead of confronting them, they end up serving them. They bend to fear and pain and fall for reward and then end up making up the loss of emotional energy and alleviatinf the feeling of powerlessness by making others feel the same way, powerless and drained by fear and pain. They displace their emotional energy of correction created by their oppressors onto new victims and in doing so serve their oppressors.
      </p>
      <p>
       These beings are running this planet secretly through our elites. They do it for the emotional energy and for reproduction of their demonic life cycle. They want to convert us into them after a long period of abusive experiences. Ideally, we blame what we cannot change and/or life itself for our poor situation, not the disease that covertly brought it. As we perceive that life sucks, we become an agent making it suck. We become them, if we fall too far in emotional states for too long. They create the problem on purpose. God damn them and ALL of their knowing supporters!

       The problem that none of you notice is that you focus on the “intellectual philosophy” of the occurrence more than the occurrence itself. The focus moves away from pedophilia as it is and onto isms like “relativity”, when that shouldn’t matter too much in the first place unless you’re writing a thesis. I wonder if it’s a psychological trick.

       Then by that definition literally every single thing is natural and redundant. The use of natural, in this instance, is not to imply that it naturally occurs--the discussion isn't about the animal kingdom, it is that it is something normal, prevelant and unavoidable which is incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like they acknowledge that they allowed it to happen instead of trying to scrub it from the net only because there is such a backlash on it. This is just my opinion, but they likely allowed it thinking it was 'progressive' and a good idea, instead the backlash showed them society does not accept this and want to play dumb.

       Pedophilia is not a natural sexual orientation. It can be removed through emotional issues just the same as beating a woman during sex is not a fucking fetish. Just because you try and normalize something does not make it natural or acceptable. Both can be combatted and overcome by the individual in society. Part of that comes from accepting it rather than hiding it, but this is not what this is it's a sympathy party to feel bad for them and accept it as is 'oh well, it's natural we just have to deal with it'. No, that's bullshit.

       Psychopathy also occurs "naturally" in that people are born that way.  Just because people are born that way doesn't make it natural either.  People are also born with different kinds of mutations and retardation and I wouldn't call that normal.  I would call that a product of toxicity or malnutrition.  I don't think a natural occurrence would cause so much damage as a pedophile would cause if he practices his sexuality.  So is pedophilia some kind of genetic mutation or something like that?

       Chromosome abnormalities are not caused by malnutrition (although of course that can lead to many other problems including retardation). They can be caused by toxicity, such as exposure to insecticides, but in most cases, they just happen, and always have. It is very natural.

       I think there needs to be better distinction between: natural, normal, and acceptable/desirable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it natural for little boys to get in playground fights?  Absolutely.  Is it normal?  I would say that it's rare for most people, so probably not normal, but it's not super rare.  You could probably argue that it is normal because we all know someone who's done it or seen it happen.  Is it acceptable?  Most people would probably say it's not the best option.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regards to retardation or homosexuality or trans, I think it's definitely within the realm of possibility that some group of people could be dumping stuff in the water or food supply or chemtrails or whatever and changing the likelihood of children becoming retarded, homosexual or trans or whatever.  We should address those factors, but that doesn't mean that the retard/homosexual/trans person is bad, but rather that the actions people are taking that shift the probability curves are bad.

       When I frist got on the internet in 1997 one of the very first conspiracy things I read was this old guy typing his rants about what he called the coming planned downfall of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stages he outlined were
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuality is normalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transgenderism is normalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophilia is normalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bestiality is normalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say what ever you want to about his views on homosexuality, but I find it interesting that just over twenty years later and we are seeing stage 3 begin.

       Actually you should have noticed multiple times she slipped up in the whole pedophilia is just another sexual orientation. An example is when she's talking about pedophiles not being able to visit beaches. I'm a heterosexual man but when I visit beaches, I don't feel the urge to rape all the half naked women around me. That's not a problem for me, like most heterosexual men.

       I'm not following your logic, why can it only be considered a mental illness if it is impossible not to act on?

       A depressed person isn't not mentally ill just because they don't self harm, as an analogy.

       But when you were going through puberty, did you ever worry about getting an erection at the beach because of all the half naked women?  Have you ever chosen not to look at the half naked women, because you might come off as creepy or others in your company might not appreciate your wandering gazes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm definitely not convinced by her arguments that pedophilia is an innate, genetic, sexual preference.  I think there's a lot of socialization type influences that can lead people into a variety of sexual preferences, but once someone is a pedophile does it really matter where it came from?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are totally correct in making the distinction between sexual urges and violating other people sexually.  As a heterosexual man, that doesn't rape people, I feel that we are at a time period, where we acknowledge that not all men are rapists.  We say this in theory, but as a society we are hyper sensitive to any claims of rape or assault and immediately assume that the man is guilty just at the accusation.  We are definitely more likely to assume that the man is a rapist than to assume that the women is lying.  If you go to youtube, you can type in "Metoo" and half the stuff is about the Metoo movement going too far, or being a witch hunt, or non-rapist men trying to protect themselves from being accused, or MGTOW.  As men, as no-rapists, there's plenty of us that are concerned about what could happen to us, even though we've done nothing wrong or harmed anybody, because all it takes is an accusation.  If you're going through a divorce, there's plenty of lawyers that will recommend that the woman try to suggest that you physically harmed her or the kids, because the accusation is so damning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think in both pedophiles and heterosexuals, we need to not punish people who've done nothing wrong, while helping people who are a risk of injuring others to redirect those thoughts in a non-harmful manner.

       I don't believe that genuine pedophiles exist, that pose no risk to children in society. I think those that genuinely want help are suffering from a little know condition called POCD. It's a form of obsessive compulsive disorder, involving the fear of being a pedophile.

       Just out of curiosity, in your mind how do you explain that some heterosexual men like women but don't want to rape them, but that all people who are attracted to kids can't help but rape them.  Whats the difference between the two?

       You stated that heterosexual males are capable of restraining themselves from raping women, but people who are attracted to children are incapable of restraining themselves.

       Perhaps he thinks they are demons that actually chose to have such an inconvenient condition, and therefore are intrinsically evil, actively seeking pleasure from others' pain. Perhaps something somewhere in their development went terribly wrong. Perhaps many of them actually have self-control and care how others feel. Of course, that would not be the case if they are perceived to be demonic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd bet that if the cause and cure were discovered, these demons would be most grateful and happy with the outcome. Perhaps they feel cut off from what others can have to make them happy and have nobody to talk to about it. Good thing for us that they are just demons. We don't have to feel their situation that way. They choose to be parasites on others, didn't they?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        fair to say the Tromovitch view does not represent majority academic opinion. It’s likely, too, that some of the academic protests against the “stigmatisation” of paedophiles are as much a backlash against the harshness of sex offender laws as anything else. Finally, of course, academic inquiry is supposed to question conventional wisdom and to deal rigorously with the evidence, whether or not the conclusions it leads you to are popular.

       Consent to what?? She isn't condoning ANY type of pedophiliac action. But since you clearly are either not going to actually watch the video, or are incapable of comprehending it if you did, my attempt at logic is futile.

       Difference is, if Fox news put something like this up, the entire media establishment wouldn't help them cover it up like they are doing for Ted. THAT is what is being pointed out here. You bringing up that there are also pedos on the right is a strawman argument that nobody made.

       Anyone who believes that pedophilia is a 'normal' sexual orientation needs to have their head knocked around a few times with a dictionary.  It is an abnormal sexual orientation.  If a majority of people were pedophiles then I would cede the point that it is 'normal', but it is not and most likely never will be.

       The funny thing is this is exactly how the media brought out being homosexual and transsexual to be considered normal. You think tedx will be the only ones to do this you’ll start seeing this increasing more in the media. the elites want pedophilia to be a norm but they had to get homosexuality and transsexuals as a norm first so they can start approaching this. None of you can stop it , eventually it’s gonna be considered legal.

       She's suggesting that we can reduce child sexual abuse by not ostracizing pedophiles. It's not difficult to see why this might be the case:
* Pushing it to the underground means they will only find solace with other pedophiles, thus creating networks of abusers.
* Pedophiles are less likely to seek council and advice from people who will actually give them good advice, for fear of backlash.
* They are less likely to care about what society thinks of them when they are preemptively ostracized. Less to lose so more likely to commit abuse.
A lot of you are reacting like she is actually encouraging sexual abuse.

       There's friends and family, online support groups, etc. Being able to hear a friend out when they open up to you about that, and let them know its going to be okay and that you'll love and support them no matter what, and helping them to get the medical help they need, is possibly the difference between them hurting someone and them getting the help they need.

       you realize there are people who are attracted to kids who dont assault them or seek porn of it online? this opinion is so extreme. im not sure anyone chooses to be attracted to kids, but saying dumb shit like this makes it impossible to reach out for help. pedophilia is a problem but how is "let them die" your solution?

       There can be no tolerance whatsoever for pedophilia in a just society, and it boggles my mind that there are people like you who would defend them.  Pedophiles are monsters, full stop.  Even if you don't think they should be locked up for crimes, surely you can see that they should be institutionalized for their dangerous insanity, just as we do in other cases of extreme mental illness.

       Yes if someone is dangerous they should be incarcerated.

       The problem is not all pedophiles are child abusers. Not all pedophiles consume child pornography. Think of them like gay catholics, some want help but the climate you're in favour of only drives them underground and probably contributes to child abuse.

       I've been on the anti-pedo train for a while now, but your take is ridiculous.  With any taboo subject, the amount of people who are a danger to other people, is smaller than the amount of people who are attracted to the taboo or fetish.  Most humans can filter their thoughts enough to prevent harming other people.  By your standards everyone could be locked up, because we all have thoughts that are inappropriate float throughour heads, whether they're our own, empathically received from others, or implanted from one of the many mind control technologies out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Punish the people for the things they do wrong, but not the thoughts they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm totally fine with setting up stings to determine who's actually a danger to other people.

      <p>
       And not all child abusers are pedophiles. There are rapists and molesters out there who do not fantasize about children and seek them out. But if the opportunity to abuse one comes up, they will take it, just as they would happily rape an unconscious woman or the smaller man who is their cell mate in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the issue in our messed-up world: we have pedophiles who do not hurt children and nonpedophiles who do.

       I think it's kind of like physically abusing your kid. If that kid grows up and doesn't get the proper help they needed to recover from the trauma, they'll probably have a kid and treat them how his/her parent treated them.

       Really though, if you like little children and you yourself are a full grown adult, that’s wrong. So you’re brains all fucked, and you should receive treatment to either help fix this issue, or be locked away because of your dangerous and toxic thoughts of being with a child sexually. It’s wrong. The thoughts are wrong, and should very well be slapped right out of someone’s head. Maybe they should bring back lobotomies

       I am biased in this conversation because I was sexually abused when I was a child repeatedly by a family member and made the mistake of telling someone. That person “got help” then continued, and continued to abuse me. From personal experience, I don’t believe pedophiles have a remorseful bone in their body, and should be thoughtless vegetables their entire lives. IMHO.

       I know this is a sensitive subject, but your abuser is a whole different can of worms than a pedophile who has not harmed a child in any way.  Apparently they exist, and if they do exist, they should not be punished for what they haven't done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also put children who harm other children in the maybe-redeemable category. A 12- or 13-year-old who hurts another child is not beyond hope.  I have a big problem with the idea of executing a 12- or 13-year-old.

       no they're just ostracized from society and prevented from making a living if an incorrect opinion slips out that doesn't meet groupthink standards. Treat pedophiles who present for treatment with no history of offending with compassion - they have recognised they are mentally ill. Kill the rest.

       So you're willing to say its ok for them to "seek porn of it online"? Where does this porn come from??? Somebody out there is sexually assaulting children to make this "safe" alternative! Anyone who says that sexually abusing a child to post it online so pedos can "safely access" their fix IS ENCOURAGING SEXUAL ABUSE! That's like saying "I really want to beat the shit out of my spouse, but I only watch videos of other people beating the shit out of their wife, so I'm totally ok!"

       Yeah, my bad. I just get riled up about this. I work for a company that rescues children who are caught in the sex trafficking industry. The sick shit I've had to see has fucked me up. I have no mercy or compassion for pedos.

       So, would you be against a system that registered all currently existing child pornography videos, anybody caught making a new one would instantly get the death penalty, same for people who actually abuse children, but all currently created CP videos would be available  via some government website?
      </p>
      <p>
       The government would then have a way to easily identify and track pedos, it would probably make it easier to identify and take down CP rings as well, as most of their "clientele" wouldn't want to risk going for something illegal when an easy alternative is available.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only downsides I can see are a possible increase in pedophilia if the gov website is public, but that could be solved with it requiring some form of psychiatric assessment to get access? and then you're on-record for being a pedophile, which is probably a good thing, we'd be able to keep all of the people who watch child porn away from places with children.

       Don't the CIA or whoever keep pedo sites up for a bit after discovering them as a kind of honeypot? I think that's a similar method to what you're suggesting, without the problematic "give the pedos child porn" angle.

       Well, yeah, it still gives the pedos child porn for a while, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of their "honeypots" actually became like 100x more popular after they took over, with more views  during the time the CIA was operating it than the former operators, due to the fact that they could afford more bandwidth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system I'm talking about would make making CP vids not as lucrative, hopefully reducing child abuse/trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see anything wrong with giving them CP as long as we can stamp out the making of more. I'm sure that there's enough in the CIA stash that we could do it, but the question is whether people care more about punishing pedos or helping children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure it's the former.

       I see a problem with kids who were already abused having their abuse saved indefinitely for the viewing pleasure of others...it’s like imagine if there was a revenge porn video of you leaked online. Sure, that person can’t make any new porn of you, but don’t you still feel like you should have a say over that content they already uploaded? Isn’t the fact that people rediscover and pleasure themselves to that video of you disturbing, and wouldn’t it be small consolation to know that it’s JUST those videos that’ll stay online forever?

       That's true. There would have to be a system where people could request that anything made of them be taken down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, unfortunately, I would expect that most of the children that were "featured" in CP to have been disappeared or killed.

       Well if they're not expressing their interest in it in any way, how would we send them to jail? They're safe as long as it's not a big enough deal for them to ever talk about.

       The moment it becomes so interesting or overwhelming that they'd be motivated to open their mouth about it, well, that's too little self control for a pedophile in my opinion, send those ones to jail.

       Idk maybe. New theory. There's only like 100 people on Earth but aliens hook them up into a simulation requiring their mind to fracture into millions of new people so they can't realize they're in the simulation.

       But yeah it's what I live for. I argue with people on r/politics because it's funny but annoying at the same time.

       all a simulation, but unlike the matrix the only real person in it is you?

       I've heard that in more spiritual discussions than conspiracy. Basically the universe gave itself life and constantly reincarnating it's spirit in different times and places. Basically all life is the same spirit in different states of reincarnation.

       To be fair that was a rather limiting outcome from the supreme court over the cake. Can't refuse customers because they're gay, that's discrimination, can refuse to make a cake that goes against your religious beliefs. My dad worked in a bakery in his teenager years, once or twice a year someone came in asking for a genital cake to be made, and the bakery refused. This is no different.

       So pedophiles need society's approval in order to not commit abuse?

       I think long story short the reason why more and more pedophiles act every day is because we don’t tend to them; we punish them with little to no rehabilitation , slap a label on them, and forget  about them/barely keep an eye on them. Then we wonder why we produce more repeat offenders, and if you ask me , produce more pedophiles because of some of the points this person makes.
Something to think about for sure because clearly our supposedly ever improving systems dont seem to be managing the issue at all.

       Nope. The video says pedophiles are not criminals until they act. True. But committing that act is their choice. It is not our fault. Putting the blame on us is counterproductive to rehabilitation and treatment because it allows the abuser to believe they are innocent of the crime of child abuse.

       Im not in any way saying we should allow an abuser to think we are the enablers to that degree, they are still responsible for their actions as far as i am concerned. However as conscious observers who wish to reduce the risk of children being abused we can take more appropriate steps to do something about the abuse and mitigate its prevalence in our future generations if not the current day and age.

       Regardless of who's fault it is, if its a fact that creating an environment where non-offending pedophiles feel safe seeing a therapist about their predilections will save children's lives, then there's some moral responsibility for that environment to be fostered.

       You all see this right? Look at how this top comment presents a simple bullet-point summary of the video's main argument. This comment thread is being used to propagate a certain point of view. It is obvious. Look at the comments that have 20+ upvotes, nearly ALL of them support the video's argument in some way or another.

       You do know the videos solution is to get pedophiles to willingly admit themselves to some program or whatever to be dealt with, right? As opposed to hiding in the shadows browsing the dark web and then possibly hurting someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which would you prefer? The way things are where a pedo isn't dealt with until AFTER the act or the way the video desired it to be where the pedo seeks help and guidance before he or she ever commit a single harmful thing against a child?

       well the point is i guess that if you actually were somehow compelled to kill people (as in attracted to it) the way pedos are attracted to kids the state wouldn't wait for you to start killing people, would it? it would try to round up these people because there's something that compels them to kill, wether they do it or not

       Except they don't go around rounding up people who have thought about murder...
      </p>
      <p>
       People who have violent thoughts are encouraged to seek help, from friends or from professionals, before they do commit a crime. You can't police thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smart thing to do is to not stigmatize the thoughts so much that people can't seek help.

       Where I am (ontario), if a mental health worker decides that you are a legitimate risk of hurting others then you can be admitted into a psych ward against your will. The emphasis here is still on healing though, and people with violent fantasies aren't treated as criminals the same way pedophiles are. Most therapists are trained to deal with people who have violent fantasies. Most therapists are not trained to deal with people who are sexually attracted to children.

       There are lots of people who want to kill others. In fact its practically a mainstay of american culture. I hear people making idle death threats all the time, and they seem serious about it. I've seen plenty of people say something like "If i ever met a pedophile in real life I'd kill them." and there are in fact plenty of stories of vigilantes killing sex offenders and they're generally met with as much praise as they are criticism.

       Fuck that bullshit. They aren't anymore ostracized than anyone else who is thinking of committing a crime. If you are having urges to murder, rape, steal or molest a child, there are people you can seek out to help you. She's not proposing anything that doesn't already exist. What she is doing, is suggesting that the way people feel about pedophiles should change (and we can all guess why), to which I say: fuck you, fuck her and fuck pedophiles.

       I think the generally agreed upon best approach for dealing with pedophilia is therapy. As for your pill argument, I don't think that's the case. It might be rather interesting, in fact... particularly if there were also pills to invoke bisexuality in people, or homosexuality in heterosexual people. Could be used as a recreational drug, to try something new and enjoy more of the experiences that life as a human being has to offer.

       I don't believe any of this bullshit, sorry. Ostracizing pedophiles is not what causes children to get abused. It's not normal people's fault that pedophiles abuse children. Not in one single case is this true. If anyone's interest in sexualizing children is high enough that they'd mention it to anyone, i WANT them on a registry. I WANT to be able to find that out. If they can keep a lid on it their whole life, fine, that's

       If pedophilia is treated as an illness rather than as something deserving of scorn and punishment, then a lot more people will come forth of their own will and see psychiatrists BEFORE comitting a crime. The end result is that you pre-emptively stop pedophiles before they hurt people, rather than stop them from doing it again AFTER they hurt people, which results in less total victims over all.

       I've heard it a million times and i don't buy it. Pedophilia does not respond to treatment. They've been trying it for a long time and the research is there. I don't even buy that it's an illness- its a lack of scruples in the face of getting one's rocks off. Rape isn't an illness in the first place and we all agree on that. Its piece-of-shittery, period. They're not crying as they're doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your theory is old, tried, and ought to be put away for good just like pedophiles who are daring enough to cop to it. You're not enlightened, you're incredibly naive.

       This is true for most counseling that seeks to revert or stop sexual acts. Even though some people's sexual fetish aren't harmful, they still feel the need to change it and there is little to no success for these individuals.

       I dont mean to be presumptuous about what kind of a person you are but your opinion is the kind of opinion that promotes systems like the current American penitentiary system which is almost completely failing us and poisoning our society with repeat offenders and fostering more hate and lack of understanding amongst criminals inside of the walls of our reform system.
Just because someone has done wrong does not mean we should condemn them, we must make a persistent effort to rehabilitate them in a way which is generally considerate of the fact that no human is born trying to hurt people they are conditioned by their environments and peers.
Yes, I understand they are personally responsible for their actions hence the necessity for punishment and rehabilitation but right now we mostly focus on punishment which is a deterrent in its own right however that system stands for improvement.
Harboring hate or disdain for your fellow man or woman in your heart only brings both you and judged suffering in the end.

       Sounding a bit spiritual, there! You're talking to a traditionalist Catholic. Don't worry, i know the distinction between judging souls and judging actions. Admitting one is a pedophile is a bold action. I don't like my pedophiles making bold actions. Fantasies, too, are an
       <em>
        action.
       </em>
       If someone is refusing to shut down their sick fantasies and
       <em>
        then go so far as to talk about it
       </em>
       they're not exercising enough restraint for me to trust them in society. Notice how I'm not suggesting we send troops out interrogating everyone on whether they have any buried pedophilic predilections that they're aware of?  That's because I'm not judging
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       , I'm judging
       <em>
        the action
       </em>
       of letting your pedophilia grow too big for the dungeons of the psyche that it should be imprisoned in.

       Traditional catholic lol, you have your fair share of pedophilia in your community to deal with so I can understand your stance.
I hear you and I have had a similar stance before for criminals but Jeffery Dahmer probably had a rough upbringing and environment. I hold fast in believing that if we had intervened at a young age and put some love and maybe some faith into him things would’ve turned out differently. I cant say for sure, some people walk that path, however I do know I wish we had done more to help someone like that because we lost multiple valuable lives to him. At the end of it all he practically got what he deserved if you wanna put it that way.
Thanks for the discussion.

       Surely didn't have an up to date psychology teacher back then right...
       <br/>
       Pedophilia is an uncontrollable sexual affection towards children. If you like chicks with brown hair, theres nothing you can do about it, if you like dudes instead of titties, theres not much you can do about it either... and same goes for if you were born having a sexual affection towards children. It is absolutely wrong to blame the person for having this affection. Blame the action, not the affection. Read up on this
       <a href="https://www.dont-offend.org/">
        here
       </a>
       or ask any psychologist/psychotherapist.

       The very idea that you were upvoted for saying that people cannot control their sexual urges is fucking disgusting.   You are a weak-minded coward who deserves to be exposed to the horror that is pedophilia.   The eighteen people who upvoted you should be removed from all contact with children and exposed to the shame of public humiliation.  Let me say this without equivocation: The only “help” that pedophiles need is the step-stool in front of a noose.

       Yeah alright, go ignore all modern medicine and psychology. Also, you missed the point. It is exactly about controlling it. Controlling if you take action fed by your affection. The affection is uncontrollable, just like your sexual preferences, however the action is, noone should ever lay hands on a kid with sexual intentions.

       What if someone told you that because you had the urge to beat the life out of multiple people that you've never met that you were a sociopath that needed to be locked away from society forever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your way of thinking actually promotes acts of pedophilia towards children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this: Did you choose to be attracted to men/women or whatever you're attracted to? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we'll go on the basis that pedophiles DO NOT CHOOSE to be attracted to children and that they were born with it. You have two options:
      </p>
      <p>
       Option 1: Condemn all pedophiles, whether they acted on it or not. If someone admits that they are attracted to children they automatically become imprisoned. Now you have incentivezed pedophiles to hide and plot. Even those who want to seek help won't. You've effectively forced pedophiles to go into hiding while their lust and attraction brews until a few snap and rape children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Option 2: You create awareness that pedophile is a MENTAL ILLNESS that needs to be addressed and treated. You make it known that acting on pedophilic urges is NOT OKAY AND THAT IF THEY DO THEY WILL BE LOCKED UP. You offer rehabilitation and coping mechanisms so that they don't act on pedophilic urges. If you normalize that pedophilia is a mental illness that can be treated, pedophiles no longer need to hide. They can be identified, they can be monitored, they can be treated. Furthermore you can catch pedophilia early on since younger and younger pedophiles will feel comfortable admitting they have pedophilia and we can treat it at the root.

       Who is blaming the affection?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some are perceiving this and similar pushback as apologism for the 'actions' of either harming a child or getting off on material that was created in the process of a child being harmed.

       Those are reasonable comparisons I guess. I was trying to figure out how to simplify it, but then I came across your comment ha. A lot of people would disagree with this though, and I can see why. But at the end of the day, the action is what you should be worried about. Some even think having these thoughts, you should be locked up or something (not you specifically). Which doesn't help at all in my opinion. If a pedophile hasn't acted on this affection, I think it's reasonable to try and help them figure out how to fix the issue, so they don't act on it. Because in the end, it's just not cool to indulge a child into that.

       You don’t see the concern?
      </p>
      <p>
       All the situations you compared to are adults with adults. We are drawing the line at adults to children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a strong desire to rape or murder isn’t an internal disposition any of us should be forced to “be comfortable” with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the feeling to the adult is sexual doesn’t make it safe. ITS HIGHLY DANGEROUS, just like the desire to murder or rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feelings are not always “okay”. Sometimes nature deals you a shitty hand. Just because you are so genetically fucked that you want to be sexual with kids doesn’t mean society needs to accept you.
      </p>
      <p>
       This not ever something that should be normalized or accepted. EVER. Nature is fucking brutal sometimes, and this is no exception.

       Surely it isnt normal, and yes its dangerous, but it should be accepted as a random occurance, and the individual shouldnt be blamed for feeling the desire, he should be blamed in case he fulfills his desire.

       Yes. People still think regressively. Psychology and human limitations apparently dictate our morals now, not the other way round. Many of these people are your average workers, not actual psychologists and such.

       Its not saying pedophilia is normal it said it occurs in 60 million people throughout the world. So not normal not common. However she did say that it isnt a choice. That there's a difference between having the desire and acting out on it and that the most likely way a pedophile acts out is due to isolation. Essentially she's saying it's a problem that's not going away so we need to address it in new ways to prevent child abuse. So being more accepting that pedophilia isn't a choice and that actually abusing a child is= acceptance of pedophilia as a unchangeable sexual orientation, less stigma more likely for a pedophile to get help and not harm any children
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the solution to the problem of pedophilia. Fear mongering a video merely talking about the issue isnt a solution.

       It would seem that many are in favour if a final solution to the pedophile problem by utilizing universal screenings by the thought police to decide who gets either put in a jail cell or an oven. I can't see any way that would go awry.

       I watched the video. I don't think she's normalizing it in that she wants society to accept pedophiliac actions. She's saying that it's an orientation that wasn't chosen,  and that there should be help available for these people before they act. That if we totally isolate them, they are more likely to commit a crime. She not advocating that pedophiles should be able to have child partners, but that they she feel safe enough to come out to someone for help before they act.

       This is simply the truth. It's a mental illness and anyone who pays a finger on a child should be locked up, but the best way to fight it is probably to help and council them.

       If you are a pedophile and reading this: You are a broken and corrupted wreck of a human being that deserves no sympathy or quarter.  You deserve to have your desires eat away at the core of your soul until your life crumbles around you and you are ostracized from society and cast into the dark.

       You fantasize about the theft of the virtue of our most innocent. Never forget that that.  While the weak among society may think that you simply are misunderstood, the majority of us know, as do you, that there is nothing more evil in this world than the theft of innocence.  You desire and obsess over that theft while ignoring the pain and loss that radiates from the child like toxic waste.  You. Are. Cancer.

       Pedophilia isn't a severe mental illness regardless what your DSM says.  It is an evil at the heart of a corrupt human being that desires to pollute the most vulnerable.   You want to offer therapy that doesn't work, guidance without morality, and acceptance of the sexual preference of the "non-violent" ones.  This type of deluded and self-serving "kindness" is not enlightened. It is enabling the rot at the heart of civilization.

       The very thought that pedophilia is being considered a disorder that needs compassion and acceptance should light a fire inside every human being that still has the desire to protect the weak from the predators.  You are denying the existence of evil and in so doing, removing the social outrage at the presence of this perversion.

       You announce the virtue of calmness and peace while children are trafficked, raped, murdered, molested, abused, and corrupted into becoming the very monsters that perpetuate the abuse.  I understand why you seek peace though.  You feel like the issue is too large to resolve so you've resigned yourself to baring your throat and pleading for pedophiles to play nicely and seek help.  God help you.

        Rehabilitation aims to normalize a way of thought or behavior so that the individual can find acceptance in themselves and create barriers to certain subsets of behavior.  That's why modern psychology rejects actual blame and instead treats behaviors as illnesses.  The normalization and social acceptance of the pedophiliac thought is an atrocity of the highest order.

       Yes because pedophilia ISNT A CHOICE, just like homosexuality or heterosexuality. No one wakes up one day and thinks to themselves "I think today I am going to get a boner at the though of children." They are born with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are hung up on the term "acceptance" and "normalizaiton" when you don't even know what it means. We ACCEPT that pedophilia is not a choice and that these people need help. We DO NOT ACCEPT child rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you NORMALIZE pedophilia it does NOT mean "Oh yeah pedophiles are cool people and should do whatever you want." You NORMALIZE it in the same way you normalize schizophrenia "This is a problem that is detrimental to you and everyone around you. You did not choose this but you must get help."

       You are still hung up on your emotions once again and have defaulted to emotionally lashing out at me.

      <p>
       Your emotional outburst are so great that you still have not understood the crux of the argument since you are blinded by rage.

      <p>
       Exhibit B: Not understanding the argument because you are controlled by your emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have hung up your emotions on the word "acceptance" as if we are saying "pedophilic thoughts are acceptable and should be celebrated." We are not. We are saying pedophilia should be accepted as a mental disorder so that pedophiles can be treated.

       No he didn't. He said "But whoever causes one of these little ones who BELIEVE IN ME TO SIN, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea."
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only did he say that, but he uses this same wording when he talks about Gehenna and how it is better for men to cut their hands/gouge their eyes etc. which is widely interpreted to not be literal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus also said you should forgive others "not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven." seventy times seven being the idiom of that time period for UNLIMITED forgiveness.

       Paedophilia is not the same as child abuse. Someone could have paedophilic thoughts, but rightly know not to act on them. Alternatively, someone could have absolutely no attraction to children, yet still sexually abuse them.
       <br/>
       Which is worse, in your opinion: The one who can't control his thoughts but can control their actions for the sake of others, or the one who has full control of his thoughts but acts anyway at the pure expense of others?

       just another sick fuck to stupid to find a solution and without a shred of empathy. You know the difference between a pedophile and yourself? Most pedophiles know they have an mental illness - you think that you are okay while being a distusting excuse of a human being.

       You would either accept the company of pedophiles because you haven't seen the destruction they leave in their wake or you just don't care.  You find the truth abhorrent and my disgust repulsive because it contradicts your desire to normalize a lack of absolutes.  You are an enabler of of child molesters.

       The other way around you idiot. A friend of mine was molested by her uncle and her family would believe it because they couldn't belive that one of theirs was *a monster*. Almost *all* child molestation happens within the family. That is the truth. And another truth: People won't easily believe that their father, brother, moter, sister is a pedophile. They will look away.
      </p>
      <p>
       *If* you are really about protecting the innocent you draw a sharp line at the act, and you do what ever you can too help pedophiles not to act on their desire. That way you can actually help pedophiles and save children from being molested. And if you would have ever spend a single moment talking with experts about this topic you wouldn't go around being an asshole. Your position is a massive part of the problem.

       Guess what: She helped me form my opinion. Because she knows that taking the high road doesn't help at all. The goal is prevention and not revenge. All your opinion does is letting pedophiles know that they are all alone and monster and guess what usually happens next: some of them start behaving like monsters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easy question: Do you have kids? How you you react if one of them is a pedophile? Kill it? Or do everything possible that he/she still grows up to be a good human being - despite his/hers illness?

       <br/>
       Yes, I have kids. And no, they won't be pedophiles.  We discuss deviant behaviors and the traumatic effects inflicted by evil individuals.  We discussed the absolute fuck-up that was the Duggar family and their insipid father.  My children know that they will be protected from evil-hearted people, from without and from within our family.
       <br/>
       Pedophilia isn't an illness.  It's a choice that's made to gratify an evil desire.  It's a tumor that grows into the mind of a man or woman and needs cut out, not coddled.

       That honestly just makes it even more likely that the vast major of abusers are close family members.

       Children and family members are less likely to report their own kin while they will easily jump and report strangers.

       So what's the issue? My daughters carry karambits and my sons learned Judo and when they're all old enough I expect they'll carry concealed.  In the meantime, I don't pretend that there's nothing I can do to stop pedophiles from slipping into our family environment.   I suspect *everybody* so there's constant questions about touch, privacy, and boundaries.  If you're trying to point out that I can't protect my children from ALL THE THINGS then of course you're right.   The point was that I look within and without or family for threats.  Like every father should.

       &gt; Oh you are so damn enlightened aren't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything but that. I just know that there is no abolute truth, and that there are very few *absolute* evils. And that human beings, given the choice, can often be brought to go down the way of least pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please go, read the wikipedia article on General Butt Naked. One of the most adhorend people to ever roam this planet abnd he thinks that he is a good person. *That* is a truth. And that is what we should learn sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; Pedophilia isn't an illness.  It's a choice that's made to gratify an  evil desire.  It's a tumor that grows into the mind of a man or woman  and needs cut out, not coddled.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is where you are wrong. That is where your inability to accept the truth will harm you and your family. Your conventient excuse makes you blind. Just like it made the family of my friend blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; Yes, I have kids. And no, they won't be pedophiles.  We discuss deviant  behaviors and the traumatic effects inflicted by evil individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       brilliant. Now, if they realize that they had pedophilic urges they will be afraid to talk to you because you would assume that they are evil. And a possible cycle of pain starts again. Because you choose to believe a convenient lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; My children know that they will be protected from evil-hearted people, from without and from within our family.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you protect them if you teach them your moral code as if it would be the absolut moral code?
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't be around forever and you don't know everthing.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: Sorry if I am too offensive but I can't stand seeing pain and being absolutely unable to do anything. And I'm none of those satisfied by revenge or *justice*. If we want to live in a better world we have to find ways to include all of our members. And every human being ostracized by society will stay blind for society. We've tried this long enough and it didn't change a thing - let's hear what those who actually study the effects and reasons have to say and maybe, just maybe we will reach a better solution.

       u/phyrros, I’d usually remove this for calling someone an idiot, but I’m not gonna remove a comment speaking out against pedophilia. Instead, can I ask that you amend your comment to remove the part where you call the other user an idiot? I appreciate what you’re saying, but please refrain from attacking other users in the future.

       <a href="/u/Thekidseateverthing">

       post (where he calls pedophiles cancer) and my answer where I call his/hers behavior cancer is acceptable but calling someone an idiot isn't. It sorta would be nicer to be too dumb to understand something than knowing the harmful consequence and doing it regardless. If you take away the idiot all that stands is intentionally malicious behaviour and that is (in my book) sorta worse..

       I hate pedophiles that do shit to kids. As far as I’m concerned, what goes on inside someone’s head is their own problem. As soon as it travels from their head to the kids at the elementary school, that’s when the pitchfork will come out.

       Why are people disagreeing with this? The "thoughts not acts" spiel just shows how much people do not understand their own brains. Thoughts change you just as much as actions do. Repeated thoughts like these can permanently damage you into becoming one of these husks of humanity, and they invite that damage themselves. Your thoughts matter A LOT. Kind of related to this is why so many people are "depressed" recently. This is because they do not focus on their base joys like the taste of their food, the beauty of art and nature, and fascinating conversations. People instead focus on how bad they look today or how unprepared they are for their exams. There are many ways to look at everything and viewing pedophiles as "misunderstood" and "needing help" is just a way for evil to lay their foundation in your mind.

       i think letting your kids watch anything that was produced by Dan Schneider could be considered as "grooming". i'd say the same about a 10 year old reading Seventeen Magazine or Cosmo.

       Sure. You have two options: Take your 4 year old to holocaust museum and show them ditches full of dead bodies, or take them to fair to see the bearded lady. Which one would you choose? Both are reality. Both are something they're going to learn about someday.

       No, but the ones who have never done anything wrong would be seriously hurt or killed if anyone ever found out. The majority of comments in this thread are proof. It's the same as being falsely accused of being a rapist. People want to fucking kill you, and take away any and all rights from you because they already found you guilty.  It isn't right, and you know it. So don't try to change my mind on what you meant.

       How is asking a question ("Do they want society to accept them being prideful of being a pedophile?") presumptuous of anything? I'm seeking to be informed, on what precisely people want -- as you and the speaker in this YouTube video are offering no solutions to what isn't even an issue. You're just wailing on a soapbox about how there are some people that act irrationally and murder.
      </p>

       Some people in society are bad, and murder people -- got it! Thanks for the insight!

       And what will happen to anyone who kills a pedophile, or anyone at all?

       They get charged with murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       What else do you want to happen to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you genuinely believe that someone that even considers the act of murder can somehow be "swayed" to all of a sudden be empathetic to pedophiles? If so, how?

       Pedophiles have more access than ever to private treatment. Again, what else do you want? Society to all of a sudden stop having people be murderous? That would be nice! But again, you're just on your soapbox with no solutions, just like this speaker.

       Reddit comments represent a small sample size, to the point where you'd be naive to regard a single thread as context of society at large.

      <p>
       Additionally, the most upvoted comments in this thread are similar to yours (slamming the very small portion of society that wants to murder someone and convict them without due process), so I don't know what you're on about. If you look at any Reddit thread, there are always a few instances of terrible people, downvoted to oblivion. That doesn't say anything about how society generally views something.

       Yep, exactly, it's about creating an environment where they are able to seek treatment to the point where both them (and the rest of us) feel confident about their ability to function in society in a manner which isn't going to put anyone in harms reach.  People don't choose to be attracted to children, so they should have options to overcome those aspects of their personalities without the fear of being lynched for reaching out for help.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite disappointing that people believe paedophiles who have not acted on their urges in any dangerous manner should be locked away for life or worse without even entertaining the idea of allowing them an opportunity for treatment.

       How do you know people do not "choose" or encourage these attractions?  It may be something like a kink, and the more they focus on it, the stronger it gets. Maybe they can shut down these thoughts and control themselves. I dont think its the same as being gay, like a basic attraction....

       I'm sorry; what kind of argument is this? My cat ate her kitten after it died; another fixed male still humped his sister before we could get her fixed. This is the kind of stuff that is natural and normal for cats, and I'm not going to ask them for guidance on morality.

       It doesn't matter whether or not we think it's ew; we're not bonobos. They probably think we smell funny, and they are not interested in our opinions.

       But would you contend that pedophilia is 'hard-wired' into them? Or better yet, that it's not because a silly concept to apply to animals outside of humans?

       I don't think that's a valid argument.  Plenty of animals rape or have incest or murder others in a show of dominance, just because they do it, doesn't mean we should do it or shouldn't do it.  I think it's fine for us to just say that we don't find it an acceptable behavior and leave it at that.

       There are three kinds of pedophiles that I think people mix up or are unaware of.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         there are those who are sexually attracted to kids - no different than how gay or straight people are attracted to people.  It is how they were born and they cannot control they feel this way.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         there are those who are into the power, corruption, abuse, and thrill that they get from doing something wrong.  They arent sexually attracted to kids but to how it feels knowing theyre doing something wrong
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are the mentally ill who for whatever reason have so little confidence, or have an under developed brain, and have come to the conclusion that a kid is their only chance at sex.

       It's Weimar all over again. When gay marriage came around people said there wouldn't be polygamy. I know someone who's been fucked up by polyamory. The Russians warned of this a couple years ago. Turns out they were right.

And now sexual preference is becoming the most important way to categorize ourselves.

       I agree there is a push in the Hellywood media to normalize pedophilia, but people have the right to discuss different ways of dealing with the problem as this young lady does.  She has more of the left-wing / European approach to problems, which is the "let's be understanding, being harsh does more harm than good" approach.
      </p>

       It is their same approach to all crime, such as the almost luxury prisons found in Scandinavia.

       Try thinking critically for a second. What is your proposed solution if not to treat it as a mental illness and prevent it from happening in the first place?

       Think they should be tracked by the authorities at all times (obviously there's a large amount of expenditure required by the tax payer here) and undergo some form of chemical castration or have some form of chip implanted that electrocutes them if they get within 20 feet of a child. This is of course pre-committing a crime. after that full blow castration and possible life imprisonment or enforced death. after all they have completely destroyed multiple ppl's lives. sounds harsh but i don't think  99.9% have the ability to change their ways even  wanted too. I think anyone that is violent against an elderly person should be hung. A bit harsh but that's where my head is right now.

       I felt the same way for a second. Then I walked the dog to collect my thoughts and and came back to refute, but almost all those mass upvoted posts supporting the video and normalizing pedophilia have since been deleted. Looks like there was some confirmed vote manipulation and brigading going on in here, which is a bit unsettling in itself to see that can and does happen in this sub, but at least it appears that its been exposed and rectified.

       I absolutely think you're wrong. What many acting (as in physically acting upon their rotten desire) pedophiles do is pure, unadulterated evil—vile, unhuman acts of heinous immorality and the most repugnant display of lust and sin and disregard for the human existence.

       I think you're absolutely wrong. What many acting (as in physically acting upon their rotten desire) pedophiles do is pure, unadulterated evil—the most vile, inhuman act of immorality and disregard for the human existence.

       No but that would fall under bad idea. Having "relations" with someone who does not want it or if they are a minor damages people and families. Its a bad choice. If they dont see that as a bad choice its because people are just a means to an end for their own will. Wether its for sexual pleasure or not is not the factor. identifying other peoples sovereignty as something you can manipulate in ANY way is sinister. You see someone with a sexual problem, i see a person who feels there sexual needs matter more than the rest of humanitys wants/needs. I want to do cocaine everyday and honestly never work again. But i cant claim my wants which are pleasure chasing based instincts matter more than my families life or my own cintributions to the world. People are compulsive, damaged, and frantically looking for a way to feel how they "want" inside regardless of consequences. I dont think that is a reason to create a new illness or pathology for every weird quirck or behavior. Some of these mental health issues are PURELY related to will power, self control, and a persons ethics and they dont want to fight back against that voice in their head that tells them to get what they want. I see a girl i want to have sex with? If i dont get consent i cant claim im ill, and the age/gender shouldent matter in this. Are we going to believe that the the reason they are attracted to kids is chemical then murder should be seen the same way. It should be seem as i have a chemical imbalance because people dont matter to me. That would imply because i think different than the common people that my whole brain must be different. Its covering up the truth that people can just be fucked up by their own ideas and choices and some of the time.

       One possible definition of illness is you/and or others suffer from the way you are. That is why there is a illness called anti-social personality disorder (aka psychopaths) which describes just what you said - people that lack empathy and sometimes have an urge to kill/murder animals and people (in very few words). The question really is how much control over their own urges people with such personality disorders and also pedophiles have. If there was no control whatsoever then there wouldn't be any use in punishment - we'd have to find another way, like putting someone away for good. If there is control and you don't want to follow your urges there should be a opportunity for help. And that help is mental health professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a father i completely understand the anger/fear/aggression that comes from the thought of someone advancing a/our kids but I hope that anyone with such urges gets help so they never act out on it.

       Creating an illness turns us into powerless people, as if we cant solve these issues because they are medical things we dont understand. We act as though only scientists can solve this issue so we cant personally do anything. The big issue is it being really hard to objectively define right and wrong, we'd have to stick to what we defined.

       By the way, illnesses aren't created but patterns of behaviour are named, these behaviours are already there. By accepting or declining these as illness (in US the APA does that, in the rest of the world the WHO) we accept that we recognise the need to treat the pattern. That way homosexuality was taken out of the index (sadly not earlier than the 80s) - pedophilia was in there for a long time. It is nothing new...

       Yes, that's why it is treated as a crime. You don't arrest people with schizophrenia because they have schizophrenia you arrest them for the acts they commit regardless of their condition.

       Exactly. But you would, if possible, treat a schizophrenic before he commits a crime. And as far as I know neither in US nor the rest of the world are there thought-crimes.

       There are no thought crimes you are correct. And you can seek help if you feel that you are in danger of committing an act that is illegal. And mental health professionals practice confidentiality, but have a duty to protect if the individual has direct/exact plans of the crime or names specific people.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the spectrum of sexual fetishes/sexualities are great. They can range from having a balloon fetish which ultimately isn't harmful to anyone, all the way to pedophilia which involves recipients (victims) of these acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society's wellbeing out weighs an individual's. And because of this these acts that harm others (rape, pedophilia, necrophilia) will always be addressed as a criminal act before anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, treating sexual problems from balloon fetish to pedos is very difficult and usually yields little to no positive results. Fetishes are like an addiction and people either replace the addiction for another less harmful one or end up trying and reverting back to the original behavior. So for someone to seek  counseling about them having pedo thoughts or urges only raises a red flag and causes the provider to act on their duty to protect.

       So if one has pedophile tendencies it's okay as long as one is able to supress the tendencies? 
That seems to translate to "I don't care what one thinks, if he suffers or is tormented by his own impulses - as long as he doesn't act up on it"

       But that's how it would have to be. Sexual  desires are a deeply rooted drive, almost primal. So to have one that deviates from the norm that inflicts harm on to others is dangerous and unacceptable.

       Yes, but you can care (about a person with such a drive) and the person with that drive can learn (in therapy) to care and not act out on it. In order to treat something, it has to be categorized as illness.

       Actually in most developed countries you need the diagnosis so the general health care covers costs (and also the insurance to cover if something goes wrong/someone sues the practitioner). Also there are medications that lower/turn off appetence/sexual drive that can be given.

       You also run into issues of pedos not acknowledging what they do as wrong. And only show remorse in order to seek lesser punishment. This fetish goes beyond just sexual kink. There are obsessions, drives, and narcissistic  behaviors that medication alone want cure. It'll just be a bandaid until the medication reaches a threshold that no longer works. Sort of how a lot of drug addicts relapse because medication alone won't cure, nor a behavioral change, it's a drive inside.

       How...in the fuck...can anyone normalize this. There is nothing normal about this. These people need to be purged from human gene pool in my opinion.

       For anyone that supports it, you obviously don’t have children. If you do, then you let me know if you would let them watch your children and not even ONCE be worried.

       Pure human trash. There’s a reason they fear prison. Even the worst of society looks down upon the pitiful excuse of life for someone who harms a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant, but any defense of this for a “Forward way of thinking” is literally no defense at all. Trash, no more conversation. Pretty soon murder will be “an urge” we have respect. Society needs a huge self correct generation. I think the worst part is we have yet to figure out which generation is pushing. Is madness.

       My spouse was sexually abused as a child. I can attest first hand the personal hell they have lived with, even now in their 40’s. It’s taken a lot of love and compassion to try and help my spouse, get over something they had no control over. I don’t care how uncompassionate it sounds, pedophiles should be executed. No amount of therapy or counseling is going to fix them. I have absolutely NO sympathy for these predators. They destroy the lives of their victims in every sense of the word. They should be put in front of a firing squad and killed. They deserve zero tolerance.

       Maybe, or quit putting pedophiles in protected custody and let the other inmates handle the problem. Either way there is no rehabilitating these people. They get caught go to prison then in most cases get out and attack again. Pedophila has no place in human society, just like rape, murder, and cannabilism. I for one don’t believe they deserve to live. Murder carries a death sentence, I believe pedophiles deserve the same. Why should we waste tax money trying to “rehabilitate” then? What good does it do? It doesn’t stop them. Maybe the threat of being caught and murdered would keep them from acting on their sick desires. Their victims are forever destroyed, so no I don’t feel any sympathy for them.

       I’m talking about the ones who do act on it. I do however think trying to normalize pedophilia as a “mental disease” is opening a door to give them an excuse to act upon their urges, with little or no consequences.

       None of them are asking for treatment. Treatment would be at the very least castration, and even that would not be enough, you would also need regular lifelong monitoring akin to something like a parole officer plus many restrictions as far as proximity and access to children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until ANY of these bullshitters start asking for that, I consider all of this an extension of the grooming they apply to their victims, only they are now applying it to the public at large, trying to wear down defenses and normalize and manipulate.

       After reading a lot of the replies to this post, I am scared for what the future holds. Many of you claim or atleast allude that pedophilia is a normal sexual desire! What the fuck?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are mental deficiencies. I understand that a person could even have a sexual desire for animals or even inanimate objects, and no its not a more power to you situation. This should not be normalized, it should be called exactly what it is "wrong" and no I am not trying to be the "mind police".  Think what you want, but understand that sexual desires are one of human beings strongest driving forces, and there is absolutely nothing legally or morally right about wanting to have sex with a child!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       So if your fucked in the head and you want to have sex with a child, you will try to find a way to do so. Even if you masturbate to child porn you are in effect promoting a monstrous evil industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our children are our biggest investment in every way! Any sane person would lose all sense of control if they found out that a pedophile was trying to have "sex" with their child.
      </p>
      <p>
       So answer me this? As a parent your mental wiring is a product of millions of years of evolution: Protect Protect Protect!!!!! Are you going to say it is wrong when a parent completely and utterly murders a pedophile who is only trying to feed his "normal" sexual desire? Or are you going to protect the parent who is wired to protect their children at all costs?

       Did you watch the video? There's a difference between pedophiles and sex offenders. A pedophile who understands that they have a problem and willingly looks for help with their problem rather than holds it in and ends up raping children is someone who should be applauded and respected. They're someone who was dealt a bad hand and yet did the right thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Child abusers deserve no mercy, but we definitely SHOULD encourage non-offending pedophiles to come forward and seek help, and support them when they do, because that's the kind of attitude that will save children.

       See what "virtuous pedophile" Todd Nickerson really thinks about raping children, based on his writings elsewhere on the internet, despite all his "virtuous pedophile" gobbeldygook he got published in Salon:

       Your instincts are correct. Scary that so many people are so easily coerced to disregard theirs. But these are predators, and they are generally predators who groom their victims. They are good at what they do. Children have no chance. But adults should know better.

       They core of the whole issue is the statement “sexual orientation is not a choice”

       This place is done for. Read the comments talking about pedos feelings. Some comments talking about being 12-13 and wanting to have sex with there coaches/teachers and would of. Or the comments saying as long as its consensual it's fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I advocate and will vote for any official advocating the immediate execution of pedos molesting prepubescent children. It's not normal, moral or compatible with my society. They must be killed off to stop the spread of this behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes pedos should feel ashamed and probably should commit suicide if they can't control themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any less than execution of convicted pedos is normalizing it. It's the most grotesque vile act a human can do. It is worse than murder imo and should be treated as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm on a rant, there was a father a month ago who executed his teenager son because his son admitted to molesting a young child. Good for the father. He was given the ultimate test and I believe passed the test.

       What she says in the video could actually work. There's a european country (I can't remember which one) that legalised drugs and provided treatment to drug addicts. As a result, there are now way less drug addicts or "hard" drugs in the market. I could see the same thing happening with pedophiles. By helping them, as mentioned in the video, the number of child abuse cases could be reduced.

       The title on this post is very sensational, the Ted Talk makes a very good argument:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "How can we treat pedophilia or those with these preferences to seek help with so much stigma social ostracization?"
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We must treat pedophilia the same way we treat other mental issues and help rehabilitate these people. We can avoid dangerous situations to help people refrain from acting on their sexual urges by seeking to understand and treat them.

       Dead wrong. Any convicted pedo must be executed. We will not normalize pedophila and put it on same level with depression, as you suggest.
      </p>
      <p>
       No amount of pedos or pedo sympathizers will change our minds. We will not allow it and will continuously advocate for public executions of the convicted. We do not care about pedos feelings and we WANT them to know we are disgusted by them and find them absolutely repugnant. Pedos should be shamed and hate themselves. They are not normal and must be purged to prevent the spread of this wicked evil. I will die on this hill and never retreat.

       You should watch the Ted talk, it discusses why this exact behavior toward pedophilia doesn't cause it to simply "stop". Rather it continues underground and progresses to the point of action and victimization.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one ever said anything about "normalizing" pedophilia. Its a problem that we have to deal with - we don't win by going to "war" like we do here in the states with the "War on Drugs".

       We all know how unsuccessful that has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather it must be treated like a disease, it must be understood to be properly diagnosed and "cured". By allowing those who experience urges of pedophilia to come forward, we grant them the opportunity to understand their own urges and most importantly -
       <em>
        change.

       We have a different moral compass I guess. I don't look at pedos as someone who is "sick". I look at them like an evil that must be eradicated. There is no coming back from pedophila and there is no "treatment" that doesn't involve a bullet.

       The easiest thing in the world to judge others, it requires no perspective, no empathy and no development of character.

       While we both agree that the eradication of pedophilia is necessary, the nature of
       <strong>
        how
       </strong>
       that's to be done is where we disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply placing a "bullet" in each person that experiences urges of pedophilia may "end" the person - but it fails to resolve the root issue which created the urges in the first place.

      <p>
       The more we can take the time to understand those who experience life differently than ourselves, the greater we grow in ability to resolve greater issues past our limited perspective.

       Consent is defined as automatically excluding certain things. For example permanent cognitive impairment in some cases, or temporary mental impairment such as due to drugs, unconsciousness, immobilization, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any non-predatory adult knows that "child" also falls on that list and would not seek to get some faux "consent" from the child, as the child by definition cannot give it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who puts themselves in the position of the hypothetical adult and asks, "can

       I will advocate and vote for legislation that executes pedophiles on the spot after conviction of prepubescent children. There is zero tolerance. There is zero sympathy. They are animals and its imoral to the highest degree possible.

       Quick execution, that is public will be the only thing that suffices. We must eradicate these tendencies.

       Sexual orientation should be defined as what it clearly is intended to mean: which
       <em>
        sex
       </em>
       is your sexual attraction oriented towards.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three options among humans: female, male, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether some sicko likes children in
       <em>
        combination
       </em>
       with any of those options is just them being a sick predator on top of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed studies on pedophiles show clear orientations. The majority target female children specifically. So they are heterosexual child predators. Others are homosexual, or bisexual child rapists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for all this "poor pedophile" bs, I might start taking it seriously when they start lining up for voluntary castration. These guys are full of shit and this is just a grooming of the population as an extension of the grooming they apply to their victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys are full of shit. Todd Nickerson is another "virtuous pedophile" whose "poor pedophiles, we just need treatment, we care about protecting the children just as much as you" bullshit was featured on Salon. Here's what he has to say about his irredeemable need to rape and molest children

        elsewhere

       "good" and "bad" can be easily defined as social and antisocial behavior.  It is very, VERY easy to sort actions into either of these two categories.  There may be argument over differences between morals based on religions, or societal norms, but social/antisocial is extremely clear-cut.

       Translation:  The only people who don't know that your perspective is provably stupid are other people who studied philosophy in college.

       Depending on the definition of "natural", it is.

       It's the other way around: Just because something is natural, or happens in nature, doesn't mean it's normal.

       Difference is, if Fox news put something like this up, the entire media establishment wouldn't help them cover it up like they are doing for Ted. THAT is what is being pointed out here. You bringing up that there are also pedos on the right is a strawman argument that nobody made.

       You all see this right? Look at how this top comment presents a simple bullet-point summary of the video's main argument. This comment thread is being used to propagate a certain point of view. It is obvious.

       Fuck that bullshit. They aren't anymore ostracized than anyone else who is thinking of committing a crime. If you are having urges to murder, rape, steal or molest a child, there are people you can seek out to help you. She's not proposing anything that doesn't already exist. What she is doing, is suggesting that the way people feel about pedophiles should change (and we can all guess why), to which I say: fuck you, fuck her and fuck pedophiles.

       Pretty simple message I got was that we shouldn't treat pedophiles like criminals instantly but instead allow them to get treatment without registering them as sex offenders for life. She clearly stated the character in the story had never committed a crime.

       I don't believe any of this bullshit, sorry. Ostracizing pedophiles is not what causes children to get abused. It's not normal people's fault that pedophiles abuse children. Not in one single case is this true. If anyone's interest in sexualizing children is high enough that they'd mention it to anyone, i WANT them on a registry. I WANT to be able to find that out. If they can keep a lid on it their whole life, fine, that's
       <em>
        good practice

       for not acting on something. Encouraging any sort of self expression on the topic is not.

       Think they should be tracked by the authorities at all times (obviously there's a large amount of expenditure required by the tax payer here) and undergo some form of chemical castration or have some form of chip implanted that electrocutes them if they get within 20 feet of a child. This is of course pre-committing a crime. after that full blow castration and possible life imprisonment or enforced death. after all they have completely destroyed multiple ppl's lives. sounds harsh but i don't think  99.9% have the ability to change their ways even  wanted too. I think anyone that is violent against an elderly person should be hung. A bit harsh but that's where my head is right now.

       I’m talking about the ones who do act on it. I do however think trying to normalize pedophilia as a “mental disease” is opening a door to give them an excuse to act upon their urges, with little or no consequences.

       Yes. People still think regressively. Psychology and human limitations apparently dictate our morals now, not the other way round. Many of these people are your average workers, not actual psychologists and such.

       The problem that none of you notice is that you focus on the “intellectual philosophy” of the occurrence more than the occurrence itself. The focus moves away from pedophilia as it is and onto isms like “relativity”, when that shouldn’t matter too much in the first place unless you’re writing a thesis. I wonder if it’s a psychological trick.
