The spiritual things that happen behind the scenes in life are the pretty much the ONLY things that matter. You think you can just go about your business and not have it affect you? I got news for you, its the single most important thing.</p>

<p>I used to hear people say don&#39;t worry it does not matter anyway, they don&#39;t say that anymore now that they have seen the effects.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have that spiritual thing then your life is going to be utter trash. You will be put in the worst possible situations and work ten times as hard with little to show for it, and guess what, NOBODY GIVES A CRAP.</p>

<p>Your mind has no firewall. What you out into it enters your subconscious and manifests as your life situations, health, people, etc. And MF&#39;s who run this shit know this so they make porn free, commercials look a certain way, movies contain certain archetypes, social media triggers the dopamine circuits, etc.</p>

<p>Also you are a powerful soul which forgot itself by allowing the ego to believe you are just a body and mind, while society is rigged to push atheistic nihilism so your only hopes and dreams are malleable and reflect only the wage slave debt cog in a machine prison system. </p>

<p>I.e. raps about murder, drugs, gangs are the hits, big asses Kardashian are idolized, materialism is God, neo-cons are pro war and pro-zionism occupied while progressive dems are anti-spiritual, anti-individual, pro-Communist plantation.</p>

<p>The Enlightenment and Union with God traditions are real, legit, and are powerful enough to produce Enlightenment in you, but it&#39;s shamed, talked down, never taught, labeled in negative light, and sh1lled hard to keep a prisoner of belief systems instead of warrior of Enlightenment experience</p>

<p>yes. it rewires your brain, gets you addicted, makes actual love making with someone you love, useless/boring and not as hot as busting your nut to ever increasing levels of degenerate content that continues to erode your conscience and as lust overtakes all ability to reason via made up justifications. Before you know it, your subconscious is telling you to look at porn every time there is a need to release the built up of semen in the prostate and like a robot which was given its command, you fulfill the programming of the virus that has overtaken your mind</p>

If its possible that you can have a healthy relationship and watch porn then porn is not the real problem, there is something else going on.

By your logic then these things are evil but it doesn&#39;t mean that those things are evil it just means there are deeper issues at hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Or not even realy. It&#39;s hard to explain.</p>

<p>Spritual things do matter, but the ones who try to change anything, just by researching and working on spirituality never achieve anything, other than being &quot;enlightened&quot;. This happens more often than not. People who fail for the idea that &quot;spirituality is the solution&quot; often spend their whole life &quot;being spiritual&quot; and do nothing else. The only &quot;actions&quot; I ever see them performing are &quot;sending love&quot; and convincing others to be like them. Then they collectively, do nothing, but being spiritual. gg</p>

<p>Not saying that spiritual people couldn&#39;t change the world, but they just don&#39;t do it. You need to accept your spirituality IN ORDER to change anything to the good, yes, but that should only be the first step. Physical ACTIONS are like the physical body, also part of this life. That is what people like you who claim &quot;it&#39;s the only thing that matters&quot; often don&#39;t get.</p>

<p>becoming &quot;enlightened&quot; doesn&#39;t equal to becoming somebody who changes something to the better immediately. Starting to act, is like the next step in this spiritual evolution of the mind. And that fact is undermined by saying: 
&quot;spirituality is the only thing that matters.&quot;</p>

<p>And don&#39;t tell me every realy spritual person knows that action is also important and does act accordingly.</p>

<p>Just need to look at the Dalai Lamas or Ghandi. Most people would agree those are the most &quot;enlightened&quot; people.
Like spiritual superheroes. </p>

<p><em>He told the British people in 1940, &quot;I would like you to lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them.</em></p>

<p>At least the brits didn&#39;t listen to him like the Tibetan monks who listened to that Lama and welcomed the chinese to rob them of their land, religion and possesions all together.
Thats where this attitude leads you.</p>

<p>Just two prime examples, but I see this shit everywhere.</p>

<p>I would rather like somebody in my team, that not even once thought about spirituality, but is willing to do something, than having the most enlightened IDIOT in my team, who won&#39;t do anything at all, besides &quot;using love as a weapon.&quot; lol</p>

<p>At least for the moment. We get physicly and spiritually attacked by some physical beings. I say for now we should send bullets instead of love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t load the site. Having almost no bandwith here. But of course spirituality gets supressed. 
As I said, spirituality is the begining, action is the next step, if you want to supress action, start by supressing spirituality, no? </p>

<p>And as I said, we are physically and spiritually attacked by physical beings (other humans) and your link only confirms this,
 (I guess)</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think that anyone would supress somebody who thinks that being &quot;enlightend&quot; equals having won already.
Somebody who does nothing than being a spiritual being, somebody who does nothing than meditating and spreading love,
somebody like this won&#39;t be supressed, because nobody sees this as the danger. No, those people who preach this: 
&quot;it&#39;s the only thing that counts&quot; mentality are crowned the superheroes of spirituality. Like Ghandi and co. and you see them on TV.</p>

<p>But do you know who gets really supressed? People who are actively DOING something. I could link you to thousands of articles where somebody was supressed who wasn&#39;t spiritual, but tried to change something.</p>

<p>They are afraid, that we do something, not that we know something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most important truth we need to get behind...don&#39;t let materialism dominate your life...it is only one aspect of reality.</p>

<p>&quot;I have often said, both here and elsewhere: A mysterious connection exists between human consciousness and the destructive powers of decline and fall in the universe. Each can, or indeed must, take the place of the other in the following way.</p>

<p>Let us assume there was a time, say during the last twenty or thirty years of the nineteenth century, when people put the same effort into their quest for the things of the spirit as they have put into achieving material knowledge and material actions during those twenty or thirty years. What would have happened if they had endeavoured to recognize the world of the spirit and used this to give a character, a foundation, to the physical world, rather than follow mere instinct and chase after more and more knowledge of a kind that has seen its ultimate triumph in the creation of instruments of murder and found its be-all and end-all in people enriching themselves with nothing but material goods? What would have happened if people had sought to gain spiritual knowledge and spiritual impulses for their activities in the social sphere? It would have meant that the powers of destruction were paid off! If people had been more awake and not asleep in the last decades of the nineteenth century there would have been greater awareness and therefore no need for destruction in the first decades of the twentieth century. <em>Spiritual awareness simply has to be greater than purely sensual and material awareness.</em> (italics by johnysmote) If this had been the case during the last decades of the nineteenth century, the powers of destruction would not have had to intervene in the early decades of the twentieth century.&quot;</p>
