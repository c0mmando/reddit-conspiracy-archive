<p>exactly how it works.</p>

<p>Go on goolge and type &quot;purchase reddit upvotes&quot; and there you go.</p>

<p>Also google &quot;share blue, media matters, correct the record&quot; then imagine a whole office full of paid teens all being told what to post and what to upvote/downvote/control.</p>

<p>Easy peasy</p>

<p>Its not. There are posts in the sub linking to people who peddle items for sale on reddit and make it get to front page of r/all while looking organic and non-chalant. The whole while they used upvote bots and clever psychological tactics.</p>

<p>Its the same as me getting you to react exactly how I want by calling you daft wanker, and you reacting to those words fulfills my control</p>

<p>Its not. I am libertarian, like some things trump has done, hate other things he&#39;s done. But most importantly, the media is lying to us all and are propagandists. There are some on the left I like, Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie(except for his socialist policies)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which side you are on doesn&#39;t really matter to me tbh but come on man, 99% of your content is political. I am more than happy to have all sides in any convo but personally, I tire of one political side trying to make the other look bad on a conspiracy sub. I hate both sides doing it because it clouds the water on who is who in here. When that happens, it allows people who only want to push agendas to do their dirty work so much easier. This site has become a litmus test for political strategists. They know it is where they can sow the seeds of doubt, distrust, and further a candidate by throwing stories out. Once they see if/how it takes hold, they put it into hyper-drive. I don&#39;t like being a part of that from either side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The very first thread I opened today had you talking about Dems and politics in response to a post. Lol</p>

<p>I have no hatred whatsoever. I only responded to your post, where you saying r/conspiracy had become political, by saying you should start with the content you post on here. Again, I said while your posts have conspiracies in them, they are mostly all political in nature. I don&#39;t see what is so hard to admit about that? Even part of your argument was how you come on to crush the liberal newbs. The side of which political party you are on shouldn&#39;t really matter in conspiracy but it has turned into that. It is both sides pushing their theories to make one political party look bad and it keeps the truth buried somewhere in between. And I don&#39;t care which party you are a member of either, it seriously makes no difference to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No way. I&#39;m talking about finding a legit candidate. Rand Paul wouldn&#39;t be moving the needle for most people I know. The past 2 presidents were able to get long time Dems and Republicans to switch sides. I&#39;m not saying they have to have someone as magnetic as them, just someone to at least show people there is 100% a party out there who is more or less, fiscally conservative and socially liberal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which side you are on doesn&#39;t really matter to me tbh but come on man, 99% of your content is political. I am more than happy to have all sides in any convo but personally, I tire of one political side trying to make the other look bad on a conspiracy sub. I hate both sides doing it because it clouds the water on who is who in here. When that happens, it allows people who only want to push agendas to do their dirty work so much easier. This site has become a litmus test for political strategists. They know it is where they can sow the seeds of doubt, distrust, and further a candidate by throwing stories out. Once they see if/how it takes hold, they put it into hyper-drive. I don&#39;t like being a part of that from either side. </p>
