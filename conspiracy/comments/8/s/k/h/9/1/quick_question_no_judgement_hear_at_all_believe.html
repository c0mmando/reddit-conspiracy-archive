       No the Mars River is certainly there. I just believe that because of the time crunch, the US faked the moon landing so they could win. I mean the flag is blowing in the freaking wind.

       Did you not read? I said the Mars Rover was legit, and probably everything else too. I just think the initial landing was fake. The US being the way it is, just had to win the space race. How else can you explain a blowing flag on the moon? The fact that the camera’s crosshairs went behind an object like it was a back drop? Or maybe, the fact that the footage was “lost?” We can keep every little scrap of information, but the footage from us touching down on the surface of the moon. Then we lose it? Yeah, totally.

       You’re right about the flag. It undoubtedly is flapping in a nonexistent breeze. My question for you is if you know NASA, a government organization deeply rooted in freemasonry, would lie about the Apollo11 mission and maintain that lie to this day, what reason do you have for thinking any of the missions are legitimate? The footage from Apollo 17 looks almost as ridiculous and goofy as the first footage.

       I am a scientist. I believe in the progression of technology and humanity. Space travel was clearly a capable thing, it’s been happening. There is no reason to doubt the legitimacy of exploration efforts outside of that space race time crunch. Or, at least, that’s how I think of it.

       Ehh so you arrive at that conclusion based on faith in "the progression of technology and humanity" and use it to ignore mountains of evidence that should, at the least, be grounds for very healthy skepticism?  That's pretty much the opposite of science, Mr. "scientist".

       I haven’t seen the mountains of evidence in regards to all the other attempts of space exploration. I was talking about the moon landing specifically. But I am not close minded, my opinions change with new information. So if I saw more reasonable evidence about the other flights my opinion would likely change.

       I was still a child when I was confronted with that claim for the first time, yet it took me only a couple of seconds to figure why this is probably a wrong statement.
The moon has pretty much no atmosphere and way lower gravity than Earth has and that is why something as lightweight as a flag would keep any kinetic energy that is put into it for way more time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you throw a flag out a spacecraft while in space it would be "flapping in the nonexistent breeze" almost for ever since there is no gravity and no atmospheric presure that could counter and nullify the kinetic energy you put into it by throwing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same effect on the moon. If you drop a ball on the moon it will take longer to reach the ground than it would take on earth. Yet you wouldn't claim that is because the strong wind coming from below. No it's because less gravity. Same thing for the flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure about the moonlanding in general, but the flag reacted to the different gravity and atmosphere exactly how physicists would predict it to do.

        there is no wind on the moon

       And yet there are videos when the flag is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       acted on by an outside force yet still flaps away, or its motion is suddenly and inexplicably amplified though the astronaut is not touching it at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard the official explanation of the mechanism of that "special" moon flag being the cause of its spooky motion, but along with the other 100 or so reasons we know the Apollo program to have been a hoax, the likeliest and even simplest explanation is that the flag was being moved by a breeze, on earth, which also happens to be exactly what it looks like, and how it appears to our senses, upon which we rely for survival and thanks to which we have survived on earth thus far.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not sure about the moon landing in general, and neither was I about 2 or 3 years ago, because I hadn't thought about it since being a child. When looking at it from any sort of critical perspective, it totally falls apart. Even smart people like yourself can fall victim to cognitive dissonance.

       Can't watch the video...
      </p>
      <p>
       The only clip I know of the flag is pretty short. They put it down, it moves for few seconds and that's it, no? I mean since then I saw it few more times and it always that clip and there is always someone saying 
"look the wind", but yeah less gravity... I'll have a look again as soon as I have the bandwith to watch videos again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked into the genral moonlanding thing a little here and there in the last couple of years, but I'm still not 100% positive. As long as I'm not 100% positive I say "I'm not sure" I'm like 70% convinced at the moment though. I never felt the need to know for sure for some reason, so I never spent too much time researching it and thus can't say I'm sure for now.

       <em>

       Yeah but it wasn't just an Idea, it's actual science and I watched some video where some physicist confirmed exactly what I said back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'd be disturbed if I'd see them putting a flag on the moon and it would immediately stop to move after being put there. THAT would tell me something is wrong. But yeah, like said I will have another look.

       I believe we can send equipment to many places, including the moon and mars.  I don't believe humans have ever done the same and lived to tell about it.  I don't believe any living man has ever left Earth's orbit.

       There is absolutely not a rover on Mars. There are well-documented videos of insects and all that. Locations which resemble places on earth almost exactly; some of the colors have been manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is even a list of like 100 Mars rover anomalies or something I saw last night when someone posted the photo from “Mars” that has an Egyptian statue in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, most people seem to take a huge illogical leap of assuming these anomalies mean that there are alien civilizations on Mars or whatever rather than that they are fabricated.

       I said that I was open to hearing everyone's thoughts. No matter what you believe. But people like you are the reason debating and discussing both sides of an argument is not possible. Just started your opinion and why you think that and let others add on to it or ask questions on why you think that.

      <p>
       People who use insults and call people names when debating or when having a discussion with someone. Those are the people who either don't know what they're talking about, lack evidence and proof that back up there argument, or are just plain out wrong.

       People like me? Who've been called far worse than "flathead" for expressing my opinion here? Check my post history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, sorry for hurting your feelings, but imagining the universe to be a big room containing a flat earth is just silly. I can't conceive what evidence could possibly convince flatheads (assuming there are any at all who aren't simply trolling) that astronomy is a real science, when all they have to do is spend some time at the library, buy an amateur telescope or just  fly somewhere and look out the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       My advice? Own "flathead" the way I own "tinfoil hat loony". Wear it like you own it and it can't hurt you. I don't think it's that insulting anyway, I hope the term catches on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding your original question, no two "conspiracy theorists" think exactly the same thing- just like any other group. I align with the ones who think that the Nazi Alumni Space Agency is doing their best to conceal evidence that we are not alone.

       There are no stars in any of the photographs from the alleged moon landings.  Bill Cooper had a very good episode of the hour of the time to do with the moon landings in which he took them apart in multiple different ways....check Youtube.  We have been lied to.  I believe in the secret space program and think they have tech that is sufficiently advanced to stage an alien invasion but what we were told officially were lies imo.

       There is a lot of proof that would suggest the moon landing was faked but there is also proof that it was not faked. I believe that it was faked because of the reason alone. During the Cold War we were competing with Russia “to send a man to the moon” this competition had a more nefarious reason which was to prove who could launch rockets/missiles farther in a sort of pissing contest kind of way. I don’t think we had the technology to do it but I believe that we put on a good show to “win” the competition against Russia. There was so much riding on the fulfillment of this achievement that it could not be left to chance. The faking was done either instead of the actual event and everything that would have been necessary to make it happen or it was done when the process and research led to failure. As I said there is evidence for both sides it really is up to you what you want to believe.

       Tl;dr: the moon landing was faked out of necessity.

       I haven’t seen the mountains of evidence in regards to all the other attempts of space exploration. I was talking about the moon landing specifically. But I am not close minded, my opinions change with new information. So if I saw more reasonable evidence about the other flights my opinion would likely change.
