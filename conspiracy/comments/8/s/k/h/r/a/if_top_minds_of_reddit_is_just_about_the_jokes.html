<p>Top minds of reddit is not a sub dedicated to &quot;making fun of people&quot; it&#39;s a sub dedicated to the targeted harassment of conspiracy theorists and anyone to the right of Bernie Sanders. Top minds is a hate group dedicated to making conspiracy theorists and right wing Americans feel unsafe on this platform. </p>

<p>This is bullying. And bullying is wrong.</p>

<p>Remember polkadotgirl? She didn&#39;t feel safe anymore after they targeted her. They harassed her until she deleted her account. Definitely sounds like just a funny joke... It&#39;s absolutely disgusting that such a hate group is allowed to exist on a site dedicated to feeling safe when discussing touchy topics.</p>

<p>Exactly. This is their goal. They always attack the mods the hardest, because their goal is control over the sub and complete suppression of certain topics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Reddit staff wrote in an official <a href="https://redditblog.com/2015/05/14/promote-ideas-protect-people/">blog post</a>:</p>

<p><em>We are unhappy with harassing behavior on Reddit; we have survey data that show our users are, too. So we’ve improved our practices to better curb harassment of individuals on reddit.</em></p>

<p>The change to the harassment policy was based on a survey of 15,000 Reddit users. Due to harassment, users were much less likely to suggest the site to friends, and many users didn’t comment because they feared negative responses from other Redditors. The primary reason users wouldn’t recommend the site was because they didn’t want to expose friends to “hate and offensive content.”</p>

<p>The new harassment policy is as clear as possible, and it defines harassment as:</p>

<p><em>Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person [1] conclude that Reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or [2] fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.</em></p>

<p>Users can report others by emailing Reddit staff, and they will then make investigate the matter and possibly ban the harassing user. It’s hard to say if this change will have any effect on Reddit. Indeed, the blog post notes that this change won’t impact the majority of users, likely because the troll problem on Reddit is smaller than it appears.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2015 - &quot;NPR&#39;s Robert Siegel spoke with Ellen Pao, interim CEO of Reddit,&quot; - <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/05/19/407971708/reddits-new-harassment-policy-aimed-at-creating-a-safe-platform?t=1529518917849">https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/05/19/407971708/reddits-new-harassment-policy-aimed-at-creating-a-safe-platform?t=1529518917849</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>What happens if someone complains?</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s an extension of an existing policy, with more clarification to provide a better definition of harassment. Those who are being harassed on Reddit can complain to the site&#39;s administrators, Reddit employees, who are taking a closer look and managing harassment on the site</p>

<p><strong>Have there been more complaints since the policy has been established?</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ve seen more complaints coming to us. We&#39;ve had about 20 to 30 complaints in the past ... half a week. With our larger team, it&#39;s been very manageable.</p>

<p><strong>With millions of users and a few dozen employees, how does that work out?</strong></p>

<p>It is definitely hard. We also have thousands of volunteer moderators who help people comply with the rules and policies of Reddit by taking an active role in managing the content. That&#39;s been a huge help in allowing us to get to 170 million monthly unique users and have only less than 100 employees.</p>

<p><strong>Since Redditors are anonymous users, doesn&#39;t that mean that someone who&#39;s contributing harassing material can keep doing it under a variety of pseudonyms?</strong></p>

<p>We have ways of finding them and we have ways of looking for repeat behavior or methods of coming to our site that can help us track down the anonymous users who may try to create fake accounts.</p>

<p><strong>There are discussion threads at Reddit called subreddits, some of which are overtly anti-black or anti-Semitic. If a Jewish Redditor looked at a subreddit called, very offensively, &quot;Gas The Kikes&quot; and said it makes them feel unsafe to participate, would you take down that subreddit?</strong></p>

<p>The question is whether it would make them fear for their safety, or the safety of those around them or where it makes them feel like it&#39;s not a safe platform. Somebody expressing ideas that aren&#39;t consistent with everybody&#39;s views is something that we encourage. There are certain posts that do make people feel unsafe, that people feel threatened or they feel that their family or friends or people near them are going to be unsafe, and those are the specific things that we are focused on today.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not our site&#39;s goal to be a completely free-speech platform. We want to be a safe platform and we want to be a platform that also protects privacy at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Are you thinking of harassment in terms of targeting a specific individual as opposed to an individual who&#39;s part of a group that would feel targeted by a whole thread of discussion?</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s a good question. We are currently focused on addressing harassment perpetrated by individual users. We know we do have a problem of group harassment as well, but we&#39;re trying to address one problem at a time and we will get to group harassment next. It&#39;s not something that&#39;s going to be very easy so we&#39;re taking it one step at a time. We are building tools and hiring more people so we&#39;ll have enough resources to do it right when we do continue to look at how our site is being used and the types of content and behavior on our site.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any connection between these two things? When you were a high-profile plaintiff, did you find yourself being attacked and bullied online by people?</strong></p>

<p>There were definitely comments from people all over the Internet that were pretty negative. More of the negative comments were from anonymous folks and it was difficult to see what the substance behind their comments [was] and a lot of the information was wrong.</p>

<p>I would have people reach out with very personal stories. Very emotional connections were formed over the course of the trial and before and afterwards that were really inspiring to me and really helped me feel confidence in what I was doing and feel good about what happened even though the outcome was not exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>Calling someone you disagree with insane isn&#39;t harassment? Making hundreds of posts about me and banning me when I come to defend myself is not harassment? Threatening to find out who I am isn&#39;t harassment?</p>

<p>What your definition of harassment then? If it causes emotional distress is it not assault?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is the most important. And I’m being serious. Anyone that spreads doubt on a conspiracy in the conspiracy sub is a robot and therefore null and void. Go to another sub somewhere else if you are a real person. I mean, if a sub like TMOR is so dedicated to attacking one sub then obviously these are not real human beings because why in the hell would a real person do that besides being a sick faq. Therefore doubters on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have become either bots or super people who still deserve zero faq’s</p>
