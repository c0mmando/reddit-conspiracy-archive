       I’ve been on this sub for a while now, and i’ve just listened to the #911 Joe Rogan podcast with Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo, and it really made me question trump and the way the media portrays him. Up until I listened to this podcast I had been under the impression that most of the bad things MSM says about trump are at least mostly true, but I always took it with a grain of salt seeing how they seem to really demonize him. I am in no way, shape, or form defending Trump against anything, nor am I advocating for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question being: does anyone know the legitimacy of the things Alex stated about Trump, and why the MSM would shill against him so hard? I am in no way trying to start an argument, just an open discussion as i’m genuinely misinformed and intrigued.

       If you look at the entire thing with objectivity, they are definitely going hard on him. There does appear to have been a highly concerted effort to stop him winning and once he had, to remove him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you gotta ask why? Is it that he's a maverick? Is he actually draining the swamp?

       Or is it all just a play to keep you running around, looking for answers that aren't to be found while the establishment continues their private agenda of world domination?

       Alex basically goes on a rant about how the ‘elites’, the Clintons, and the Obama administration are part of a sort of cult that believes they are communicating with a 4th dimensional being. This being is telling them to build a machine that would eventually help them break off of what they believe is the current ‘failed civilization’, by dumbing down and killing off humanity(?). Alex says Trump knows about this to some extent, and does say a lot more than that about the situation, but in general they seem like such outrageous claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes you wonder if there’s any truth to some of what he says though, as he claims he has sources in the nsa, cia, etc.

       Step one is to admit that you have been misinformed. The second step is to find what subjects interest you and find out what has been hidden from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be biology (epi-genetics and quantum biology), religion, physics, power-generation, transportation, ancient history, geology, medicine, food, politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is to keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out! And as one of the more trustworthy and honest researchers (William Cooper) once said, "Don't trust anyone. Not even me! Look it up for yourself or you only think and do not know!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The journey is yours and I promise there are myriad rabbit holes to look down or to immerse yourself in completely. However, no one ever finds the big picture by staying in one hole (though they do often link together) - nor by trusting any one researcher/podcast/show.

       Indeed, one does not come here to make progress, just to gather information. Occasionally to try and help out a fellow researcher, such as yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real battle is within you, the search for the truth that resonates and makes your life superior, by sifting through all this information of which 95% is unimportant, disinformation or outright false.

       Along the Robert Schoch line, have you watched the episodes with either Graham Hancock or Randall Carlson?
      </p>

       If not, I'd recommend episode #725, where they both appear together. Shit is absolutely fascinating.

       Ugh, not yet! But glad you knew video games are also right up there with things I love. I’ve always really liked Assassins Creed because of all the history. Buuut you’re the first to describe Origins in that way (although it’s never come up paired with conspiracies before...) so maybe I shouldn’t be sleeping on it like I am.

       I'm actually going to make a post about it very soon. They bring up things that Schoch discusses directly in the JRE episode, so I was pretty blown away when I saw them come up in the game.

       Okay that’s actually pretty neat. I never thought there would be any crossover between two of my favorite things. I’m going to go watch it now. I’m prooobably going to buy Origins when I get paid on Friday. Because of you, so thanks friend!

       Great post!!!! As being someone who has just really started looking into theosophy could you point me to some critical viewpoints and critiques of it? On the surface it seems to make some sense and resonates somewhat with me, with that being said I haven't dug too deeply into it.

       Truthfully, aside from the current "dark" types of people who rely upon its teachings - I have no real "critique" - I looked into most of it, it's peppered throughout the new age/spiritual and ancient history/atlantis type podcasts and teachings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pretty pervasive and when you look into its origins and what it's saying really resonates as undesirable to me.

       One of the things that REALLY stood out to me, so much so I made a whole post about it
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7nho9k/if_you_want_to_know_what_the_elite_believe/">
        here
       </a>
       , was the film "The Hidden History of Humanity" - by one Philip Lindsay (he was JUST on Forum Borealis recently and you can sort of feel the weird vibes from him, not "proof" I know, but see for yourself). In it they talk about "root races" and try to categorize people into "levels of evolution"  - the most startling (to me) was
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbWMw249xY8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1h22m5s">
        this quote

       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We will explore the importance of Britain the United States and Brazil as a triangle of nations preparing us for the sixth root race ... and in 2025 the reappearance of the masters of wisdom for the first time since those ancient atlantean days ... and the expansion of human consciousness will go steadily forwards"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This "idea" posits that Brazilians will transition into the next new root race and supplant all current humans. This fits perfectly with the

        "everyone will look Brazilian"
       </a>
       meme and the whole "mixing everyone into one multicultural race" thing going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just food for thought, not necessarily damning evidence, but I get REALLY suspicious vibes from Theosophy.

       Thank you for the very in depth response. I'm going to look into it for sure. Certainly a knife can be used to hunt, cut steak or kill people. That's the problem with us humans, it is so very easy to take something and bend, twist and mold it for personal gain or even nefarious puposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just stated listening to Manley P Hall so he's about the extent of jniwledge I have right now. I did listen about the root races and honestly it did sound strange but I like to keep an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm really intrigued by is the whole idea of spiritual alchemy by means of transforming one's self from the inside. I'm not even sure if that is tied into Theosophy or not...lol.

       Thanks for posting this....this makes a hell of a lot of sense in the abstract. It's tough to actually source all of it, just like when Joe asked him "where are you getting this from?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it making logical sense is when you've deep dived into many areas and basically given over your MIND to the possibility that anything is possible. You really must unlearn almost all of the stuff you've been taught from birth. Fascinating stuff!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Your exactly right about politics as well....it's all a dog and pony show. Is it any wonder why this sub is so filled with political bullshit now? Politics is a literal conspiracy in of itself.

       Quantum computing, brain to computer interfaces, brain to brain interfaces (aka brain nets aka hive mind), predictive analytics, transhumanism, all of those are good places to start the research. This all goes back to the mystery school's quest for perfection, to make Gods out of men, and to enslave the profane (those without the knowledge).

       No. The initiates in themselves are inherently bad or good. How they perceive and use the teachings is up to the individual, some see dark connotations, some see light. (no pun intended)

       It's tough, you got to find where you stand.  I default to "trust no one".  Personally, following the Bernie campaign really removed the wool from my eyes in regards to MSM/DNC/Hillary/Online-Shill-Campaigns.  So that became the new center for where I would stand.  And if the crazy Alex Jones and Trump speak out against corrupt opposition or get slandered by the MSM, then I start feeling that maybe there's some truth on their side, because there sure as hell doesn't seem to be any on the MSM side.
