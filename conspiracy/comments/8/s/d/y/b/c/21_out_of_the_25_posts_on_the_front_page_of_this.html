       I think some of this people have a point when saying that sometimes there is too much content here that is just news. Yeah, sometimes political events are conspiracy related, but this isn't always the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally out of my own experience, instead of searching for news people should try to find cases of corruption going on that involve either politicians, organizations or corporations. Those cases aren't conspiracy theories, but rather factual conspiracies. These are usually my most upvoted posts.

       Pretty ignorant, I've been here a couple of years but never seen so many political news threads on this sub in the past than now. I made a thread asking why these threads are now a thing and why actual conspiracy threads have been overshadowed by these threads

       I'm new, but I post and it contributes to the subreddit. You're just complaining. And there's no proof. Did you link all the 21/25 political threads? No you just said it when people can see the top 25 aren't like that.

       You have my apology. I went to the sub and......you guys ae absolutely correct. I pitched my bitch to the mod and haven't heard back. If you read the sub rules, "no politics" is rule #1. Fucking mod is either asleep at the post or just doesn't give a fuck.

       So here's the thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even before I went over there I knew there was going to be politics. Not just because the conspiracy "movement" has been co-opted by right wing political groups since at least WACO. But because Politics is just something that's going to happen when more then 2 people exist in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that humans are a political creature and have been since we started living in groups. When you see something and you think "awe, that's completely apolitical" what's actually happening is that it just fits your politics. Whenever someone throws a fit about someone else "putting politics in my  X"  what they're really doing is protecting the status quo. It's kind of like the fact that you're eyes don't "See" your nose even through it's always there in plain sight.

       Unerstood. But when rule 1 says "no fucking politics" then you would think it means just exactly that. The fact is that people are assholes. They will go onto a sub and spew their polital rhwtoric even when specifically told the sub and its users dont want it there. Some people think rules are not meant for them, or are so brainwashed with propoganda they cannot function without doing so. Either way, I was trying to support a sub because I like the concept and the one moderator made me look bad by doing so. Will not happen twice. Peace.

       It's not just one mod, they have a mega threads on 9/11, MK Ultra, and HAARP. When they say "no fucking politics" what that means is "no politics....that we don't already agree with". Their users want politics they agree with so that's what they're given.

       This sub isn't "safe" for Trump but I do think that more people here will at least try to understand the
       <em>
        alt right

       perspective before passing judgement. After all, most of us don't trust any news outlets, especially when they clamor in unison. That sort of blind loyalty to the media is what helped rush our nation into the war on terrorism.

       Exactamundo. Trump the shithead is good for that at least. Obama was slick enough to keep most who might otherwise question his meteoric rise (and CIA past) were lost in the sauce. Trump on the other hand? He has a 2L bottle of The Sauce and is squeezing it into the collective faces of mainstream America on a daily basis.

       I don’t think he believes his actions to be negative. Nor do I believe him to ultimately be in control of said actions. He is a man playing a part assigned to him by his controllers. Now were you to ask me if they believed Trumps is engineering his own downfall I’d have to agree,  and also add he intends to take America along with him.

       We live in violent times were geopolitical events are a factor in our lives, and a much bigger threat then aliens and big foot.  I'm sure if you do a little searching you can find a lighter splinter sub for that kind of stuff.  I know you're not the first to complain.

       This is the correct answer. I was subbed here in 2016 and it was a swift takeover that happened in several subreddits at once. I recently re-subbed here and it's a little better, but still "politicized."

       i've been here for about 10 years. i really miss the reddit from 2006-2012. so many posts about aliens, black ops, false flags, 9/11, the Mayan Calendar, pyramids, etc.

       there was hardly any current-event type posts.

       I enjoy conspiracy theories involving aliens, cryptids, mythos, and the unnatural/unexplained more than political as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, some of the more political conspiracy theories have large implications and many people believe those theories will be on the level of WaterGate, so I can't blame people for wanting to talk about that stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want more of the "unexplained mysteries" theories, participate in those threads. I'm afraid, however, that politics will consume the hot tab for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discourse is easier to find there and a lot of people seem to be looking for discourse. Perhaps that's the goal, to keep people from talking about the actual theories, but I subscribe to the simplest answer is usually the right one and it's just people looking to discuss.

       Politics is defined as: "the activities associated with the governance of a country or other area, especially the debate or conflict among individuals or parties having or hoping to achieve power."
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy is defined as: "a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful."
      </p>
      <p>
       All conspiracies have connections to politics, because all conspiracies are about seizing power through unlawful or harmful plots. Maybe you mean to say that a lot of the posts on the front page are about "partisan electoral politics" or "government politics", but all conspiracies are inherently political. And when politicians in government are constantly involved in conspiracies, cover-ups, criminality, what would you have us do? NOT talk about conspiracies involving governments or politicians just because you don't like it?

       Yea youre right . However, If there is a cover up, I dont see a way that it could become partisan because even though it took politicians to cover it up.  It has been done  by many political figures in multiple  countries of different political parties  and spectrum of political belief over a period of at least 70 years or more.

       I probably shouldnt have picked on Bigfoot because I believe at one time I think something like a Bigfoot type creature may have existed. Maybe it was when humanity was young and we co-mingled or competed with other Homo species that were pretty different from us. As if are shared memory from long ago still remembers and stories of them have been brought down through the ages. I mean there still might be some holdovers out there that  remain hidden. I guess that is possible . But, I do know that is what brings a lot of us here.

       Though Aliens/UFO conspiracies are somewhat political as well.

       Government covering up aliens. Government creating ufo's. Government in contact with aliens.

       Yea but if this sub stuck more to it's roots and got more away from politics it would become less partisan because governments,in this country and others tend to hid info about Aliens/UFOs regardless of political party. If somebody tries to make it a partisan issue, they could be made to look ridiculous because if there is/was a cover-up of the phenomenon it would necessitate bipartisanship. That is definitively true in this country and any of  the western democracies anyway.

       For democracy to work, people need to be actively participating in politics. So the whole media, and reddit has been politically sided. It is done through sensationalist media, through fear mongering russia, through mediocrity and idiocracy of identity politics, and even in conspiracy subs. After all, the best way to stay in power in a democratic system is divide and conquer and in this modern age of information confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also in the real world away from theoretical conspiracies involving aliens, lizard people(which is I think just a synonym for the sociopaths of washington and wall street, cold blooded and ruthless individuals of business....), faked moon landing where we the people aside from piecing together clues never really able to know the truth 100 percent, POLITICS at the very minimum, and their conspiracies have real world immediate proof, in policies, in laws, in alliances and through multitude of media propaganda at very minimum some truth amongst the bullshit.
