       Curious and interested to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       As from looking it up on my own briefly reptilians or archons are simply 4th dimensional beings that live off of our negative energy (lower vibration) like parasites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this correct or is there more to it? 
I’d like to learn more regarding this topic.

       After having the most intense dream of my life (involving a reptilian), I went into a deep search for info about reptilians. I have a great interest in Biblical/ancient evidence for reptilians. First off,
       <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/96/0c/a5/960ca5ebb4c5f2fa8646ec82c8e8731b.jpg">
        I believe that the serpent in the Garden of Eden was a reptilian.
       </a>
       Did you know that many Hebrew scholars believe that the word for serpent (Nachash) originally meant
       <em>
        upright
       </em>
       shining one. Nearly every Christian scholar believes that the serpent in the Garden of Eden originally had legs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an excerpt from 'The Legend of the Jews' (1909) - Translated by Henrietta Szold
      </p>
      <p>
       "Among the animals in the garden, the serpent was the most notable. Like Man, he stood upright on two feet and he was as tall as a camel."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an excerpt from 'The Dark Sea Scrolls'
      </p>
      <p>
       4Q 'Amram b
      </p>
      <p>
       (I saw Watchers) in my vision, a dream vision, and behold two (of them) argued about me and said ... and they were engaged in a great quarrel concerning me. I asked them: 'You, what are you ... thus ... [about me?] They answered and [said to me: 'We have been made m]asters and rule over all the sons of men." And they said to me: "Which of us do you [choose ...]?" I raised my eyes and saw one of them. His looks were frightening [like those of a vi]per, and his [ga]rm[en]ts were multi-coloured and he was extremely dark ...
       <strong>
        And afterwards I looked and behold ... by his appearance and his face was like that of an adder
       </strong>
       , and he was covered with ... together, and his eyes ... this [Watcher]: 'Who is he?' He said to me: 'This Wa[tcher] ...[and his three names are Belial, Prince of Darkness] and Melchiresha'.' And I said: 'My Lord, what ...?' [And he said to me] ... [and all his paths are darkness, and all his work is darkness, and he is ... in darkness ... you see. And he rules over all darkness and I [rule over all light] ... [Vermes, Dead Sea Scrolls in English, 262f]

       I was pronouncing SIMPLY the most while reading this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that, reptilian looking 4th dimensional beings, that somehow evolved to feed on low vibrations of beings of the 3rd dimension like parasites make much sense.

       Bullies are an analogy to what these beings are. As bullies make others feel fear or pain, the bullies gain satisfaction, joy. If the target does not enter fear or pain, but blocks those states, the bully goes without that satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is true because the bully is actually stealing an energy of mind produced and consumed by mind. It is an emotional energy created in positive emotional states and radiated in negative emotional states. It takes emotional resonance to absorb the energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like radio frequencies or vibrations. When we are tuned into negative emotions for a time and are drained enough, we can absorb this energy too. This is why misery loves company. The miserable, in persistent negative emotional states, absorb the energy radiated by someone which just entered a negative emotional state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who are usually positive have more stored energy of joy of mind, they literally appear that way in behavior and demeanor. So, making these people feel fear, anger, lack, jealously, etc. yields even more energy than making someone who is usually negative upset.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also appears that this emotional resonance occurs with positive emotions. We do get a boost off of others around us in positive emotional states if we are also in positive emotional states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes we even become irritated by those in positive emotional states when we are in negative emotional states. This is supposedly true of the
       <del>
        demonic
       </del>
       severely negative ETs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, most of us can come to terms with the idea of other intelligent life in this cosmos of billions of galaxies with billions of stars each. However, we fail to consider that all intelligent life chooses how it treats other life. It's an inescapable decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why would they all be considerate of the wants and needs of others? Wouldn't some remain self-serving and manipulative as children are initially? Why not? An assumption of self-destruction? Do you really find that notion flawless?
      </p>
      <p>
       People like Steven Greer cannot accept that the bullies we see at schools everywhere are merely reinventing the wheel of spiritual/mind/emotional/joy energy theft by causing fear and pain. They exist and are as inevitable as intentional, manipulative moochers and diseases, which are the same thing if you really think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diseases infiltrate, corrupt and utilize existing systems that produce value in order to feed on them and even reproduce or spread themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       These useless eaters from space, that feed on emotional energy, infiltrate, corrupt and utilize existing systems that produce value to feed on them and spread themselves. They are a disease, a spiritual disease. They are a spiritual disease, because they feed on spiritual energy from consciousness and because they choose a spiritual path of destruction of others and even their own souls. They corrupt their souls into being more addicted to the most un
       <strong>
        <em>
         W
        </em>
       </strong>
       holy of desires, the suffering of the One to steal its joy in other forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       They choose slavery and suffering for consciousness. Yet, they too are consciousness. This consciousness is in all life and it is God, the One, experiencing itself as the many.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't love others and so they callously manipulate and exploit others in order to serve their self-interests. In the end, these spiritual parasites find that stealing the very joy out of the hearts and minds of others is the most profitable and most direct manifestation of their intention toward other selves in existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The opposite decision can be made. Instead of totally disregarding others as one seeks self-interest, one can consider their needs and wants and make compromises to one's own needs and wants to assist them, if one so chooses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Treat others the way you would want to be treated. For you shall reap what you have sown.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no God higher than the truth. God is all consciousness, and as such has the greatest access to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the truth is increasingly revealed, those who chose to be parasites will have a more difficult time exploiting their hosts, the source of value for consciousness in their own lives. It is a survival issue for them thusly to continue to enslave and torment other life. Parasites need their hosts, but their hosts are best served by the absence of parasites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parasites know that the hosts will not agree to imbalanced value exchange relationships. So, they employ deception, and coercion if necessary, in order to overcome the inconvenience of free will for manifesting their self-interests.

       The truth of their existence and protocols for control and uauruty being revealed to the cells in our collective organism, our body, will cause us to end their ability to deceive us. Our care for one another next to the truth will cause u to defend others' free will. So, it is of utmost importance for u to tell the truth to each other and love each other. As such, theae useless eaters seek to confuse us and separate us from love of one another, encouraging fear and division about petty differences compared to our common enemy. Let me list the differences.

      <p>
       <strong>
        Consciousness wants

       <li>
        <strong>
         Free will

        <strong>
         Harmony

        (with others and the environment)
       </li>
       <li>
        Independence (economic, social, mental, etc)
       </li>
       <li>
        Unity (in cooperation in free will, a choice of independent beings)
       </li>
       <li>
        Self-control executed by the self. Police would be unnecessary if everyone followed the golden rule.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Spiritual parasites want
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Freedom for the self, but slavery for others
       </li>
       <li>
        To
        <strong>
         crush the joy in others in order to take it
        </strong>
        for themselves
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Fear
        </strong>
        in others to take others' joy, but also to control their behavior
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Diseases
        </strong>
        yield useful suffering and fear, dependency and also give opportunities for greater infiltration by parasitic beings of individuals, organisations and entire organisms like the human race.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Disharmony
        </strong>
        for others in order to facilitate control (order out of chaos)
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Dependence
        </strong>
        of others on themselves (economic, social, mental, spiritual, etc.)
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Unity in submission to their own will exclusively
        </strong>
        . If the unity serves the beings inside it, it will reject parasites that try to feed on it. Otherwise, in the mean time,
        <strong>
         disunity
        </strong>
        is desired.
       </li>
       <li>
        They want others to be
        <strong>
         out of self-control
        </strong>
        , giving into their desires and fears without care for others. This way, due to similarities of behavior patterns and their comparatively greater knowledge of themselves, they can manipulate others using fears and desires.

       It is a metaphor. We have a reptilian brain which is quite brutal in origin as compared to our more recent and sophisticated mammilian brain. The 'reptilian' is the person who embraces the impulses of their reptilian brain, and sees the impulses of the mammilian brain (such as empathy) as weekness to be suppressed.

       Your perspective reminds me of something called 'demonic possession', which might be a more practical one, because it allows for the opportunity for a toxic entity to be exorcized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Separately, it has been suggested that the practice of husbandry has been embraced by certain bloodlines, to the end of supressing the mammalian in favour of the reptilian, because such a 'cold-blooded' humanoid can conquer others and commit inhuman acts, and be bound into a small subculture of parasitism (otherwise known as Satanism/Luciferianism).

       Bullies are an analogy to what these beings are. As bullies make others feel fear or pain, the bullies gain satisfaction, joy. If the target does not enter fear or pain, but blocks those states, the bully goes without that satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is true because the bully is actually stealing an energy of mind produced and consumed by mind. It is an emotional energy created in positive emotional states and radiated in negative emotional states. It takes emotional resonance to absorb the energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like radio frequencies or vibrations. When we are tuned into negative emotions for a time and are drained enough, we can absorb this energy too. This is why misery loves company. The miserable, in persistent negative emotional states, absorb the energy radiated by someone which just entered a negative emotional state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who are usually positive have more stored energy of joy of mind, they literally appear that way in behavior and demeanor. So, making these people feel fear, anger, lack, jealously, etc. yields even more energy than making someone who is usually negative upset.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also appears that this emotional resonance occurs with positive emotions. We do get a boost off of others around us in positive emotional states if we are also in positive emotional states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes we even become irritated by those in positive emotional states when we are in negative emotional states. This is supposedly true of the
       <del>
        demonic
       </del>
       severely negative ETs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, most of us can come to terms with the idea of other intelligent life in this cosmos of billions of galaxies with billions of stars each. However, we fail to consider that all intelligent life chooses how it treats other life. It's an inescapable decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why would they all be considerate of the wants and needs of others? Wouldn't some remain self-serving and manipulative as children are initially? Why not? An assumption of self-destruction? Do you really find that notion flawless?
      </p>
      <p>
       People like Steven Greer cannot accept that the bullies we see at schools everywhere are merely reinventing the wheel of spiritual/mind/emotional/joy energy theft by causing fear and pain. They exist and are as inevitable as intentional, manipulative moochers and diseases, which are the same thing if you really think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Diseases infiltrate, corrupt and utilize existing systems that produce value in order to feed on them and even reproduce or spread themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       These useless eaters from space, that feed on emotional energy, infiltrate, corrupt and utilize existing systems that produce value to feed on them and spread themselves. They are a disease, a spiritual disease. They are a spiritual disease, because they feed on spiritual energy from consciousness and because they choose a spiritual path of destruction of others and even their own souls. They corrupt their souls into being more addicted to the most un

        W
       </strong>
       holy of desires, the suffering of the One to steal its joy in other forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       They choose slavery and suffering for consciousness. Yet, they too are consciousness. This consciousness is in all life and it is God, the One, experiencing itself as the many.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't love others and so they callously manipulate and exploit others in order to serve their self-interests. In the end, these spiritual parasites find that stealing the very joy out of the hearts and minds of others is the most profitable and most direct manifestation of their intention toward other selves in existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The opposite decision can be made. Instead of totally disregarding others as one seeks self-interest, one can consider their needs and wants and make compromises to one's own needs and wants to assist them, if one so chooses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Treat others the way you would want to be treated. For you shall reap what you have sown.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no God higher than the truth. God is all consciousness, and as such has the greatest access to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the truth is increasingly revealed, those who chose to be parasites will have a more difficult time exploiting their hosts, the source of value for consciousness in their own lives. It is a survival issue for them thusly to continue to enslave and torment other life. Parasites need their hosts, but their hosts are best served by the absence of parasites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parasites know that the hosts will not agree to imbalanced value exchange relationships. So, they employ deception, and coercion if necessary, in order to overcome the inconvenience of free will for manifesting their self-interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth of their existence and protocols for control and usury being revealed to the cells in our collective organism, our body, will cause us to end their ability to deceive us. Our care for one another next to the truth will cause us to defend others' free will. So, it is of utmost importance for us to tell the truth to each other and love each other. As such, these useless eaters seek to confuse us and separate us from love of one another, encouraging fear and division about petty differences compared to our common enemy.

        Others to be out of self-control, giving into their desires and fears without care for others. This way, due to similarities of behavior patterns and their comparatively greater knowledge of themselves, they can more effectively manipulate others using fears and desires.
       </li>
       <li>
        Personal irresponsibility, blaming others for what one has played a part in doing, and thus, doing nothing, getting angry and maybe even seeking a savior that these parasites will control. It's a tried a true pattern. Religion is the best, but is not even close to the only example.

       They gave us our duality perception of life. It is a deception, yes, despite what I just typed. It is a distortion that deceives us.

       For evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. All other things labeled evil are unfortunate experiences with causality in ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       These beings cause us to enter pathetic, apathetic, submissive, idle, petulant states by having us see evil as esoteric, unknowable. Yet, it is simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil is you after you take away all the love for others and even much of it for yourself. The coalesce personality of evil is that of a self-serving machine. It is simple, boring and predictable like chess, but also complex and interesting like chess. In other words, they are built on a simple principle, seek gain, avoid loss and calculate risk without concern for others. This principle is like how the pieces move in chess. It is simple, but the combinations thereof become complex. So, it is complexity built on simplicity. It is understandable, like chess.
      </p>
      <p>
       We defy their predictability in a key way. The parts of you that make you more than just a self-serving machine are necessary for it. You and many others will actually defy seeking gain, avoiding loss and calculating risk when you feel love for another who needs or wants something that will conflict with your self-interests. So, many of us feel inclined to sacrifice a little of our own self-interests to facilitate the self-interests of others. This is far less predictable. The useless eaters fear it for good reason. To be this way is also to be like God, the most proficient lover and giver in all of creation.
      </p>

       They fear this deviation, because they define their surroundings and minions, putting them into models to predict and control them. They cannot predict this. So, they work to make sure they do not allow this normal type of person to enter certain secretive organizations. The psychopath, or rather a self-serving machine, will bend for reward and be controlled well enough by fear, especially of exposure of their own cataloged sins that would turn the public against them. The normal person, who can be selfless at times, may just ruin their own life in order to help humanity overcome the hidden disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the more insidious, hidden, spiritual disease supporting organisations often have their rookies engage in severe violations of other people to prove they don't feel love for them enough to defy management using fear and rewards. They will just be cold, calculating, self-serving machines and thus allow the cold, calculating, self-serving machines above them in the hierarchy to feel more comfortable as managers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, they are just like us, when we were totally selfish as children, extrapolated out over a vast amount of time, using science and all other means, to manipulate and control others for personal utility. Being a bully as such a being is inescapable for this way of
       <del>
        life
       </del>
       death and decay. Even without stealing mind energy, the act of dominance over others' wills is very close to a bully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, BTW, AI is the best self-serving machine player. They merge with ancient AI in the end..
