       Recently watched the Disney movie Atlantis. Yes I know, a kids movie. However, it is a very interesting movie and I would encourage watching it. After watching it I did some research and digging and it is interesting how philosophers such as Plato talked about an advanced civilization in the Atlantic that helped bring knowledge and culture to civilizations such as Egypt and Greece.  Is it possible that perhaps a civilization such as Atlantis could have existed and their existence has been wiped from history or perhaps covered up? Interesting to think about and thought-provoking.

       Atlantis is the coverup. There is much evidence of a technologically sophisticated global grand unified society less than 200 years ago.

       Um try again "sweetie", that's European Colonialism, and standards of architectural style of the 1800s for you. Inspiration is another key factor, one country uses the style, it becomes popular, external Royal Families, and Nobles love it, go home, and have buildings built in the same style.

       Next you'll be telling me that the Brutalist structures in the US and Great Britain were proof that those countries were controlled by the Soviets in the 1960s!

       No, but you can examine erosion patters, date the organic material in the mortar, etc.

       That said, you and I seem to agree that pyramids vastly predate "European Colonialism", so we seem to be on the same side here.

       No I think everything is much younger than school teaches us. I think what you see on the Giza plateau or really any famous archeological site is akin to Disney world. At some point they may have been interesting but they have been altered beyond recognition.  Erosion patterns don't do much good if we're still living in a uniformitarian paradigm. How do they distinguish between gradual erosion and catastrophic erosion?

       We'll have to agree to disagree about this subject. If anything, the evidence seems to indicate that the pyramids of Giza, and especially the Sphinx, are much older than estimated. This is largely based on the work of R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz, for whom I have the utmost respect, and also the work of Robert Bauval, Graham Hancock, and Robert M. Schoch.

       Good references there. Can't forget John Anthony West. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't own nearly all of R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz's major works. Need only the Temple of Man (steep price though at $120......but man, what a purchase that'd be).

       Thank you! Schwaller de Lubicz was such an incredibly brilliant guy. His extensive knowledge and command of subjects like symbolism, theoretical physics, chemistry, biology, architecture, engineering, etc. is amazing. I often read his work twice, and still only understand half of it, if I'm lucky.

       I agree on the Temple of Man, it's a good investment!

       Not helpful for the convo, but, i was watching AVP (alien v. Predator) yesterday and the plot starts with them founding some pyramids/structures in Antartica. Funny how i thought to myself "that sounds like the stuff you read on Reddit".

       After the earthquake and loss of peninsula (not island) its people journeyed many years to many places, living in tents for fear of losing even more ground, hunting and foraging. At one point they were known as the Red People of Scotland. By 1800 they had all left the eastern hemisphere for their new lands they had been settling in for centuries, which were not as susceptible to crop famines such as happened to the Irish not long afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with these people was their history was told by word of mouth, and therefore so polluted by inaccuracy that even before they settled in the West they had forgotten all about Atlantis. But they continued to be called "red" and live in tents.

       I wouldn’t call it a theory, I’d call it fact. You got a lot of reading to do, but here’s a quick rundown of some stuff I’ve researched myself over the last few years...
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s loads of evidence, articles and documentaries pointing out that ancient cities across the globe who supposedly lived independent from one another used the same building techniques, and managed impossible engineering feats that can’t even be efficiently replicated today. Precision cuts etc. Go and compare the stonework of Saksaywaman and Cuzco in Peru to Baalbek, Lebanon, and then to Giza Egypt. They all feature the same megalithic blocks, fit to precision so tight you cant fit paper between.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the weathering of the Sphinx Enclosure at Giza among other things, there is a growing theory that the Egyptians as we know them merely inhabited that region, and the Pyramids are actually remnants of a much older, world-spanning advanced civilisation, which was wiped out in the biblical great flood, which occurred around 12k years ago following the Younger Dryas event. That civilisation could theoretically have been Atlantis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to Egypt... The Egyptian king list spans back far further than the first pharaoh. Before there were kings of Egypt their kings were “gods”. The gods were enlightened elders, who supposedly lived
       <em>
        thousands
       </em>
       of years. Thoth (who is recognised also as Hermes) the god of wisdom, science, and astronomy was said to have stored a great library beneath the Sphinx which contained all collected knowledge of the universe and our extended history as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cover-up is quite real. You only have to look at how “Egyptologists” prevent, block and sabotage modern studies into its ancient history. There are chambers below the Sphinx’s paws. There are a labyrinth of tunnels beneath the Giza plateau. There is a lake under the great pyramid. Yet the Egyptian authorities deny it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence is everywhere that we have been here a lot longer than we know. Chances are, earlier humans (maybe Atlanteans) had advanced technology centred around vibration and frequency, which would tie in with the Emerald Tablets of Thoth. Zechariah Sitchin calls us a “species with amnesia”. Half the stuff they taught in school history is absolute bullshit - outright lies and assumptions ignoring an abundance of evidence to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I believe this ancient civilisation understood the nature of the universe better than we do. They probably had a deep understanding of sound, energy and resonance, which unlocked parts of higher consciousness. I imagine TPTB actively suppress this by burying evidence and closing things off (just like the Vatican do with the Bible) because the truth is if we knew the truth, the collective consciousness would shift. Their control would be shattered when we realise we’re immortal energetic beings temporarily inhabiting a vessel (like the ancients believed) and not just the consuming zombies they need us to be.

       Upon destruction, I like the thought that they spread out in many directions. So in a way Atlantis became global, but there was most likely a global network before that.

       Believe whatever you want to man, Personally the "island of Atlantis" is now the Azores (Bathymetric maps of the area for example) and considering the Azores is on a rift, it'd make sense that an earthquake struck the island, and most of it collapsed into the vent and magma chamber of whatever volcano was once there, and the Azores themselves are most likely the former peaks and hills of the island.

       I would disagree with that being Atlantis specifically. They mentioned it being a weak boat ride west of the straight of Gibraltar. If we use Roman era ships as a basis, it would put it at the Portuguese Azores. Coincidentally, a boater reported finding pyramids off the coast there. If you raise this area out of water the same distance as Cuba's pyramids, you get a land mass the size of the alleged Atlantis. Seeing as both the Azores and Cuba are on the edge of the tectonic plate, it isn't too surprising that with the ice being removed from the center of the plate, that these locations would sink. That is my theory anyways.

       Great comment, outlandish claims personally regarded as facts and then claiming the elite are hiding them from you. What civs are you referring to? Don't name the ones everyone already knows about such as the Mayans, Mesopotamians and Egyptians. Where are your sources? And why was this upvoted? Other people also believe this to be fact? Explain first then claim fact after.

       So this book contains the evidence? Do you happen to know which evidence you're referring to? Geogroahical points? Photos of ruins, objects, or imprints from objects in the dirt? Saying there's evidence of ancient civilizations is much different then demonstrating said evidence. You're the one saying it's there, where is it?

       The planet is covered with ancient engineering marvels many of which were built before the dawn of recorded history. Most of the academic descriptions of who built these structures, how they built them, and why they built them, are flimsy at best. There are cities and stone-paved roads at the bottom of seas which haven't been below sea level since half of Europe and North America were covered in thick glacier ice. There are similarities in architectural style around the entire world at a time when the academic consensus is that people weren't too far beyond sticks and stones tools.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this makes any sense. You are blind if you don't see that academia has so far failed to give a satisfactory description of these phenomena.

       You want him to write a research paper? Read 'Atlantis: The Antediluvian World' by Ignatius Donnelly, 'Atlantis Discovered' by Lewis Spence and 'The Secret of Atlantis', by Otto Muck. These 3 pieces of literature seem the most sound as to actually lrove the case that Atlantis existed as an advanced society.

       What's outlandish about citing Plato's detailed account of an advanced civilization in Atlantis. Check out the Timaeus and Critias. It's all in there. Lemuria/Mu would be another lost civilization that has been hidden.

       Plato's account are absolutely outlandish in their own right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim 1: this "island land mass" a has larger than ancient Libya and Asia minor combined, so basically the size of Texas or larger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim 2: this land was sunk "overnight" by earthquakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim 3: ancient civilizations lived there and warred with the ancient athelonians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see how ridiculous these claims are? Claim 1 contradicts claim 2. By the way these are just my interpretations of this classical literature. What are your interpretations? Isn't it odd the only real "proof" we have are Plato's writings? Translated accounts from thousnads of years ago. This giant land mass sunk? Implying such an event is even possible, when else in history has such an event ever also occurred?

       Those articles should get you started. It’s called the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis and in short it says that a meteor struck North America around 12,000 years ago, melting the glaciers and causing sea levels to rise 400 feet or so. Atlantis, if it was real, is theorized to have essentially been sunken by these rising sea levels. Saying they were an advanced society is a bit outlandish, but there is growing evidence that something catastrophic happened 12,000 years ago, and it would have certainly hit the global reset button so to speak. Now do a bit of reading for yourself instead of insulting people trying to answer your questions, you’re starting to sound like you may have an agenda to push...

       Haha geez, asking for evidence to facts is me pushing an agenda? I'm a free thinking open minded individual who happened to come across this comment and it seemed crazy to me. I'm arguing only what I know to believe true and what I've researched previously as you all have. I just don't happen to believe in this conspiracy in particular. You and the others have clearly shown you've done research on the topic. But what's funny is you never showed anything we could actually discuss. You point to books and say there is the proof. How about quote something within these books that proves something? Photographic surveys of ocean floors? Pieces of art or tools or weapons from this area? Anything? That's my question. No agenda buddy.

       Great Pyramid of Giza...show me the facts that have been proven as to HOW it was built and the unbelievable amount of knowledge that has been derived from its actual dimensions.

       Baalbek...give me facts as to how ancient man could have and better yet why would they have quarried such massive stones.

      <p>
       Gobekli Tepe...please, please, please explain to me how a group of hunter gathers were able to erect these magnificent ruins. Wait, not only erect them but to be able carve them in bas relief as well. While we're at it maybe you could explain all of the symbolism and apparent celestial knowledge that was carved into them as well. Oh yeah...this was all done about 6000 years BEFORE Stonehenge.

       Why is it outlandish to think that they may have been an advanced civilization? I have no evidence or anything to support my claim just theory but take a minute and think about it. We say there couldn’t have been and we assume that all areas of the world had a similar tech level but even just looking at today’s world we know it is far from equal. Compare America to Africa. Huge levels of technological variance so why can we see this now but not 12000 years ago?

       Maybe outlandish was the wrong word to use, but just assuming they were a technologically advanced civilization without any evidence can be problematic and also turn the uninitiated away from the discussion.

       What is so outlandish about those claims? If you had looked into any of the extensive texts that have been written on Atlantis, you would know that there were likely three cataclysms that destroyed the continent over tens of thousands of years. The cataclysm to which Plato refers is only the final one.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interpretation is that Plato was largely correct and relaying a true story, as he clearly stated himself. I am inclined to believe one of the most intelligent, honest, and moral figures in world history.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a meteor hit the Earth, as the Younger-Dryas theory proposes, an entire continent could definitely disappear overnight. Keep in mind, modern civilization has only existed for the blink of an eye relative to our Earth's history. Thus, it is entirely conceivable that a massive earthquake (e.g. Yellowstone "supervolcano" eruption) could wipe out an entire island in a very short time. Just because it's not recorded
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, Plato's account is hardly the "only real proof" of Atlantis. There is a wealth of evidence documented by Robert Stacy-Judd, Lewis Spence, Edgar Cayce and the A.R.E., Ignatius Donnelly, and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you should actually do the research before discounting what is objectively a strong theory.

       Atlantis disappearing at the end of the Younger Dryas by a flood covering the whole earth in 9500 B.B. or there abouts puts the whole known length of christianity into question, with Judaism close on the heels. If you funnel your money from these organizations and they also keep the mass of your society in submission, you have a good system in place.

       My theory, which builds off of Phantom Time Hypothesis, is that the ones in charge are the people in charge of the three major Abrahamic religions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each one controls a treasure trove of hidden information: The Christians have the Vatican, the Jews have the Smithsonian, and the Muslims have the Cradle of Civilization. These religions were created a handful of centuries ago in order to control people, and once they overthrew the previous order and established a new rule, they began manipulating history and waging wars to give themselves more and more power. They also appear to fight amongst each other at times, though, so all may not be well at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current historical narrative has only been around for a few hundred years at most, and even to this day they are continuing to rewrite it to suit their needs on a regular basis. I really couldn't say what their motivations are in trying to subjugate an entire planet, but I have difficulty imagining it could be anything benevolent.

       If you wanna talk about the "elite" who hide things from us, it's quite easy to see from a logical perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most of the folks responsible for hiding information are academics who have done research and written textbooks. Last thing you want, once you've got a textbook out there, is some new information that makes your research and book wrong or outdated. Look at the aging of the Sphinx, for example. Seems to show erosion from water, which is odd because Egypt has been a desert for all of recorded civilization. So we just reject this because the guys who have textbooks in circulation want to keep those textbooks in circulation, and since they wrote the textbooks, their the experts or the "elite".
      </p>
      <p>
       The money train from textbooks, every year a new revised edition, is just ludicrous and if your textbook says human civilization is 9000 years old, dammit, it's gonna be 9000 years old until you die. And it's big club of these information purveyors, and you ain't in it.

       But wouldn't new information be cause for a new edition, and thus more sales?  Wouldn't it be worse for the textbook company to hide new developments?  Otherwise, why would you ever need to buy a new book?

       New information that doesn't contradict the basic premise. You discover a new room under the Great  Pyramid, call it a tomb and you've  got a new edition of the same book with the same underlying theories. A new element? Ding, ding! Quantum mechanics doesn't overtly challenge Newtonian physics (not my comfort zone, please correct me here if needed).
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you wrote The Book on ancient Egypt. You certainly have information about the origin, construction and purpose of the pyramids, the Sphinx and other structures and the people who built them. All of that can be wiped out by the discovery that those structures are much older. The mere suggestion of that is treated as lunacy, and I think it's entirely the instinct of self preservation at work. It's not just money at stake, but reputation.  What's an academic without their mighty reputation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would bet that whoever wrote the books used in a class on ancient Egypt at Harvard, Oxford, your prestigious universities, is considered one of the preeminent experts in that field of history. To make a statement, even one backed by scientific observation, that contradicts their book is tantamount to heresy.

       Aren't those professors hired by prestigious research universities specifically in order to discover and publish?  These kinds of groundbreaking discoveries are what those guys and institutions live for, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, Newtonian mechanics breaks down at the quantum level, which is why Professors Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, etc. published and sold so many books containing his groundbreaking discoveries in Quantum Theory.

       If it weren't for Atlantis, I wouldn't be on a conspiracy forum today. It was atlantis that led me down this path. I loved the story. I think they know more about Atlantis then we'll ever know. I think Atlantis is the forbidden secret. I think it is the root of a lot of things. Even weapons experimentation and UFOs. It's an interesting story.

       Have you looked into the stories of Lemuria? I think Plato called it "Mu". Its possible that Atlantis had knowledge of nuclear weapons which could explain the ancient blast location in Kashmir.

       After the first atomic tests in New Mexico a strange and previously unknown kind of green glass was found at the blast site that had actually been created by the incredibly intense heat that the explosion created. Hotter than anything imaginable up to that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       That strange new glass wasn't unknown to many geologists, however, although how and why it existed was something they hadn't managed to figure out from any of the identical samples that had been found in over 50 out of the way places around the globe where no atomic testing or explosions have ever occurred as far as anyone knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most obvious but never admitted conclusion was that a nuclear war was fought in some prehistoric past on our planet which would also mean that some  civilizations advanced enough to create atomic weapons would also have had to exist that far back as well.

       There was also the mummified remains of ancient Caucasians that were found in a cave in China that predated the arrival of any Orientals in that region by at least a thousand years or more. Why they were there and where they came from is anyone's guess but there's enough anomalies that point to a global trading network of some kind that existed long before our own history as we know it started.

       Atlantis is a Frequency that connects al. from trees to ants to humans.   The Pharaos know What Atlantis is not where. There is no where. Just what. RA / DIO. The clues were left behind in brand names long ago. RA the black sun god tell you that everything is at least a RA   then DIO connection  SUN to God then universe then loads back the whole universe using a new frequency. The Hyeroglyphics were an even more evil alphabet that you can think of. Just people with their faces hidden stuck in one position. Then fast forward to now and look at the colors of the most popular brands and historical gflags. Who has Yellow and red as their logo? ( Sun hits blood then you go on forever)

       To everyone wanting evidence of Atlantis, please read the book
       <em>
        Cataclysm:Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C
       </em>
       by D S Allan and J B Delair. It presents a mountain of geological, cosmological and mythological evidence that will show almost beyond a doubt that Atlantis was real and was destroyed by some sort of Earth-changing event.

       I wrote up a book review of it last year which can be found

       Examples of evidence are; geological samples over the ages of mountain ranges, sea floors; plant and animals life that on both sides of the Atlantic that could not have made the journey across the ocean; erratic boulders with different magnetic orientation to their surroundings; deposited remains of mega fauna that suggest massive eradication at one point in time. That's just off the top of my head. It's also not including the volume of historical testimonies from cultures in the Americas, Europe and Africa.

       Forgotten Civilization by Robert Schoch is another great book on the subject, although not necessarily about Atlantis. He makes a good case for solar activity being the cause for whatever happened around 9500 BC.

       To be fair though, Plato wasn't describing what he thought was a real place. He was only using a thought experiment, and even then nothing like  what we think of as Atlantis is in any of his writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       In his works
       <em>
        Timaeus
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Critias
       </em>
       it's presented as a shitty island nation with a shitty navy that gets defeated by a more powerful Athenian state. It was a thought experiment. He didn't talk "about an advanced civilization in the Atlantic that helped  bring knowledge and culture to civilizations such as Egypt and Greece."
      </p>
      <p>
       Plato was drawing on traditions and myths of islands that submerged beneath the oceans, but he never talked about their supposed advanced civilization.

       Clearly, you have not read the Timaeus and Critias because your summary is way off base. Plato specifically said he was relaying an actual account passed down to him from Solon, who heard the story from an Egyptian priest in Sais.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, it is clear that Plato had great respect for Atlantic civilization. However, his account states that they became a militaristic, imperialist society, which lead to their downfall. A cautionary tale that could not be more relevant.

       And I can guarantee that regardless of which version they have, I can guess your follow-up question almost word for word.  Are you actually trying to foment discussion on Atlantis, or on sourcing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the Canary Islands and the Basque alone are interesting enough for there to be some plausibility to remnants of an Atlantic island hitting into Europe and possibly North America.

       Yes, I am sure the person analyzed their source versus the original vellum.  That's the only thing that would satisfy you.  And even those are fake, according to you.

       Yes, and so was Jowett, who spent 30 years working on his translation of The Republic alone.

       Well, I suppose we could travel back in time and stop the Romans from sacking and burning the library of Alexandria.

      <p>
       There are around 250 manuscripts of Plato that still survive, from various sources, IIRC. Seems unlikely that the Egyptians or Byzantines just made him up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, it seem unreasonable to expect the original documents he wrote to survive 2,400 years. However, there is plenty of documentation regarding his life that has been passed down and documented through the ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, to play devil's advocate, even if his works were written by someone else, or a group writing under a pseudonym (a la the "Shakespeare" plays), would it make "The Allegory of the Cave" any less insightful or valuable?

       I agree that there is value in the content of these texts, even if they are not as ancient as is claimed.

       It doesn't make it questionable at all. There are plenty of sources documenting ancient history (Josephus, Homer, Diodorus Siculus, Plutarch, the Cistercian monks, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, most of those sites are so remote that they generate almost no tourism dollars. Nan Madol is in Micronesia, and Puma Punku is in a remote part of Bolivia, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if some of them do generate some tourism dollars, that doesn't make them illegitimate. Frankly, the article you posted proves absolutely nothing. I mean, no one confuses the Luxor casino with the actual Giza plateau.

       Again, it is objectively unreasonable to expect original papyrus scrolls to exist for thousands of years. Especially when the largest repository of ancient knowledge in history, the library of Alexandria, was destroyed over a thousand years ago.

       Besides, there are plenty of primary sources from Sumerian cuneiform tablets, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Nag Hammadi gospels, Dead Sea Scrolls, etc. that still exist from ancient times.

       He is also ignoring that we have found dead sea scrolls, we have found cuneiform tablets, we have collateral documents mentioning others texts and we have corroborating archaeological evidence that we put together to create an idea of what happened 1000s of years ago. No one claims this is a complete picture or a completely accurate picture and with new findings and technologies we can refine this picture.

       But step2thejep doesn't much care about any of that. He is here to sell subscriptions to his website where he charges $20+/mo to subscribe to the words of the "world's greatest skeptic" (him, aka John Le Bon). He is trying to impress you with his wisdom so he can slip in a john le bonn link.

       He does not believe in space, planets, stars, a round earth, missiles, wars, all of human history before his lifetime, atoms, molecules, gravity, evolution, dinosaurs, nukes, nuclear power plants, etc etc....

       There are plenty of people on here who have very strong convictions and often without really good evidence for it. Some of them even get a bit aggressive. Fine, to each their own.

       Atlantis was an active civilization 32,000 years ago. They were more advanced than current generation, societally and technologically. they eventually became extinct after a global war which ended up in mass destruction. the earths crust got blown up which led to the slowing of earths spin and then boom, seasons were created.

       If they said it affected it's axis or it's orbit around the sun, I could understand that. But just slowing the earth's rotation isn't gonna do shit about seasons, that would just make for longer days.

       The momentum required to measurably change the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation in a single catastrophe would release enough energy to sterilize the planet. The Earth's tilt likely hasn't changed much in billions of years.

       I'm saying the entire premise that the loss of Atlantis had anything to do with the creation of seasons is complete hogwash.

       The axual tilt likely goes back to proto-planetary collisions long before the appearance of even simple life.

       We can only really, via this site, reference books or videos. Robert Schoch's and John Anthony West's work should speak for itself, putting the Sphinx weathering info pointing to an existence as far back as 10,000BC (this is what Schoch and West could get away with in the Egyptologist world, as far back as they were safely allowed to go where there hypothesis could be marginally entertained). West thinks that with what they were uncovering, the Sphinx could've been but here is a link for more information:

       I mean it does. Sphinx used to be a lion the symbol for Leo as it faces the Leo constellation. The water/rain erosion shows that the sphinx dates back to before 3000BCE, potentially as far back as the last ice age so around 10,000BCE. The face of the sphinx is newer than the body, telling us the Egyptians rebuilt/changed the head of the sphinx to more resemble a dynastic Egyptian head.

       I totally wrote off Atlantis as fiction.  I mean, an entire city just slipping off into the ocean.........
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I saw a short news piece about half of Port Royal slipping off into the ocean over the span of about 6 hours.

       With a 400 ft ride in sea levels after the ice age, it is not a surprise that a whole island city could vanish under the ocean. Seeing as a 15ft rise would make the state of Florida disappear (along with many other big coastal cities).

       Atlantis was real. There was a congressman that joined Congress specifically to look at the library of congress for information about Atlantis. His name is Ignatius Donnelly and he wrote a book about it too. You can bet the government does know about Atlantis.

       The funny part is its gonna happen again.  That's why they build those DUMBs in the mountains for themselves.   Personally I believe it is Sun Cycles / pole shift related which happens regularly and its gonna happen again (that's the real elite secret, and why they treat average people like shit...They think you are already dead meat).

       I'm not opposed to the idea that there once was a civilization that equalled or exceeded us in technology. It doesn't take long for evidence of a defunct civilization to be covered up by water, silt, mud, lava, and remains of carbon-based lifeforms. Mass extinction events more than likely caused mankind to start all over again at least a few times.

       What I find most interesting about Plato's Atlantis stories is Ancient Athenian society. This pre-universal flood society strived for , and seemingly archieved, communal  perfection. Then maintained a stable number of inhabitants, no more than necessary to live peacefully from their land and to be ready for war to defend themselves, which they actually did, against the Atlantis empire no less. I just wish someday the missing dialogues get found.

       Yugioh also talks about this. There's an episode where the Pharaoh (Yugi) meets Dartz (from Atlantis) and Dartz says that Yugi's powers are 5k old, but his are 10k old so he's much more powerful - something like that. There's also the Leviathan (evil force who came from space/meteorite) who brainwashes Dartz and brainwashed Atlantis' civilization to do evil and kill humanity.

       My theory is that, in the epoc of tribal time. before Incas, before greece, china. There was the primitive man. A very large and very organised violation, the first city. Or what i think, the city that was built after the first nomads having wandered around figured the offering of primitive cities were limiting their creative side since early tribal living was even more religiously and dictator like. Basically, they got together and started the first modern city with knowledge of irrigation, domestication, buildings, building first society for the smart humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they ran into a problem, we know all ancient empires ran into. Rise of inequality, rise of delinquency and fall of that way of life for the people to break up and start again elsewhere. I like the Tower of babel in the bible story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because what has pyramids did? It gathered nomads, free roaming hunters gatherers, because those structures could be seen for miles. A structure like that will get attention of people, and man power is needed to build a society. So the first one would have been that tower, one massive (for the time) tower where all the primitive men gathered. And they learned one tongue. Maybe Atlantis was the second such major civilisation. Because we know empires fall, cities fall. Coherent civilised way to teach independent violent hunter gatherer to live in society with all its problems was difficult at first. This atlatis I bet was no doubt one of such primitive hubs. But it had fallen like all others fell. Until enough smart families, and we know intelligence was handed down passed n through blood and wealth of rulers, kings, and religious monarchs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when Atlantis was just one of such ancient societies that fell, but this one was one of the most advanced, knowledge of primitive maths, and construction, and mining, and alchemy(science of physics and chemistry at the time). But power means rulers and rulers means wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       So was probably forces the smart of the early humans to hide somewhere far, try to build smart first city. They failed. But from that societies like tower of babel spread humanity far and wide, and forged early cultures. With different religious upbringing to teach early primitive stupid  brutal man, to live civilised way in a modern society.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took us a while, and even now because so much war and civil falls of empires has lost so much history, perhaps much of it wa hidden, much of it, like vatican style religious libraries were built and burnt. But it wasn't until well organised well built permanent keeping of rock buildings like Greece like Egypt, that written history was kept long enough to benefit man hundreds of years, being taught from faults of the past.

       Personally, I believe civilization was widespread that had high technology (not entirely comparable to what we have currently developed but sophisticated) and the last Ice Age ended in a manner that cause us to basically forget it.  I just don't buy the mainstream stonework arguments or the commonly postulated pre-historic migration patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hancock, Carlson, Bauval, Schoch, Brien Forester pose some really interesting ideas.  A lot of what they throw out there is not necessarily 100% proof of anything and I understand why people stay away because of the alien craziness, but it's a completely reasonable concept in my view that there was something going on in the past and many of our mythologies and religious texts are echoes of forgotten times.
      </p>
      <p>
       The somewhat baseless ideas that I feel drawn to:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The Atlantean culture Plato referenced and that was passed down through Egyptian knowledge keepers extended from South America to Rapa Nui, even as far as New Zealand.  They were sea farers and the home base was in modern South America. In the context of the greater globe, considering what wasn't frozen, that's the landmass the size of Libya (Ancient context) sitting right smack dab in the Atlantic (What they deemed as the entire greater ocean, so what we look at as all oceans outside the Mediterranean)
       </li>
       <li>
        India was another pre-deluge hub and depending on how you view their historical text, there's a possibility they had flying devices.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Ancient culture may have gone to the moon.  People look too far into Martian rock formations and whatnot but the reason why I think we don't go back and why the original astronauts looked so dejected upon their return wasn't space travel haze or because it was a hoax.  They got there and realized they weren't the first.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Again, it's more my personal beliefs but I think there really is something more than what was suppose happened in the ancient past.

       Sorry for being so late to this thread. If you would like to see Atlantis, it didn't sink. Destroyed yes but not sunk. It's been out in the open this whole time. If you go to google earth and search for the "eye of sahara" you can see what's  left.

       Read a book called
       <em>
        Cataclysm: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C
       </em>
       by D S Allan and J B Delair. The contains a mountain of hard evidence pointing to the very probable existence of a global civilisation and an event that destroyed it. It's nothing but hard, referenced and verifiable science.

       You want him to write a research paper? Read 'Atlantis: The Antediluvian World' by Ignatius Donnelly, 'Atlantis Discovered' by Lewis Spence and 'The Secret of Atlantis', by Otto Muck. These 3 pieces of literature seem the most sound as to actually lrove the case that Atlantis existed as an advanced society.

       What's outlandish about citing Plato's detailed account of an advanced civilization in Atlantis. Check out the Timaeus and Critias. It's all in there. Lemuria/Mu would be another lost civilization that has been hidden.

       Just gonna throw it out there that the pyramids are still extremely guarded.  There are certain "elites" that know more than they reveal as they have had access to portions of the site that are off limits to the public.  it's not an unprecedented notion.

       Well it was more than just floods. The floods were just an aftereffect of the asteroids impacts.
