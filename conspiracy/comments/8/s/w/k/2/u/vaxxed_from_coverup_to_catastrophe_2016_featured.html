<p>MTHFR mutation affects detoxification. Methylation is required to produce glutathione, which is one of the major molecules in a detoxification cycle, but if you don’t methylate properly, you won’t be able to detoxify properly, so what this can lead to is a higher susceptibility to heavy metal toxicity and toxicity from any source like pesticides, other environmental toxins and pollutants, mold toxicity, toxicity from lipopolysaccharide or any other bacterial or pathogen-based toxin – so just in a general, an increased susceptibility to toxic overload because the body is not able to detoxify properly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An excerpt from my paper on the neurological effects of vaccines that I just posted:</p>

<p>According to Dórea, who wrote a paper on the neurological effects of  Thimerosal, studies involving mice have demonstrated that exposure to  aluminum adjuvants and Thimerosal are consistently correlated with  neurological damage. He stated that, “it is worth mentioning that the  brain of adult mice can accumulate substantial amounts of Al derived  from vaccines . . . indeed, adjuvant-Al provoked significant impairments  in motor functions and diminished spatial memory capacity” (927-938).</p>

<p>Dórea, José,G. &quot;Integrating Experimental (in Vitro and in Vivo)  Neurotoxicity Studies of Low- Dose Thimerosal Relevant to Vaccines.&quot; <em>Neurochemical Research</em>, vol. 36, no. 6, 2011,  pp. 927-38*, Agricultural &amp; Environmental Science Database; ProQuest Central*,  <a href="https://login.proxy.kennesaw.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy">https://login.proxy.kennesaw.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy</a>.  kennesaw.edu/docview/864085346?accountid=11824. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>broken link. may have to screen shot content, if its behind a wall  </p>

<p>im not saying Thimerosal is safe, but i did once hear a talk by someone who was anti-vaccine who made a good case for why Thimerosal is not the root cause </p>

<p>its almost as if they use Thimerosal as a red-herring to distract you from all of the other ingredients </p>

<p>for example, if you Google &quot;are vaccines safe?&quot;, you may get an answer like, &quot;yes Thimerosal is safe&quot;, while not addressing the rest of the vaccine ingredients </p>

<p>Thimerosal and Aluminum together create what is known as synergistic toxicity </p>

<p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mercury+aliminum+synergestic+toxicitiy">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mercury+aliminum+synergestic+toxicitiy</a> </p>

<p>bear in mind that the purpose of the adjuvant (aluminum) is to instigate a more robust immune response</p>

<p>but it sensitizes the immune system to all of the ingredients in the vaccine </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunologic_adjuvant">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunologic_adjuvant</a></p>

<p>which is why vaccines cause anaphylaxis </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think heavy metal adjuvants, while likely being dangerous, are a bit of a red herring.  MMR has always been the vaccine most implicated in autism cases and it doesnt contain aluminum or thimerosal. V.K. Singh did a couple good studies on MMR and found that autistic children produced an abnormally shaped antibody to the measles component of the vaccine. This antibody also happened to &quot;fit&quot; into the myelin sheathing of nerve cells, notably in the brain, flagging these cells for attack by the bodies own immune system. Its a great explanation of why autism is actually an autoimmune disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To my understanding the whole issue with vaccination is they find the 1 thing that they need to address to solve the issue. Find the way to synthesize that 1 thing into your drug, or vaccine in this case, and sell it. </p>

<p>Problem is things are way more interconnected in the body. Your gut biome and every other microorganism that makes you you are all intricately connected in how they check and balance one another. Finding the X in your problem is good, but they they only address variable x and the equation looks more like health = (x)(y)(z) is setting yourself up for failure (or the ability to sell more solutions to these &quot;side affects&quot;). When healthcare is for profit, you can see the rabbit hole begin to open here. </p>

<p>So yeah they put X in your vaccine, congrats you can&#39;t get polio now. What are ALL the other ingredients doing in your vaccine? That&#39;s where the science gets muddy and tainted by... capitalism. </p>

<p>When vaccines were first introduced in 18th century, population control wasn&#39;t yet an issue.</p>

<p>The vaccine delusion probably started as the delusion of <strong>scientism</strong>. Blind faith that science will save us. They were desperately seeking to prove their preconceptions.</p>

<p>Also, the corporate interests of the medical profession no doubt played a role. To give doctors more power.</p>

<p><em>The Introduction of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Oral Polio Vaccine Among Young Infants in an Urban African Community: A Natural Experiment</em></p>

<p>Søren Wengel Mogensen,a,1 Andreas Andersen,b,1 Amabelia Rodrigues,a Christine S Benn,b,c and Peter Aabya,b,</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We examined the introduction of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) in an urban community in Guinea-Bissau in the early 1980s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The child population had been followed with 3-monthly nutritional weighing sessions since 1978. From June 1981 DTP and OPV were offered from 3 months of age at these sessions. Due to the 3-monthly intervals between sessions, the children were allocated by birthday in a ‘natural experiment’ to receive vaccinations early or late between 3 and 5 months of age. We included children who were &lt; 6 months of age when vaccinations started and children born until the end of December 1983. We compared mortality between 3 and 5 months of age of DTP-vaccinated and not-yet-DTP-vaccinated children in Cox proportional hazard models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among 3–5-month-old children, having received DTP (± OPV) was associated with a mortality hazard ratio (HR) of 5.00 (95% CI 1.53–16.3) compared with not-yet-DTP-vaccinated children. Differences in background factors did not explain the effect. The negative effect was particularly strong for children who had received DTP-only and no OPV (HR = 10.0 (2.61–38.6)). All-cause infant mortality after 3 months of age increased after the introduction of these vaccines (HR = 2.12 (1.07–4.19)).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>DTP was associated with increased mortality</strong>; OPV may modify the effect of DTP.</p>

<p>Ok, I have no understanding of science? Oh ok Doc, here is where i know you are full of shit. Aluminium and mercury have no know biological uses in the body, non whatsoever, I dare you to link me to a study that says they do. In fact there is plenty of irrefutable evidence that they cause harm, I know this because i looked at the 147 studies that i linked, that you seem to dismiss like they dont exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s flawed in that the groups that were unvaccinated were far less better off financially, and thus more prone to dying. Not to mentipn the sample sizes are tiny, and the end result of the study didnt even show that vaccines somehow cause people to die more. And aluminum has been shown to have no negative effects on the body when in trace amounts, and only comes in trace amounts. Mercury is not only no longer used in vaccines, but it has 0 correlation or causation with autism. You&#39;ve been brainwashed by pseudoscience and your batshit crazy fellow antivaxxer echo chamber. </p>

<p>The problem is the safety standards are appalling and unscientific, assumption based not evidence based, and vaccines are likely causing more harm than good, but they the industry refuses point blank to refuse studies to compare the harm against benefit, they only look for benefit.</p>

<p>You are right, this is not a case the &#39;anti-vaxxer&#39; not researching both sides, everyone gets the pro side of the story, then has to research to balance it out, but most will never research the other side and always assume the pro side is all evidence and fact based.</p>

<p>heres a better idea</p>

<p>lets make it so vaccines are opt-in, as opposed to opt-out</p>

<p>lets make it so multi-vaccines can&#39;t be given</p>

<p>lets make it so every vaccine has mandatory follow-up to check for titers </p>

<p>lets tax and regulate vaccine quackery like we do tobacco and alcohol</p>

<p>some common sense vaccine quackery control: </p>

<p>if you want a vaccine, you have to be 21 years of age, passed a class on understanding the side effects of vaccines, and have passed a background check and a 3 day waiting period </p>

<p>And those are events that GET reported to VAERS. I would say the vast majority of vaccine reactions do NOT get reported to the system like they are supposed to, since either the doctor or parent doesn&#39;t know about VAERS and doesn&#39;t push the issue, or the doctor/medical professional won&#39;t admit it was vaccine damage (the VAST majority of the time). I&#39;ve read countless stories of children having seizures hours after a vaccine and doctors still never admitting it had anything to do with the vaccine and thus never reporting it to VAERS. 
And mild reactions such as eczema/a new allergy never get reported. I would bet the 65,000+ events reported in the system is only a fraction of how many adverse events happen. So that would not be 99.99999%. </p>

<p>you can continue to deny that vaccines cause side effects, but pics like the one below are going viral on the internet today. i just saw this pic for the first time a few days ago but it already had thousands of views, shares, comments etc </p>

<p>So I feel comfortable in telling you, you are goddamn terrible at changing people&#39;s minds. All of your posts consist of little to no actual information and statistics, which is pretty bad in and of itself, but even your language is off-putting to people wanting to know more about the subject. Questioning bad arguments makes me a member of the &quot;vaccine cult&quot;? Questioning it makes me immediately a member of the bad guys, trying to cover up the little man spreading the Truth? I have something to hide?</p>

<p>Your language and arguments make <em>you</em> feel good, and make people who <em>already agree</em> with you feel good, but I went into this genuinely wanting you to provide some evidence for your claims, because for all I know maybe it IS only 1% of injuries that are reported. And I left it with a belief that anti-vaccine people are paranoid assholes who argue using image macros. </p>

<p><em>The Introduction of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Oral Polio Vaccine Among Young Infants in an Urban African Community: A Natural Experiment</em></p>

<p>Søren Wengel Mogensen,a,1 Andreas Andersen,b,1 Amabelia Rodrigues,a Christine S Benn,b,c and Peter Aabya,b,</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>We examined the introduction of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) in an urban community in Guinea-Bissau in the early 1980s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The child population had been followed with 3-monthly nutritional weighing sessions since 1978. From June 1981 DTP and OPV were offered from 3 months of age at these sessions. Due to the 3-monthly intervals between sessions, the children were allocated by birthday in a ‘natural experiment’ to receive vaccinations early or late between 3 and 5 months of age. We included children who were &lt; 6 months of age when vaccinations started and children born until the end of December 1983. We compared mortality between 3 and 5 months of age of DTP-vaccinated and not-yet-DTP-vaccinated children in Cox proportional hazard models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among 3–5-month-old children, having received DTP (± OPV) was associated with a mortality hazard ratio (HR) of 5.00 (95% CI 1.53–16.3) compared with not-yet-DTP-vaccinated children. Differences in background factors did not explain the effect. The negative effect was particularly strong for children who had received DTP-only and no OPV (HR = 10.0 (2.61–38.6)). All-cause infant mortality after 3 months of age increased after the introduction of these vaccines (HR = 2.12 (1.07–4.19)).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>DTP was associated with increased mortality</strong>; OPV may modify the effect of DTP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is the entire theory behind vaccination unsound, so the only way it is possible for immune cells to recognize antigens is via an entire disease-causing particle? And not even a weakened version of that disease causing particle, it has to be the entire unmodified disease-causing particle because that&#39;s the only way for the immune system to work. Is everyone that works in immunology just lying, everyone who ever got better from cancer via immunotherapy just lying, everyone who does any research on the immune system paid off by big pharma to come up with made up fairy tales to explain how their made up system works?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would need to look at the actual omitted data and the reason why it was omitted. For every variable you add to make subgroups you analyze smaller, in this case the group is separated by race, age, and gender, the easier it is to &quot;p-hack&quot; statistically significant data from a larger data set. Take for example <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/p-hacking">the economy based on who is in charge.</a>. By playing with the variables you can easily make the data set say Republicans make the economy better, OR Democrats make the economy better, at a high level of significance. However if you include all the factors that statistical significance disappears. </p>

<p>To qualify this for medicine, there are indeed racial differences in diseases. However, you have to look at the base rate at which diseases occur in the population if you want to say that the data clearly shows a relationship for this specific population. Now if there were a bunch of other papers pointing specifically to African American Boys under 3 years of age as having a weird increase in autism in association with vaccination, then you have a pattern starting to emerge that becomes concerning. The question then is why for every one of those variables, why AA and not another race, why boys and not girls, why under 3 and not over, and the end result after a dozen or so papers conclusively proving the relationship is real is maybe African American boys should not get vaccinated under the age of 3 if it turns out that the harm from autism outweighs the benefits of disease prevention. That would be another dozen papers conclusively analyzing the risk-benefit ratio for this specific scenario. A scientist working on this could milk a lot of grant money from the CDC to prove this if he produces consistently good work, that no one else can dispute because it&#39;s done entirely according to protocol.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between using proteins as ingredients and using proteins as a growing medium, but either way children with known egg allergies aren&#39;t supposed to get flu vaccinations. MMR is grown on egg-based cultures too, hence why children known to have severe reactions to eggs are supposed to stay in the hospital for an hour in case any reaction does happen. If anything does happen you give them an epipen and antihistamines and that blocks the rest of the allergic response. Some more science on how allergies work, allergies come about from your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_E">IgE antibodies</a>, which have nothing to fight because they&#39;re designed to target worms and other parasites, latching onto harmless proteins and sensitizing your IgE lined mast cells to those proteins. Mast cells produce the hormone histamine, which is why we give people with allergies antihistamines. The more exposure to a wide variety of allergens, the less likely an allergy is to actually occur because the IgE-producing cells start recognizing those allergens as harmless. That or you can infect someone with worms and then IgE antibodies that actually work on the worms will be selected for and mass produced while all the other IgE antibodies that attack peanut proteins won&#39;t have any mast cells to bind to. I do not recommend giving your kids worms so they don&#39;t get allergies.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Babies get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_A">IgA antibodies</a> from their mother&#39;s breast milk. IgA <em>antibodies</em>, not antigens, provide passive immune function to defend against pathogens, lining the gut tissue so if any potential bugs come in contact with the gut lining, they get neutralized by all of the antibodies the babies ate. IgA antibodies are most commonly made in mucous membranes as the dimeric secreted form, which means that if an antibody is a &quot;Y&quot; shape, the tail of 2 &quot;Y&quot;s get stuck together to make an &quot;X&quot;. Why this matters for adaptive immunity is because that tail is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_crystallizable_region">Fc region</a>, that actually binds to receptors on cells. Antigens link to the prongs and the tail of the antibody sockets into a cell that responds to having its socket filled. Like an on/off switch. Secreted IgA antibodies can&#39;t do this, they can only clog up antigens and hope that making a physical barrier of IgA &quot;X&quot;s is enough to stop any virus or bacteria in its tracks.</p>

<p>You have the two concepts reversed. Mothers are the ones insulating the baby&#39;s immature immune system, because any antigens that come in contact with IgA antibodies never make it to any immune-system organs in the baby&#39;s sterile fluids(blood/lymph), like the thymus. </p>

<p>Antigens that do get in the blood get recognized not by IgA antibodies, but by single-unit &quot;Y&quot; shaped IgG antibodies. When you get a shot of antivenom because a snake bit you and injected all of its proteins into your blood, the antivenom is actually purified horse blood full of horse IgG antibodies to those venom proteins. This is passive, so once those IgG antibodies get used up, you&#39;re no longer counteracting the venom. IgG antibodies are also capable of crossing the placenta, so all of the IgG antibodies from the mom are what keeps a baby&#39;s blood protective for the first 6 months of its life. After that point a baby is on its own, making its own antibodies.</p>

<p>Now how do you make make your own IgG antibodies? We have &quot;naive&quot; B cells(The B is for bone marrow, where they were first isolated) sitting in our lymphoid organs with antibodies slotted all over their membranes. As the B-cell makes antibodies, it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D)J_recombination">randomly slams a bunch of antibody parts together</a> so every antibody it makes is unique, which is what allows it to recognize and bind specific antigens. If an antigen is a billion copies of a single key, B-cells are covered with a million different locks hoping that one of them will fit that single key. If one of those locks fits, then that lock gets absorbed back into the B-cell and now the B-cell makes a copies of itself that each make a million copies of that lock and they all release all of those locks to float freely into the bloodstream. The floating lock is an IgG antibody. After no more keys appear the copies slowly kill themselves until you&#39;re left with a few remaining B-cells who lie in wait for the next time the keys show up so they can clone themselves and make a fuckton of locks. This is how you become immune to diseases. This system, which I massively simplified because explaining how the B-cell &quot;knows&quot; which lock to copy and how to clone itself is an entire graduate immunology course, is what we manipulate to create vaccines.</p>

<p>So what are vaccines then? It depends on what kind. Some are basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subunit">the keys by themselves</a>, which have iffy effectiveness because why freak out and make a trillion lock copies for a key if that key isn&#39;t associated with anything bad? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus-like_particle">Some are the keys studded onto fake cells</a> that kind of resemble actual pathogens but have nothing inside of them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attenuated_vaccine">Some vaccines</a> are actually the pathogen with its keys all over it ready to do whatever the key is supposed to do normally (bind to stuff, tell white blood cells to fuck off, it&#39;s hard being blind and having specialized knives being the only way you can interact with things around you), but it&#39;s been weakened in some way so even though the keys work, the pathogen doesn&#39;t. That or the pathogen is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inactivated_vaccine">just straight up dead</a>. Some aren&#39;t even keys you can find on the pathogen, but the pathogen makes poisons that can be recognized as keys, but we don&#39;t want to actually inject poison into you so we took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoid">part of the poison that&#39;s recognizeable as a key and inject that into you.</a>.</p>

<p>How do we know which one works the best? Trial and error. Just test it and if it works, hey we got a working vaccine even if theoretically this other method could work better.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunologic_adjuvant#Inorganic_adjuvants">Now about all the other shit we put in with vaccines,</a> we don&#39;t actually know how they work but they haven&#39;t been proven to fuck anyone up so far so whatever. If human experimentation was legal we could just inject a bunch of death-row inmates full of aluminum salts, see exactly what happens, and determine if it&#39;s actually dangerous, but alas, modern science is constrained by ethics.</p>

<p>Yup, this is pretty much what I do.</p>

<p>Evidence that Dr. Thompson&#39;s testimony of evidence tampering and destruction is false, or that their results were a false positive. This should be carried out by neutral groups, i.e not funded by pharma companies.</p>

<p>On paper, I agree with this, but considering the state of medical journals, especially peer review, even this would not be enough unless we could establish a clear lack of bias. </p>

<p>Double blind randomized control trials have no bias if randomization, blinding, and data analysis were performed correctly, which is why I specified high impact journals with adequate peer review. Journals like Nature and the NEJM will not publish unless papers meet the criteria.</p>

<p>Testimonies are anecdotal evidence. There were thousands of testimonies of people suffering from MSG-induced headaches and there still are but when actual double-blind RCT studies were performed it was proven to be placebo effect.</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s unethical to give people ineffective prophylaxis for potential permanent damage. It&#39;s the same reason why in experimental cancer drug trials they use standard chemotherapy without the new substance as the control treatment or AZT as the control for AIDS treatment. It&#39;s called an active control. Still acceptable as evidence because of blinding(which reduces bias) and randomization(which reduces confounding factors).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an excellent documentary, great to see it available here.  Below I&#39;m going to provide a quick red pill of information on the vaccine situation for anyone would like it.</p>

<p>Once one learns what is really going on, we discover that unfortunately the science is not settled as the industry refuses to fund the necessary studies to find out if vaccines are bringing a net benefit overall, the industry doesn&#39;t want to find the harm their products cause as it can mean loss of confidence, sales and also huge compensation payouts. So what they do is whitewash their products, data is played with, statistics are used to lie.</p>

<p>For example the honest experts are so sick of Big Pharma for not funding any proper studies into the safety of injecting Aluminum, that now they are crowdfunding for over $600,000 to perform the trials.</p>

<p>For those from a scientific background I&#39;d strongly recommend the presentations given at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VaccineSafetyConf/videos">Vaccine Safety Conference</a></p>

<p>The rest is a general starter pack for people who want to learn more:-</p>

<p>&quot;This new study demonstrates that vaccines can affect brain development via immune activation. Hence, the immune activation experiments are relevant to vaccines…The hep B vaccine increased IL-6 in the hippocampus (the only brain region analyzed for cytokines).&quot;</p>

<p>The authors noted that the HBV mice showed “significantly increased” IL-6, which we know is a biomarker for autism.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated.&quot;</p>

<p>Follow the money!! (see below)</p>

<p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just posted a paper that I wrote for school about vaccine ingredients if you&#39;re interested. One fascinating thing is that the MMR vaccine that Dr. William Thompson studied at the CDC does not contain Thimerosol or aluminum adjuvants, yet they determined in the study that it causes neurological damage.</p>

<p>I feel that it is incorrect to say that vaccines cause autism. It&#39;s more accurate to say that vaccines cause neurological damage and it is being diagnosed as autism because doctors believe that it is some unique condition and they don&#39;t understand what is causing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Research has identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) as the specific cytokine responsible for autism; IL-6 is stimulated by vaccine adverse reactions (fever, seizures). IL-6 causes all three autism traits (social impairment, speech impairment and compulsive behavior), and damage to specific brain structures (e.g., the cerebellum) known to be damaged in human autism. Both prenatal and postnatal surges of IL-6 can cause autism. Immune activation during brain development has also been shown to cause schizophrenia, seizure disorders, and ADHD.</p>

<p>Immune Activation</p>

<p>A developing brain can be damaged when the immune system is activated by a vaccine. Immune activation has been researched extensively and is proven to cause autism and other brain damage.</p>

<p>In early life, the brain and immune system develop together. Communication chemicals (“cytokines”) used by the immune system also guide brain development. Immune activation causes surges in cytokine production; cytokine surges during brain development cause permanent brain damage and mental illnesses. The brain-damaging effects of immune activation have been studied extensively. The science is high quality and there is a lot of it. It is well-known that vaccines cause immune activation and can cause surges of many different cytokines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>most of the following from <a href="/u/vaccinepapers">/u/vaccinepapers</a>  , vaccinepapers.org</p>

<p>Research has identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) as the specific cytokine responsible for autism; IL-6 is stimulated by vaccine adverse reactions (fever, seizures). IL-6 causes all three autism traits (social impairment, speech impairment and compulsive behavior), and damage to specific brain structures (e.g., the cerebellum) known to be damaged in human autism. Both prenatal and postnatal surges of IL-6 can cause autism. Immune activation during brain development has also been shown to cause schizophrenia, seizure disorders, and ADHD.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907982">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907982</a></p>

<p>*=====================================</p>

<p>In scientific experiments, dosages of 100mcg/kg, 300mcg/kg, and 550mcg/kg Al adjuvant cause neuron death, muscle weakness, learning and memory impairment, and pathological behavior changes in animals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17114826</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740540">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19740540</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932735">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23932735</a></p>

<p>Dosage of 550mcg/kg also caused excessive weight gain (a sign of metabolic disorder). All 3 dosages (100, 300 and 550mcg/kg) also caused numerous signs of nerve damage (observable by microscopy and biochemical changes) and/or abnormal anxious behavior.</p>

<p>All these results together are conclusive evidence of brain damage caused by the same dosages (mcg/kg) human infants receive according to the US vaccine schedule.</p>

<p>Vaccine advocates argue that injected Al adjuvant is safe, based on studies of ingested Al salts. This is unscientific because ingesting Al salts and injecting Al nanoparticles present very different risks. Both the route of administration and the chemical forms are different.</p>

<p>Recent experiments prove that Al adjuvant is transported into the brain by white blood cells. This explains why injected Al adjuvant can be more dangerous to the brain than ingested Al salts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557144">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557144</a></p>

<p>Vaccine advocates like Paul Offit make false statements about Al toxicity studies. The studies show that ingested Al is harmful at dosages less than half of what advocates claim to be safe.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Immune Activation</p>

<p>A developing brain can be damaged when the immune system is activated by a vaccine. Immune activation has been researched extensively and is proven to cause autism and other brain damage.</p>

<p>In early life, the brain and immune system develop together. Communication chemicals (“cytokines”) used by the immune system also guide brain development. Immune activation causes surges in cytokine production; cytokine surges during brain development cause permanent brain damage and mental illnesses. The brain-damaging effects of immune activation have been studied extensively. The science is high quality and there is a lot of it. It is well-known that vaccines cause immune activation and can cause surges of many different cytokines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cover-up is definitely wrong, and the information should have been released up front, but if we didn&#39;t do vaccinations the rate of polio, smallpox, and other diseases cured by vaccination would surely ruin more lives than if we hadn&#39;t done them right? I&#39;m not exactly pro or anti vaccination, but I&#39;m curious about whether the end justifies the means for the average person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are asking a reasonable question. The answer is complicated but you are assuming that all diseases we vaccinate for had a high mortality. Diseases like Chickenpox and Rotavirus are usually not serious and Rubella is an issue in pregnant women so there is no reason to vaccinate  a baby for it.</p>

<p>Hep B is rarely a problem for infants unless the parents are at risk of being Hep B carriers.</p>

<p>There is also a difference between not-vaccinating at all, making vaccines safer, delaying vaccination or selectively vaccinating for certain diseases that are serious.</p>

<p>It is not just a black white issue of vaccinating or not vaccinating, this is what the media wants you to believe but making vaccination safe.</p>

<p>One of the problems with the current vaccine schedule is that the pharmaceutical industry does not care about the safety of their product and we are over-vaccinating very young children and babies.</p>

<p>Another thing that you are not being told by the media is that most of the impact that vaccination had is exaggerated. The mortality from these diseases had already declined a lot before vaccination was even introduced. In fact it is shocking how small the impact on mortality was.</p>

<p>The vaccinators convinced society that all reduction in infectious disease was due to vaccination which is not true.</p>

<p>The also tend to exaggerate the risk of infectious disease. Even harmless viruses can kill you when you are sick or immunosuppressed but this has not so much to do with the virus but with your general health. We can not vaccinate for every germ that is out there.</p>

<p>Before we had mumps vaccine the chance of getting mumps and dying from it was maybe 1 in 50000. Virtually no one ever died from it and the ones that died usually had another health problem and illness.</p>

<p>Back in the sixties we got maybe 5 doses of vaccines and children would not be expected to die or be crippled from an infectious disease. Today we give over 70 doses to children and teenagers.</p>

<p>Do the children that got 70 doses lived  longer and better than the ones that got only 5 doses? I would say not.</p>

<p>In fact the opposite seems to be true. A shockingly high percentage of children today have either a mental or physical chronic illness.</p>

<p>So what we need to do is:</p>

<p>Study why and how vaccines can harm.</p>

<p>Attempt to make them as safe as possible</p>

<p>Give only vaccines when the risk of the disease is serious</p>

<p>Space the vaccines out and do not give all at once</p>

<p>delay vaccines if possible and do not overvaccinate babies</p>

<p>get big pharma influence out of vaccine science</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did watch it.  Twice.  I like anything that pulls a perceived curtain away from the public’s eye.  How do you see religion disguised as science in vaccinations? Because it’s widely accepted and those who don’t adhere are persecuted? I suppose we could be even be likened to Christian pro-lifers rallying for the sake of a child’s life that’s not theirs. That’s interesting, I’m definitely open to that idea and think it’s worth pondering.  You’ve read thousands of studies and spent years learning about the problem. Thousands of studies.  Being well aware of what “studies” are available I don’t even know why I am typing this but if you could link a few I sure would be open to leaving the church. But I too have read articles and small poorly peer-reviewed hypothetical theses and they don’t compare to the “religious texts” on my end, at least yet. Either way I wish the best for you and your children (?) and I hope the frustrating and painful confusions of human health that you are searching for the answers for (and maybe blame as well) can find you peacefully.

<p>Simply because people blindly believe the experts (priests) without questioning the statistics and vaccination. People choose to believe without checking the facts themselves. Blind trust.</p>

<p>Is the pharmaceutical industry super shitty?  Yeah.  Should we encourage the scientific community to research, publish and review data regarding vaccines?  Sure!  Does this mean that vaccines are evil or should be neglected?  No, absolutely not.</p>

<p>Vaccines as a whole have done unbelievably amazing things for the world.  From the eradication of Polio and Smallpox, to providing a means of surviving a Rabies infection, it was best said by Randall Munroe:  &quot;The heroes of [The medical field] have slain one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot;.  That is remarkably true, and in a crusade to attempt to reign in the pharma industry, it&#39;s as important to remember that Vaccines in and of themselves are some of the most important pieces of human progress in history.</p>

<p>If the goal here is to hold the pharmaceutical industry responsible for their bullshit, then please do that, but do not do what most of the Anti-vax movement and point to Vaccines as the problem.  Demonize Pharma, not vaccines.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as an anti-vax movement. It is made up by the media. The majority wants that the governments  address vaccine safety problems. Since this is not being done people are forced into avoiding vaccinations. Then they claim people are anti-vax. If vaccine safety problems would be addressed few people would be vaccine hesitant. </p>

<p>Smallpox went away because of economic changes not because of mass vaccination programs this is what even the people who ran the smallpox programs said.</p>

<p>Polio is not eradicated.</p>

<p>The polio program was not as much of a success as people believe we still have thousands of cases of paralysis each year. A good part of the success was due to diagnostic changes and renaming it.</p>

<p>India which eradicated Polio had reported 20000 cass of Polio before they began the mass vaccination program. Now they have 0 Polio cases but 50000 AFP(A polio like illness twice as deadly)</p>

<p>Stop drinking the Kool-Aid. </p>

<p>Statistics show that the average lifespan was not changed by vaccination at all. It is a delusion that we live longer because of vaccination. </p>

<p>Of course some vaccines can prevent disease. Great. Nothing wrong with this but they did not save us from the dark ages.</p>

<p>I agree that pharma is the main problem here not vaccination per se but today it becomes nearly impossible to separate vaccination and pharma propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on dude, you cannot simultaneously claim &#39;There is no Anti-Vax Movement&#39; and then insist that Smallpox &#39;went away&#39; due to economic changes.  No disease in recorded history has &#39;went away&#39; due to &#39;economic conditions&#39;.</p>

<p>Diseases vanish because we deal with the problem in some way.  Our water doesn&#39;t carry Cholera, Malaria, or Trachoma because we treat it.  We don&#39;t get E Coli, Salmonella or Staph infections from our food because we cook it.  We don&#39;t get Whooping Cough, Measles or Hepatitis because we vaccinate for it.  &#39;Money&#39; does not solve disease.  Solutions solve disease.  Those solutions often cost money to research and distribute.</p>

<p>Regarding Life expectancy:  What you say is generally true regarding raw numbers, but it&#39;s important to understand that Life Expectancy didn&#39;t go up because we got really good at treating and preventing disease en masse.  It went up because Infant Mortality went way, way down (partially because we can treat and prevent diseases, but partially because we suck a lot less at handling birth, and also sanitation.)</p>

<p>There were 22 cases of Polio reported in 2017.  It&#39;s not Capital-E &#39;Eradicated&#39;, but what was a massive, scary epidemic has been nearly reduced to a statistical footnote.</p>

<p>As for India, it represents a really interesting discussion point:  How do we deal with risks associated with Vaccines?  Well, in areas where vaccine-derived polio which have been problematic in the past two decades, the more problematic strain has been removed from the oral vaccine as of 2016, with a plan to <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-015-1114-6">remove the oral vaccine</a> entirely from circulation and instead distribute the injected vaccine which has demonstrably fewer complications.</p>

<p>No one is claiming that Vaccines are 100% perfect - Some carry real risks, like the oral polio vaccine.  Others like the whooping cough vaccine have questionable effectiveness after a decade or so, but that&#39;s part of the imperfect science that is epidemiology.  Those in the field generally do their best, and yes, phrama companies suck and this should not be profit center at all, but the problems with vaccines isn&#39;t some cover-up or secret.  <a href="http://www.who.int/features/qa/64/en/">The WHO reports on it</a>.  <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-015-1114-6">Solid independant researches reports on it</a>.  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/vaccine-derived-poliovirus-faq.html">The CDC reports on it</a>.  Even organizations who&#39;s sole purpose is to eradicate polio <a href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-prevention/the-virus/vaccine-derived-polio-viruses/">reports on it</a>. It is well known, and well reported that vaccines aren&#39;t perfect and those doing good work trying to improve lives and provide real medical care to those who need are working to improve it (and we see those improvements all the time).</p>

<p>This is the nature of every science.  We get as close as we can.  We try to find a best solution and very often these scientists do a really good job, but it doesn&#39;t mean &#39;perfection&#39;, and in the light of imperfection, we iterate in hopes of more closely approaching perfection.  To that end, the discussion we should be having is &#39;How are companies leveraging something as important as medicine as a profit center, and what can we do to prevent that?&#39;.  Again, it&#39;s so important to repeat:  Vaccines are not the problem.  They have made an immeasurably positive impact on society. There is no grand cover-up of their risks as demonstrated clearly above.  If you want to make a positive impact, then get vaccinated and then be mad that it might not be covered by insurance, or that you might have to pay a ridiculous sum of money.  Be mad enough to write your representative declaring the Health Care industry a sham, that pharma companies should be responsible for their actions and that necessary medical care should not be a profit center.</p>

<p>The scariest disease caused by a virus or bacteria that I have to worry about is the common cold, and maybe influenza.  That is an absurdity even 100 years ago and for that I have two things to thank:  Sanitation and Vaccines.</p>

<p>Many did. Not all. Lack of poverty leads to reduction of many diseases. This is historical fact.</p>

<p>Here is what the WHO smallpox expert said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If people are worried about endemic smallpox,</strong> <strong><em>it disappeared from this country not because of our mass herd immunity.</em></strong>  <strong>It disappeared because of our economic development.  And that&#39;s why it disappeared from Europe and many other countries, and it will not be sustained here, even if there were several importations, I&#39;m sure.</strong> <strong><em>It&#39;s not from universal vaccination</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>No disease in recorded history has &#39;went away&#39; due to &#39;economic conditions? Really? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It went up because Infant Mortality went way, way down (partially because we can treat and prevent diseases, but partially because we suck a lot less at handling birth, and also sanitation.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Infant mortality mostly declined NOT because of vaccination. Vaccination did not affect our lifespans in any meaningful way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We still have thousands of Polio like cases even in the US each year that would have been diagnosed as Polio before we had the vaccine. Polio virus associated polio is gone but a lot of &quot;Polio&quot; that we had before the vaccine was not even Polio virus associated Polio.</p>

<p>Children are still being crippled by Polio-like illness we just renamed the cases. That why it appears that Polio is completely absent while it is not.</p>

<p>In India the reported cases of Polio-like illness are HIGHER than before we started the vaccination program. We hear that more children are being crippled than before we started vaccination.</p>

<p>How can we say we eradicated it? Yes it is true we do not see any wild polio-virus associated cases anymore but paralysis is as common as ever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no grand cover-up of their risks as demonstrated clearly above. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no need to cover up the risks as the proper studies to figure out real risks are not being done. Never have been done. There is no large study that studies long term health outcomes of the childhood vaccination program. <strong>Studies that compare the health of vaccinated children to the health of unvaccinated children DO NOT EXIST.</strong></p>

<p>The childhood vaccination program is a grand uncontrolled and ongoing experiment. Fact.</p>

You respond with unverifiable quotes from an unnamed someone and a poorly written article from a website who exists to serve the Anti-Vax movement.  In your head that&#39;s probably some kind of victory condition, but you demonstrate a kind of hopelessness that makes me literally cry for the human race and I can not deal.</p>

<p>I can only hope you and others understand the importance of the research community as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; Yes I do, because again, just having money doesn&#39;t make diseases go away </p>

<p>hint: economic development does not just mean having a lot of money. It means bigger houses, more food, better access to medical care, better education and many other things.</p>

<p>If you do not understand or accept this any further information will be a waste of time.</p>

<p>I do not want to waste time with sophistry, word twisting or plain denial.</p>

<p>to sum it up: you do not have anything that you could use to refute the claims so you simply label it &quot;anti-vax&quot; and it magically becomes invalid.</p>

<p>Everything I wrote can be verified easily. The link posted had proper citations.</p>

<p>Refuting reality is a form of denial. Denial is the most common defense mechanism in the vaccine worshipper community and their blind followers. Calling everything you do not like &quot;anti-vax&quot; is another from of denial that is commonly seen.</p>

<p>Problem is things are way more interconnected in the body. Your gut biome and every other microorganism that makes you you are all intricately connected in how they check and balance one another. Finding the X in your problem is good, but they they only address variable x and the equation looks more like health = (x)(y)(z) is setting yourself up for failure (or the ability to sell more solutions to these &quot;side affects&quot;). When healthcare is for profit, you can see the rabbit hole begin to open here. </p>

<p>So yeah they put X in your vaccine, congrats you can&#39;t get polio now. What are ALL the other ingredients doing in your vaccine? That&#39;s where the science gets muddy and tainted by... capitalism. </p>

<p>According to Dórea, who wrote a paper on the neurological effects of  Thimerosal, studies involving mice have demonstrated that exposure to  aluminum adjuvants and Thimerosal are consistently correlated with  neurological damage. He stated that, “it is worth mentioning that the  brain of adult mice can accumulate substantial amounts of Al derived  from vaccines . . . indeed, adjuvant-Al provoked significant impairments  in motor functions and diminished spatial memory capacity” (927-938).</p>

<p>Dórea, José,G. &quot;Integrating Experimental (in Vitro and in Vivo)  Neurotoxicity Studies of Low- Dose Thimerosal Relevant to Vaccines.&quot; <em>Neurochemical Research</em>, vol. 36, no. 6, 2011,  pp. 927-38*, Agricultural &amp; Environmental Science Database; ProQuest Central*,  <a href="https://login.proxy.kennesaw.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy">https://login.proxy.kennesaw.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy</a>.  kennesaw.edu/docview/864085346?accountid=11824. </p>

And then there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360569/">this study from 2017</a> that finds that the DTP vaccine kills more kids than it actually &quot;saves&quot;.</p>

<p>0 science? yea sure, youll find 0 science if you never look of it.</p>

<p>did you look at link at all? is the NIH not reputable enough?</p>

<p>The study you linked me is critically flawed in the groups it uses...</p>

<p>oh really.? please tell me how it is &quot;flawed&quot;. Be specific. Are you aware that this study was co authored by renowned &quot;provaxxer&quot; Dr. Aaby?</p>

<p>Elements such as aluminum and other ingredients in vaccines are naturally used in the human body, and have no effect on whether or not a child has developmental disorders. You&#39;re just scared because you have no real understanding of science</p>

<p>Ok, I have no understanding of science? Oh ok Doc, here is where i know you are full of shit. Aluminium and mercury have no know biological uses in the body, non whatsoever, I dare you to link me to a study that says they do. In fact there is plenty of irrefutable evidence that they cause harm, I know this because i looked at the 147 studies that i linked, that you seem to dismiss like they dont exist. </p>

<p>The only one scared here is you. You cannot accept that you were brainwashed. You are following scientism not science.</p>

<p>So you disagree with the WHO smallpox expert? </p>

<p>Would you like to provide a citation, because as far as I can tell, AFP in India has only been tracked since 1995, long after an eradication effort was made.</p>

<p>before 1995 all AFP was Polio since lab confirmation was not required. AFP monitporing is testing for Polio virus and if lab result comes back negative it is called AFP.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are literally constantly being done </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. These do not study long-term health outcomes of unvaccinated children please read the studies before linking to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes There Are</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they do not exist. You do not understand that one single flawed study from the Philippines is not well studied. Why do you think you cite a poorly done study from Philippines?</p>

<p>Because there is a LACK OF DATA and you are unable to find something better.</p>

<p>The Philippines study is worthless and has been debunked. They compare outcomes of completely different groups(selection bias). The two other studies that are frequently cited were also worthless. </p>

<p><a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/alleged-vax-unvaxed-debunked/">http://vaccinepapers.org/alleged-vax-unvaxed-debunked/</a></p>

<p>There is a LACK OF DATA. We DO NOT study long-term health outcomes. 
You are not able to provide any good study because they do not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you just think science in general is bunk,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not believe science is bunk and I do know that good science is not done in the vaccination industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Understanding bias, specifically Confirmation Bias is hugely helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are biased. You are presented with the evidence and refuse to accept it. Denial.</p>
