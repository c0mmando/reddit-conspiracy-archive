But I can’t explain this timeline anymore.  We are literally living in the worst reality TV series possible.
Everything seemed to be completely normal not so long ago.  Things made sense.  Events seemed somewhat real, and the information we got through news and people around us seemed believable.</p>

<p>I can not say the same things anymore.  Nothing seems to make sense, events are somehow unbelievable.  And we are living the unbelievable somehow.</p>

<p>So I’m left with the thought..... did someone finally succeed at time travel?</p>

<p>Have we been left behind in someone’s attempt at cracking time itself into something that can be traveled?</p>

<p>Also I feel I must declare this on this sub now, but I did not vote for trump, I do not agree with almost everything going on right now.  I am also not a liberal, as most would label me after what I just said.  I prefer to try and think for myself as freely as I can with the information I’m given.</p>

<p>I also just smoked a bowl of pot, so I know this is crazy.... but is it?</p>

<p>I used to think Florida was on the west coast and California was on the east (when I was a kid) because it was the other side of the world and I just kinda incorrectly internalised that information. When I realised it was the other way around, I weighed up the possibilities: either I was wrong about US states when I was ten, or I&#39;m living in a simulation, or two landmasses swapped positions without anyone else noticing.

<p>It doesnt rely on a lot of other assumptions though.  If we assume reality is a simulation (which is a legit theory thats being taken seriously) then that explains everything we are discussing; while on the other hand, if you assume reality and the universe are physical you have to make a lot more assumptions to explain how everything came to be in the first place.</p>

<p>I absolutely disagree. You are making way more assumptions if you are arguing that we&#39;re living in a simulation, because you&#39;re assuming there&#39;s another reality outside ours without any sort of verifiable observation. You&#39;re really just adding another layer of reality on top of ours and assuming... well, literally everything about it.</p>

<p>Moreso, you can&#39;t use someone&#39;s anecdote that &quot;Australia moved&quot; as evidence of a simulation/parallel dimension or whatever without making huge, world altering assumptions. You can, however, use the known and quantifiable fact that people&#39;s memories aren&#39;t perfect to explain why someone think a country is in the wrong spot. Not many assumptions are being made, because we know memories are a shit show sometimes.</p>

<p>Any reality on top of ours is irrelevant to the topic.  we are talking about this universe and what happens here.  There is A LOT that supports the simulation theory.  The probability of us being in a sim is so great that its even more probable that any layer above us is <em>also</em> in a sim...the theory is that serious.  like I said its a legit theory with a lot of merrit behind it.  </p>

<p>Theres no way to prove it one way or the other, but what I can do is at least explain how it would happen.  If i can explain that then that makes the claim just as valid as yours of it never changing</p>

<p>that doesn&#39;t apply here because that doesn&#39;t explain how multitudes of people remember the same detail incorrectly in the same way.  That goes beyond just bad memory.  Its too coincidental that so many people from so many backgrounds remember things wrong exactly the same.  </p>

<p>So how do explain the above?  How do so many people come up with an entire movie (kazaam starring sinbad) on their own (and no, this is not a case of people hearing someone else say it first.  people tend to discover the mandela effect after looking for more info on a subject and have their minds blown when realizing it never existed but others remember it)</p>

<p>Let me phrase my argument differently: whether or not we&#39;re in a simulation, people&#39;s memories are bad. By that metric I can&#39;t really use it as evidence we&#39;re not in a simulation either, but that just brings us to an unfalsifiable conversation that has no point but to waste our time.</p>

<p>This is pretty simple: your thoughts are not as unique as you think they are. If your brain can mistakenly make an associative chain between Sinbad, his career in children&#39;s movies, Shaq and his 100% real movie Kazaam, then so can other people.</p>

<p>If in 20 years you talk to people about The Last of Us and they think the girl was modeled after Ellen Page... well it might just be that people are dumb and their memories aren&#39;t perfect.</p>

<p>no its not, I&#39;m claiming that a simulation would allow for changes such as Australia moving.  I&#39;m not worried about what&#39;s running the simulation because we are trapped in here and any outside forces would not effect us</p>

<p>That&#39;s my point, both sides cancel out meaning you can&#39;t really lean one way more than the other based on anything besides feeling</p>

<p>the Sinbad version was well before the shaq version though, but i get the point you&#39;re making and i don&#39;t disagree, my whole point is that i don&#39;t think concepts like the Mandela effect should be brushed off with out a thought.  i think it&#39;s a legit topic of discussion regardless if it&#39;s a natural phenomenon or otherwise</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the matrix makes decisions for people with low awareness. they are semi sentient. the key is to expand awareness and self project reality. someone like yourself is obviously very conscious and self aware. most of your actions are self driven. but in this simulation many things are matrix driven. for example a baseball thrown at 90 mph cannot be consciously hit in time. this has been proven. the matrix or the subconscious makes it happen. also worth noting is what we see has lag time. the outer world is never actually seen. electrical signals are interpreted with slight lag time.</p>

Climate change, melting sea ice, ya dad yards.
Google maps does indeed not show any ice, however I believe google maps only shows land mass not sea ice.  As is visible by ice in Greenland and other northern islands, but not showing sea ice.

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure there has been planting of talk about arctic ice melting, and global warming... I’m just saying comparing what you see on google maps today and what you remember from older version online maps , or even old flat maps and globes, probably will seem a little different in the mind.... especially when wanting to find the missing pieces you know.  But hey, only way to know would be look at some old actually photography from on location, then go up there ourselves!

    <div class="md"><p>Funny little story. So you know the bible quote that says &quot;and the lion will sleep with the lamb&quot; I&#39;ve seen it on billboards, schools public bulletin boards, t.v. shows. My bfs father is a pastor and he knows the quote as well. </p>

<p>Well....look up the quote online and it tells you where in the bible that quote is. </p>

<p>The thing is, THAT&#39;S NOT THE QUOTE! I&#39;ve heard it many times and seen it many places but yeah, that&#39;s not the quote at all. I showed it to my boyfriend&#39;s father and he seemed really confused but didn&#39;t say much.</p>

&quot;The wolf will lie with the lamb, the lion will eat grass as the stag does and the snake will eat dust because fuck snakes&quot; - So sayeth the Lord.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, you just woke up. Your consciousness has evolved and it can now perceive things and events differently. What you now call &#39;unbelievable&#39; probably wouldn&#39;t be &#39;unbelievable&#39; to you, 5 years ago. Because your mind, your perception was different. I was like this, too. It&#39;s until I got into conspiracy theories and understanding how things work that I opened my eyes and now perceive things differently. You aren&#39;t looking at the surface anymore. Now, you&#39;re looking for the root. And that&#39;s a step in the right direction. Because, as human consumers that we are, we tend to take most things at face value. We don&#39;t go deeper into them. Which is why, once, things looked a lot simpler. Now that you might have read about some stuff, your brain can now understand things better, hence events appearing &#39;weirder&#39;. For example, If I read about a school shooting 5 years ago, I would just say &#39;poor babies&#39; and move on with my day. But now, I do say &#39;poor babies&#39; but I also think &#39;Hm, this &#39;shooting&#39; seems to be very coincidental, especially with the political climate of today. Also, there are x,y,z things that aren&#39;t making sense about this shooting. Is there more to this than what&#39;s being broadcasted on the news?&#39;. And now, that&#39;s how my brain works. Always. </p>

<p>The world has always been a reality show. But with the advanced technology that we have now, and how much it has impacted our daily lives, it&#39;s just a lot more &#39;in your face&#39; than before.  </p>

False flags.... I’ve seen the dots enough to believe they exist.... so it’s possible but I’m sorry, you loose me at entire towns and families being staged for school shootings.  I believe both sides will use those events to push an agenda , and that is all the information we have at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry, I did not see anything in that link that changes my mind..... this is kind of what I’m talking about with this post tho..... I saw all of that as easily to fabricate “evidence” to prove what people want to think.  For instance just some critical thinking..... the email about “room changes”?
If I am to believe that email proves that teachers were just picked up and moved to another school.... why is it titled just “Room Changes”?
Why not.... School Merging, or New Building Move..... why does it out of context look like a normal email about teachers possibly having to, pack up there current class rooms, and move “rooms”, implying within the same building.  And hey at least they didn’t cut the whole department and we have jobs! Is how I read that.  But that’s just one and I don’t want to get off topic and debate all of the holes in the fake sandy hook shooting.  Thanks for the link though, I enjoy taking in all sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be the more logical end of the false flag school shooting scenario. Still seems ineffective on the take much guns theory though.  If they wanted to take guns after a false flag, wouldn’t they kill thousands in a mass uprising of “regular” gun owners.... seems like it would get the job done real quick, like an attack on America to push us to war.

Itd be alot harder to organize enough of their people to do that, kill thousands- where would they even do that at once?

<p>However, with automation on the rise, and drone tech improving every day, running robots that can break down doors and carry large munitions, tiny drones that can slip in your sit duct and spy on you or even shoot a dart that paralyzes you, etc... I&#39;m scared of that... As well as the &#39;mark of the beast&#39; IE people giving into being microchipped and tracked. We aren&#39;t necessarily safe I&#39;ll give you that </p>

<p>I wish I had it for the last six years of my awakening. Would’ve made things so much easier because I would’ve understood the process and resisted it less. Now I’m coming out of a dark night of the soul because of all my resistance and needing to shed the reality show ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel that the events we are living today are because someone who was attempting time travel succeeded.
I don’t think there was anyway to understand what happens if time travel happened.
I think the effect may have been that time is fluid and living just like all matter we study.  What if, like drying up a river......the puddle we are left with that is slowly evaporating back into everything around it and itself.... maybe all the matter in that time line is forming into things close to what they should be... but not really “right”.  A lot like the broken simulation idea presented above.  What if what is left after someone jumped time itself.... is just a puddle of time and all the matter inside of it, is just turning into something different... something like what we remember but different and wrong.  Until there is no more time in this timeline... or something like that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It only seems disheartening because people are witnessing the atrocities that were always hidden. The world can’t get better if good people keep their heads in the sand. There wouldn’t be atrocities in the first place if people were awake throughout history.</p>

<p>True “humanity” didn’t do all the bad stuff. It’s people disconnected from their truth/morality/spirituality etc. Books like Untethered Soul and New Earth by Eckhart Tolle can help you understand how trauma distorts the human condition, and help your own processing of all of this.</p>

<p>By being out of the mainstream and having everyday contact with the people in your life, you’ve helped yourself understand the human condition at a truer level, without all the programming. Honestly, congrats for strengthening your self-awareness. Many people are content to be dragged along by the throes of someone else’s circumstances just because it’s being broadcast.</p>

<p>And if you want to get “serious” about alternate, better timelines for our world, google “COBRA beta timeline” and start going down that rabbit hole. Your wish may not be so far off the mark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think It puts my credibility into a category.  It’s why I stated it.  This was not a thought of a sane and sober mind...... but is it that crazy if you look past the I’m high part?  That was the question, I think the fact that I not only recognized that I was high and my thought could be muddled, but I then let the evidence be known and asked the question to others to test just how high of an idea it was, says how critical of the thought I was being.  I think the fact that my credibility disappears to you over something so tangible as a chemicals effects on the brain says more of you than me..... but that’s just my muddled opinion man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually enjoy how marijuana changes thought processes. It does affect the brain, therefore changes how you perceive things. Doesn’t take away credibility at all... just puts a different light on the subject matter. It’s almost like stepping into someone else’s brain for a moment and seeing things in an entirely new way. I can appreciate this because when I reflect on thoughts I’ve had while high, I can see their integrity is still intact and was a perspective I would have never visited while sober. Sometimes these thoughts are a completely plausible concept that my later sober self confirms as valid. Pot doesn’t solely produce ‘muddled thoughts’ as you are implying. Sure some will get through, but the only way to discover new thought processes is to change the way the brain has previously thought. What better way than by altering the chemical composition a little?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can only speak from experience. But I started smoking in 8th grade, and didn’t kick it until my junior year of college. Naturally, I was far too immature to handle marijuana and I proceeded to sorely overdo it, and I can’t help but feel like I missed out on a large swath of my childhood. While most can find a happy medium and mix the two, I instead traded a number of formative years for often times solitary pot use. And I’ve witnessed my experiences play out in countless others. Just being honest.</p>

I sort of see it as an outcome of ignoring all these red flags for so many years that now there is no where to hide from it and the pot has boiled over.

    <div class="md"><p>So true, and yet you are getting downvoted for this comment but you hit the nail on the head, people have no perspective indeed. I think it&#39;s partly narcissism, everyone thinks the world revolves around only them, they are not even concerned about what happened 5 minutes ago let alone 5 or 50 years ago. History is extremely important to understand so we don&#39;t repeat the mistakes of the past but here we are about to repeat the mistakes the Soviet Union made during the 20th century- we all know what happens when the right goes too far but people have seemed to forgot what happens when the left goes too far and we are making those same mistakes right now, in my opinion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does make sense.
My own personal experience with deja vu type experiences was once I started to change the outcome, the deja vu has become less frequent.  It’s one of the few things I yet to have any explanation for because it always enters the complete unknown.  Are these simulations I’m remembering?  Am I a simulation?  Is someone sending me warnings?  Have I now headed the warnings and am I on the right path?  Have I made a fatal error and am no longer guided? Is there even a path and a guide?  The questions never end to be honest, so I’ve tried to just let that side of life happen however it does.  I’m not sure it’s something I need to understand..... 
my deja vu was always dreams that then happened in real life.  Some up to 3 years or 4 years later.  But vivid memory of the dream to the point of describing places I had not been before.  Creepy shit man, gives me goosebumps for real</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes sense when you realize our future posthuman descendants engineered a space-time bubble around our solar system and we basically loop through time.</p>

<p>That then also explains the &quot;curious&quot; positioning of our moon and other celestial bodies, because they placed things in a specific order.</p>

<p>The deja vu experiences are another side-effect of this space-time bubble, because an enclosed system does not allow for infinite combinations of settings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may seem like a long shot, but what if all déjà vu was due to us living in a &#39;worldline&#39; of sort. Lets say, if I were to die in this &#39;worldline&#39;, it would resort to an older version, in which I&#39;m still alive. This &#39;worldline&#39; would diverge from the one in which I die, and I prevent my death without knowing it. The déjà vu could be the last show of the original &#39;worldline&#39;, before switching to the new one. Think of it like loading a savepoint on a game. When it first loads, it shows what was happening, but now you know what happens and you can prevent that and progress.  </p>

<p>The déjà vu that you can&#39;t control could be a &#39;fixed point&#39;, that is unable to diverge. This points are ones that are relative to all &#39;worldlines&#39; and cannot be altered. </p>

<p>The concept of time travel could make it possible to change &#39;worldlines&#39; say if someone was to prevent someone else&#39;s death. How ever, that &#39;worldline&#39; would diverge from its original, but not into a pre-existing one. Say a world without time travel would be named alpha. In using time travel and altering a &#39;worldline&#39;, it would become a beta &#39;worldline&#39;, not reliant on the other alpha lines. This would make it unstable, and susceptible to paradoxs and fluctuations due to events that simply shouldn&#39;t have happend based off of the original alpha &#39;worldline&#39;. The people who hadn&#39;t time traveled wouldn&#39;t know about this making it ethically wrong. All they might have of the original &#39;correct&#39;&#39;worldline&#39; is odd accounts of déjà vu, of events that should have happened but now can&#39;t. </p>

<p>Think of it like a singular rope. At first it looks like a solid entity, but the closer you look, you begin to see it&#39;s made up of multiple threads. These &#39;threads&#39; are the alpha &#39;worldlines&#39; these shouldn&#39;t be altered. However, say if one of the threads tore or frayed, it could become separate. This becomes the beta &#39;worldline&#39;. It originated from an alpha, but is not part of it. The frayed bit of thread can the get tangled around the main rope, but will never be the same, much like a beta &#39;worldline&#39; trying to fix it&#39;s self, and being unstable. Because of this instability, &#39;fixed points&#39; can now be altered, but will continue to increase the separation from alpha and beta until eventually it no longer needs alpha, and beta could then diverge and create the same as alpha. A &#39;rope&#39; of beta &#39;worldlines&#39;. All of which are unstable. They can clash with each other. People could switch &#39;worldlines&#39; without being aware. This could be where false memories come from. Something they thought happened but didn&#39;t because of a switch. If time travel created a beta, it could be done again. Each time creating a new &#39;rope&#39; from a &#39;thread&#39;, gradually becoming more and more unstable. This could potentially end time as we know it, and thus breaking reality. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s all just a potential hypothesis. Déjà vu is an odd case, which cannot be easily researched due to the randomness and difficulties trying to recreate it artificially. (the only way I&#39;ve read about doing this is some form of hypnosis, or something. Might be worth a Google). </p>

We were watching a movie and I turning my head to look behind me out what was the living room window, and I seen what looked like a flying saucer out of a sci fi film, spinning and flying behind the hilly scenery, then there were tonnes and then our beautiful blue sky “turned off” and all we saw was black and stars with tonnes of what I guess were alien space craft.(the sun was still out, so black sky and bright highlighted land, it was the most bizarre thing I’ve ever experienced In a dream) It looked like an invasion and I felt so helpless, </p>

<p>i do not know about time travel but what i can say for sure is that the &#39;news&#39; in the united states and much of the world is now &#39;managed&#39; in the sense that nothing becomes a national story unless it has been planned.  </p>

<p>also every public gathering is going to have undercovers and private security contracted informers to make sure it goes as planned, and never becomes a capable movement</p>

<p>the united states is totalitarian, this is primarily what you are feeling</p>

<p>time travel, who knows, this is one of those things that can&#39;t be tested of verified so it is permanenet speculation, and as such is not a good use for your time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop. Look around you. You live in a personal private reality from which you are not separate. It goes where you go. Wherever you go, you will find yourself there. Notice the difference between your perception of what is vs. what is. The difference between your opinion of something and the actual details of its reality. Notice that no matter where you put your focus you are seeing &quot;one of a kind&quot;, uniqueness. This uniqueness is ubiquitous. Always unique but always moving and changing.</p>

<p>Notice that people come and go, come and go. They come into your reality and tell you stories of what has or is happening in the void outside your awareness. You can never be aware outside of your awareness. Perhaps, there is no outside. People manifest, then disappear. They&#39;re here and then they&#39;re gone. Dematerialized. </p>

<p>There is no separation between you and any of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you realize, truly realize, that you&#39;re not separate from your experience then it&#39;s very easy to be good to everyone, because you know and are experiencing the truth that there is no separation between us. Call me &quot;dummy&quot;, and you&#39;re just calling yourself the same. That energy behind your judgment doesn&#39;t support &quot;we should all just be good to each other.&quot; Or that you understand that I am you. That this post is you and the result of your action (which changes probabilities of experience). It&#39;s part of the experience you are having, which is not separate from you. You attack another, you attack yourself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually free of delusions and see things as they are in the present moment. The only time and place I can be. Life is vast, unlimited, creative and multidimensional. There&#39;s more to it than what the five senses presents and what we&#39;ve been taught and conditioned to believe.</p>

<p>Adventures in consciousness are available to everyone. Anyone currently smoking a bowl is having such an adventure, and go further than where they currently are if they wish. Anyone meditating can do the same.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is wrong. If you ever thought &quot;things made sense&quot;, that&#39;s just because you hadn&#39;t peeled back the layers of deception in the simulacra we call society. To use a metaphor, you <em>thought</em> that the Matrix made sense while you were living in it, but then Morpheus gave you the red pill. </p>

<p>That all said, you didn&#39;t really develop your theory. I&#39;d say there are some interesting aspects you could have dug into, wacky time travel theories involving Trump aren&#39;t new, but you didn&#39;t. It sounds like you&#39;re really just describing having your mind blown by realizing that you can&#39;t trust the corporate media. In reality, you never should have put the faith you did in it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This 2002 article is similar today, this quote about reality is attributed to Karl Rove, &quot;In the summer of 2002, after I had written an article in Esquire that the White House didn&#39;t like about Bush&#39;s former communications director, Karen Hughes, I had a meeting with a senior adviser to Bush. He expressed the White House&#39;s displeasure, and then he told me something that at the time I didn&#39;t fully comprehend -- but which I now believe gets to the very heart of the Bush presidency.</p>

<p>The aide said that guys like me were &quot;in what we call the reality-based community,&quot; which he defined as people who &quot;believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.&quot; I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. &quot;That&#39;s not the way the world really works anymore,&quot; he continued. &quot;We&#39;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you&#39;re studying that reality -- judiciously, as you will -- we&#39;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#39;s how things will sort out. We&#39;re history&#39;s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes sense. I was always told &quot;History repeats itself&quot; in school and I didn&#39;t realize how true that was until much later. Also so many subtle things that teachers (elementary, high, or college) said and my brain filed as &#39;unimportant&#39; were actually real advice and I didn&#39;t figure that out until later. In hindsight, I think one of my favorite teachers (6th grade) was dropping subtle truth bombs about certain subjects, particularly history.  I should look him up someday and see if he&#39;s still around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Time travel from the future into the past was determined to be theoretically possible, if we&#39;re talking about information. Not so sure people can time travel. If they could, however, you are correct (as even Stephen Hawking eventually agreed) in the sense that if the time travelers were among us, we might not know it. As to nothing making sense anymore and people in general going batshit crazy, perceiving that just means you&#39;re sane. Time for another bong hit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If time travel actually occurred, and it actually changed the direction of time, you wouldn&#39;t be aware of it. Problem is, time isn&#39;t a discrete <em>thing</em>, it is a variable measurement we use to measure beginnings and ends. How do you traverse an idea? We bind time to the speed of light within the realm of relativity, but quantum mechanics have shown us that our understanding of time is flawed. The problem is, it&#39;s still &quot;moving&quot; in the same direction. There is no backward or traversing it as a medium, you can only alter the perception of time by changing your frame of reference.</p>

<p>But I can’t explain this timeline anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its the consequence of decades of bad decisions by a society willing to sacrifice humanity for comforts.  All of our modern &quot;conveniences&quot; involve someone&#39;s misery in their production.  People don&#39;t want to be miserable.  To keep people in miserable places requires force.  People wanting to escape miserable places now need to use force to escape.  The cycle continues until people decide their &quot;conveniences&quot; aren&#39;t worth the energy required to keep them convenient.  Almost 100% of the social unrest we see is because of or exacerbated by our society&#39;s need for its comforts.  Wars for cheap oil created terrorists and fundie regimes. Monoculture crops, factory farms for cheap, over-processed food harm both the environment and our physical health.  Mass production and disposable people in China enable me to communicate this digitally.</p>

<p>Everything happening now is chickens coming home to roost.  Pretty hard to find a current threat to humanity where consumerism/capitalism isn&#39;t a significant or root cause.</p>

<p>And then later that day, I read your post. I thought, well apparently I&#39;m not the only one who thinks this.  Too many wacky unimaginable things happening in this reality, both good and bad.  But can&#39;t say we live in a boring timeline though. Tank <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAIKGQacmU8">sums it up</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to say you&#39;re &quot;not self critical&quot;, but you really do sound overly confident in your ability to remember something that I (presume) you don&#39;t have a significant reason to think about in your day to day life.</p>

<p>Are you implying with this theory that the climate in Australia is competely different as well? That NZ is more tropical than most of Australia is? Because none of these things have ever been true.</p>
