        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not judging or patronizing anyone at all. I firmly believe that Conspiracy Theorists are not just some group of crackpots who think the Government is after them like the World makes them out to be. When you think about it, it takes a lot of intelligence, critical thinking and problem solving. Along with persistence mixed with a little stubbornness and cockiness, which is a good thing. It takes a smart person to question the status quo of what the World says to be true.  But it takes an even smarter person to take that question, do their own research and decide on what to believe based on that. </p>

<p>No matter how true or far-fetched a conspiracy might be, I&#39;ve NEVER heard someone say they believe something and not have a list of reasons why they believe it. Say what you want but Conspiracy Theorists are always well researched and versed. They never just say they believe in something without showing and telling you the mountains of evidence they&#39;ve collected to back them up.   There&#39;s no such thing as a crazy or dumb Conspiracy Theorists. </p>

<p>But with that being said, I had a few questions. I&#39;m open to hearing from all sides. So...</p>

<p><strong>What Conspiracy Theory do you believe in? What did you see that made you believe in that Conspiracy Theory? And what piece of evidence or proof would it take for you to admit you were wrong?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What other Conspiracy Theories are out there that you also believe happened? And what made you think that?</strong></p>

<p>Again, this is 100% me just being curious. No judgment or anything. Thank you all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moon landing.  I&#39;m not saying it never happened but it didn&#39;t happen at that time.</p>

<p>The cameras on the moon supposedly had crosses etched into the lenses.  This would mean any picture taken should have these crosses on the foreground,  yet in numerous pictures you see these crosses behind objects. </p>

<p>The whole two light sources is odd.  It shoots different shadows in different directions. It illuminates astronauts when they are standing directly in a shadow.</p>

<p>The video footage looks much more faked when it is sped up,  the astronausts jumping and falling and moving around. </p>

<p>These cameras they took pictures of we&#39;re mounted to their chest.  They also had to manually control them with their big bulky suits ans gloves.  That being said the majority of the pictures taken look flawless with the subject completely in focus and centered in the picture.  </p>

<p>Those are the only ones on my mind right now to defend it didn&#39;t happen at that time. </p>

<p>To be fair, they could have taken thousands of pictures and only saved/released the ones that turned out well. I have friends who are quite fond of this photographic strategy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with everything you said, but bro, NO planes were used. </p>

<p>The explosions where the planes supposedly hit were planned explosions blowing up data centers of insurance brokerages, in order to destroy the evidence of the millions that were stolen/funneled out during the attack. Thermite was used to cut a cartoon-ish outline of the &quot;plane&quot; hitting the building. </p>

<p>Videos directly from news networks show the plane&#39;s wing disappearing at times. And most damning IMO, an outline of the planes nose emerges on the other side of the building, unscathed. There is literally no way that&#39;s possible. It was a CGI mistake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, im a dude who works with cameras and lights a lot.</p>

<p>I also work with the sun, which is a fickle and bouncy, yes bouncy beast.</p>

<p>First off, I won&#39;t deny that there is a non-zero chance of the Moon landing being faked. Or at least one of them. It just would have been insanely hard in 1968. (Technically earlier than that, as there were earlier manned flights that didn&#39;t land on the moon, as well as ones in low Earth orbit)</p>

<p>To the &quot;two light&quot; conspiracy. Sunlight can reflect off of lighter colored surfaces and illuminate shadowed areas. As a lighting technician for movies (aka the kind of guy who would be called to fake a moon landing with movie lights) I see sunlight &quot;bounce&quot; (thats the industry term) off of plenty of surfaces. Including things like gravel and sand. We actually take advantage of large, reflective surfaces a lot in movie lighting, because bouncing light can create very pleasing soft shadows, and a more flattering look on the talent. One thing we sometimes do if we have no choice but to film under ugly high noon light outdoors is to lay out white reflective fabric under the actors to fill in dark, shadowed eyes and stuff. Its actually pretty similar to what happens on the moon. You can think of the entire lunar surface as one big bounce card. So even though the sun creates deep, black shadows on the moon (especially in absence of an atmosphere), the reflective nature of the lunar surface can actually fill in some of those shadows, depending on the angle of the sun. Also consider the fact that the astronauts are wearing white, and therefore will stand out better in shaded areas.</p>

<p>The nail in the coffin for me though about the double light theory is... take a look at the shadows. You only see one sharp shadow per object. Part of the nature of light is that the bigger the light source, the softer and less defined of a shadow. The smaller, the sharper. We only see one sharp shadow being made in all of the photos and video of any given object on the moon... that&#39;d be the sun. If you look at the sun (please use proper eye wear) from our perspective on earth or the moon, it looks quite small because its very far away. You can blot it out with your thumb. So a small point-source, relative to objects on the moon, makes a very sharp and defined shadow. If we saw two shadows of the same quality and same relative brightness (or lack thereof) FAKE BRO! But we don&#39;t. </p>

<p>What we do see are much bigger and softer shadows created by the reflectivity of the lunar surface. End only in areas that are shaded from the sun (or &quot;key&quot; light source if you&#39;d like)</p>

<p>And if by some miracle you do catch two sharp shadows on the moon of the same object... what else is up there but a movie lig....oh wait that might be the Earth. Yup, the earth reflects a little light back onto the Moon as well, depending on how much of the surface is illuminated. Its part of why you can see the moon partially lit in the daytime when conditions are right.</p>

<p>Another nail in the coffin on this one, look at their visors. You only see one light source reflected, and you never EVER catch a camera reflection. This used to be a giant problem for movies back in the day, before CGI. We would and still do try and cover equipment with tarps and things, but if you look close in windows, sunglasses, etc. in old movies, you can always see movie gear and crew members. </p>

<p>Nowadays you can digitally paint out reflections, but in 1968, that technology did not exist. Its like saying &quot;yeah no way did we have the tech to go to the moon, but we did somehow manage to remove all the inevitable camera, light, and crew member reflections from their visors in post production&quot;. That would have required a level of computer control, even if you could find a method to do it on film prints with a robotically controlled exacto-knife or something, that would have been far in excess of computer &quot;alleged&quot; to be flown on Apollo or used on the ground at that time. Even later optical printing devices used for the Starwars films in the 1980&#39;s had computer control in excess of what existed on earth in the 1960&#39;s.</p>

<p>And for the inevitable &quot;but they could have used big movie bounce material in addition to one light&quot; I urge you again, look at their visors. The next time you watch a movie with someone wearing any type of glasses, or even just a closeup where you can see eyeballs, look at the reflections. 9/10 you&#39;ll see a big white square, trapezoid or something with sharp edges. Thats a bounce! </p>

<p>Had the moon landings been faked with more than one light source, they would have been all over the visor reflections. And, I argue, so would the cameras, rigging, light stands, and Stanley Kubrick :)</p>

<p>As for the black crosses, technically they were on a transparency placed in front of the film gate and not etched into the lenses. Its possible that some of the transparency could have chipped away on launch, or rubbed off onto the film or leader.  The claim is that they sometimes appear behind objects.... first of all, pics or it didn&#39;t happen. Second, it makes no logical sense since that would imply that said crosses where on the &quot;movie set&quot; rather than in the camera. Why would you places crosses everywhere if you were trying to fake a moon landing in 1968? We do it now with modern computer effects as a way to track real world objects to super impose CGI elements onto video footage... (aka tracking markers) but again, the computers and software to do that did not exist at the time. And if the crosses where added in a later print, why would they appear behind an object? Again, it makes no sense if you were trying to make a good fake.</p>

<p>And to the point about the cameras being chest mounted, and awkward to use... well yeah they were. In fact, a lot of the really famous photographs had to be cropped and leveled off to the horizon because the framing was so horrible. The cameras they used were modified Hasselblad 500cm medium format cameras. You can actually find the same model on ebay for cheap that still works. The versions they were using actually had no viewfinder, but more of a gun sight apparatus. So you get shots that are horribly canted to the side, or have important objects in a far off corner of the frame. Nasa actually has all of the in-edited still photos and footage on their website, even some of the ones that are over/underexposed, have too much dust on them, or are obstructed by other objects.</p>

<p>So, all I can tell you from a photographic and lighting standpoint, is it looks like what you&#39;d expect the Lunar Surface to look like. In other words, I see nothing to conclusively prove that it was shot using artificial light or trick- photographic effects they had at the time. If they were faked, the images themselves are air-tight.</p>

<p>Woof, been waiting to get out my thoughts on that, thanks for the opportunity!</p>

<p>I believe Jarrah White even addressed the multiple shadows thing during his &quot;Moonfaker&quot; series which has like a thousand videos. Basically if you have two light sources the brighter one ends up causing the shadow causing the other dimmer shadow to fade out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buddy, All I&#39;m saying is that from a lighting standpoint, based on the way I know real sunlight, and single source lighting to work in the real world, that part looks real. If its fake, they at least got the lighting right. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re gonna say the moon landing was a hoax, attack it on the better points that are out there. But the lighting subject, as far as I&#39;m concerned, is debunked.</p>

<p>I hear the double shadow argument all the time, and not one person has ever been able to show me a picture or video of it. Not one. If you can, then we&#39;ll talk.</p>

<p>If I were you, I&#39;d go after other aspects, like motion, or maybe look for reflections or pieces of equipment that shouldn&#39;t be there. Or inevitably, if it were a set, the soil might thin out in some areas after several days of shooting. Maybe there&#39;s some exposed plastic or studio floor on the ground or something? There&#39;s like hundreds of hours of footage right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I&#39;ve lit many a dark room/ studio  with a single light source, and I&#39;ve spent years studying the way light interacts with things in the real world.</p>

<p>Its simple logic. With one light source, a reflective material on the ground, then you&#39;d expect light to behave in the way I described.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m not going to convince the hardcore non-believers. Especially the ones who are not versed in photography, or how light works. Its just like climate change deniers who haven&#39;t studied climatology. All I can tell you is to ask other industry lighting people, and they will give you the same sort of explanation.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you&#39;re seeing the dark &#39;sky&#39; reflected off the lander. His suit is matte and white, so it reflects and scatters quite a lot of the light that hits it. The shape of the lander (basically a cone) means that little light from the surface would strike it at the right angle to be reflected back towards the camera. And the ground shadow is very dark because how would the light around it reflect back onto the ground? There isn&#39;t an atmosphere to scatter it around like there is on Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See my comment above. In short no, because the shadowed ground is at such a low angle relative to the light bouncing from the sunlit ground, that it wouldn&#39;t catch the light. And since no light is being reflected from the lander&#39;s ground shadow, it doesn&#39;t create a light source on the left side of the lander. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I see your concern, but I also see what&#39;s happening here with the light. So whats lighting him does look to me like a &quot;bounced&quot; light source. More than likely the Lunar surface. The reason the whole shadow isn&#39;t illuminated is because the space suit is elevated, therefore catching and reflected light thats bouncing up from the sunlit soil. But since the shadow soil is at such a low angle relative to the sunlit soil, its not catching any of the light. It all has to do with reflectance angles, and the very reflective nature of lunar regolith.</p>

<p>If you and I were standing in a totally dark, white concrete parking lot at night, and I had a flashlight, I could show you. (No to be creepy lol) I&#39;d have you stand behind a car while I shine my flashlight at the ground next to, but not behind the car. Some of that light would bounce back up and hit you, while simultaneously not lighting up the ground shadow. Simply because you are standing elevated from the ground.</p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Another way you might play around with this idea, is to maybe pour some flour on your kitchen floor and turn off all the lights at night. Then use your phone light as the sun, and maybe set out some lander models, or whatever you want, and test it yourself!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All you have to light things up there (on the irl moon) are the sun itself and reflected sunlight. All they proved was that it&#39;s possible it could have been lit with artificial light and still look real. Its also possible that all of the world&#39;s governments are ruled by lizard people, but that doesn&#39;t make it likely.</p>

<p>Also consider something else I know about making movies:</p>

<p>It takes a lot of people. Not just the guy or gal running the camera, or the director, but often <em>hundreds</em> of people. People who build the sets. People to build the props. People to rig the backdrops and the lighting. People to help out those people, and still more people to feed everyone. It also takes time. </p>

<p>The fact that Starwars and Marvel franchises leak like a sive makes me dubious about the moon hoax theory. Not one person has EVER come forward, not even on their death bed, and claimed that they helped fake the moon landing. Not one set painter, not one lighting technician, not one camera operator, not one set decorator, and not one special effects artist. (Off the top of my head, all professional positions you would absolutely need to fake a moon landing).</p>

<p>There are youtube videos out there of death bed confessions of people who claiming to have worked with UFO&#39;s and Aliens for the government. The fact that not even crazy&#39;s have come out and said they faked the moon landing tells me it likely was real.</p>

<p>Not a single member of the THOUSANDS who worked on project Apollo have ever come forward. Neither have any of the astronauts. Actually, speaking of which, there are even astronauts who&#39;ve claimed to see UFO&#39;s on moon and shuttle missions years after leaving NASA.</p>

<p>It just seems highly unlikely that nobody involved ever came forward. NDA&#39;s, death threats or not. Movie people are a talkative bunch. (Can&#39;t you tell??!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon is a big one.  I think it was a cover to develop ICBM&#39;s for nuke warheads without a public outcry.</p>

<p>but a few things just make it so I don&#39;t think people have been out of low earth orbit.  the Van Allen radiation belts are a huge thing to just whatever away.  And thermal properties (estimated) in the sun its +250C shade is -250C  so you would need a crazy temp conditioning system to cope with that Even if we had that tek that we don&#39;t how would we power it battery&#39;s ?? no fa king way.  I could go on. </p>

<p>most of the other stuff I have questions but I&#39;m not 100% on much so discussions and questions are alright but definitive proof is almost impossible</p>

<p>Long story short, too much disagreement, inconsistency, and blatant bullshit surrounds the concept that it seems more likely a fabricated pseudo-explanation for why it&#39;s &quot;hard&quot; to go to &quot;space.&quot;</p>

they explained that the probe had to enter orbit a certain way or jupiters rad belts would have fried it.  I know that jupiter has probably 10,000x the power ours would but makes the argument for planetary phenomenon slightly more plausible.

    <div class="md"><p>Van Allen belt:  the radiation field is not uniform.  There are fixed regions of high and low intensity.  NASA was aware of this and purposefully sent the astronauts through the better spots.  Even so, all astronauts are aware that they have increased their chance of cancer by several percent.</p>

<p>Temperatures:  Temperature is not a very description of heat flow in a vacuum.  There is so little gas in the moon&#39;s atmospheres that there is extremely low heat transfer.  IR radiation is still a problem, but it is much lower in magnitude than heat conduction by collision with molecules of the atmoshere.</p>

<p>Another example of non-intuitive temperatures.  Plasmas of 2,000,000 degrees F are routinely created in small scale experiments with very low gas pressures (aka high vacuum).  You could stick your hand in these plasma chambers and not get burned.  Why? Because getting hit by three molecules of gas doesn&#39;t hurt no matter how hot they are.</p>

<p>As there is no atmosphere on the Moon, you get no vortices. The thrust hits the dust and the dust flies <em>far</em> away (as there is nothing stopping it). 
Think about the mechanics/angles: Thrust points down in a cone-shape, thrust hits a particle, particle flies out at same angle, particle might hit leg and get deflected further out but a different angle (still out and way).</p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking like you&#39;re on earth, things behave differently on the Moon. This is also why f.ex. some distant mountains look like small hills, there is no atmosphere to obscure the view and your brain is tricked (a brain that has ever <em>only</em> seen mountains/hills within an atmosphere).</p>

And don&#39;t start about no funding bs. How many millions go to NASA yearly? You mean to tell me they had the money to do it back in the day, but not now? </p>

I was just reading an article today about Trump&#39;s &quot;Space Force.&quot; I learned that Mike Pence is hilariously the <a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--8qmCkvY7--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/irkktvq1eyrukcznjy4g.jpg">chairman</a>of the National Space Council. Anyway, one of their objectives is to build an orbiting base around the moon as a launching point for further space missions.</p>

<p>NASA astronut Don Pettit: return trip to the moon is <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nasa-astronaut-don-pettit-next-logical-step-go-back-moon-then-mars-beyond-1582401">&quot;next logical step&quot;</a> in space exploration.</p>

<p>NASA openly desires to &quot;return&quot; humans to the moon: <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-to-return-humans-to-the-moon">https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-to-return-humans-to-the-moon</a></p>

<p>As well as the other international space agencies who currently are said to be planning lunar missions, including Russia, China, and even Israel.</p>

<p>Basically the idea that we wouldn&#39;t go back is dumb. It would be extremely remunerative and not going back goes against the history of human exploration.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll add the distance travelled, what some 250,000 miles one way in 1969 through the van Allen belts? Since then no mission has gone more than 400 miles above earth. There&#39;s many, many other strange things as well but I don&#39;t feel like listing then all. I don&#39;t know for sure what happened and I never will but it&#39;s suspicious to say the least.</p>

<p>The fact that the US established a &quot;Weather Modification Operations and Research Board&quot; over a dozen years ago means that they&#39;ve been thinking about this for a long time, and that there is reason to be working on improving it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for me it has been a journey basically for my SO.  We were having some digestive issues mostly with her and started to look around for help. My wife&#39;s friend is the one that turned her on to several online personalities (Johnny juice and medical medium) and started to listen from there. Farmer markets was great place to look for locally grow foods and asking what products they use to keep the insects away. I mean there is alot on our food that shouldn&#39;t be. Eliminating cheese Dairy any processed foods was the way to go. Getting back to eating what nature has provided for us. I mean you can always go to the grocery store but looking at every ingredient and trying to decipher what every thing is was a huge hassle.  That why I tell people to buy local. For me I think everything is better for my gut but still working on it for the wife. Right now doing a 30 day celery juice routine to help out with the rest. She&#39;s  been completely vegan. I still have to sneak meat every so often lol but still on target. I was at 199 about 2 months ago but kept on doing what we needed to do and now down to 170. (I swim mainly for exercise. And my wife was at 156 and now down to 132. My mind feels clearer and same with her but still has some issues just due to the fact that we have different body types and will continue our little journey together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When discussing moon landing hoax theories, I think it&#39;s important to distinguish between two very different possibilities:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s all a big lie and we have never landed on the moon.  </p></li>
<li><p>There was tremendous pressure to land before 1970 to fulfill JFK&#39;s big promise. As the deadline approached, NASA had everything worked out and tested except for the actual landing itself, and they weren&#39;t sure if they could put it together in time without taking too much risk. In a moment of desperation, they decided to run Apollo 11 as another Lunar orbit with Lunar Module descent (similar to Apollo 10), but then faked the landing itself. At least some of the later Apollo missions were legitimate.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m not saying I believe either of these theorues, but I put a lot more credibility into the second. This is the kind of cover-up that really makes sense from the standpoint of national pride/security. The program was so massive and so much of it was independently confirmed in real time that I really don&#39;t believe it was all just a big show.  </p>

<p>I also find it really strange that nobody bothers to make this distinction when discussing moon hoax theories. Most people that come to this discussion seem to have made no attempt to study space flight engineering.  </p>

<p>Just to go one layer deeper: what if the first moon landing really was faked for the reasons I described above, and the spooks have seeded conspiracy communities with more elaborate and unbelievable theories to distract from the real lie?</p>

When they arrived on the moon, they may have found something that they didn&#39;t want to disclose and - instead - used the footage from Plan B. If this is true then we probably did go to the moon but released footage that was composed of real shots and produced media.</p>

I found my way here because of things like Stanley Kubrick lending NASA his film equipment and expertise on the staging and filming and directing of the moon landing hoax.

<p>Real quick though, where are you right now? And what&#39;s your Social Security number? Lol just kidding.</p>

<p>But seriously, I&#39;m honestly just curious. I&#39;ve been listening to a lot of Joe Rogan&#39;s Podcast lately. Even faking asleep to it most nights. He has a lot of people on that talk about Multi-Dimensions, JFK Assassination, Moon Landing, Aliens, etc. I got curious in how much of this people actually believe in. Other the 9/11 which I&#39;ve seen a lot of red flags, I never researched any other conspiracies. Just curious.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take that Social Security number now. Lol</p>

<p>1 shame people who use critical thought politically</p>

<p>2 create evidence for both sides of any significant historical event </p>

<p>What I want to know is 2 things: </p>

<p>1 how did the moon landing footage all go missing? </p>

<p>2 how did the astronauts get through the van allen belt of radiation around the planet?  (which is to say, if you could provide a 3d flight plan of a shuttle through the van allen belt and/or a 3d layout of the van allen belt, you would help me really understand the moon landing from your enlightened officially sanctioned point of view) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you are collecting information to make a report or part of a research, you&#39;d quote what you got here as &quot;popular conspiracy forum online&quot; you&#39;d refer to the replies as inputs and use the APA manual to reference reddit, I see it all the time, any class related to psychology or sociology could accept a paper about your a topic like conspiracy public opinion, asking why really sounds like lazy research angle, I sound more bitter than I am right now, I was , I hope you have a good day, Im glad you dont get homework anymore</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Telemetry data. NASA &quot;lost&quot; it. The most important information on arguably the biggest achievement of humankind and they lost it. Oh, and look into the &quot;moon rocks&quot; they brought back. You&#39;ll find that they are either missing or proven fake. And what&#39;s with the lack of enthusiasm with the astronauts at their press conference? You&#39;d think they would be thrilled. Nope. And guess who NASA collaborated to produce and broadcast footage? Disney studios. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What annoys me most about the moon landing is that they said they can&#39;t go back to the moon because they don&#39;t have the technology(saw this in a NASA interview I&#39;ll find source) like surely the amount of engineers and stuff working on it would have a shit tonne of notes and research etc especially with it being a long time ago and technology advancing i dont see how it isn&#39;t possible anymore even if its supposedly happened before (sorry if i didn&#39;t word this the best) </p>
