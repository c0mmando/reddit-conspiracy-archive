       SS: Have you ever met a religious person who was conspiracy-minded? Religious followers and Conspiracy followers are the antithesis of each other.  The religious are sheep (“the Lord is their Shepherd”), while the conspiracists want to pull the wool from their eyes.  There is no Critical Thinking allowed in Religion.

       This sub is supposed to be about finding the truth, not be told religious lies.   The “Church” is the oldest and largest TPTB that have ever existed, controlling what people say and think.

       The Old Testament is a consolidation of folklore from many different “tribes” that were conquered, meant to replace their traditions and force them to exist under a new ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New Testament is the same but used by a newer ruling class.
      </p>
      <p>
       The King James Bible is the same again, but yet another ruler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before there were governing laws of modern nations, religious texts were used as a way for the ruling class to govern the people.

       The Prosperity Gospel?  “I get mine, the rest of you can fuck off”?  Because that’s what seems to be preached today, not the “Live thy neighbor” of Hippy Jesus.  It’s all about control.

       Actually, the origin of most religion is the search to free yourself. Great philosophers who took a stand against the popular mindset and moral standpoints of their time. This is why martyrdom is a thing.

       being raised in religion and having majority of my extended family still very religious, I'm not having much conspiracy talk with them.  If they instigate or ask it's still a "tread lightly" area.  If they see BS in the world/media/people i can give some conspiracy-esqe insight, but by no means do I think they can dive in fully.  slow woke approach, so one day when the top really blows off they know i'm open to talk.

       The bible is a book that holds many mysteries that still have yet to be figured out by humans. To me I looks like there is a spiritual war that the other side wants to tear down to bring in a new religion.

       Most of us were put into religion (man's false way of attaining their own salvation) as children so that we would reject it very early on.  Many conspiracy minded people are seeking "the truth" and when you do that you end up finding it:
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh_14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
      </p>
      <p>
       “
       <em>
        The first
       </em>
       gulp from the glass of
       <em>
        natural sciences
       </em>
       will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”

       I'm saying "the world" (run by Lucifer) has it set up in such a way.  My parents did this unawares.  Both of them go to a Laodiceain type Church and don't believe a bit of it.  Modern Church buildings are just social clubs.

        that

       bogeyman jumping out of your closet, you can turn your attention to more important truths.  Like the Egyptian/Babylonian pagans who fabricated your "Bible" in the first place.

       It's a Bible study, if that's how you prefer to phrase it.  It's straightforward, and with the Bible's own words, dismantles your misconceptions about "Lucifer".
      </p>
      <p>
       But you will stay willfully blind and ignorant, because that's what you've been trained to do.  And no amount of reading, even from your own bible, will fix your condition.

       Yeah another "Bible corrector" who doesn't know the difference between the "prince" and the "king" of Tyre.  The false teaching also lines up with Masonic doctrine who worship Lucifer (the light bearer).  What a surprise!

       Jesus is God who shed is blood for your sins to save you from the second death;

       Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

       Repent and believe this to be saved:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       God gave you this life freely to choose.  Whether you repent in this life or are thrown into the lake of fire for eternity as God mocks you, either way, God will get the glory.

       Pro 1:22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
Pro 1:23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 
Pro 1:24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; 
Pro 1:25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: 
Pro 1:26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 
Pro 1:27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 
Pro 1:28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: 
Pro 1:29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 
Pro 1:30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 
Pro 1:31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 
Pro 1:32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. 
Pro 1:33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

       It's funny, when your brain shuts down, you just start vomiting up verses like they mean something.  Well, here are the ones relevant to this...  discussion...
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation 22:16
I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Lucifer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 14:3-12
3 On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labor forced on you, 4 you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon:
      </p>
      <p>
       How the oppressor has come to an end!
    How his fury[a] has ended!
5 The Lord has broken the rod of the wicked,
    the scepter of the rulers,
6 which in anger struck down peoples
    with unceasing blows,
and in fury subdued nations
    with relentless aggression.
7 All the lands are at rest and at peace;
    they break into singing.
8 Even the junipers and the cedars of Lebanon
    gloat over you and say,
“Now that you have been laid low,
    no one comes to cut us down.”
      </p>
      <p>
       9 The realm of the dead below is all astir
    to meet you at your coming;
it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you—
    all those who were leaders in the world;
it makes them rise from their thrones—
    all those who were kings over the nations.
10 They will all respond,
    they will say to you,
“You also have become weak, as we are;
    you have become like us.”
11 All your pomp has been brought down to the grave,
    along with the noise of your harps;
maggots are spread out beneath you
    and worms cover you.
      </p>
      <p>
       12 How you have fallen from heaven,
    morning star, son of the dawn!
You have been cast down to the earth,
    you who once laid low the nations!
      </p>
      <p>
       But continue on being an ignorant fool who can't even read his own book.  I tried to help.

       It started when the Trump supporters threw in their lot with the religious right and the racists (lots of overlap).  In internet terms, that means non racist, non religious folks had to put up with that stuff to keep the coalition together.  I even found some of my alt-right friends even started finding religion.  So when the coalition gets cozy and the sides help each other out, you get the religious folks posting their cringey stuff right and left.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as the coalition falls apart (as it will in coming months), the regular conspiracy minded, atheist believing folks will finally turn on the religious and the racist folks and shit will get ugly right quick.

       Meh, the NWO idea was created by Reaganites (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Libby, Bennett).  It was the think tank they founded, PNAC, that wrote papers about using false flag attacks (“a new Pearl Harbor”, ie 9/11) to consolidate American power.  They even wrote about using a false flag alien invasion as the most likely way to consolidate all nations under one unified government.

       Nah.  Right now I'm focused on the guy that posts here like it's his job.  The one who stays here round the clock, arguing with people for no reason.  The guy who doesn't believe in any conspiracies not approved by CNN.  The one who "mysteriously" gets a consistent amount of upvotes for any of his comments, no matter how stupid they are.  The one who is such a blind, brainwashed, partisan zealot that he would put any fundamentalist Christian to shame.

       That's what happens in American politics with the two party system: to get anything done you have to form coalitions.  And ultimately you are a reflection of the company you keep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't think this right wing coalition can survive for long especially considering how anti-establishment and anti-religious a lot of the altright young folks can be.  Add to that the falling number of white uneducated males and you have a recipe for a party realignment.

       In the years I've been interested in the paranormal and conspiracies, I do not remember there being talk about conspiracy theories being traditionally a right wing thing (except for the govt trying to reduce gun ownership) -- only in the past few years did that sentiment seem to grow.  Particularly, this sub has become filled with much more discussion of political conspiracies  and leaning towards being more conservative biased -- but it wasn't always that way.  If someone were to look only at this sub in the past couple years then they might think it's primarily a right wing thing, but that is only when you consider a relatively small place during a relatively small portion of time which isn't really a valid statistical sample.

       People sure seem to think differently. I've seen very few left-wing conspiracy nut characters in any medium, but I've seen tons of right-wing conspiracy nuts.

       The anti-Trump crew aren't here for any conspiracies. They are here to destroy President Trump and use this forum to piggyback those goals just as they do r/television, r/nba anytime someone says something about President Trump, r/sports during the anthem stuff, r/todayIlearned with it's front page nazi post of the day and so forth. And it's fairly easy to tell when people get mass downvoted, harassed, when TMOR has to be banned from here because of brigading and when any time some incident with President Trump comes up, it's a first post gilded comment.

       Naw, you just haven’t examined the Bible critically.  To quote Clarence Larkin:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        This brings us to the great question - that is, did God write it, or is it simply a collection of the writings of men? if it is simply a collection of the writings of men, without any divine guidance, then it is no more reliable than are the writings of men; but if God wrote it, then it must be true, and we can depend upon its statements. It is clear from the character of the Bible that it is not the work of man, for man could not have written it if he would. and would not have written it if he could.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It details with scathing and unsparing severity the sins of its greatest men, as Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David and Solomon, charging them with falsehood, treachery, pride, adultery, cowardice, murder and gross licentiousness, and presents the history of the Children of Israel as a humiliating record of ingratitude, idolatry, unbelief and rebellion, and it is safe to say, that the Jews, unguided and undirected by the Holy Spirit, would never have chronicled the sinful history of their nation.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have to reject all prophecy
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53&amp;amp;version=KJV">
        regarding Christ
       </a>
       as coincidence/conspiracy, while also ignoring the uniqueness of Israel as the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       culture of antiquity that banned any image of their deity.  Without God, evil doesn’t exist.  I’ve seen enough to know that true evil does exist.  This world is dark.  And there’s only one light.

       There are a lot of religions which are all about critical thinking. Gnosticism, the pythagoreans, Hindu, Buddhism, Taoism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a lot of these religions believe that physical existence is a conspiracy to place more importance on the body than the soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ties into modern societies obsession with individualism and materialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you think religion is mind control, doesn't make it so. Your opinion is valid, but it is still an opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that all conspiracies exist for the sake of gaining power and control and wealth. This has heavy spiritual implications for those who believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout history, there has been a pattern of killing people for the proclamation that god exists as the infinite source from which all springs forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists seek knowledge, and ultimately, truth and knowledge are linked to the divine.

       I hate religion, hate fanatics, and despise hierarchy. That does not mean I’m going to ignore all the obvious religious (satanic) shit the elite do. You see a lot of religious talk here because ppl are beginning to see the same patterns and signs from these people and they all point to a wicked system.

       Ask yourself this, out of all the possible words that TPTB could have chosen to denote our creator, they decided on GOD. Why? Because backwards it spells DOG and our brains are wired to read things front and back. Some studies actually say we retain the memory of the reverse word longer than the orginal. They specifically did this so that every time someone uses the word,  they are reminded that god is nothing more than a dog, meek and obedient.

       0 has always been here along with 1. 1 has always been bored with 0 and yet cannot exist without it, so it divided into ½, etc, ad infinitum. 0 is still chillin' alone while 1 multiplies across the universe, but the two of them were, are, and will always be a perfect match, the decimal system and binary code for proof. The number 10 was most sacred to Pythagoreans.

       I'm not sure I understand your meaning with the exception of how it applies to your statement. Presocratic philosophy focused on 3 main problems; the one and the many, appearance vs reality, and change. As far as I'm aware, it is still considered the Pythagorean approach to the problem of the one and the many.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the meaning of what you're saying, it's great stuff! I find it very interesting that all symbology predating geometry illustrates this concept. However, as I've understood it, the zero is more of a superposition of everything and nothing existing as one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is incorrect, I would greatly appreciate your input.

       That's great feedback. I can most recently quote "The Invention of Science", by David Wooton (2015), p176-177, for a clue:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Perspective painting generally involves a peculiar form of abstraction: the construction of a
        <strong>
         vanishing point
        </strong>
        . It is worth noting that the term itself is relatively modern: in English it dates to 1715. [Leon Battista] Alberti [1404-1472] called it the centric point
        <em>
         (il punto del centro)
        </em>
        , and in many early texts it is simply referred to as 'the horizon'. But Alberti is perfectly clear that the image in a one-point-perspective painting extends "to an almost infinate distance". This, to a Renaissance intellectual, is a deeply puzzling concept. Aristotle's universe is finite and spherical; moreover, it is not surrounded by infinite space and there is no such thing as empty space. Indeed, Aristotle [384–322 BC] does not really have a concept of space as distinct from the objects which fill it. So, for Aristotle, all space is finite, all space is place, and the idea of an infinite extension is conceptually contradictory, just like the idea of a vacuum.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not true, of course, in Euclidean geometry, where parallel lines can be extended indefinitely without meeting (nor, it may be added, in the optics of [Hasan Ibn al-Haytham] Alhazen [c. 965 – c. 1040]). But what you can see when you look across an infinite distance is precisely nothing. It helps, then, if you want to work with a vanishing point, to have
        <strong>
         a concept of nothing
        </strong>
        . Euclid [who was born around the time Aristotle died] lacked the number zero, which was introduced into Western Europe in the early thirteenth century with what we call the Arabic numerals (actually, it is the only one of the ten numerals that is Arabic; the others are Indian). Arabic numerals made possible the paper-based accounting of double-entry bookkeeping. Zeros are wonderfully useful, even if deeply mysterious; perhaps only a culture which had the number zero could have made sense of the idea that a vanishing point could be both a point of non-seeing and the key to the interpretation of painting.

       Nice outlook but I would argue that without 1, zero wouldn’t even be known or experienced. If all you had was 0 you would have something indescribable and unimaginable, a nothingness that’s not even nothing. Yet 1 brings life to it all because 1 is in essence every number so 1 gave life to life itself.

       But the global elites that have controlled power for centuries have all belonged to mainstream religions (various sects of Christianity for the most part).   The only President of the United States that wasn’t a mainstream church-goer is Trump, who has no record of religiousness until he switched parties in his 70’s and started his campaign to court the religious right vote (hence continuing the tradition of Christian ruling elite).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only religions that generally have been shat on and can’t be expressed in public and will ruin your career would be perhaps Wicca/Pagan, Zoroastrianism,  and Satanism.   Oh and Scientology (unless you are an actor, then it might advance your career).

       The ‘Elites’ coopted the teachings to their own ends- getting in front of organic revolutions allows them to determine the narrative that follows.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, that’s why we have hundreds of millions of people believing in the idea of the virgin birth as a literal occurrence as opposed to a symbolic metaphor for the independent growth into consciousness.

       Actually, it makes a lot of sense for their to be Christian Conspiracy Theorists if you look at it from this angle: Aliens and reptilians are actually Demons. The shadow government behind the seats of power are demonic in nature. The NWO is the coming kingdom of the Anti-Christ.

       I think it's over-simplifying to say that religious people are sheep, as if athiests are critical thinkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that we are all prone to believing things that agree with our existing worldview without thinking consciously about them.  It's the people whose worldview's clash with a narrative that are most apt to see it's faults.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some conspiracies, like pedogate or the Satanic cults, religious people are some of the best at seeing the things that don't make sense.

       I've noticed religious people tend to believe crazier theories like Flat Earth and Reptoids but I guess that's kind of expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the risk of sounding like I'm disparaging the religious, if they've already accepted the existence of God without evidence then there's really nothing so crazy that they couldn't accept it on faith alone.

       I'm saying "the world" (run by Lucifer) has it set up in such a way.  My parents did this unawares.  Both of them go to a Laodiceain type Church and don't believe a bit of it.  Modern Church buildings are just social clubs.

       But the global elites that have controlled power for centuries have all belonged to mainstream religions (various sects of Christianity for the most part).   The only President of the United States that wasn’t a mainstream church-goer is Trump, who has no record of religiousness until he switched parties in his 70’s and started his campaign to court the religious right vote (hence continuing the tradition of Christian ruling elite).

       The only religions that generally have been shat on and can’t be expressed in public and will ruin your career would be perhaps Wicca/Pagan, Zoroastrianism,  and Satanism.   Oh and Scientology (unless you are an actor, then it might advance your career).
