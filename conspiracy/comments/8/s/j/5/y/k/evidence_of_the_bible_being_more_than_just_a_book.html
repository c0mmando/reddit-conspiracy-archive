<p>𝐀n 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐰𝐡𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 &quot;𝐂𝐡𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐆𝐨𝐝&quot;  &quot;Yahweh&quot; or עליון 𝐄𝐥 𝐄𝐥𝐲𝐨𝐧= 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐇𝐢𝐠𝐡 𝐆𝐨𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐝 עִמָּנוּאֵל 𝐈𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐞𝐥, 𝐆𝐨𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐮𝐬 = 𝐉𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐬. 𝐈𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐆𝐨𝐝.  </p>

<p>Firstly would be historical. I think arguments can be mounted that are solid and compelling—first for the existence of Jesus, and then for the death and the resurrection of Jesus.  </p>

<p>𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨 𝐂𝐡𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐧 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐮𝐬?  The value of this evidence is that it is both early and detailed. The first Christian writings to talk about Jesus are the epistles of St Paul, and scholars agree that the earliest of these letters were written within 25 years of Jesus’s death at the very latest, while the detailed biographical accounts of Jesus in the New Testament gospels date from around 40 years after he died. These all appeared within the lifetimes of numerous eyewitnesses, and provide descriptions that comport with the culture and geography of first-century Palestine. It is also difficult to imagine why Christian writers would invent such a thoroughly Jewish savior figure in a time and place – under the aegis of the Roman empire – where there was strong suspicion of Judaism.  </p>

<p>A 𝐍𝐨𝐧 𝐛𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐞  Flavius Josephus was a 1st century Jewish historian (37 – 100 AD). He was a commander of the Jewish forces in Galilee and would later become a Roman citizen. He was employed as a historian by the Flavian emperors Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian.  He mentions Jesus in his historical writings (and his brother James cf. Antiquities 20.200).  </p>

<p>His testimony,  “𝐀𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐚 𝐰𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐧 𝐰𝐡𝐨 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐉𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐬. 𝐀𝐧𝐝 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐠𝐨𝐨𝐝, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 [𝐡𝐞] 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐤𝐧𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞 𝐯𝐢𝐫𝐭𝐮𝐨𝐮𝐬.

<p>𝐃𝐢𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐰𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐉𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐬?  Strikingly, there was never any debate in the ancient world about whether Jesus of Nazareth was a historical figure. In the earliest literature of the Jewish Rabbis, Jesus was denounced as the illegitimate child of Mary and a sorcerer. Among pagans, the satirist Lucian and philosopher Celsus dismissed Jesus as a scoundrel, but we know of no one in the ancient world who questioned whether Jesus lived.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ill answer a few for you to help you understand. First off the Bible is a living book which is why it says; </p>

<p><strong>Isaiah 28:10 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for the first one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GE 1:3-5 On the first day, God created light, then separated light and darkness. 
GE 1:14-19 The sun (which separates night and day) wasn&#39;t created until the fourth day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The light it is talking about first is not a star, it is a spirit. The first spirit ever created was the spirit that dwelled in Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>John 1 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p>

<p>2 The same was in the beginning with God.</p>

<p>3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>

<p>4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>

<p>5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>

<p>6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</p>

<p>7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</p>

<p>8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</p>

<p>9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For all of the creation ones like #2 #3 #4 #6 using wisdom we see that chapter 1 of genesis is the precursor to explaining the second chapter. During the second chapter it becomes personalized with names and such.</p>

<p>Moving on;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GE 1:26 Man is to have dominion over fish, birds, cattle, and all wild animals, yet-- GE 2:15-17 It is wrong to be able to tell good from evil, right from wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the first commandment ever given by God. This was done for divine purposes. </p>

<p>Next;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GE 1:28 God encourages reproduction. LE 12:1-8 God requires purification rites following childbirth which, in effect, makes childbirth a sin. (Note: The period for purification following the birth of a daughter is twice that for a son.)</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><p>These are two different commandment settings, the commandments given to Adam and Noah have nothing to do with the commandments given to Israel. </p></li>
<li><p>The purification process is to allow the woman to heal. This is why God also says take a break from producing crops on the land so that she can heal (we rape her today more than ever). Which is why it is a sin to keep producing even when the woman has not healed. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Another one;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GE 1:31 God was pleased with his creation. GE 6:5-6 God was not pleased with his creation. 
(Note: That God should be displeased is inconsistent with the concept of omniscience as well as with the fact that God allegedly does not change his mind: NU 23:19-20, 1SA 15:29, JA 1:17.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet we stand here today 8 billion deep. Was not mercy showed to the men and women of earth when we had become to evil? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>GE 2:4, 4:26, 12:8, 22:14-16, 26:25 God was already known as &quot;the Lord&quot; (Jahveh or Jehovah) much earlier than the time of Moses. 
EX 6:2-3 God was first known as &quot;the Lord&quot; (Jahveh or Jehovah) at the time of the Egyptian Bondage, during the life of Moses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll let you in a secret, God took a special seed from the children of Adam and has been with them ever since all the way down to Noah---&gt;Shem--&gt;Abraham---&gt;Issac----&gt;Jacob. </p>

<p>This is why Jesus was compared to Adam, because the same spirit that dwelled in Adam dwelled in Jesus. </p>

<p><strong>1 Corinthians 15:45-47</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</p>

<p>46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</p>

<p>47 The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>GE 2:17 Adam was to die the very day that he ate the forbidden fruit. GE 5:5 Adam lived 930 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, entered the world because they ate the fruit. God does not specify when they would die but that they would die because they ate the fruit. Only a scoffer would say that it meant he&#39;d die the minute he ate it.</p>

<p>The punishment of sin is death. We sin everyday and yet here we are still alive but even though we don&#39;t understand it when it happens, judgement is still happening. Whether is it is instantaneous or ever creeping. </p>

<p>This is just to correct a few but I&#39;m curious to which ones on the list you are claiming are the heaviest contradictions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what the liars of the Romans Catholic Church told you. God has favorites and they don&#39;t read those precepts. God has a favorite people, favorite flower even a favorite fowl. If you were a master architect of all of this wouldn&#39;t you have a favorite? Don&#39;t hobbyist who build model cars and etc have favorite models? Then the same is for God.</p>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 7:6 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>6 For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Deuteronomy 32:8</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>2 Esdras Chapter 5</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>23 And said, O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of the earth, and of all the trees thereof, thou hast chosen thee one only vine:</p>

<p>24 And of all lands of the whole world thou hast chosen thee one pit: and of all the flowers thereof one lily:</p>

<p>25 And of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee one river: and of all builded cities thou hast hallowed Sion unto thyself:</p>

<p>26 And of all the fowls that are created thou hast named thee one dove: and of all the cattle that are made thou hast provided thee one sheep:</p>

<p>27 And among all the multitudes of people thou hast gotten thee one people: and unto this people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavest a law that is approved of all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, out of all the nations the only nation that God exclaims hate for is the nation of Edom (the twin brother of Jacob) which will be destroyed at the end of time. </p>

<p><strong>Romans 9:13 King James Version (KJV)</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>13 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did create a perfect world</p>

<p>God gave humans the power to be good. But humans out of their own free will choose evil. Humans brought evil and suffering upon themselves not through God&#39;s doing thus creating a sinful world.</p>

<p>Just because bad things happen it doesn&#39;t mean God isn&#39;t real.</p>

<p>I suppose you believe in aliens, if you do let&#39;s say peaceful aliens from across the galaxy come and tell humanity to destroy our nukes and show us new technology&#39;s on how to further our race and make the world a better place.</p>

<p>Would you scold the aliens and complain as to why they didn&#39;t reveal the knowledge to us sooner or would you be thankful and accept the knowledge as a gift and better yourself for it?</p>

<p>Perhaps the aliens waited until we reached a certain level of intelligence, or they oberserving our actions with no interference because they were bound by an oath they put forward? or there is a completely different reason all together that we can&#39;t comprehend because there race is millions of years ahead of us.</p>

<p>The same concept applies to God, for most part we are unsure of his reasoning because he is out of our realm of comprehension as he is literally the creator of the universe.</p>

<p>For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. (Isaiah 55:90)</p>

<p>God gives us an outline on how to live our lives, that we should strive to be righteous and holy. That is why there is a lot of personal and social knowledge found in the bible.</p>

<p>Humanity is in a corrupt and evil state. God cannot accept evil into his home or any imperfect thing. Our flesh belonging to this world and our spirit belonging to God cannot have intercession with each other forever so we must leave the flesh and follow Jesus Christ so we can be with God in the spirit.</p>

<p>The bible isn&#39;t meant to tell you the secrets of the universe it is meant to tell you how to be with the creator of the universe. That is the purpose of the bible.</p>

<p>And anyone who thinks that someone who lived their life as a good person won&#39;t be allowed into &quot;Heaven&quot; just because they didn&#39;t follow the right book written by man is asinine with delusions of grandeur. </p>

<p>Ever heard of the game &quot;telephone&quot;? Religion is very powerful. How are we supposed to expect that the actual <em>word of God</em>, the only being to ever be infallible, not only wasn&#39;t changed over the years due to miscommunication, but due to malice? To believe that is to put your faith in something besides god. Which is a sin. </p>

<p>Therefore one of God&#39;s commandments is contradictory. Either that or he assumed that humans, beings that he knew were corrupted, wouldn&#39;t fuck his word up for their own selfish reasons. Either way, that goes against his inherantly infallible nature.</p>

<p>Have you ever met a religious person who was conspiracy-minded? Religious followers and Conspiracy followers are the antithesis of each other.  The religious are sheep (“the Lord is their Shepherd”), while the conspiracists want to pull the wool from their eyes.  There is no Critical Thinking allowed in Religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then why place the fruit in the garden to begin with? Why force humanity go to through test to prove their worthiness? </p>

<p>The gift of free will also came with the knowledge that it would be used improperly. An all-knowing and all-powerful God would have understood that people would abuse this gift before he gave it. Therefore, suffering and poor decisions made by humans can only be possible because of God. Had he not given the power of free will, there would have been no need to give rules about how to commune with him in heaven. </p>

<p>My point is that if God did not want evil to exist, he has the power to end it. Fed up with Satan? End him. Or better yet never create a power for evil in the first place. It has nothing to do with our level of intelligence or understanding since we were not the ones that set this whole thing in motion. </p>
