        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ever since Julian Assange made his revelations of US war crimes and was accused for pedophilia shortly after I&#39;ve been been in alert with the pedophilia-accusations. While I no moment believe that Assange had anything going on with kids, let&#39;s admit it, if someone gets convicted for pedophilia it&#39;s game over. </p>

<p>Mike Tyson even got (socially) away with a rape, but if he had been a pedophile instead, he would have been stabbed to death already in prison. You don&#39;t want to associate any way with a pedophile, and surely you don&#39;t want to believe a word a pedophile says. You don&#39;t want them working even on a local store - 99% of people just want the pedophiles away from all the civilization, and often castrated, if not dead. </p>

<p>The only reason that anyone believed Assange is because he striked first, and the accusations came after. Can you even imagine Assange trying to publish &quot;SHOCKING TRUTH OF US MILITARY&quot; when he is being trialed for luring 8 year old kids to his home?</p>

<p>Now while I don&#39;t claim that there aren&#39;t real pedophilia amongst the politicians/other influential people, I must ask if all of these pedophilia-cases are actually legitimate? One weird detail seems to be very common amongst these cases: pedophilia-related emails/possession of child pornography. These are fucking child&#39;s play to fabricate, yet after someone gets caught for emailing/chatting about fucking children, it triggers so absolute disgust that no-one even wants to think the person being innocent no more. just one step backwards - who the fuck talks about committing the most horrific and loathed crime via internet in the first place? EVERYONE today knows how easily computers get affected by viruses that aren&#39;t even visible to the owner, so it&#39;s wear the seatbelt when driving-level of precaution to stfu even about the smallest crimes, such as selling illegal weed or so. so how in the world assumably above average-intelligent politicians/influentals who KNOW that they have powerful enemies would actually be so fucking suicidal to talk about their pedophilia via internet or hide child porn on their PC/homes?</p>

<p>however this still seems to be the physical evidence (often the only hard evidence as well) for their child abuse. isn&#39;t this kind of weird? What if these seemingly sudden pedophilia-cases are actually preemptive strikes against political enemies who are about to make something so big that they just need to be erased from the picture? </p>

<p>don&#39;t slip poison to his drink - just slip some child porn to his apartment or fabricate a child abuse conversation in his name. Please do remember that these people have millions of money and shitload of influence to hire the best programming/computer experts to fabricate evidence that really holds in court.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;d think that false pedophilia-accusations would be the perfect social weapon to erase anyone unwanted permanently away from the picture. Send a child molester to prison and he&#39;ll be shanked in a week, and if he ever manages to survive the moral justice of the inmates he&#39;ll face a world where NO-ONE wants to even hear about him until his obituary on the newspaper. Succesfully fabricate your enemy for pedophilia and he&#39;ll be absolutely fucking gone, forever.</p>

<p>Leave a thought!</p>

<p>You&#39;re completely right.  And these days the light version of it is to assume someone of sexual misconduct or harassment from decades ago.  As soon as anyone in public is accused, it&#39;s already career over time, whether it&#39;s true or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>metoo seems to have turned into a political weapon indeed. People get so triggered when hearing about sexual harassment (of women lol) that by the time you win the trial you are stigmatized and your future in every possible influental job is gone - it&#39;s simply bad business to deliberately associate the company with people who have been blamed for sexual harassment.</h1>

<p>It was one from the start. Weinstein was outed to create a wide zone of community outrage so they could slip in other targets who would be considered guilty by association. It was a politically-motivated operation. Rose McGowan didn&#39;t just suddenly get a conscious about being paid off. My guess is that she was probably both manipulated and compensated.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve figured out how they do it. Since they have access to your whole life history, they identify 5-10 women who you have a history with, and who you&#39;re on bad terms with. Then they have lawyers on their payroll who will contact each of those women individually. Since none of the women were actually  sexually assaulted, they&#39;ll tell each one, &quot;Hey, someone gave us a tip you had a strained relationship with [James, Garrison, Morgan]. I&#39;ve got a number of women here who say [he] assaulted them. However you know how hard this is to prove, so we need to find as many women as we can who can strengthen the case, otherwise [the liberal actor&#39;s name] will get away with it. You don&#39;t have to do anything, just show some support.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point the lawyer and the operatives who paid them have ten accusers named to documents without any assault ever having taken place. They will not win any lawsuit, which is fine, since that was never the point. And now there is a big movement, and the whole of woman-dom would rather crash and burn every last man on Earth than admit they were played. </p>

<p>I&#39;m certain something like this is exactly what is happening, though I can&#39;t be sure about the tactics. This feels like it would work well, however.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA worker who leaked espionage tools WikiLeaks was charged recently. The article says that they had him on child pronography before they had him for the leaks: <a href="https://truepundit.com/cia-worker-charged-with-disclosing-classified-information-to-wikileaks/">https://truepundit.com/cia-worker-charged-with-disclosing-classified-information-to-wikileaks/</a></p>

<p>Conceivably, the CIA could have just emailed  some CP, then busted into his residence one second later, and finally start looking for the evidence that they&#39;re really interested in.</p>

<p>Planting CP, if that&#39;s really what they do, would be much easier than planting physical evidence. Planting weapons and drugs requires being somewhere and not getting caught. Planting digital evidence just requires an anonymous identity, and not even the digital evidence itself - probably just a link to it is enough.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the guy might have a giant pornstash, with no way to really verify whether or not young girls are really  of legal age or just look like they&#39;re of legal age. Or maybe some of them are of legal age, but they look a lot younger than they really are. All of those could be cause for a search warrant and charges on CP. If the CIA wanted to, they really could stretch charges that far.</p>

<p>And of course, if he did have actual CP, then that&#39;s totally wrong and it&#39;s a good thing he went to jail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;be much easier than planting physical evidence&quot; while certainly harder, influental people often travel a lot, meaning that their homes/travel homes are often empty. they certainly do have camera surveillance, but I doubt that any kind of security system would be enough to hold CIA-level ninja wanting to momentarily shut down a part of the system without triggering an alert.</p>

<p>they often travel a lot, so just hide some child porn to their luggage while fabricating the digital evidence. easier and gets the job done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s much easier than that.  Intel and Microsoft (there are many more) are absolutely complicit to leaving security holes open for alphabet agencies exploitation.  A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/another-day-another-intel-cpu-security-hole-lazy-state/">recent example</a> here, although this is a great one, since it&#39;s easily attributed to lazy engineering to allow boosted performance at the cost of security.</p>

<p>Still, rest assured they would have zero problems planting CP on a computer covertly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found that presentation mind-blowing when it first came out. Again and again we find that various &quot;vulnerabilities&quot; were actually planned obfuscations - it will backfire on them one of these days. It&#39;s all just a modern take on the rigged electrical equipment we sold to Poland during the Cold War. The plan was for it to function normally until we needed to turn off the lights during a Russian invasion. We&#39;d be fools to think that strategy hasn&#39;t been updated. There&#39;s a reason NSA sponsors and attends all the major hacking and security events.</p>

<p>We&#39;re in a sad time. Because of WL, we know about so many of these programs, but the gap in understanding of what CIA and others are capable of and the public&#39;s general knowledge of computing is so vast that we don&#39;t properly appreciate how out of line it all is. Americans know it&#39;s bad that the gov&#39;t can wiretap phone calls, but by and large they have no idea that anyone at anytime can become a realtime target of various NSA programs that are so far beyond phone calls. And when you become a target they&#39;ve already collected massive amounts of data on you - it&#39;s just a matter of becoming the subject of a query.</p>

<p>Imagine some hopeful Senator with a bold plan to fix our foreign affairs and invest in infrastructure? Oops - he used to look at some pretty whacky fetish stuff on porn sites and an agent has helpfully let him know who his real constituents are. It&#39;s all just such a recipe for disaster in a so-called democracy.</p>

<p>The encryption we take for granted today very likely has gov&#39;t backdoors in it. And if it doesn&#39;t, there&#39;s every reason to believe they&#39;ve got quantum computers that are decades ahead of what the public knows about. Hard not to be cynical!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In short, I agree whole heartedly with everything you said.  Really your comment deserves it’s own post.  People don’t know, they have no idea that once you connect any computer to the internet, it’s pretty much all bets are off.  Hell there’s even compromised HDD firmware!  </p>

<p>So you agree the real enforcers are the alphabets.  They have the keys to every man’s castle, President, senator, or janitor.  Nothing is secret, and they can frame you for anything if you have a machine that was ever on the internet, it’s fucking spooky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He released about 20 pages of grievances on how he fucking hates our prison system and how J. Edgar Hoover essentially weaponized the FBI into the police state and how it is today. He&#39;s currently under pre-trial house arrest with everything but basic TV and phone calls. No Internet to help himself with his case, nothing. He&#39;s been deemed a violent/flight risk by the system and has had all rights stripped before he&#39;s even had his first court date. I read his grievances last night and he totally seems like the dude who&#39;s trying to stick it to the Feds making him an enemy of them. </p>

<p>Funny how the CIA/FBI who actively manage CP sites don&#39;t find anything related to his leaks but magically find 10,000 pictures and then say he just google searched child porn and got it from people and they have receipts. Real easy to make receipts when you&#39;re running the joint eh? Also why would someone who is in tech like that just google child porn? He hacked into CIA computers, do you think he&#39;s really THIS stupid?</p>

<p>Yes, there were other allegations, but they didn&#39;t get a lot of press. The slander was traced to a DNC-connected company based in San Francisco. Later, some CIA guy repeated the slander on cable news. You can find the deets on Google is you wish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s way more pedophilia/trafficking going on than people would like to think happens.  I also think that you are 100% right that  people are just outright accusing people of false crimes right now.  The true pedophiles accuse everyone else of pedophilia, so it chums up the water and no one can tell the truth from lies and everyone is a shade of gray rather than black or white.  The same is true for the metoo movement.  Some percent is real and some percent is false accusations.</p>

<p>The real question is why has it come to this?  It&#39;s because no one trusts the judicial system to get it right.  We should be able to let the judicial system do it&#39;s work and just trust that they came up with the right outcome (with systems in place to ensure fairness and lack of corruption), but since we can&#39;t trust them we end up forming our opinions from hearsay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know they plant cp on people’s computers. It’s terrifying. Keep vigilant on your servers and make sure you don’t get fucked with. Especially when bringing to light this shit. Exposing grooming as well is a mindfuck in itself. It boils down to lack of feminine energy in the world. Mothers need to be focused on the protection of their children. Trust no one. Children technically only can defend themselves once they are capable of forming thoughts on their own and being allowed to voice their opinions in safe environments. Mothers do not give enough weight to words their children say and must be on the lookout for abuse signs up until that child is taking care of themselves financially, mentally and physically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you just look at the timeline of these pedo cases, it usually follows along with elections. It is 100&amp;#37; based on politics and used as a tool to throw dirt on opponents or their supporters. I hate that it has started because this sub is always filled with all of this political stuff. There are tons of articles on pedos now and politics in general. This is exactly why Trump hired Bannon, spoke to Alex Jones all the time and hired Roger Stone as well. And it is from that alliance that I believe &quot;Q&quot; was started. I think &quot;Q&quot; was Assange but after his internet was cut(the day it was, &quot;Q&quot; had to start posting on a different page, which is very interesting to me) other people picked it up. Ever since then, there have been multiple people come out proving falsehoods about &quot;Q&quot;, whistleblowers coming out explaining how the group did certain things and other stuff like money, etc... Anyway, different story. </p>

<p>My biggest issue with the pedo stuff is that 99&amp;#37; of these people who write about it don&#39;t really care about stopping pedo&#39;s, they care more about proving that the elite do the things they talk about. I prove that part by asking those people: If you really cared about stopping pedos, then why don&#39;t you? Why don&#39;t you start in your own town? I guarantee there are plenty of them there because they are everywhere. There are people out there that go online, act like children, get sicko&#39;s to send them gross texts/pics, set up a meeting, then turn the evidence over to the authorities when they show up. So why don&#39;t you start there? They either never respond or block my account. </p>

I expect hes going to commit suicide after his defense and the prosecutor roughshod right over him.  Pft. Probably will bob his head left n right from the drugs as he sits in a perplexed silence.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>turned into a political weapon </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was one from the start. Weinstein was outed to create a wide zone of community outrage so they could slip in other targets who would be considered guilty by association. It was a politically-motivated operation. Rose McGowan didn&#39;t just suddenly get a conscious about being paid off. My guess is that she was probably both manipulated and compensated.</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve figured out how they do it. Since they have access to your whole life history, they identify 5-10 women who you have a history with, and who you&#39;re on bad terms with. Then they have lawyers on their payroll who will contact each of those women individually. Since none of the women were actually  sexually assaulted, they&#39;ll tell each one, &quot;Hey, someone gave us a tip you had a strained relationship with [James, Garrison, Morgan]. I&#39;ve got a number of women here who say [he] assaulted them. However you know how hard this is to prove, so we need to find as many women as we can who can strengthen the case, otherwise [the liberal actor&#39;s name] will get away with it. You don&#39;t have to do anything, just show some support.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point the lawyer and the operatives who paid them have ten accusers named to documents without any assault ever having taken place. They will not win any lawsuit, which is fine, since that was never the point. And now there is a big movement, and the whole of woman-dom would rather crash and burn every last man on Earth than admit they were played. </p>

<p>I&#39;m certain something like this is exactly what is happening, though I can&#39;t be sure about the tactics. This feels like it would work well, however.</p>
