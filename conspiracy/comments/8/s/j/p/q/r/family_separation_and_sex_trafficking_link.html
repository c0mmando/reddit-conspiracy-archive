A huge influx of undocumented children being brought in, separated from their families, and then dispersed across the country into foster homes or left at the concentration camps. All the while their parents are deported without them. With little hope of them being reunited because the US has no plan in place for reunification. Seems like the perfect scenario to supply untraceable kids to pedophiles.</p>

<p>All I could find about this was a Buzzfeed article kind of aggressively denying any of this, and then a bunch of links to other articles that say that there&#39;s no evidence for this.

    <div class="md"><p>That would be what will happen. There are numerous laws and policies around all of this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of silly to isolate a single policy.</p>

<p>Just like this separation of kids and adults occurred due to a 1997 law meant to both curb human trafficking and prevent children from being locked up in jail with parents that committed crimes.</p>

<p>Trump created a zero tolerance policy which drove the prosecution of people crossing the border illegally.</p>

<p>The children being detained separately was an unintended consequence of this policy. (You can debate whether it was intended or not, but I&#39;m not because it is completely beside the point and irrelevant.)</p>

<p>Trump signed an EO that kept in place all of the rest of the enforcement, but suggested a new solution needs to be done to detain the families together.</p>

<p>There are separate laws, not being talked about here, that require identifying familial relationships before releasing children to them. This EO does not affect those laws.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of laws, policies, and regulations around immigration.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to get into this gutter of arguing assumption and speculation. Unless you know every law and policy around immigration, I would advise you don&#39;t either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s blown my mind I haven’t seen this mentioned more here. Trump, a guy linked to Epstein who had also been named in court cases with Epstein,  has been separating children from families. In the process, THOUSANDS of children were “lost”. Dyncorp, a company contracted to run some of these camps have been previously linked to trafficking. </p>

<p>I can only stand so many coincidences before I start to think something is rotten. I personally think these kids are being trafficked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve confirmed that 90% of these kids coming are NOT coming with their parents. They&#39;re coming with child-traffickers. Their own parents sold them into sex slavery.</p>

<p>So we can drop the rhetoric of the &quot;caring parents being separated from their children&quot;.</p>

<p>No, we&#39;re watching the difference between sentimental Western attitudes toward children, and brutal Third World attitudes, where they don&#39;t have the same value for life.</p>

<p>The Original Poster is right, though: The child-traffickers are working for pedophile networks INSIDE the United States. Child-trafficking generates more money than narcotics now. It&#39;s a huge problem. As our economy tanks, the elites are turning to drugs and child-trafficking to recoup their losses. </p>

<p>What the pedophile-elite are doing now is dishonestly claiming that the traffickers are the children&#39;s &quot;families,&quot; to have tax payers subsidize the pedophile corridor </p>

<p>It&#39;s a brilliant masterpiece of evil.</p>

<p>Getting taxpayers to pay for THEIR pedophilia. All under the guise of &quot;But-It&#39;s-For-The-Children!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. It&#39;s definitely crossed my mind. Not only sex trafficking, but also being used as test subjects for things like mind control &amp; manipulation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also crossed my mind that they&#39;re using children to be informants, drug smuggling, and other things that children are more likely to get away with.</p>

<p>If they&#39;re being taken from their parents, they probably also won&#39;t have any type of communication with other family members, therefore it&#39;s easy for the governments to take them away &amp; not have to think twice about any repercussions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be what will happen. There are numerous laws and policies around all of this.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of silly to isolate a single policy.</p>

<p>Just like this separation of kids and adults occurred due to a 1997 law meant to both curb human trafficking and prevent children from being locked up in jail with parents that committed crimes.</p>

<p>Trump created a zero tolerance policy which drove the prosecution of people crossing the border illegally.</p>

<p>The children being detained separately was an unintended consequence of this policy. (You can debate whether it was intended or not, but I&#39;m not because it is completely beside the point and irrelevant.)</p>

<p>Trump signed an EO that kept in place all of the rest of the enforcement, but suggested a new solution needs to be done to detain the families together.</p>

<p>There are separate laws, not being talked about here, that require identifying familial relationships before releasing children to them. This EO does not affect those laws.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of laws, policies, and regulations around immigration.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to get into this gutter of arguing assumption and speculation. Unless you know every law and policy around immigration, I would advise you don&#39;t either.</p>
