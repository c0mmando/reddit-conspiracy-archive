       Terrifying facts. There really aren't that many stupid people on twitter, fb, and reddit. It's botnets and groups paid to smear, confuse, and divide. Always call them out. It may kill time, but it strengthens your arguments as you shutdown corporate talking points.

       Itâ€™s so baffling how different people are in real life vs the average person you come across through TV and social media.  The manipulation has to be so much more widespread than I previously thought was realistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get a lot of solace knowing most people are far more decent and reasonable than the snapshots and sound bites would have us believe.  All the more reason to judge based off your experience first and foremost.

       As someone who has been in IT for years... No, most people are bona fide idiots and assholes.

       I've had people in their 50s ask where the cord with three prongs goes.  They literally didn't know how to plug in an electrical cable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, if you want examples of social skills, the people that have laughed at me when I fixed their problems. Because they said I was wrong and they knew it because their
       <em>
        husband
       </em>
       works in IT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or all the nurses and doctors with massive superiority complexes because they think IT people are beneath them, when they didn't know how to hit Restart from the start menu.

       I could be here all night. I've supported people from offices in person and from their homes as telephone tech support for a different company.

       People aren't smarter than you think. They are far, far,
       <em>

       stupider and do not give a fuck about people around them, even the ones that just want to help.

       At the same time, I think it might be important to remember that - if you are anything like me - you too are sometimes the one making the mindless little mistakes or stupid thoughtless gestures; if it's not as stupid as asking what the plug is for, it's leaving your trash behind because that's the minimum wage suckers job, or driving through that stale yellow which you know is actually a red, or even just taking a turn without shoulder checking and cutting off a pedestrian or a biker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have done something like this, and will do so in the future. But that's because most people are dealing with shit, just like you are, and trying to make due. Some of them do it because they really are that selfish and greedy and shitty, but the vast majority of them do it because they are distracted and have all the other shit they have to attend to on their mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just like you forgive and forget yourself when you do stupid shit like that, you should still try and forgive the same behavior in others. Otherwise, jesus man, that's not a life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for preaching. Wishing you the best.

       That's all well and good,  but the fact remains that people are stupid.  THEY need therapy.  Stop telling IT guy HE needs it. No matter what field you work in, if you're not stupid,  you'll see most people are.

       How do you figure this? Do you have a pretty small "friends" list on these sites ? I am connected to quite a few people and there are definitely "those" people running around. Hell, one of my facebook pals posted a huge rant about how the Mexican Wal Mart stuff was fake news and tons of "right wingers" who constantly talk about how dumb "liberals" are.

       I have about a thousand on FB, a separate thousand on instagram, and about a hundred on twitter. The demographic is mostly 18-35 though. Most people online and IRL that you actually get to know are for a lot more than the labels and news media suggest. Common ground isn't hard to find, even with my right wing upper middle class friends. Most bots are just empty worthless arguments that end very quickly or lead to blocks/bans. Certainly there are people lumped into these groups that just parrot what they're reading above/below, but those people can be swayed in conversation/debate.

       Yeah, if anything, I would say most people aren't exactly anti-conspiracy (althought the bad reputation we have doesn't help) by itself but rather apathetic for the most part and only become part of the circlejerk because of social pressure, but I'm sure this could all be avoided if the control these people have in social media wasn't so huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried this out myself, if I become isolated enough from the usual "echo chamber effect" I can talk about even the most controversial conspiracy content with regular people and wake them up with almost no effort put into it. That's why we gotta do what we can to create a place that actually fights back against the brigading and rewards It's users for participating.

       this post is some front page 800+ upvotes kind of post, simply because that's Arthur Davis (Obama's right hand man) standing next to a guy that looks like Obama, with a jacket on and trees, (when supposedly this is supposed to be Burning Man, which is a hot ass desert with no trees)

       You're saying it's front page worthy because you think it should be.

       I mean, it's not confirmed that that's Artur Davis, the original picture isn't attributed to Burning Man, and there's nothing "satanic" about the bloody costume anyway.

       A typical work week in the U.S. consists of a variable amount of days and hours that usually consist of Monday - Friday, typically 7-8 am to 3-5 pm, and sometimes multiple shifts. Any weekend hours would consist of overtime and going over budget.

       We need to put away our political beliefs and collectively think about how to end the problems that cause political divide.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may put people in office but we currently can't control what they do when they get there.  If we get enough people coming together actually wanting to solve problems, we may be able to force change.

       Yup.  Propaganda tends to focus on middle class vs. lower class. (Cops vs. inner-city blacks.  US job seekers vs. Illegal immigrants.  Birth control.  College debt. etc.)  Then there's identity politics that just splits the middle and lower classes completely across partisan lines.  Like Trans issues, kneeling for the anthem, climate change, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmm, I wonder who has the means to push that type of propaganda to and benefits by keeping the middle class and lower class at odds.  Could it be the new plutocracy?  Nah, I'm sure the mega rich are blissfully neutral on all this stuff.

       Kind nuts how many times this has been said in this community and yet...still disdain for anyone bringing up anything other than dividing domestic topics. Topics that are pretty fucking pointless if you really look at them. Iâ€™m sure you can think of a few yourself that weâ€™re all just pitted against each other on for no reason but to divide. Weâ€™ll get there one day. I have no doubt in my mind that the American people will be the first to correct their tyrannical govt in the most peaceful/civilized means necessary. And it will be beautiful

       daily reminder that in 2013 they repealed the Fulbright amendment to the Smith-Mundt Act. that amendment prevented US intelligence agencies from targeting propaganda at US citizens. since then we've been hit with a full-court press by domestic propaganda, meant to divide the US populace and get us pissed at each other instead of the people in power.

       This is the selling point for why there should be more engagement by real people on social media. The other thing to think about is the way you write. Include links to back up your claims when you can, or provide links for others when they claim something that you know is true. We have to have each other's backs. Some people will dismiss a claim because they have no idea that proof is available.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, OP's post is about online shills. Some people don't know that there is a
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">
        mountain of proof
       </a>
       on this topic. This is in contrast to claims like
       <em>
        "I can't believe you think there are secret agents arguing with you on the internet."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Given all of that information, it should be clear that we are being bombarded from many different angles, which means we need to be better at this. They can spend millions trying to propagandize a population to believe a falsehood, but all it takes is one well-placed comment with a citation to completely neutralize that propaganda for tens of thousands of people or more. We have the upper hand, we just have to use it.

       Basically if you listen to any American music(or any country that is part of the system), watch television, watch movies, use Facebook and a slew of other things.... YOU ARE BEING PROGRAMMED TO THINK HOW THEY WANT YOU TO THINK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you are being dumbed down, especially with television. Think for yourself and question everything and everyone. If you have friends that do not think like a non sheep cut them out as they are liabilities, if you cannot convert them they are just frienemies.

       You are 100% unbending on these points and that's certainly why I downvote you.
