       Sexual promiscuity is leading us to a global mass extinction event. Already antibiotics are becoming useless to some forms of these infections. Soon "having a good time" will result in millions of children dying from drug resistant disease. Promiscuity is not just detrimental to your own mental and physical health, but it is harmful to the health of the human genome. Context matters. Having sexual relationships within the context of a relationship is the only healthy way to have sex. Go talk to someone, get to know them, then bang. Banging random people is absolutely degenerate. Not only that, a promiscuous lifestyle has the chance to cause permanent physical and psychological harm.

       Is There a Price to Pay for Promiscuity?
Society puts an emphasis on sexuality — but casual sex can impact your physical and emotional health in ways that you may not suspect.

       Having a stable relationship and sex life is healthy. Having sex with different people all the time is very detrimental to your mental and physical health. Not just you though. It has an effect on all of society.

       Again; context matters.

       Sex with multiple people throughout your life is fine. It's just important to form a relationship with the people your having sex with. Sex is more than just "a good time". The act forms neuro pathways that we can call "love". Sex with multiple partners randomly I.e. hooking up with strangers does damage to this aspect of the brain.

       Not just that look at what's happening with std's... They are rampant in major cities. And now California legalized the knowingly transmission  of aides.

       ? How is having random sex healthy in any way?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only healthy way to have sex is to at least get to know the person. I know impulses exist, but having a lifestyle of impulse just shows a lack of self control.

       That's me agreeing with the OP but offering the idea that opposing ideas exist, based on individual thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason i can offer that argument is not because i think people should sleep around (I've been with Mrs Tron a long time and we are monogamous) but because having liberal ideas about other stuff, I'm understand liberal thought processes.

       You seem narrow-minded. Sex is healthy. Not everyone wants to be in a monogamous relationship. It’s certainly healthier then beating off alone in your room watching porn.

       No I can agree that sex in a relationship feels better both physically and mentally. It IS much more fulfilling in my own experience. But there are people with no interest in being in a relationship so they use casual sex to fulfill those urges. As long as they are practicing safe sex it’s still a healthy activity to engage in. Are you suggesting people who don’t want to put the time and energy into a relationship remain celibate despite their sexual urges?

       No, I said given it’s with another consulting adult. Learn how to read and process information. Stop twisting my argument because yours doesn’t have a leg to stand on. It’s a classic technique but a majority of the people in this subreddit are intelligent enough to see when it’s being done. It won’t serve you and your agenda here.

       If your urge doesn’t knowingly hurt anyone else, then go for it. I’m not going to continue engaging in this sad excuse for a discussion if you keep twisting my words and trying to make it seem like I’m saying something I’m not. Your method of discussion is pathetic and shows how unwilling you are to look outside of your own self righteous point of view. Aka the most important aspect of being a conspiracy theorist.

       Your need to twist an argument into something you can easily disagree with without thinking about what was actually said is the cognitive dissonance. When your ideas are challenged you seem to grasp at whatever straws you can to prove yourself correct, even if it requires making things up. I’d say this is suggestive of a low IQ.

       Yes, based on your method of arguing I’d say that’s a fair assessment. If you think debating is based on twisting your opponents arguments and changing the topic instead of providing intelligent discussion is intelligent, then no one can help you. Have fun living in a world where you are always right.

       I haven't twisted anything you've said. I've just asked for codification on your blanket statement "people can do whatever they want with their bodies", which apparently has all sorts of caveats. Typical.

       “People can do whatever they want with their bodies” doesn’t have any caveats. You’re trying to turn the argument into “people can do whatever they want to their own bodies and other peoples too” to make that argument seem invalid.

       No, I’m not. It is affecting another person. Which as I stated many times, is different then doing something to your own body. You’re the one who brought the morality of flashing someone into this. I don’t carry a bible and I’m not religious in any way. You tell me to keep a bible to myself when you are the one pushing your own morals on to others. A little hypocritical no?

        So you believe casual sex is morally wrong. Do you believe that people should be put in prison for having casual sex? Death penalty? Fined? How do you agree with the limiting of our already limited freedoms?
       </p>

      <p>
       I believe it can be morally wrong if it becomes a lifestyle. No penalty is necessary, the psychological damage and stds are punishment enough.

       And I could ask you; do you think age should be a factor? Is it immoral for someone to have sex with someone under 18

       I think in that situation it depends. If a 19 or 20 year old has sex with an 18 year old? I don’t think that’s immoral.  When you’re that young I don’t think you know enough about the world to make decisions in our own best interest. I would see it as someone taking advantage. Two consenting adults engaging in casual sex? I have no doubt in my mind that that is morally ok. Which is what this debate started as and seems to me to be the only relevant discussion in the terms of the original post you made.

       No, I said given it’s with another consulting adult. Learn how to read and process information. Stop twisting my argument because yours doesn’t have a leg to stand on. It’s a classic technique but a majority of the people in this subreddit are intelligent enough to see when it’s being done. It won’t serve you and your agenda here.

       I never even thought about it in this way. Thanks again for opening up my eyes.  It's kind of similar how the dairy industry pumps the cows full of antibiotics so the cows don't get infections. In return humans will take in what is let over destroying the guy bacteria disrupting the natural flora with in ourselves. What can that cause, it's the same thing your saying. Causing bacteria to become more resistant to antibiotics. Trust your GUT, meaning think for yourself and not buy into what other people are  PREACHING.

       Ha not really. People today are programmed to look at the  biometrics features that are only uploaded on those types of site. And if you read  the description people put on those, they're bull shot because both males and females are so obsessed with looks today that they tend to lie about themselves.

       Meet a person in meat space. It's easy. Walk up to them and start talking. If they think you're cute they will talk back and be sweet to you. If they think you're creepy move on. The stats break down something like thus; three out of ten will go out on a date with you. Two of the three will make out with you. And one of the two will consider a second date.

       Great post. And you can get into the eugenics, dysgenics, and epigenics of it. And how the more partners a person has inhibits their ability to pair-bond and form a strong family, ultimately ceding more power to the State/corporate Beast system...

       I mean just pick a mental illness (Borderline, Depression, Schizophrenia etc) and one of the symptoms is heightened promiscuity.

       I understand that "all elephants are grey, but not all grey animals are elephants" but it's definitely something we should be considering.

       Can't believe this thread is being downvoted. TPTB are encouraging polygamy and promiscuity to divide the masses. They are achieving this through Feminism, which is encouraging women to cheat and "trade up" with partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally, marriage was the form of social control. An institution of the Church, marriage kept men working and providing for women, keeping everyone good little slaves to the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is strength in numbers, and TPTB realized that. They are now working to isolate everyone and destroy the nuclear family.

       Of course they did, but it was highly discouraged.

       My grandmother wanted nothing more than to go to college and become a business woman.  My family was aghast, and instead she was denied a higher education like all others in her town and spent her life raising kids and her husband.  When she finally got a job as a switchboard operator at a telephone company it was quite the scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, it was not a scandal when my mother got a job at a major corporation, so progress was made due to feminism - however she was sexually harassed for years and never made as much as her male counterparts.  Which is
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       going on in the workplace today.

       Ok. So it's really only in certain jobs; those who don't state the pay and where discretion is left to the hiring managers who don't make up their minds until meeting the potential employee that the inequality exists?  I'm just asking because many of the women I know make excellent money and I have yet to ever hear one complain. They are for the majority college educated as am I. I tend to work in areas I enjoy; working for satisfaction rather than money, so ever comparing my pay versus the women I know is not really adequate. So I hear a lot although exclusively via media about the pay inequality for women but have a hard time seeing - so all in all this is why I'm asking.

       Promiscuity has never been cool. For both sexes it just becomes meaningless and empty until you don't even see the human being on the other end. Our ancestors had it right. It's only been in the last 60 years that we've been fed the lies that say its ok and good for us. I've never heard of anyone who has endless one night stands that say it brings something rewarding to their life. (Usually they're so fucked up they go into therapy).

       Monogamous relationships don't exist all over the ancient world. Just much of the northern hemispheres that had long winters. People had to plan ahead in order to ensure their children would survive the winter.

       Definitely.. It devalues the act of sex. They meet their true love and sex is nothing. Not a metaphorical union of two people, not an expression of love, just something 'fun' and indulgent to do in the evening

       This is actually entirely dependent upon the person. More than 50% of people are getting divorced now. Apparently something is wrong. I think monogamy is a thing of the past now. If you want to start a family and have old family traditions, then great go find a spouse and build a life together and invest your time into one another. But some people need diversity when it comes to sex. Monogamy was great for hundreds of years because we needed to reproduce and you need to be with someone long enough to do that. Now we have lives where we can fulfill our own desires and proceed with our own goals. I think there’s a lot of people that just don’t have that degree of attention anymore. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re ill willed or don’t see the other partner as a human being. I believe if both people are safe and use the correct methods and Are making sure they don’t have any diseases, sex can be a great thing to do with other people. But for the most part you’re all retarded and don’t know how to do it safely. Sorry not sorry lol I see people all around getting pregnant and diseases and all I can think about is you guys aren’t careful enough and it gives casual sex a bad name. I just can’t see having sex with the same person for the rest of my life. It just seems entirely selfish from each person to expect that the other will hold the other person’s attention forever.

       it's not so much monagamy being a thing of the past. it's more the fact that the majority of divorce cases favor the wife, majority of child custody cases favor the mother, while many of these cases should have had a different ruling.

       when there is no logical/rational decision-making with the family courts system, what do you think will happen? men will stop getting married. the benefits no longer outweigh the risks.

       I just think when it comes to relationships, people are entirely different. It’s like trying to agree with people about what they think God is. But it’s how they think a relationship is. If you aren’t a part of any religion and you don’t plan on ever having kids, why not have flings once in a while? If you and your partner committed to each other through thick and thin and are safe in picking other like-minded partners,but just like to have a little casual fun, I don’t see how there would be a problem with that. It’s all in trying to find who is compatible with you. Again, if you are in anyway shape or form thinking of starting families or what have you then yes definitely make sure the people you are dating are thinking and sharing the same end goals.

       26 years old and still got my V card, it seems I am repellent to women so I have given up with the idea of casual sex, etc, most woman I talk to don't really have any substance to them, no personality, just a profile on IG/twitter/FB, etc.
      </p>

       I don't mean to take apart your comment, buuuutt....
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many ways to become less repellent to women.  First, try meeting more women with substance, as it sounds like you could be growing bitter and that's
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       a repellent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you're just 26 - I'm in my 40's and these years totally beat out my 20's.  In fact, most friends my age agree and shudder at the thought of their 20's.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are really interested in losing your "v card" - develop some interests, become interesting, engage in those interests and the women will notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not all "hot" guys getting laid out there, I promise you.

       Maybe std's are the earth's way of keeping things in check.. If it thinks people are misunderstanding the reproductive mechanism and 'doing it wrong' then the earth has a way of keeping things in balance.. The earth or 'God' has no conscience, it does not warn or forgive. If you mess up, you pay for it. I agree with the general message in this post. Sex without love is as empty as love without sex

       Antibiotics days are numbered already imo. All the garbage people eat will do more to hurt the population then promiscuity. I think trying to control people and tell them how to live their lives is more of an issue. I think humanities days are numbered to begin with. People might as well do what they can to enjoy their short time here on earth while they can. For the record I’ve never had sex outside of a relationship, but I think people have the right to choose what they do with their own bodies.

       I don’t live it due to any sort of misplaced morality system. It’s just how my life has played out so far. I’m not opposed to casual sex. Morality  is guided by a persons own values and beliefs. It’s subjective. Therefor you can’t label casual sex immoral across the board. You can feel free to find it immoral, but don’t expect everyone else to follow as they have their own values. Such as the right to do whatever they want with their own body.

       You’re twisting my argument because you know you are wrong. I never said that and nothing I said remotely suggests that. This is about casual sex. Now you are turning it into someone knowingly giving someone an std? That’s a completely different argument.

       As I said, as long as it’s with a consenting adult. In this case if they don’t know you have an std and you knowingly infect them then no. How many times do I have to repeat the same thing as you phrase your ridiculous argument differently in unrelated ways?

       Your inability to accept that people have a right to do what they want with their own bodies is what is sad. The world doesn’t revolve around you and what you want. Who said I want to watch the world burn? A little dramatic are we? You seem a little to emotionally invested in this topic and that leads to you seeing it through a narrow lens.

       It’s your right to think and feel however you want yes. I believe I provided good explanations for what is “doing whatever you want” with your own body and why that is fine. In every hypothetical you attempted to turn it into using your body to do something to someone else. Which is a different discussion entirely.

       It certainly is a double standard, if you view intimacy as an "equalist".

       Women
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       no longer penalized for promiscuity and the negative consequences are quite apparent in society today. The focus on materialistic pursuits is demonstrated clearly through the promotion of indiscriminate fornication (for both sexes really but for men less so) and it has turned into an obsession. So you like to suck dick...keep it to yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a day where men were shamed for being too promiscous as well...the solution isn't to forego the shaming for both sexes and stand behind indiscriminate fornication as a healthy and natural thing, it is to have some damn dignity and focus on something else besides hedonistic pleasure.

        the solution isn't to forego the shaming for both sexes and stand behind indiscriminate fornication as a healthy and natural thing, it is to have some damn dignity and focus on something else besides hedonistic pleasure.

       The solution is to keep out of other people's bedrooms.

       And casual sex is natural, all sex was "indiscriminate fornication" in the wild. Not that I believe appealing to nature is a good argument, good things can be unnatural, bad things can be natural.

       No, I’m not. It is affecting another person. Which as I stated many times, is different then doing something to your own body. You’re the one who brought the morality of flashing someone into this. I don’t carry a bible and I’m not religious in any way. You tell me to keep a bible to myself when you are the one pushing your own morals on to others. A little hypocritical no?
