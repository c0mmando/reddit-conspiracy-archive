       Hi. This post's aim is mainly to test your reactions. I have no sincere hope of convincing you, especially since this sub is owned by the enemy (hi, missed me?), but it won't cost me anything to post it, so here goes. Don't bother trying to get anything more from me, i'll go back to my routines and stop caring about this thread the moment i post it.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       So. You're not alone in this universe, and not even on this planet. Apart from Humans and all Earth-born species, at least three other species - that i know of - are here. And you are, indeed, prisoners. But not exactly as most believers have come to expect it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll come back to all of this soon, but first, go read
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/03/09/idaho-shooting-suspects-hypersexual-martian-manifesto-is-a-window-into-an-unraveling-mind/">
        this
       </a>
       if you've never heard about it. Let me sum this up for people who don't want to click, be it because they're lazy, or because it's the Washington Post, or because they're frozen by paranoia: in the first months of 2016, a man named Kyle Odom shot a pastor point-blank several times, including in the head, because he thought that pastor was a mind-controlling alien. He said so in a manifesto sent the same to a local TV/radio station. He was arrested later while trying to sneak into the White House. If you've ever read his manifesto, then you know his mind had snapped. He blabbers about a lot of incoherent, unsubstantiated things and ticks a lot of boxes for standard schizophrenia, with a most likely origin in repressed homosexuality while growing up in a hyper-religious environment (abuse by a religious figure may also be a possibility). But see, he wasn't wrong about everything. Even though, like almost all Humans too smart for their own good, he cracked in the end and his sanity didn't survive, he proved his point, only not the way he intended to. The pastor survived. Go read about the ballistic aspect of the shooting. The ammo used. The number and location of the shots. Go see videos of the victim only a few days later, claiming it was some sort of "miracle". Now tell me honestly: how human do you sincerely think that pastor guy is?
      </p>
      <p>
       And now comes the hard part, especially if you've been turned in recent months/years.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was at least one other thing among KO's claims that was close to accurate. Go have a look at the sketch he made when trying to show what the xenos look like. Now, empty your brain of everything you think you know, of all your opinions, and tell me: does this sketch remind you of something? Let me help you here: a thing you've seen on the internet in recent years. An amphibian-looking character used in memes. Yup, that one. Now tell me: you know it's inspired by a cartoon character, but can you tell me anything rational about
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       it was chosen to represent a movement? Here's the answer, and some of you are not gonna like it: It was chosen for its resemblance with the species piloting this "movement". If you have been using that image and are Human, bad news: you've been used. And laughed at, by things that look exactly as ugly as that character. You've fought fellow Humans for them. You've defended objectively disgusting Humans they retain control of. No, really, keep what i just told you in mind, and look at pictures, videos, tweets, Reddit posts, articles, or whatever from the people you've associated with while taking refuge in the comforting warmth that was handed to you along that frog meme: do you see any honor in them? Any dignity? Any exemplarity? How resistant do you think they would be to some frogface in disguise promising them easily-earned glory?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the three species i know to currently roam this Earth. Another one looks like anorexic skeletons covered in black oil. They're equally toxic and dangerous to Humanity's future. The third one is peaceful and friendly and has scales that end with spikes (and their females are goddesses in bed, but it's a story for another day).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's focus on the hostile ones. They have no nationality. No religion. No ideology. No political side. No "identity". All those concepts are tools, inventions they have used for centuries, millenia, to control you. To keep you divided. I know, it's a hard pill to swallow, so let me take an example. I'll take one in the Christian myths, since a majority of you are of Christian upbringing (others, i'm pretty sure you'll find comparable examples if you perform a reexamination of "sacred" texts with a critical and realistic approach): The Tower of Babel. Yup. Tell me: what kind of benevolent entity would ever tell you that uniting with your fellow Humans and trying to go higher is a bad thing? What kind of "good" entity would ever punish you with the most divisive of all tools ever invented, for that perceived affront to their power? Does their story make more sense, or does mine?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing they believe in is dominance. And you're the target, along with seven billion Earthlings. They have, in the last decades, become progressively more aggressive, because they're afraid. The internet, this formidable tool you've built for yourselves, makes it way harder for anything to remain a secret, for anyone to remain hidden. They are trying to take it from you, to deprive you of, or turn against you, the most powerful weapon you have built to destroy them yet. It is no new behaviour of theirs. Every time you try to unite, they invent a new way for you to be angry at your fellow Human. They make you hate Humans that come in other colors. They lock some of you in inhuman dumps, and make you hate them for the resulting anger and jealousy. A constant invention of reasons for you to hate one another. A constant game of turning pawns against pawns to prevent them from surrounding the kings. They divide you because they fear you. They hide because they fear you. They poison your hearts and minds with hatred to drain you of your Humanity, because they fear it. Because you outnumber them, tens of thousand times over.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       If, by any miracle, i have convinced you, then stop serving them. Stop granting them power. Stop hurting your fellow Earthlings. Stop blindly obeying what is objectively inhuman. And join our efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have no name. No country. No religion. No ideology. No flag. No banner. No symbol. This is the only way they will be defeated: by offering them nothing that they could ever steal and turn against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you decide to join us, then consider yourself one of ours. You will have no confirmation. No support group. No comfort. Only the confidence that you're fighting a worthy battle, silently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some day, we will go after them, crush them and take back this planet of ours they have harmed for far too long. But now is not the time. For now, rest. Rebuild your mind. Cherish it, make it an impregnable fortress. It will be your most precious weapon. Take care of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck, and see you on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;

         Alex Jones is the typical, caricatural, Orwellian, predatory tool they will use against you to drown you with noise. Stop listening to that kind of nonsense.

         The Earth is not flat, but you already know it. This whole thing is just an argumentation exercise used by superior-quality primitive minds on inferior ones.

         There's nothing hidden in Antarctica, except a few Cold War-era backup military strategic underground bases. If you don't want to live on that continent, they don't either. They didn't come to Earth to enjoy another planet's climate.

         Fiction versus reality: Independence Day is utter shite, probably made by an advertiser on coke. Men in Black is closer to the weirdness of it all, but too cartoonish and optimistic re the ratio of vicious "intelligent" species. The "Dreamland" episode of X-Files, although not set in the right place, has some hilariously accurate references. Some writers for the Simpsons/Futurama have probably seen/heard things. Alan Moore knows stuff. The spiral-from-the-ceiling in the last episode of True Detective S1 wasn't there for no reason.

         I know of at least a fourth regular species that visited this planet, long ago. Problem was, it was too kind-hearted, honor-bound and straightforward for the regular brand of scum that was in charge at the time. Their leader wanted to reveal the whole thing to Humans, and was thus stripped of any power in the ruling interspecies conglomerate, sent away after a furious battle, and later painted as some evil creature by the victors. Yep, you've read well. The story you were sold about Satan/Lucifer/whatever is inspired by what happened then, and was rewritten so you associate rebellion with evil, ignorance with bliss, and never question anything. And you fucking fell for it, you impossible fools. That outcast friendly species' regular fellow is, indeed, three-meters high, red, with horns and wings. And i suspect some writer for Elite:Dangerous has heard about them, since their "Guardians" are the closest thing to the real deal i've ever heard of.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the past, i've worked for a fifth species, that some of the others have heard about, a way older one, that they shit themselves knowing they're on their way here. I've been told i was chosen because i was "pure of heart", which is complete bullshit. I suppose i'm just the first one they found that was stubborn enough to not let his mind go down the drain. Anyway. The point is. Don't kill yourselves just yet. Stay around. The show is gonna get fucking intense, and you don't wanna miss it.

       Yes yes, all the water would spin off, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do this experiment:
       <br/>
       1- Get a tennis ball.  This will be your model of earth.
       <br/>
       2- soak the ball in water.  This will simulate oceans, lakes, etc.
       <br/>
       3- Next, we will spin the ball to simulate the Earth's supposed fake rotation, and watch all the water fly off due to centrifugal force.  So, we have to spin the ball at the same speed of the Earth to make a valid comparison.....  so here's how fast we'll spin it:
       <strong>
        <em>
         ONE ROTATION PER 24 HOURS
        </em>
       </strong>
       .  Tell me how much water comes flying off the tennis ball earth, flat-tard.

       no....Since the tennis ball is small, it doesnt have a gravitational force required to keep the amount of water that it absorbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is basically the bending of space---Think of the universe as a flat Trampoline. If Hillary Clinton were a piece of heavy mass it would cause  a U formation on the trampoline. if you are near, its hard to crawl up to the original position of the trampoline...thats how gravity works

       Great.... except I was pointing out that water wouldn't go flying off the earth due to it's rotational speed, as believed by some flat-tards.  Angular momentum creates centrifugal force, not momentum, so the actual speed that the earths surface is rotating around (1,000 mph at the equator) is irrelevant.

       The entire post hinges around one story where one guy believed in aliens and drew an alien frog that kinda looks like Pepe. The rest is gibberish that you might read because if he's willing to cite evidence for one of his claims, the others must have some truth to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it quite often on weird conspiracy sites. Cite something that has some mild truth to it (Supertramp has an album with the twin towers on the cover, right, provide a link) and then whiplash into something like "okay so there's a council of seven alien races controlling our emotions" and not a single external source seen after.

       I was! Always will be! So many will. Look at Scientology. Gotta entertain everything in thought. Just don't have attachments. Don't wanna let your imagination run away.

       Aliens, well. Yeah, it's a big universe. Possible, check.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can travel here, they are waaaaaaay more technologically advanced than us. By centuries at least. Possible, check.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if they've been able to come here for centuries, which there's kind of a lot of evidence about, then why wouldn't they have been here all along?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rationally, it's probable in an infinite universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe an alien race formed the un? It's possible, almost probable, if we are not unique in the universe. But that depends on your beliefs.

      <p>
       Can you imagine what the world would like in an hour if everyone as they are today, suddenly had mind over matter abilities?

       I can't really use personal experience to convince you, but I know ESP and TK are real.  I've seen it.

       Yes, there are many people who would use their power for evil, but they're already doing that anyway, minus the superpowers.  I don't think a psychic awakening will change human nature, but it will force people to see, and force them to wake up and do something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine what would happen is that the government would announce the existence of people with psionic abilities, and say that this "minority" needs to be quarantined to protect the public.  They would announce this knowing full well that everyone has these abilities.  The idea would be that most people would be afraid, and hide their power, not wanting to be the ones rounded up in concentration camps.  I think this will work for a few years, but people will start to figure out the truth, and then there will be anarchy and civil war.

       I think you would have a hard time yes. In fact something like a hero’s journey may be a universal requirement but I obviously don’t know either.
      </p>
      <p>
       For my buck, it’d be a requirement of all, though.

      <p>
       Prove you have good intentions, sound mind, compassionate heart, and very little to zero darkness within and you get the keys.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s an awfully lot at stake if it’s true because look at this world. One bad actor and the whole cosmic order could topple down.

       I'm just a fly on the wall following the conversation but can you elaborate on what "ESP" and "TK" is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its highly confusing when people start to throw around abbreviations like it'd be common knowledge or it could only be the abbreviation of one term. Back in the days we've spelled it out once in the start and used the short hand only afterwards, once we've established what it means.

       ESP stands for Extrasensory Perception, a sixth-sense so to speak. TK in this context might be telekinesis but don't quote me on it.

       You have no family? I don't even like one of my brothers all that much, but he's been there twice when the chips have really been down. I would trust him with my life, and he would trust me the same.

       Yeah, this basically translates to "stop using pepe-memes, be a democrat/neoliberal luciferian like the "elites"". Implying pepe-memes are all nasty and evil, then saying we should like satan/lucifer later on.

       <em>
        read
       </em>
       it
       <em>
        carefully
       </em>
       - between the lines. Sounds like a tryhard luciferian hipster democrat or progressive neoliberal. And the way the OP also highlighted specifically racism and clearly implying they're talking about Glyrmpft -voters or repubs. Same BS you'd hear from THAT circle of Washington DC or San Fransisco.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop using the meme that was super powerful and gave a rise in populism, it's destroying the internet (no it's not, the "elite" is because it worked so well). It's also making u a toxic bigot y'all, yawn. Also you should worship lucifer and god is evil. Trust in aliens but also don't.

       You are wrong. Therev s a hyper-intelligent microscopic alien invasion that started 76 years ago. They are smaller than most bacteria and slightly larger than a typic virus. They travel in ships the size of a mosquito. They have an infinite possibility mechanism that allows it to produce an infinite amount of possibilities in the next dimension outside perpetually space. Their planets are mammalian species. They can only survive inside blood. The mammalian species on their planet was destroyed.

       Here's a spoiler: Demons don't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck off with your simplistic worldview, bad things don't happen because of DEEMOONS. The only ones being deceived are idiots who despite having a lack of any coherent argument or proof still believe the bullshit that they only truly believe because they want to believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you, who seems to jump with dopamine-driven ecstasy when he gets to accuse someone of being possessed by demons, because it helps validate yourself. You, who lack any real analytical ability or willingness to learn and adapt proactively and so you instead choose to put your faith in something childish and easy to fucking follow.

       You seem to be very angry that I have experienced things that you have not. You have a lot of accusations for me based only on your emotional response, while the irony of accusing me of following something childish is lost on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what is easy? Rejecting God. Never been a better time to be an athiest! By all means, go ahead. You know what is hard? Experiencing sleep paralysis your entire life and your parents telling you it's "just bad dreams lol".
      </p>
      <p>
       A "demon" is a negative energy that manifests through weak people. They are the unwanted thoughts in your head, the voices of self hatred and doubt. I don't mean there are little Hillary Clintons running around but there is a non-physical, spiritual battle going on and if you can't see how it is reflected in our physical world, then nobody can make you.

       God. Doesn't. Exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say this as someone who as a child did nothing but fucking believe in it, the thing is, when you look at religion objectively because you actually do care, you end up realising it's bullshit. I believed in demons, in God, in a GREAT BATTLE between good and evil. I'd look up things relating to God and religion online, and then... it all came crashing down when I tried to have it all make sense. Not to mention what happened when I actually took a look into theology and the history of religion, I noticed that historically, people were always telling lies to further their own beliefs, cherry picking information to do so as well, all because they believed it was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does sleep paralysis have to do with FUCKING demons? The fact that when it happens you see shadow people? Hm, if only there was a scientific explanation! Backed up by evidence, evaluation, review, from experts who understand how the brain functions? Guess there isn't, y'know, it can
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       be DEMONS! Just like the old masters of wisdom discovered from God back in the day when they weren't enslaving, raping and murdering...

       I can't wait for you to find a way to deny this. Something with little to no substance or evidence, I assume? Something that is "spiritual", maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unwanted thoughts in your head aren't "negative energies" or "demons", doubt isn't a bad thing. If you reject doubt at every turn all you're doing is deluding yourself, have you ever stopped to actually look at things objectively? I realise that idea is going to go over your head, and that to you,
       <em>
        of course
       </em>
       you think objectively. Do you ever stop and think, "Hm, maybe I should try evaluating whether these doubts have merit, whether I'm wrong, whether I'm right?" No, of course you fucking don't. You don't evaluate shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the fact that you appear to have an incredible lack of understanding of what a LIE is. To you, a lie appears to be something someone tells you to lead you astray, THE GREAT DECEPTION, as you call it, seems to be something that, of course, you're going to be able to avoid. A lie is the same thing as a doubt! Except, it isn't. A lie doesn't come to you, declaring itself a lie. It comes to you as your friend, something that makes you very happy to accept. If you want to find the primary person feeding you bullshit lies, look in a mirror.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Though it's doubtful you'll actually step back and consider this, because, of course, doubts are obviously DEMONIC in nature, demons being "Negative Energy", which in of itself is a retarded term.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I am angry. Angry at someone showing extremely delusional thinking. That does not however mean I type everything in a BLINDING RAGE, as you probably to believe. Emotions aren't simple, "Wow, I'm now feeling: X" or "Oh no, initiating ANGER". It's far more complex than that. You, for instance, probably fail to realise how much you project in your comments. "Never been a better time to be an athiest!" [Tip: Spell "Atheist" Correctly] - You believe that everyone's rejecting your imaginary friend, becoming atheists, the whole of society is working against you, you're part of a very ostracised and oppressed group of people :(
      </p>
      <p>
       You, like many, seem to thrive off of the idea that you're under attack. You haven't come to where you are through reflection and research, you have found a way to validate yourself, by being with those you identify with, your behaviour is predictable, simple, and reeks of the arrogance of SJWs and Trumpites. There are those who want to be correct, and those who want they say to be correct, you are the latter.
