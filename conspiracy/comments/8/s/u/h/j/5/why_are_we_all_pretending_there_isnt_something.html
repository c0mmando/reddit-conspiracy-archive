        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The last few weeks have seen Trump look and sound worse than I&#39;ve ever seen. Mentally and physically, he appears to be in the grip of some kind of collapse, with his handlers and acolytes in the conservative infotainment sphere desperately conspiring to cover it up. </p>

<ul>
<li>His speeches are a mess of tangents, digressions, random claims, and nonsense. It&#39;s worse than ever. Much of the time he simply says words in the hope that they&#39;ll become cogent at some point. That &quot;rally&quot; in Duluth last night was a series of unconnected phrases. He wasn&#39;t even trying to make a point, he was just talking and exhorting cheap applause - for 45 minutes. </li>
<li>He lies over and over and over again, easily verifiable lies that he doesn&#39;t even need to tell. For example, he claims that Congressional Republicans laughed and cheered when he mocked Mark Sanford - yet even people in the meeting claim it didn&#39;t happen, and that he was actually booed. </li>
<li>His story on what exactly he&#39;s trying to accomplish with the push to separate families at the border changes constantly, sometimes by the day. </li>
<li>His behavior at the G7 summit was bizarre and erratic, leaving early, showing up late for sessions, signing a statement then taking his name off it, threatening to send millions of Mexicans to Japan, and apparently even throwing candy at Angela Merkel</li>
<li>His showering of obsequious praise on Kim Jong Un is incredibly troubling, even by the standards of a man who routinely lauds autocrats.</li>
<li>His speech is slow, slurring, and repititous, as if he&#39;s struggling to pronounce words at times.</li>
<li>Physically, he&#39;s a mess. Slumped over, sagging bags under his eyes, hair a mess, suits hanging off him, obvious weight gain</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe some of this is confirmation bias. But I challenge anyone who observes the president to disagree with at least some of this.</p>

<p>Something isn&#39;t right with this man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of times, not that it really matters.  The one people usually talk about is when he bowed to King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at a G-20 meeting in 2009.  A white house aid it wasn&#39;t a bow and it was instead Obama bending over to shake his hand since Obama is taller.  Conservative outlets said he belittled the US and showed respect to Islam.</p>

<p>Some people claim he bowed to the Queen of England at the same G-20 meeting.</p>

<p>He bowed to the Japanese Emperor in 2009, prompting Cheney to say &quot;There is no reason for an American president to bow to anyone. Our friends and allies don&#39;t expect it, and our enemies see it as a sign of weakness&quot;</p>

<p>The rest of the instances some people talk about are not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>But let us not forget the most appalling act of all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=454NAw_rO1Q">Obama bowed to a Robot</a> thus confirming his globalist plan to turn America over to foreign robot overlords.</p>

<p>I already said it’s fine to trash Trump. We can discuss all of his broken promises, the retarded Space Force, whatever. </p>

<p>They’re both despicable puppets. Anyone who can’t realize that is one who still believes the two parties have any significance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He obviously has his flaws and he is in his 70s. But you must remember that he was running against Hillary. She was threatening war with Russia on the campaign trail. Putin even said if she&#39;s elected there will be war, world war. She had her own set of problems and people chose what they believed was the lesser of two evils. For the record I didn&#39;t vote for either of them and I don&#39;t really like everything he&#39;s done. But he&#39;s the president now so I&#39;m going to give him a chance. I&#39;m extremely happy that he&#39;s working on NK and trying to establish a working relationship with Russia. We don&#39;t need enemies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so much more wrong with him than just this list. It&#39;s mindboggling. He&#39;s not fit to run a ham raffle, let alone a country.</p>

<p>And yet millions support him, and a not-insignificant proportion of those think he&#39;s the greatest President ever. The situation is a shocking indictment on American education systems, and on modern American cultural values. It&#39;s worse than tribalism. It&#39;s near-worship of a profoundly stupid, morally bankrupt malignant narcissist. Why on earth would someone willingly exalt such an observably idiotic person? Hell, I could excuse him being slow, except that he&#39;s so malicious and transparently self-serving and seems to have no other redeeming features whatsoever.</p>

<p>And yes, he&#39;s clearly struggling under the burden of a role he&#39;s not equipped to undertake, even though he barely seems to shoulder that burden as it is (eg: not reading briefs, frequent golf, excessive television, constant ego-stroking rallies, endless tweeting of nonsense, lies and propaganda).</p>

<p>Trump seems to me to be among the absolute worst products of privilege and modern capitalist society. Our grandkids are going to be like &quot;WTF, how could this happen?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s true though. The President of the United States of America works harder than both of us combined. You know this already, you just don’t like the guy and will take any chance you can get to make him look bad. It’s okay, I did it when obama was in office legalizing propaganda and blowing up entire families 24/7.</p>

<p>The difference is that Trump isn’t doing shit like that on the daily, he’s reversing those practices. He’s turning the economy around and he’s exposing the criminals at the top that have robbed you and me and our families for generations. Hell, the guy has avoided WW3 on THREE OCCASIONS already.</p>

<p>Sadly pal, you’re the one who is disabled. Your mind is legitimately broken and cannot wrap itself around the plot of this world anymore. That’s okay though, you can thank Obama’s propaganda for causing such damage so effectively. Please look up the Smith-Mundt Act, and remember that the guy who repealed it “coincidentally” ended up dividing this country right down the middle. </p>
