       I am not the only one who has been banned from a subbreddit/subbreddits but I noticed a very uneasy tone now. A tone that has seeped in since the popularity has increased.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning is now something that is used to censor speech. This is not anything new. But I think it may be important for new people experiencing reddit that everything is censored by the mods. Be it for personal reasons, political reasons or racist reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed that there is a wave of anti heterosexual speech going on. Free speech is free speech but not when a person cannot express views that are contradictory.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: I was banned from Star Trek Discovery reddits for expressing my views on the show. Now, I followed the rules. No hate speech. But the people who stood up for the show are allowed to attack and break said rules. No me. Banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banned because I stood up for my viewpoints. The show is no longer star trek. It is a well maid female power sci fi show. This was my point. So I edited the show for the old school star trek fan. So the fans I know would not hate on the show so much. They all stopped watching this new show. Old school fans. After my edits, they liked star trek again. Nope, not good enough. I somehow hate women and the gays.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually know a few gay dudes. Funny as hell. One time met them at a friends party. One of them actually hit on me drunked up. I laughed. His partner came by and shooed him away from me. Smiling. I noticed that there was no longer that fag hate in me. You know, from the 70's kinda thing. It was all cool. I have known them for years. They are happy and that is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything against this new politically correct idealism is met with fire and fury.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example:  Banned from "the last jedi" subreddits. Because I disliked the show and expressed my views. Not with hate, but a wonder why the movie disliked Luke Skywalker so much. Why Star Wars decided to seemingly push this social commentary onto the audience when the older movies already had it going on with the female power thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not good enough. Banned because I somehow hate women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I am banned from the canadian subbreddits for even suggesting that the gasoline attack on the mosque in Alberta could be from a rival mosque.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem the subreddits want to push this hate crime possibility. I agree it was a bad thing. I want the person responsible to be caught and punished.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is also the possibility that it could be from either a rival mosque or a self inflicted thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is direct evidence that the sympathy self inflicted thing for muslim publicity happened. Twice in the news already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that this situation is applicable, but we must not rule it out. It has happened already.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quick google search comes up with pictures of rival mosques attacking each other. One article has a picture of a burnt out mosque entrance after an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is not relevant to them. Not good enough. I am spewing "bullshit". Banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, free speech on reddit? That is a complicated thing. It is not cut and dry.

       I think it is. We live an age now where feelings and emotions matter over logic and discussion. If you don't agree with some people, you're either blocked or banned. It's just the sad truth of it all. You see it here, Youtube, Facebook, MSM. You get censored if they don't like what you say.

       It has been for quite a while. It's not just the politically correct/SJW culture getting a huge power over sites like this. But rather, there has been a huge effort to destroy the level of discussion here on reddit. The site keeps getting more and more populist everyday. It all started with eliminating the ability to see the upvote/downvote rate in order to hide brigades and encourage the echo chamber effect, dumb memes getting too much attention and it only kept getting worse from that point on...

       If you are looking for alternatives,
       <a href="https://saidit.net/">
        check saidit out
       </a>
       in order to create a place that actually promotes decent behaviour. I think we gotta keep the fight over here at the same time in order to draw more users and pressure the PR firms.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to The Last Jedi I actually liked the movie, but yeah I can see why there are people that don't like the change in Luke's character.

       Why does Reddit owe you free speech?  These servers are like Reddit's house.  If you came into my house, I'd be allowed to kick you out for saying or doing things I don't agree with.  Why can't Reddit?

       I've seen numerous sources that say the government is heavily involved with/gives money to Twitter,facebook, reddit /social media in general. I don't buy the "its a private company arguement" there is no way the government isn't involved with these companies. They infiltrated regular news "project mockingbird" why would they not want to control social media? "A much more powerful platform."

       Would you consider anyone who receives a grant to be part of the government?  What about a company that wins a government contract?  Are they now part of the government too?  Does it matter what the contract would be providing?  Is the company that supplies the government with paper clips part of the government?  How about companies that supply IT for the government?  If I work on one of those contracts would I be part of the government also, even though my paycheck comes from a private company?

      <p>
       So, is it just working w/ the government that makes you part of the government?

       Along the same line, your neighbor sees you stealing from another neighbors garage, if they tell the police they saw you take the items (working w/ them), are they now part of the government?

      <p>
       Is any group that has the same goal as the government and works with them now part of the government?

       This is still a privately owned business, they can do what they like.  If they want to work with the government they are free to.  If they don't want to, they are free to not.  Just as you are free to go to Reddit.com, or if you don't like it, you are allowed to not come here.

       So is the government is allowed to tell these "businesses" who/what to feature/censor. Wouldn't that be the government controlling free speech? Wouldn't that be the best way to work around the law that the government can't limit free speech. Just create a "private company" that doesn't have to follow the rules.

       No, they are not, but companies are allowed to have the same opinion as the government.  You seem to think if you act in the same way the government may act or work with them for a common goal, you are automatically part of the government, and that isn't true.  See my "neighbor see's you stealing" argument.

       Obviously there isn't full blown proof otherwise they would be in trouble. But just research how facebook was created I'll give you a hint zuckerberg didn't do it by himself. And if a private company "agrees" with the government one time what's to stop them from "agreeing" with them every time. Especially if the are getting funding. If i were a business id "agree" with the government everytime make sure i get paid. Detonate conflict of interest at the very least.

       Reddit membership is open to everyone and messages posted can be seen by everyone so Reddit might be seen as a public forum, in which case we're entitled to free speech. Legal practice is way behind times on this so websites can pretty much do what they want and there's no shortage of useful idiots defending them

       Ok, back to my house analogy, these servers are Reddit's house since they own/rent the servers and pay for the power to run them.  Even if Reddit changes their house from a residence to a commercial building, they still can kick someone out for saying or doing things they don't agree with, correct?

       That literally just happened in April as

        two black men were arrested in Starbucks for trespassing
       </a>
       . Starbucks policy is to kick out people who don't make a purchase but after a public outcry decided to drop it. All it took is for enough people to challenge the rule and it disappeared.

       If it's challenged enough,
       <strong>
        YES
       </strong>
       it is illegal. Look, the general trend with human rights has been that we've been getting more and more of them as time went on. For example, serfs that gossiped the king would be lashed or quartered but now you're free(r) to talk about anything you like, blacks had to sit at the back of the bus until Rosa Parks etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This expansion of rights is likely to continue and we'll eventually get our Internet Bill of Rights. Until then websites like Reddit and Facebook will continue to exploit the fact there's no clear-cut rule on freedom of speech and just do whatever they want. However, confidently stating that "Reddit doesn't owe you anything LUL" is not true, just delays the inevitable and sounds ignorant. They datamine my presence here and gather private data in exchange for the ability to post, comment and participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is this – why the fuck are you defending this multimillion dollar corporation? What's your agenda? Do you get some kind of a sick ego boost from putting people down or sounding like an authority?

       They're a company with practically infinite funds and lawyers compared to regular users such as you and I (by this I'm presuming you're not some kind of a super AI or something).

       GDPR settled this cleanly by using the residence of the user – if you're in the EU you're covered by GDPR. Things already work like that, if you made a company in Botswana that wanted to sell physical items on the US market it would have to follow US regulations, but there is no such equivalent for digital services
       <em>
        because legislation is too slow

       . Tech companies can do whatever they want because average age of Congressmen is ~62 and they have no clue how digital services work (just listen to the Cambridge Analytica hearing from March).

       It's always weird when people refer to reddit doing something, but it's really just subreddit mods. Unless you're referring to admin actions, they are all independent. The alternative is restricting what mods can do and giving admins more power which I hope no one wants. Spread the word about the subreddit/moderators and create/move to new ones.
      </p>

       This also sounds fishy. Unless you are toxic or an extremely prolific poster, that is a ton of bans to get organically. And there is no collective 'canadian subreddits', there are a bunch of them.

       Go to r-KotakuInAction. Make a comment. You are now automatically banned from at least a dozen subreddits. Go to r-TheDonald. Make a comment. You are now banned from r-TwoXChromosomes, a default sub. Bots already rule Reddit.

       It's because they formed and operated as a free speech site for years. Bait and switch.

        Why does Reddit owe you free speech?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Reddit membership is open to everyone and messages posted can be seen by everyone so Reddit might be seen as a public forum, in which case we're entitled to free speech. Legal practice is way behind times on this so websites can pretty much do what they want and there's no shortage of useful idiots defending them
