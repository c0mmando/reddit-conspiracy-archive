      <p>
       I realize that it can sound like a broken record, constantly harping on about the importance of the new queue and such; however, it cannot be emphasized enough that we all, as a subreddit, must be the change that we want to see in this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, if you would like to see more variety in which topics are being covered on this subreddit, please spend some time in the new queue-
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/new/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/new/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, some even set their browser homepage to the new queue as a way to establish a habit of visiting that queue.
      </p>
      <p>
       All too often, as redditors, we can fall into the trap of only voting from the hot queue. This, in turn, reduces the cogency of content on the subreddit as insipid content, with eye catching headlines, will slowly swallow whole the board as if a conflagration.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the nature of a user curated aggregate is rooted in user voting, and recognizing the endless attacks against this subreddit by outside groups, only through an increase in activity in the new queue can organic users hope to reclaim this space from those factions (on all sides and from every view point) attempting to utilize this space as a battleground.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not in any way to suggest that political conspiracies should be downvoted (as they are obviously quite important in light of current dynamics worldswide), but rather that the soul of this subreddit is truly those who spend time in the new queue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, for those wondering what kind of content hides in the new queue (simply waiting to be discovered) take a look at one of the greatest posts in the history of our community-
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for taking the time to read through these thoughts and see you all in the new queue :).

       r/conspiracy helped to unite multiple dissident factions in an extremely effective push back against the establishment media's narrative. As a consequence, The Black Hole of Fuckery is finally cracking ... and it's full of lying spies.

       More or less every conspiracy theorist can hope to find confirming evidence for his/her/nonbinary conspiracy theory as the tendrils of The Steele Fuckup uproot the establishment.

       I think you guys should sticky a post telling users to browse by new like this once in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, my advice to users over here is not pay that much attention to news unless they are truly conspiracy related. Rather, search for corruption cases involving politicians, corporations or organizations. These aren't conspiracy theories but rather historical/factual conspiracies. These are usually my most upvoted posts.

       A good start would be to recognize that people like this will support you in watching the sub die as long as you're doing all the wrong things or at least not doing the right things.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll pretend like the rot we all see is actually "progress" and that they give a shit about the community beyond ensuring it isn't a platform for people they disagree with to congregate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality the sub is becoming MSMplus where the plus represents a departure from the MSM's policy of pretending like they don't want the US to fail and become "that other European country" complete with lacking free speech and an overbearing nanny state.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know it as well as many Americans do.  They want us to fail.  All the policies and goals are designed to weaken and divide us, any departure from that is punished in the court of media opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are progressives being banned from Twitter and YouTube and deplatformed from speaking events?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are insane people who claim there are 72 genders being mocked by the media or just reasonable people who speak out against blatantly deranged ideas?

       Fair and equal application of the rules would be a start.  Evidently saying someone who told me in a private message that they are IDF that they are IDF is a rules violation but me being called shill 10+ times isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care at all about being called a shill but if the rules is going to be in place it should be applied equally.

       As a test I did report at least 5 of them over the course of multiple days then monitored those comments via a script that checked on them ever 3 hours.

       Not a single one was removed.

       Again, I don't care about being called a shill but I did test out my hypothesis before I said anything.  You can look and see how many people are worried about losing their accounts by saying anything about stuff like this and it should not be that way.

       Yes I can.  However you can't guarantee me protection if I do so the rational think for me to do is not provide the evidence and the rules are setup in such a way that these matters can not be discussed without breaking them.

       Why can't you have an open discussion about this?  Are the accusations of my lying and backpedaling really required?

       Keep in mind that the rules you enforce prohibit me from giving you the information you request.  These very same rules strictly limit my ability to respond to your accusations so what do you expect me to do?

       If amything, we have a few too many mods. Some of them are in varying stages of inactivity, from a few months to more than a year of reddit user activity and a few
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       of mod inactivity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite this, I think the team we have now is something solid to build on someday, but I don't see us needing anything more than temporary help during the America midterm ramp up.

       They were nominated by users and vetted by mods who then voted accordingly.

       One where there isn't a conspiracy and it's just a literal news story that has the intent of pushing an agenda for the posters preferred political party and there's been a good few of them over the last week or two especially. Ofc politics is a big part of most of not all conspiracies but there needs to be a line between the posts that just shill for left/right and the posts that highlight some funky shit going on within a political stage at least thats how I feel about it

       <strong>
        Irony and sarcasm defeat bots
       </strong>
       there was a long post about this somewhere from a guy who programs deep learning algorithms.

       <strong>
        Whatever you do avoid marking it with /s or any indication, better yet, use /s and “jk” in the wrong part

       This place is totally fucked. Even mentioning that this sub is compromised gets your comment/ post deleted regardless of how true or upvoted it is.

       I understand that the political talk gets old, but it could
       <em>
        easily
       </em>
       be argued that there's no such thing as non-political conspiracy. Be the change we want, and if we want paranormal talk, then let's go repopulate the r/paranormal sub and be that change we keep hearing about. Don't try morphing this sub into something other than conspiracy, or I'm going to start smelling a conspiracy.

       Nope. Anove you said you had comments

       The link that is in your screenshot points to an image post.  Rule 12 need not apply.  In that thread, another user told you this (I just linked to it) and you obviously didn't comprehend it then (Because you still don't).

       Exactly. Your BS is called out, again, and it seems all you're here for is to shit on the sub and it's mods and now that you have been confronted on your BS you are trying to walk it back.

       Complaining about getting a mute 5 days ago after innapropriately flagging a post as Rule 12 (instead of just using the report function), after already being told by other users that you are incorrect,  is how you chose to justify throwing shade at the sub and modteam.

       I have no clue what you’re on about (in the sense of queuing on Reddit), yet it’s refreshing to see a group of people waiting for something in an orderly fashion to be referred to as a “queue”, not a “line”. The world does not revolve around the US. Which unfortunately jumps at you when you skim this subreddit.
