       Here’s a few things that stood out to me as odd.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the few videos that have surfaced online of his body in his car slumped over, if you look at his shorts, one video they are red, the next video they are black/gray.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No shattered windows, gunshot wounds, bullet holes, or even blood can be seen in either of the videos.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some say that his face tattoos are missing? The tree in the middle of his eyebrows, the huge clock on the side of his face, also the 17 on the corner of his forehead seems to be missing
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Who and why would this be filmed? Why would someone want to record and zoom in on X’s dead body?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Last year in August X shook his fans by posting a “fake” suicide video where it shows him hanging himself. Many fans thought this was real but it was all a joke.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The alleged shooters killed him ONLY to rob his Louis Vuitton backpack. Why would two people murder someone like X who I’m sure they both knew who it was, over a measly 5 thousand dollar backpack ?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       You take away from this what you want, I’m not saying he’s either dead or alive. Most people are saying he’s dead, but when you take all this into consideration, somethings might not be as clean cut as they seem.

       People are also coming out with supposed videos of X saying he’s not dead and it was just for a music video. But the stuff about Soldier.Kidd is being put together at the same time people are saying he’s alive. Shits confusing as hell.

       Drake used the cadence / flow from one of X’s first break out hit (drake - KMD / X - look at me), the internet saw this as streaming and blew way out of proportion.

       How does that prove anything. Red masks and shit aren't one of a kind. Pretty easy to frame somebody if all it takes is to hide your face with a red mask and everybody immediately points their fingers at someone else.

       Well let’s look at the facts. Soldier.Kid and his friend(s?) were 8min away from the scene, they had guns as proven from their post, and the Black Dodge Journey is also confirmed to be Soldier.Kids or Soldier.JoJo’s. It’s all pretty compelling evidence and everyone on insta in on this shit like dogs right now. I’m guessing shit is gonna go down tomorrow idk though it still isn’t confirmed.

       That is not compelling evidence. That is a lead on who the

        <em>
         POLICE

       should question. I dont give a shit what users on instagram are saying, its not like I want them after me with this lack of evidence if I were innocent.

      <p>
       To me it seems like everybody is so certain of who did it even though the shooter was completely disguised and nobody saw his face.

      <p>
       If this wasnt a setup then they are some really really really dumb criminals. I know it happens but this is especially dumb. There is no way they could have done this and gotten away with it.

       Well like I said, NOTHING is confirmed. Every spec of evidence that people have gathered so far doesn’t mean anything until the culprit(s?) are caught and police confirm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence is undoubtedly suspicious though as the timeframe, the coincidences, and everything else just puts Soldier.Kidd and Soldier.JoJo as the prime suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there is a picture circulating of Soldier.Kidds twitter saying “I think I just popped X” &amp; “I think I’m gonna blow up”. Now if all this is true then it would certainly be weird that he made a video saying he “Didn’t even know who X was” and that he “Wouldn’t do something like that” while the dude literally sweats and shows most signs of lying in his “I didn’t do it” video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again idk if this is all true, but people legitimately know that the dude was 8min away from the scene, and had a gun/guns. But it’s all up for debate still.

       do you have a red mask like that? does anyone you know have a red mask like that? have you ever seen that red mask before yesterday?
Since the answer to all those questions are no, let me introduce a few facts.
That kid was in Deerfield when the shooting happened, that kid was a red mask that's pretty unique, and one of the shooters was described by a witness as a kid with a red mask.

       I definitely feel you, so here's to hoping the police finds more evidence. However, people have wrongly gone to jail for a long time on less evidence than a red mask.  We cant have that.

       No, everything I said WAS factual.
1) That kid was LITERALLY in Deerfield when the shooting happened. as per instagram posts and vids. 2) That red mask is EXTREMELY unique, as the fact that you can purchase one doesn't make it any less so, considering if you say something is common, yet you or people around you dont see it every day, then guess what? It's not common. 3) Witnesses actually said that the suspect was wearing a red mask. 
Explain to me how any of these are guesses.
Do they mean that kid shot X? No, probably not considering the only reason this is a theory to begin with is because he happened to be in the area. But you can't just pretend like all these coincidences dont exist. 
They do, grow a pair and call them coincidences at the very least.

       What I saw as evidence that he did it was pretty weak. Everything could have been somebody setting it up to look like he did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       How convenient it is was you can't get the best look at bodily shape because of a hoodie, can't get a good look at a face because of a mask.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it be dead simple to pin this on somebody when you can hide everything that could be used for actual identification.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far I haven't seen anything that couldn't be quickly thrown together to frame somebody else without much effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure more is going to come out of all this and it probably won't take too long. Many times a dumbshit criminal fucks up wildly and they get themselves caught rather quickly.

       Well, yes I don’t know if it’s all true but the facts like I said were: Soldier.Kid and his goons were like 8min away from the scene, they had guns and they have the escape vehicle that was identified by police.

       So glad to see others have questions about this. It doesn’t add up. Broad daylight murder for a designer backpack? Maybe the robber panicked, they were telling him to get out and he responded wtf is happening instead of getting out but others say they didn’t give him a change to get out and it was a premeditated but they only took the bag to make it look like a Robery.

       The light theory doesn’t hold up if you watch the video.  It is pretty clear that at the very least the tree tattoo isn’t there, the sun is directly on his forehead at one point and at another it is dimmer, still nowhere to be seen.  Not saying he isn’t dead, maybe makeup?  I’m pretty stumped

       Okay. You wanna play with words you have to Google? Let's play.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, your definition straight up says "against one person or one group". Fun fact: bias is not inherantly derogatory. It can mean you prefer one. Which you, and that article, obviously indeed do. White people. Otherwise the inclusion of the word "white" before "child" is useless. I, for one, think hanging any child is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, I came to this thread because I wanted to see if this was another publicity stunt like the one with the child. I grew up through the Biggie/Tupac thing and wanted to see if someone was actually faking it this time. I didn't need a bullshit "news" article written by someone who has probably muttered "damn kids with their loud music and their hippin' and their hoppin'".
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, journalism is supposed to tell you what is happening. It doesn't tell you how to think. It is the watchdog of current events; not "this is what you should think about that". The fact that was the first source you could find, or at least the one you decided to post, speaks volumes. That wasn't a news article. It was a glorified blog post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blog: place where you can say whatever stupid shit you want and pretend you are a journalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you want to open a dictionary when someone calls out your bullshit? You are welcome to. But I'd prefer you take a look in a fucking mirror.

       Try these patterns or variations thereof in your favourite “news” site:

       “X is bad for you, and here’s why”

       Do you even know how big the bag was and how much money you can keep in a bag? If it was a normal size bag pack and he got 100 dollar bills it could have been easily more then that BMW is worth.

        Yep obviously no one involved with the team involved with these death faking videos noticed X change his shorts, mid shoot, in a public place.

        I really do not understand how this would mean he was alive. Shit in my room falls over all of the time for example, none of which to the best of my knowledge has ever been alive.

       I’m really confused why everyone keeps saying he “changed shorts.” There’s a picture someone took of him inside the motorcycle shop wearing a dark red/maroon colored pair of shorts. In one shot the sun is on them which makes them look red. The next the sun isn’t on them which makes them look black and you can barely see his body that low. I feel like that’s all there is to that point.

       In Drakes most recent video release, about 4 days before the shooting, he had the line

      <p>
       "XXX that's the only time I shoot below the neck - that's the way you get you some respect"

       X had previously made some nasty photoshops of Drake or somesuch and called him shit on social media, typical wannabe rapper shit, but Drake is definitely losing street cred by the day during surgical summer, so ...

       People are saying X told pusha t about drakes child which is what pissed drake off.  It’s a reach for sure. It’s also worth noting X was involved with satanism. He even was accused of trying to sacrifice his best friend ski mask the slump god. Maybe he cut ties with his satanist cult and they silenced him.

       Has anyone else pulled up the google earth images of the motorcycle place? I checked them out and compared them to the video, and to me it is weird because where his car was parked is a back entrance to the parking lot (which is usually open) on the opposite side of the dealership. Just seems like a super awkward place to park. And the road it’s linked to is a residential street.

       I just find it odd that he makes a video about his “great death,” and then dies at the entrance of the motorcycle building he was coming out from. What made him stop his car in the first place to get shot? There was no one on the street that saw this before it happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like OP said, no broken glass or bullets on the car, and no blood or wounds on the body. Doors were also unlocked so people could open the door to get him? And no one tried to move the body to give him CPR?
      </p>
      <p>
       No news reports either on what he died from/how he died. No autopsy reports yet. Social media knew he was dead before the NEWS knew he was dead.

       People are also coming out with supposed videos of X saying he’s not dead and it was just for a music video. But the stuff about Soldier.Kidd is being put together at the same time people are saying he’s alive. Shits confusing as hell.

       Well let’s look at the facts. Soldier.Kid and his friend(s?) were 8min away from the scene, they had guns as proven from their post, and the Black Dodge Journey is also confirmed to be Soldier.Kids or Soldier.JoJo’s. It’s all pretty compelling evidence and everyone on insta in on this shit like dogs right now. I’m guessing shit is gonna go down tomorrow idk though it still isn’t confirmed.

       The light theory doesn’t hold up if you watch the video.  It is pretty clear that at the very least the tree tattoo isn’t there, the sun is directly on his forehead at one point and at another it is dimmer, still nowhere to be seen.  Not saying he isn’t dead, maybe makeup?  I’m pretty stumped

       do you have a red mask like that? does anyone you know have a red mask like that? have you ever seen that red mask before yesterday?
Since the answer to all those questions are no, let me introduce a few facts.
That kid was in Deerfield when the shooting happened, that kid was a red mask that's pretty unique, and one of the shooters was described by a witness as a kid with a red mask.

       People are saying X told pusha t about drakes child which is what pissed drake off.  It’s a reach for sure. It’s also worth noting X was involved with satanism. He even was accused of trying to sacrifice his best friend ski mask the slump god. Maybe he cut ties with his satanist cult and they silenced him.
