        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trumps plan to create a Space Force branch within the military is really the beginning of another carefully crafted 9/11 type event. We have always had a Space Force since probably the 60&#39;s yet they chose to announce its existence now because this &quot;Space Force&quot; will be the agency who will disclose the false alien attack to the public. It will be all over the news because it will be the 1st ever government declaration that <em>we are not alone.</em></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>I believe either its to further advance the &quot;there is no God, just aliens&quot; psyop (closely related to the dinosaur psyop). Or to unite the country, diverting attention away from the satanic pedophile elites. Or maybe they will show us a real levitating ship, but I guarantee you it will not be of alien origin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A sneak attack, from some other country. It will be just like Pearl Harbor, where they know what&#39;s coming... and let it happen on purpose.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s where it gets interesting. Why?</p>

<p>Because space is different than the surface of the Earth or even the oceans. Space is infinite and it&#39;s 3D. So if you get to space first and establish a dominant position, it&#39;s the same as being in control of the entire world (above a certain altitude).</p>

<p>Space is the ultimate high ground.</p>

<p>Jokes aside.</p>

<p>You&#39;re probably right, but why an attack from another country... finish off whatever cities/countries you want gone and then have &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; where the &quot;aliens&quot; just drop dead... (cause you engineered them that way :p) then your friendly neighbourhood religion that believes in aliens can step in and be the one true faith (there are two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolob">take</a> your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenu">pick</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is actually John Le Bon and here to promote his videos and website. These comments are supposed to make him look smart so then you pay him $20/mo for his website.

<p>His standard of evidence is he has to see something with his own eyes... but you cannot just show him and old book, or fossil, he literally has to have been there to see the dinosaur walking around.  </p>

<p>So even if you have a radioisotope dating curve that you can extrapolate back to get an estimate of age that is not good enough for him because:</p>

<p>a) atoms dont exist cause he cant see them </p>

<p>b) radiation/ radioactive decay doesn&#39;t exist cause he hasn&#39;t seen it</p>

<p>c) just because it behaves this way now doesn&#39;t mean it worked that way even a second before you starting measuring. </p>

<p>Also if he does not get the science or maths it must be fake... and given his lack of education and maths/ science knowledge that is most things. </p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/bon-earth-model/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Basically the tl;dr is this:</p>

<p>We have senses which can be used to gather and verify empirical evidence. The prevailing cosmology (spinning ball earth) involves dismissing our own senses, and deferring to authority. If we have the gumption to think for ourselves (and not be in the majority), then we will instead trust our own senses. Our senses tell us that that the sky moves as though it were spherical, plane flights only work on a spherical model, and we feel no spin. </p>

<p>Why would you expect to feel it?</p>

<p>There are long sections of Japan’s Shinkansen railway system that are so smooth, the rails so evenly laid, that it’a possible to trick your senses into believing the scenery outside is being projected onto the window.</p>

<p>Until you hit a bump, or a curve. The <em>change in acceleration</em> is what brings you back to reality.</p>

<p>In the conventional spinning ball earth model, <em>the earth’s acceleration is constant</em>, it doesn’t change.</p>

<p>So why would you <em>expect</em> to feel the spin, and more importantly, why would you suggest <em>not feeling it</em> supports a fixed ball Earth model?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes to both.</p>

<p>The key point of the analogy is that although the occupant is certainly moving, he only notices when that motion <em>changes</em>.</p>

<p>If train motion stays calm and consistent, as it often does on the Shinkansen, our occupant could fool his senses into believing he isn’t moving.</p>

<p>I’ve done this myself, it’s a little spooky.</p>

<p>The motion of the spinning ball Earth is <em>perfectly calm and consistent</em>, better than any Shinkansen train could ever achieve.</p>

<p>Although earth’s supposed rotational speed is fast by ground speed standards (several hundreds of miles per hour, depending on latitude), that movement covers a large, smooth radius of curvature (several thousand miles).</p>

<p>This explains why we don’t feel rotation. The <em>rate of change</em> of motion is simply too small to sense.</p>

<p>They are one of the several things:</p>

<p>1) John Le Bon videos, blogs, or podcasts including john le bon... he is John Le Bon, he is here to promote his content. He spams the same content because most of his content is behind a paywall for $20/mo on his website where he bills himself as the world&#39;s leading skeptic. </p>

<p>He does not believe in anything from atoms, to molecules, to evolution, to the moon, the sun, the stars, space, satellites, gravity, dinosaurs, all of history, missiles, all mass casualty events, all wars, etc are all fake... for something to be real he a) has to understand it b) has to see it. Since he is poorly traveled, under educated and arrogant this means he thinks very few things are real. </p>

<p>2) Gustave Le Bon content and John Tyler Gato links. These are his heroes.  He thinks he is some intellectual heir to gustave le bon and John taylor gato and is influencing the minds of people using crowd psychology to wake up people to his genuis sketpicism ... he actually is kind of an antisocial walking example of the dunning krugger effect...</p>

<p>3) Aggressive, vague, condescending comments. Moves goal posts, nitpicks, demands unattainable evidence while providing non himself or presenting some vague random videos as evidence. This is to a) show his genuis so you subscribe to his content b) because he thinks he is influencing you using crowd psychology. </p>

<p>4) Antisemitic,  misogynist, anti-psychiatrist/ medical doctor, aanti-marijuana. These seem personal. He is angry at women who he sees as out to steal men&#39;s money and sees marriage and relationships as ways to control men... against weed for some reason... dislikes jews... and hates psychiatrist... also seems personal. </p>

Doing so exposes his hypocrisy. He has the good sense of questioning evidence, but that&#39;s <em>all he has intellectually</em>, he&#39;s like a one trick pony. He cherry picks information to support his world view and to support his paid website. The thing is some of his ideas are interesting, but he&#39;s so hypocritical, dogmatic, and has such double standards that it&#39;s important to see his comments in context of who he is in terms of on this sub. </p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t aware, he abuses the socratic method of questioning only to disprove others (argument for argument&#39;s sake) and yet usually can&#39;t put forward his own beliefs because he knows he can only link back to his own website, random youtube videos without primary evidence. So he can only argue from ignorance, and use fantasy projection, two major logical fallacies. </p>

<p>The ironic thing is he uses the same tactic and has the same dogmatic binary thinking that the people and institutions he criticizes use as well. He just doesn&#39;t even see it with his blinders. It&#39;s a shame because he could add to many topics if he wasn&#39;t so conditioned. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m onboard with you up until the &quot;why&quot;</p>

<p>The why is that there is a need for a national crisis to justify martial law. At first thought, I did not see this happening until there is a reduction in the number of firearms available (to the public) within the United States. But, if time is running out, and people are not yet begging to turn in their weapons in light of the pace of mass shootings, it could happen sooner than later. </p>

<p>My assumption was that an ebola outbreak within the United States was going to be the trigger for martial law, but a perceived alien attack would serve just as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general public currently owns over half a billion legal guns. I dint think that is really a goood basis to go off of personally. </p>

<p>And martial law is hard to establish in this country. Even during the civil war it was deemed unconstitutional. As long as we have civilian courts that can function they cant really do it.</p>

<p>Plus inhonestly dont think theres many servicemembers that would participate knowing the types of people I served with combined with a stronger sense of individuality in the military blind obedience to orders is no longer a thing. Soldiers bitch and moan about anything you tell them to do. Its why I got out. Why my dad retired. And why my brother is getting out. Since about 2008 theres been a shift in the quality of new soldiers coming out if basic. </p>

<p>So based on those experiences I cant see martial law working. </p>

Once people think we are protected then the shock of knowing we aren&#39;t alone won&#39;t be so bad.

People failed and freaked out thinking the world was going to end. So we were deemed not worthy of the info.  Now people will feel protected and the reaction will be less of a shock. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tl;dr (I believe this is accurate but still look it up on your own) On the Galápagos Islands, a very secluded string of islands, over the course of years Darwin was able to observe first hand the shift in population of birds of the same species; specifically that over time the majority of their beaks seemingly changed shape. This was because the birds with a random mutation for a specific beak shape were able to obtain the food they needed to survive, so anything without that mutation was less able to eat, and didn&#39;t have as high of a survival rate, diminishing the populations gene pool of the genes for their beak.

When he returned in 1837 he gave the bird specimens to John Gould a ornithologist noted that all the finches captured where of different species but very closely related. The finch which at one point in time had migrated from the south american mainland to the galapagos and thanks to the isolation of said islands and the slightly different biome of each galapago island the finch through survival of the fittest evolve to adapt better to the different diets available. The original mainlander finch being a ground dwelling seed eating finch turned into <a href="http://cmuems.com/2014a/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Darwins-Finches.gif">14 different species</a> of which 3 would stay ground welling seed eaters, 3 would live in cactuses and eat seeds, one tree dwelling and eat seeds and 7 would become tree dwelling and insect eaters</p>

<p>Do you actually <em>believe</em> that a god living in the skies (which is already ridiculous since we no longer need religion to know what&#39;s above the sky lmao) wrote a mythological <em>book</em> containing talking snakes, creation of the universe in 7 days, talking donkeys, apocalypses, people turning water into wine lmao, people being born of virgens or walking above water lmao by putting thoughts and dreams into this dimension on people&#39;s head? LMAO </p>

<p>But let&#39;s discontruct your comment and see religius minds work:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religion is a man made construct, the bible doesnt speak on religion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the bible was miraculously written in magical rocks? Yeah, makes sense - for a religious person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man made religion not god. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmmm, but incredibly <em>all</em> gods are made of people&#39;s beliefs. Zeus, Osiris, Allah, jesus, yahweh. All bullshit. You and I are both atheists, I&#39;m just atheist towards <em>one god</em> more than you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man corrupted religion dont confuse the two</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So man is more powerful than god&#39;s powers? Or god just doesn&#39;t give a fuck? Or the ol&#39; grand uncle LUCIFER YOUR LORD AND FATHER beat god but god will beat him in the end but not really but yes really so it doesn&#39;t matter? Hahahahah</p>

<p>Haha please try to answer my comment from before, it&#39;d be funny since you haven&#39;t actually read because it defies your beliefs with logic and you know that no logic in the world will back up the belief in the absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again with the fearmongering? I <em>might</em> see him when I die? hah, and you might see the Spaguetti God when <em>you</em> die lmao. Look forward to waste your whole life for a mythological god because he <em>might</em> fucking judge you when you die. Even tho he (in your mythological fantasy) created you and your mind in the first place, and he already knows exactly what will happen in your whole life he still thinks he&#39;s in position to judge you. What a moron god to believe in. And if you disagree with him he&#39;ll send you to hell to burn, cry, suffer, be tortured and live in hell for all eternity....... but he <em>loves</em> you. L.O.L</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;ll just be a good person on my own. I don&#39;t need a mythological book full of magical beings and fantasy to tell me how to be a good human being. And by the way, a book full of rape, death, genocide and gods telling people to kill others and their own children doesn&#39;t seem like a very good book for morality LOL.</p>

<p>Just loose your religious pride and leave religion for fantasy. You don&#39;t need a priest to tell you you&#39;ve been a good boy. You don&#39;t need to fear a god to not steal. You don&#39;t need to believe in miracles, jesus, unicorns and all this bullshit to have what to live for. Just be good, be logical and leave the bullshit behind you.</p>

<p>Move on.</p>

Men get put out of work for weeks or even months when this happens. Then paleontologists begin work on the site. Also, the whole thing is based on the premise that we suddenly happen to start finding them only after the initial discovery in the 1800s. People who buy into this think &quot;well why didn&#39;t we find them before then!?&quot; It&#39;s simply because we didn&#39;t know to even look for them before. Obviously if you know what you&#39;re looking for you have a much higher chance of finding it than finding something you&#39;re not looking for.</p>

<p>Well someone is way ahead of you.</p>

<p>The similarities and mirror imaging of Trump and Reagan are way too coincidental.  </p>

<p>Famous person<br/>
Considered an outsider as far as government is concerned (although Reagan was a senator first)<br/>
Charisma<br/>
Dismissed as a serious candiate<br/>
Witty speaker (Trump has his moments)<br/>
Pro business, military and nationalistic<br/>
Removed regulations<br/>
Practiced trickle down economics<br/>
Want to build space weapons<br/>
Make America Great Again slogan<br/>
They are the oldest presidents ever elected at the time of their presidency<br/>
Reagan was the first divorced president, Trump the first thrice divorced president<br/>
Had strong Evangelical support<br/>
Had a combination of tax cuts and an increase in defense spending which leads to high deficits<br/>
Use to be Democrats<br/>
Talked directly to the people  </p>

<p>Differences:<br/>
Trump: Wants to build a wall<br/>
Reagan: Tore a wall down  </p>

<p>Trump: Starting a trade war<br/>
Reagan: Spoke negatively about trade wars  </p>

<p>Trump: Pro Russia and helping them build themselves up<br/>
Reagan: Against Russia and caused their collapse  </p>

<p>Trump: No filter, no class, acts like a child<br/>
Reagan: Very respectful and courteous, acts like a responsible adult </p>

<p>From wikipedia:</p>

<p>&quot; A <strong>fossil</strong> is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_age">geological age</a>. &quot;</p>

<p>You are saying all fossils are man-made hoaxes? Any traces of a once-living thing from a past geological age is a man-made hoax? So you are saying you dont believe in life existing more than, say, 50 000 years ago? Or do you not believe in geological ages because you deem the Earth is 6000 years old?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>archeology is almost completely controlled field </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, no shit, Graham Hancock is correct, ancient human civilization is real and archaeology is a controlled field, but what on the planet earth does that have to do with fossils? Fossils are millions and billions of years old, there are no fossils from human civilizations, as that&#39;s not a past geological age. Fossils are relevant to biology and evolutionary history, not human history :S  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are so many proven fakes that it would not be hard to argue maybe all are. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are saying any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological_age">geological age</a> are fakes, and basing that on there being &quot;so many proven fakes&quot;, without providing a single example. I&#39;ll say no more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just answer one of my questions please: how old do you believe the earth is? 6000 years? </p>

<p>This is what your link says btw:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The two principal abiogenic petroleum hypotheses, proposing that all petroleum is abiogenic, the deep gas hypothesis[further explanation needed] of Thomas Gold and the deep abiotic petroleum hypothesis,[further explanation needed] have been scientifically reviewed and largely rejected.[1][2][why?]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier studies of mantle-derived rocks from many places have shown that hydrocarbons from the mantle region can be found widely around the globe. However, the content of such hydrocarbons in such rocks are extremely low and seem to lack accumulation in concentrations that would render them feasible for exploitation.[3] Scientific consensus on the origin of oil and gas is that all natural oil and gas deposits on Earth are fossil fuels and are, therefore, biogenic. Globally significant amounts of abiotic oil in the crust can even be ruled out.[</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely disagree with you. Think of the scale things would need to be done at to fake an alien attack. You would have to globally fuck with radio/tv signals, have some kind of space ships, worry about technical failures somewhere along the line, factor in the reaction of people (shooting at the things), figure out the actual aliens, and a bunch of other shit. Then you need to convince your own countries armed forces who aren&#39;t all in on it that they need to fight back etc etc. This would have to be orchestrated world-fucking-wide. </p>

<p>Now, i&#39;m not saying the above is not all possible to do - but if you wanted to impose martial law or some shit a fake virus pandemic would be MUCH easier to pull off and require far less people.</p>

The reason she&#39;s still in such good health at an advanced age is that she benefits directly from the dark science they are doing. Hell there&#39;s even a rumor that her breast implants are made of ivory. Anyone who gets too close to discovering what dirty Dolly is up to gets a foot cut off as a warning (which is why lone feet sometimes wash ashore in different places).

I especially distrust religious people. We have repeatedly seen that power you speak of used for unthinkable crimes throughout history. Being a skeptic has always been demoralizing at some level, especially for people that have high expectations of their fellow men, those in power and institutions that WE fund. I learned at a young age to curb my expectations and, although that does not prevent disillusionment, it does help a great deal in bouncing back to normality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be cautious of what one calls an &quot;evident truth&quot;. Personally I do think the Earth is round and dinosaurs existed, but saying anything is an &quot;evident truth&quot; without thorough research and truly looking at all sides of an argument is a wonderful conversation stopper and destroys any ability and possibility of critical thought.</p>

<p>I would encourage everyone to be mindful of what they think are &quot;evident truths&quot;. Some things seem evident from a very mainstream perspective, but when you dig deeper, they are not evidently true whatsoever.</p>

<p>There are plenty of examples for this - an obvious &quot;conspiratorial&quot; one would be 9/11 and how most people think it&#39;s &quot;evident&quot; that it was Al Qaeda that piloted those planes into the towers (or so at least it seemed back then, nowadays I&#39;d say that the mainstream opinion has shifted and the official 9/11 narrative doesn&#39;t really fall in the &quot;evident truth&quot; category for almost a majority of people).</p>

<p>There is a lot more, including theories related to historical events, such as who and how various megaliths and structures throughout our history (including the pyramids for example) were built...etc. many evident truths become very fragile when they are put under the magnifying glass and a lot of seemingly good science is shown to have very flimsy foundations.</p>

<p>I think this modern behaviour of doubting everything is good. The only problem is that you can get lost in the process and sometimes ignore truly overwhelming evidence for something because you go too far (I&#39;d place flat Earth into that category, no offence to anyone who believes the Earth is flat). But that&#39;s just my opinion, some would say everything should be doubted and examined...some don&#39;t even believe &quot;outer space&quot; exists, because they have not been there themselves. I am not in that camp, but certainly it is an interesting perspective to have...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been making posts to Facebook pointing out that this new rash of UFO stories allegedly leaking from military sources is all a set-up for some kind of air disaster being caused by Anomalous Aerial Vehicles operating in our airspace. Now, once the disaster occurs, we can have our &quot;space force&quot; spring into action I guess? Maybe the &quot;space force&quot; shoots down one of the AAVs and retrieves the craft and we&#39;re supposed to cheer and root against the aliens? The only thing that makes me doubt that this will happen is the fact that I&#39;ve been publicly predicting it.</p>

<p>&quot;guns can&#39;t protect us against this one particular threat, so you should turn them in even though they still protect you against other threats.&quot; how does that make any sense? and why would the government even need more guns if, as you said, they are useless against alien threats? do you think people would feel safer by handing over the most effective personal defense tool currently available to the masses? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what&#39;s actually happening is that <em>a Space Force already exists</em>, and this announcement of a newly formed space division (as well as its subsequent funding) is in essence a disclosure to the public of it&#39;s existence or at least some type of partial disclosure to desensitize people to the idea.  It is in effect legitimizing something that is more of a shadow figure currently, but has been a functional part of reality for decades.  </p>

<p>My real hope is that it&#39;s part of a larger disclosure that we have already made contact with intelligent life outside of Earth.  </p>
