<p>I was skeptical at first until I started looking at these accounts posting about &quot;anti vaxxers&quot;. </p>

<p>These accounts in no way seem organic. <a href="/u/lfuculokinase">/u/lfuculokinase</a> posted something on <a href="/r/quityourbullshit">/r/quityourbullshit</a> today, which reached the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. Take a look at that users account and you&#39;ll see that all they ever do is post pro vaccination posts ALL THE TIME. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll notice this trend with other accounts posting similar pro vaccination.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes open. Always question everything. Be skeptical. This site has been overrun by corporate interests and shills pushing narratives. </p>

<p>Everyone carries on about science, but you should know both ‘the Lancet’ and ‘NE Journal of medicine’ have come out lamenting the degree of fraud in Pharma studies, about 50%.

<p>I kind of think of population control as a whole bunch of differing systems at work in order to cull a population.  Not one thing or process that you could point and link an obvious group to, but a wide range that takes its toll off the top.  </p>

<p>One of those might be that roulette type lottery system of children being affected or in the case of the colored community, targeted.</p>

<p>&quot;While antibiotic resistance is a well-known issue in health care, antiviral resistance is rarely mentioned as an issue of concern. One of the main reasons for this discrepancy is that viral vaccines have been very successful.
However, there are several infections for which antiviral resistance is becoming a serious problem. These include both infections for which a vaccine is available (e.g., influenza) and infections that do not have licensed vaccines (e.g., HIV). Although combining several antivirals has been shown to be a useful treatment strategy, arguably, efficacious vaccines would be an even more effective way to combat drug resistance.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, that&#39;s not how vaccines work.</p>

<p>to put it very simply, vaccines stimulate the immune system into being able to fight viruses and bacteria it encounters later on by giving it an &#39;example&#39; to learn how to fight against.</p>

<p>antibiotics and antivirals are just broad-spectrum drugs used to directly attack an existing infection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You either don’t understand anything you’re typing, or you didn’t actually read the article. The article is a great read. It’s about possible ways to develop vaccines in the future that are more cost-effective so we won’t rely on antivirals alone in case of resistance. Let me break it down for you. </p>

<p>“One of the main reasons for discrepancy is that vaccines have been very successful.” 
In other words, some don’t find a reason to start testing other types of vaccines when the ones we currently have are doing so well.</p>

<p>“However, there are several infections for which antiviral resistance is becoming a serious problem. These include both infections for which a vaccine is available (e.g., influenza) and infections that do not have licensed vaccines (e.g., HIV).” 
The writers argue that finding new vaccination methods is important because viruses can develop resistance against some antivirals, such as amantadine for influenza or Epivir/ Emtriva for HIV. What they are saying is that even though HIV isn’t a “death sentence” anymore, its important to not forget about possible vaccine prophylaxes when antiviral resistance is a possibility. Influenza also needs a better vaccine in case of a major pandemic since current antivirals aren’t very effective. The efficacy of the current four-strain vaccines vary by year and strain, so finding a universal flu vaccine is the best option.  </p>

<p>“Although combining several antivirals has been shown to be a useful treatment strategy, arguably, efficacious vaccines would be an even more effective way to combat drug resistance.&quot;
I don’t think I can state it any clearer than this. HIV has HAART, but prevention would be best. </p>

<p>These diseases were already on their way out when vaccines were introduced. Look at Measles on the graph specifically. Our bodies know how to adapt. Those who don&#39;t adapt... well we are overpopulated anywho.  </p>

<p>Overpopulation will slowly decrease the standard of living for EVERYBODY until it is unbearable. We can already see this happening. We need to either cooperate to create technological advancements that solve the resource issues we have today, or just wait for the culling of the herd. Truth hurts</p>

<p>We are keeping people (who arent even enjoying thier life) on life support just because they fear death. We need to remind ourselves that there is consciousness after death. It becomes so obvious after a certain point. Just die and go get recycled haha enjoy a new form. Energy is never destroyed only transformed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It only seems like a brigade because antivaxxers are in the minority. Pushing this agenda that had helped so many people for generations because donations told you they think it causes autism. I&#39;ve po pretty given up trying to even fight you guys because nothing will change your mind and now just try to educate people around me about the importance of vaccinating. Dogs are a great example.. Have you ever seen a puppy suffer through parvo? Do you know what parvo is? Did you know vaccinating against it is now the law and because of that countless puppies don&#39;t have to suffer and in all probability die? Not getting vaccinated is like playing Russian roulette for intense suffering. People like yourself that spread misinformation are unintentionally spreading possible suffering and death. You are unapologetic and without care to others around you. I despise people like you for doing your small part in making this planet a more miserable place for many people. It truly is shameful. </p>
