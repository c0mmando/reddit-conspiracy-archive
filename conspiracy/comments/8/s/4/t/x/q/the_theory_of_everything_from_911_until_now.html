        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>9/11 was an inside job? (Leave thread if you disagree). </p>

<p>The reasoning behind 9/11 was to reset US financial institutions and debts to a &quot;maintainable level&quot;, due to our losing position of first world status. </p>

<p>Saudi, &amp; israel / egyptian intelligence contractors worked in unison with the cia to entrap Osama Bin Laden, Coercing him to &quot;create&quot; the event which was heavily assisted (unbeknowst to OBL) By US, and 5 Eye intelligence committes; (Primarily the CIA / Pentagon). </p>

<p>Following the attacks, a &quot;Trade was made&quot;, to Plant A MB (AKA: muslim brotherhood operative) (aka: Former President: BO)
into executive power of the united states; </p>

<p><em>This was a condition of international parties, participating / assisting in the illegal debt resetting of US bankrupcy</em> Which hoped to &quot;compete&quot; with outside nations, like China, Russia, and Syria / Lybia- (petro dollar vs Green back). </p>

<p>Since 9/11 the NSA has created Bitcoin as a &quot;One world currency&quot;, to limit financial impacts; as well as sending Black OP&#39;s, Funding; Which will reduce &quot;financial records (aka papertrails) to future operations; But it is far more complex then that-</p>

<p>Wikileaks, is factually a CIA / 5 eyes Front, and Gate keeper tasked with containing known information leaks; Designed to Limit the Release of sensitive information; So that PR and Media (cia) operatives can maintain &quot;Spin&quot; on &quot;damaging leaks&quot; much like the HRC Emails, which was an &#39;unplanned event&#39; in terms of &quot;continuity of government&quot;. </p>

<p>Groups Like:
Anonymous
ISIS
BLM
Not My President
Womens March
Students Rights
Etc (feel free to list them) </p>

<p>All follow a basic framework of CIA intervention and cosmetic makeup. Hence HD Public manipulation videos; Public Manipulation and participation requests; Which are heavily advertised by military intelligence groups, to regurgitate the information and assimiate it to the average citizens;</p>

<p>This is why Youtube (egyptian / middleeastern intelligence operators) Fail (at every level) to &quot;redact&quot; known parties engaging in the destruction of US property, and interests. 
(Ergo: ISIS video&#39;s, approved; Yet, Conspiracy theory is A NONO)-</p>

<p>This is because the government uses these groups to push international &quot;black-ops&quot;. To destabilize and re-build Hostile nations governments; In hopes to establish control over the regions)-</p>

<p>Bitcoin is just a &quot;digital-Coupon&quot; being used to &quot;reward&quot; unknown parties, as they accelerate &quot;technological innovation&quot; (unbeknowst to them). </p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>Why is Bitcoin so Hard to mine?
Why does it get so much harder to mine?
What are the &#39;puzzles&#39; We are solving?</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a hash system which uses confrimation codes-
Coin 123 moves from user 222 to user 333&#39;s wallet- This produces a hashcode 123222333-  (in a completed transaction). However these &quot;codes&quot; are maintained by &quot;blocks&quot;- Meaning that once saved and archived the blocks can be utilized by intelligence / technology sectors as items (such as): Rainbow tables, And INFINITY TABLES?</p>

<p>What is an infinity table?
Much like a known Rainbow table, there are 95 Keys active which can produce x amount of combinations used in password cracking. </p>

<p>A unique rainbow table in example using numbers 1-10 would look like:000001,000002,000003, Etc until: 999999</p>

<p>However Hashes are in addition to the alphabet so now it looks like 
a111 A111 Etc. </p>

<p>If you have an infinity table:
What is an infinity table? 
Have you ever heard of Infinite Monkey Paradox. 
Where a group of monkey given an infinite amount of typewriters, and an infinite amount of time; Will almost undoubtebly re-write the entire works of shakesphere- Flawlessly, because there are only so many &quot;combinations&quot; and patterns / frequencies within the data to Produce said &quot;final product&quot;. </p>

<p>Why is this important:</p>

<p>Bitcoins biggest competitor is VISA. Visa uses visa-net to utilize their entire networks transaction history effectively within 2 main information centers / propertys-</p>

<p>SO we are lead to believe that &quot;bitcoin&quot; is a &quot;Superior&quot; technology; While it uses billions of &quot;miners&quot; which make 1,000,000,000 calculations per /s To process &quot;an encryption&quot;, solving: puzzels; 
All to produce a &quot;payment ledger&quot;, for a (current) 30 million (estimate) users globally-</p>

<p>Well, that would be fair and all, accept the average 1080 processor can already handle that many calculations per hour- So Why do we need to &quot;sell&quot; the entirety of Every single high Value Gaming Processor, and GPU on the planet; (literally rising global temps). Just to &quot;beat visa&quot;? (does that make sense)&gt;&gt;&gt;????</p>

<p>That the (better then visa system that the technocrats are supporting) users the entirety of international computers; All working within a &quot;bitcoin-botnet&quot;, so that we can officiate Jimmys, 3.00 pizza order)? </p>

<p>How much better can Bitcoin be then visa. (two skyscrapers jammed up with memory / servers), When Bitcoin uses: 100,000,000,000,000 High speed processors (in tandem) calculating a googleplex of data (every second) just to Compete?</p>

<p>And Satoshi?!? Ya sure; If any user here attempted to create a &quot;1 world currency capable of ending the &quot;banks&quot;- Well, lol. Talk about gitmo status- (no wonder he&#39;s not &#39;active&#39;) lmao- Dude never existed as a &#39;single person at all&#39;, and the only cryptographers / group capable of even designing and maintaining such a complex operation are: You guessed it! (alphabet soup agencys)-</p>

<p>So what is being encrypted (the puzzles) which miners solve. </p>

<p>If I had to guess, is that they are processing Deep space / satellite data, provided by TESS, and other Planet spotting satellites;</p>

<p>The argument I have for this:
Basically you take a single image which has over 10,000 galaxies (deep field as an example) that need to be individually processed (all 10,000 galaxies) to study their cosmetic makeup (100 billion star&#39;s per galaxy), to find planets (potentially 8 average towards host star), as well as noting their hosts stars color / spectrum, gravitational pull, distance from earth, distances from intergalaxy objects; Etc-</p>

<p>Essentially it becomes: millions, and billions of data points that no given super computer can solve (within years), making the entirety of global processing power a Surreal &quot;NEED&quot; in order to &quot;begin&quot; mapping the cosmos-</p>

<p>It took a super computer years to essentially calculate a single CME strike, and model it- So How are we reviewing all the trillions of data points, within the thousands of operating planet / hunters (satellites data); Without the assistance of something similar to the ambiguity, of the Bitcoin Botnet-</p>

<p>A botnet is just a group of computers that are linked together to maximize processing power thereby reducing the Time, that it takes to solve a given task- </p>

<p>Blockchain is nothing more then a botnet- Bitcoin is nothing more then a financial credit that users get for &quot;solving a puzzle&quot;, and the reason that the coding is encrypted, is so your dumb asses wont find out about what you are creating.... I.E. The infinity table. </p>

<p>If you had an infinity table, every answer to every question ever asked would be available to you instantaneously-</p>

<p>If a single Memory bank could host the infinity table, computing speeds would be faster then light- (instantaneous). </p>

<p>We could then design computer programs (using AI) assistance to redesign themselves better without even needing a human operator...</p>

<p>These computers would be able to guage all existing elements on the periodic table, all known processors in operation, and all known human / achievements; Producing more and more capable systems; (blueprints) over, and over, and over; Until items like: PI and timetravel are no longer outside humanities reach-</p>

<p>We are training super AI; all with the knowledge that an infinity table can provide-</p>

<p>This is exactly why bitcoin is peaking to the heights it has, and why companies like ibm, and samsung are redesigning ASIC&#39;s chips to produce even better results; for global distribution to improve the very complexity of what the bitcoin blockchain really is. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is nothing more then the entirety of the technocrats giving their AI full control of world data in hopes to find: solutions to the largest paradoxes that man has approached since the chicken vs the egg paradox-</p>

<p>Bitcoin speeds up the application of:
Time travel, Black holes, wormholes, space travel, PI, Mapping the universe, programming computers, programming cpu chips, </p>

<p>In fact there are so many potential applications of additional sectors I can&#39;t list them, because it literally is INFINITE-</p>

<p>There are infinite applicaitons, that can stem from an Infinity table; </p>

<p>Imagine a single computer chip, which can host the entire knowledge of the internet; So that a &quot;connection&quot; is no longer needed to access it. This one single chip containing the entirety of googles knowledge and it being offline, and in your hand-</p>

<p>I think this is where the entirety of first world governments are heading, and they now acknowledge the threats that 3rd world non technological and savage citizens, have against their plans. </p>

<p>This is the reason that Gold backed currency&#39;s threaten the united states- Not due to the FAKE finances involved; But due to the knowledge that will be gained when the entirety of the infinity table is accessible to these nations-</p>

<p>The financial reset, and all the drama of what happened is completely inferior as to the direction we are taking now as a species to transcend to a new level of enlightment via digital innovation-</p>

<p>So what do you think?
Is satoshi just some unknown dude hiding who gave us a &quot;gift&quot;, and dissappeared. (having never been penalized for what you would have been)- While this FAR more costly and expansive system is the Better solution to a system like VISA-</p>

<p>I bet your motors running now-</p>

<p>I am also tired of thinking infinity but keep trying to understand implications </p>

<p>99 percent can not handle these infinite fields even tho Turing and godel both affirmed them as limitations and now we are implementing against time itself with near infinite tables which are inevitably fractal</p>

<p>My best hunch is we can not break thru with digital but will require some analog system such as the universe itself indexed to the infinity field such that we have a 1 : 1 correspondence between entities and the field position that describes it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are a rainbow table.  More specifically, all of the attempts at mining each block make up a <em>very incomplete</em> rainbow table.  But, as far as we know, that data isn&#39;t stored anywhere.  In fact, we can assume that it <em>isn&#39;t</em> stored anywhere simply because storing that data would slow down miners and disadvantage them.  So they aren&#39;t likely to do that.</p>

<p>But even if it were stored somewhere, it would be fairly useless, not only because each block hash is contrived, but also because the energy alone required <strong>just to read</strong> such an enormous rainbow table renders it pointless.  And, at the end of the day, it&#39;s just a rainbow table for SHA256, not &quot;every answer to every question ever asked&quot;.</p>

<p>I really suggest you look into how Bitcoin works, specifically the difficulty and how the block hash is calculated and how that determines when a valid block is found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well: President Obama and his administration continue to support the global Islamist militant group known the Muslim Brotherhood .

    <div class="md"><p>It means that if initially you disagree as a whole, then you are free to disengage the topic at your leisure. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t meant to create an echo chamber. It is more so a disclaimer stating, this is a conspiracy forum; So feel free to comment on the material, adding your own positions, or touching base on new topics. (Relevant to the threads contents). </p>

<p>Some people do not believe that 9.11 is an inside job by example. They are welcome to comment, and disagree. I just am proposing to them that there may be a large amount of users (in this thread), that do feel the material Is helpful. So users working against the grain, may find (in the end) it to be a waste of their time / or efforts. </p>

<p>I do see your position. I just hope that others that engage the ideas, will take them as candid, (and not so literal) :)</p>
