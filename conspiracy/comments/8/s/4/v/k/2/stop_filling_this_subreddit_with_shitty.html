<p>There are multiple photographs that show injuries Onfroy purportedly inflicted on the woman. More than one shows the two in a tender pose together, with her nose allegedly bruised from an earlier head-butting. Another shows the woman with her left eye reddened and the skin around both eyes all hues of purple. Prosecutors have taken sworn statements from several witnesses, among them the alleged victim, in preparation for a trial.</p>

Putting her in the bathtub and threatening to kill her in it. I read true crime fairly often, but that all just got right under my skin. Sure, it’s awful someone died and all. But.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. We are in total agreement. Why would him, or anyone else for that matter, stop and think “man, this isn’t right. I’m so close to killing my pregnant girlfriend every day. I need to change!” When <em>fucking Kanye</em> is praising him and he’s got Louie bags full of cash despite it all. Sadly, that scenario isn’t exclusive to him. Actors and musicians alike beat their girlfriends/wives, apologize for it, and still get work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you think all the Bourdain posts last week were meant as a distraction as well? XXX just got shot TODAY. Its fresh in peoples minds. When you have famous people die who psychologically resonated with their fans, these fans are naturally going to be curious. You can only read the same TMZ article about the murder so many times. People naturally want more information. People want to explore theories from a critical angle and bounce ideas off eachother and get feedback, and consider things from different angles that they never considered and examine evidence others find that they werent aware of. This, in my opinion is what makes the sub great. People are coming here because they know people in this sub will think critically and not just regurgitate the same story over and over. Stop being such a conspiracy snob. Theres no need to be elitist about it. This helps the sub grow. Its really a complement to the sub. </p>

<p>And distract us from what exactly? Its not like there is a limit on posts. You can post as much as you want about whatever you want. Distract us from the guy who posts the same stupid plum Island Lyme disease theory every 2 days? Distract us from discussion about crop circles and aliens? </p>

<p>This is probably my favorite sub at the moment, but there is a lot of crap posted here. Not all of the posts have a lot of substance. Whats great about this sub is you have a lot of critical thinkers. But you stll have groupthink and herd mentality on any sub, but at least people are coscious of it here and attempt to resist and limit it.</p>

<p>You shouldnt be elitist and say we shouldnt allow certain conspiracies to be discussed. The #1 post a couple days ago was a post about outlawing CBD, when it turned out the part of the bill that was supposed to ban it was immediately retracted, no conspiracy at all, but it still continued to get mass upvotes.</p>

<p>If thats a conspiracy then a popular controversial rapper getting murdered certainly has the elements of conspiracy in it as well.</p>

<p>Its not a purposeful distraction. Its genuinely curious fans coming to this sub for answers they feel they wont get anywhere else.</p>

<p>Let them come. If people want to discuss conspiracies of any sort whether they have ever posted here or not, we should welcome that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SMS is Short Message Service aka Text Message. Triple X is also another  way of saying adult content aka nudes/porn etc. &quot;Shoot below the neck&quot;.  Shoot as in photo shoot. Things models &amp; promotional shit do. Below  the neck as in, not showing your face when you send nudes. So basically  that whole line is him sending nudes to a chick but doesn&#39;t want his  face to be shown.﻿ </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because there were so many &quot;untimely deaths&quot; or &quot;celebrity suicides&quot; in recent years that have made significant waves in the conspiracy community as having actually been assassinations that the idea of false deaths and suicides has spread into public consciousness; first with Seth Rich, then with Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell, and now with Anthony Bourdain.</p>

<p>If at least one of those speculated assassinations was truly not what they claim on the news, then the person or entity that organised the hit would want to muddy the waters before this new force of internet sleuths with too much time on their hands finds your actual fingerprints.</p>

<p>The easiest way to muddy the waters about this is to use every single untimely death, real suicide, or real overdose – especially of controversial figures – and seed the idea that it too could have been an assassination, based on weak enough evidence. If this was indeed the strategy, then we should see at least two or three more celebrity deaths soon that enter the public imagination as &quot;being fishy&quot; without properly explaining how or why.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not sure about this case, or Bourdain&#39;s for that matter. I haven&#39;t had enough time to look into it properly yet, but I do sense a kind of overreaction to some of those deaths that only serves to undermine the truly suspicious ones, and it feels like an inorganic push. But that may or may not be so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is honestly such a hypocritical post. It&#39;s nauseating.</p>

<p><em>You</em> don&#39;t believe anything conspiracy-related happened, but in reality, these XXX posts have just as much validity (if not, more than) as any other conspiracy on here... Who cares if its not some intense global conspiracy?? </p>

<p>Maybe it was a small group of people, maybe the media got it wrong, maybe just an unfortunate event. No one really knows at this point, and this is a place where people come for answers. Gatekeeping it for conspiracies that you&#39;ve deemed &quot;important&quot; or &quot;more plausible&quot; is just selfish.</p>

<p>This isnt your sub. It belongs to the collective community, and if this is what people want answers to then thats more than ok. You think it&#39;s a stupid conspiracy then comment why in the thread and move on. </p>

<p>And look, you&#39;re now accusing new and curious members of the community of a coordinated effort to block out <em>your conspiracies</em> - that is a much bigger problem to me because I see no such evidence of the case. You&#39;re discrediting their questions to make yours seem more important. </p>

<p>You can be annoyed by it all you want, but the moment you accused others malicious intent is the moment you crossed the line. </p>

<p>Seriously, take a step back and look at how ignorant you&#39;re being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s easy to come to that conclusion, don’t get me wrong, this is a conspiracy sub after all. And yes, there will always be trolls in every community. But keep this in mind:</p>

<p>People are hurt and confused by his death, especially his younger fans. They want answers, and like many people in here, assume the worst. Every new tragedy brings in a new of emotional people looking for answers, most have absolutely no idea how this community works - they are searching for any alternative explanation to the tragedy they are facing. </p>

<p>Pointing fingers and discrediting these “conspiracies of emotion” just further divides this community into ‘casual’ and ‘hardcore’. The more casual theories are typically the ones that draw outsiders in and open up their minds to this way of thinking. It’s an overall benefit to this community to let them ask the questions they need answers to. Who knows, they might even start reading I to some of the more impactful theories. </p>

<p>Kicking them out before they even have a chance to participate in the community is t good for anyone involved. It just serves to preserve the echo chambers that have developed a foothold in here. We need fresh people and ideas if we ever hope to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>He was shot in his car. They have footage of him being dead. These people making these theories are saying somehow he changed his pants and is alive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t think this happens for every unsolved tragedy in the news then you&#39;re either new here or have confirmation bias. It happened yesterday. These threads will slowly die down over the course of a week as people slowly accept whatever conclusion they come to. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just part of the process in my opinion - no reason to interpret it as an outside threat. For the most part, these people are just curious and searching for truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they&#39;re not. In my opinion, they&#39;re shills attempting to use this as a distraction. I&#39;ve never seen on this subreddit, this level of effort to plug the same lame conspiracy that is literally suggesting he&#39;s alive when there is TMZ footage of him dead in his car. Instead of letting people mourn him and accept that he has died, they&#39;re bringing up this whack theory that has no footing in a sub of people that do not even know him.</p>
