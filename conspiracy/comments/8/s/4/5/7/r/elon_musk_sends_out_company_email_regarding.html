<p>This is going to be interesting. I have to find it in my comments, but I had suggested the strong possibility of a fire happening to cause Tesla more problems.</p>

<p>Also of interest to me is the &quot;sensitive data&quot; that was stolen. In regards to that...I point you to a post I made not too long ago. </p>

<p>This is a great conspiracy discussion as it possibly involves many players.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, like I said, the list of possible players in this is quite large. The employee says they did it because they didn&#39;t get a promotion...that doesn&#39;t explain the highly sensitive data that was stolen and delivered to unknown third parties tho...</p>

<p>Yes, there&#39;s monetary incentive...but still, there are obviously third &quot;parties&quot; as in plural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re doing the calculation for how much Bitcoin could be mined by powering Antminer S4 ASICS with Tesla car batteries. Which is quite worthless, since you can&#39;t hook up every Tesla in the world to an Antminer S4 using a remote code exploit.</p>

<p>In fact, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much reason to look at it from a power storage perspective at all. You can probably assume that a compromised Tesla would be able to mine crypto 100% of the time it&#39;s not in use for driving, since its processor demands such a tiny fraction of its overall battery capacity.</p>

<p>What you should really be calculating is how much Bitcoin a Tesla&#39;s main CPU - an nVidia Tegra 3 SoC - can mine. (Which is a calculation I don&#39;t care to do myself since relevant information on it doesn&#39;t seem to be easily available.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You weren&#39;t kidding about the lack of documentation of the Tegra 3 with Bitcoin mining. Presumably because the cost of electricity is larger than the revenue from mining by a few orders of magnitude. Of course, that only matters if you&#39;re acquiring your own specific hardware and paying your own electrical bill.</p>

<p>The only thing I found was a Samsung experiment where they took a group of 40 Galaxy S5&#39;s and had them mine Bitcoin. The 40 phones were getting about 2500 kHash/hr in 2014. Today, that would be a joke, only $0.0003 per year. Tesla is expected to produce their 200,000th car this year. $0.0003 * 200,000 = $60. Add on a few orders of magnitude (probably realistic given the advancements made between the Galaxy S5 and the modern Tesla chip) and a you get $600 or $6000. Add on four orders of magnitude (a 10,000x more efficient BTC miner) and you get $600,000. It&#39;s hard to make this seem viable.</p>

<p>Also I have a feeling Musk is going to claim the Auto Pilot Software was sabotaged and thats the reason why Auto Pilot killed several people by steering them into a wall.  </p>

<p>This would make that pesky NTSB investigation go away and shield them from all civil suits filed by pissed of Tesla owners and wrongful deaths suits filed by the family of the deceased.</p>

He doesn&#39;t believe in literally anything and calls himself the world&#39;s leading skeptic... he does not believe in anything from atoms, to molecules, to evolution, to the moon, the sun, the stars, space, satellites, gravity, dinosaurs, all of history, missiles, all mass casualty events, all wars, etc are all fake...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the reason he stole it was that mysterious.  He knows that data is valuable to the right people, and being a disgruntled employee he took it with plans to sell it or secure a job with it elsewhere.</p>

<p>The recipients would be interesting because it could be a high level corporate/government espionage thing or something boring like he sent it to a few people he trusted as a backup and had yet to decide what to actually do with the data.  </p>

Its how the ex Nazi&#39;s made so much money.. they stole all the patents in Europe.

<p>Could be a case of corporate espionage. Otherwise why would someone steal data or sabotage code? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could also be &quot;rogue engineer&quot;  seeking revenge by sabotaging Teslas Auto Pilot software. This conviently allows Tesla to blame the sabetour for the numerous deaths and crashes that occourred while the AP was driving. It also saves them a shitload of money from the inevitable civil suits filed by family of the deceased.</p>

<p>Of course that&#39;s just a crazy theory I have with no eveidence to back it up. I got a weird gut feeling he&#39;s going to say it was the AP software that was sabotaged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s precisely things like this that has made him enemies. If Elon would learn to keep his mouth shut, he wouldn&#39;t have half his problems. I don&#39;t know exactly what it is, but he rubs me the wrong way. Maybe it&#39;s because he forced the founders out 8 years ago and his ego know no bounds.</p>

<p>I think he has bit off more than he can chew, and his mouth is his undoing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is the interresting bit. </p>

<p>From a purely industry (IT) perspective.... </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I get wind that one of my 500 code contributers did something bad in the code. </p>

<p>I go, okay, the commits of this person get reset, we patch them over, we get back to the latest working version, while the people responsible for that sort of thing audit every line of code the guy wrote. I mean, fuck it, in an open source program, you cabn get volunteers to help you out. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what a version controll system is for. Shit, even your github can do this. All it takes is manpower to fix that. </p>

<p>However, think of this from a conspiracy angle. we have evidence of a couple of fires. that&#39;s the ONLY other thing that happened. </p>

<p>Would it be much of a stretch to suspect that if someone ENGINEERED those fires, instead of a state controlled federal bumblefuck investigation, you go, okay, this was industry espionage, chill, we got this? You present a patsee, he goes, ok, I admitted it.... </p>

<p>because the idea that this is extremely bad? nope. Sad, but this is industry standard. Nothing to write home about. </p>

<p>You got the feds from taking too close of a look at your code, you got publicity, you get to print up that you are now making this many teslas....</p>

<p>Qui bono? Tesla. </p>

<p>Honi soit qui mal y pense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>see, I don&#39;t mind this. I just like seeing that people go over the accepted fact. </p>

<p>And if 99 people don&#39;t see a thing wrong with it, maybe the 100&#39;st sees something wrong, because he has personal experience. </p>

<p>With me, I just fibnd it curious how this was phrased. you want to know? I maintain a few projects at work. If we found out that someone had injected code that made batteries go boom, I would promise you that I could within 4 days there would be an update that would roll back the dangerous code, to a pre-state that was not dangerous but still workable (let&#39;s say a few minor features are broken, but ok), and within a week, we would be up on going through all his committs, line by line, and making sure he has not injected something nefarious. And I say It straight out. My company is at best mid level, and the projects we are making are not small. if our code fails, maybe a few people have to stay longer, but that&#39;s it. I mean, our code is basically unimportant, big, and we can do 4 days, and all that happens when our code fails is &quot;oh... well, I guess we will have to do it by hand. &quot;</p>

<p>If you have a product where the battery can explode, the reasonable assumption would be to have a team which is well paid and has nothing else to do then jump in when shit goes down like this, and read code. Just to make sure there are not other surprises hidden. </p>

<p>With a dedicated specialised team, I cvould guarantee you even larger commit sets are not a problem. </p>

<p>If you now see how musk takes this..... it gives me a wrinkle. </p>

<p>I mean, just from the german perspective, if you say, sorry, industrial espionage, first thing is, you call it cyberterrorism, then you get aid from the people. Bump the minimum punishment for the fecker who broke the code up to a couple of years in prison, and you are good to go, cybersecurity unit looks good, yoiu look good, professional. If you are going internal, it is usually done to keep other people from looking at your code.</p>

<p>With one strange exception. </p>

<p>The project is open source. meaning everyone could have taken a look at the code. </p>

<p>Mind you, what I would have expected, is find the person who agreed to the contributer, slap him with conspiracy to commit terrorism , get the boys in blue to confiscate all his equipment, throw him in jail untill be breaks down and names names, and then go after the people. because the issue is, if the code don&#39;t work, it&#39;s sabotage. If the code don&#39;t work and it causes batteries to explode, it&#39;s terrorism. And of course you would be more then willing to work with the feds to ensure even the computers and internal files of the people who paidf him are checked , because if you can slap like general electric with a charge of cyberterrorism.... </p>

<p>IF you play it down..... it don&#39;t fit the picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up poor. I‚Äôve worked a lot of jobs. Never for a union. They were fine. I think unions were great options when businesses were letting employees die and we didn‚Äôt have the other mediums of recourse like we have today.</p>

<p>Some of us are union workers but we‚Äôre all customers and when I‚Äôm around union workers I have to treat them like children and worry about their emotions and  get on their good side to get anything done. When someone does their basic job I‚Äôm so grateful like it‚Äôs a miracle because it basically is. Why don‚Äôt we make the entire world like the DMV so we can all be miserable all the time except when we‚Äôre working and can act entitled and make others miserable. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm a progressive at heart, but the nature of experiments in progress like business and academics is mostly idealistic failures that need to be learned from and losses minimized</p>

<p>The problem is incentives and freedom. I believe people should be free to organize unions, and businesses and customers free to move to more competitive markets which they are doing. The experiment achieved huge success in making the world safer for workers. Just like trains and horses made the world much faster, but I‚Äôm still not going to ride a horse because it once served a purpose </p>

<p>there are many employees that are a great fit for their jobs and out work others, universally coworkers will hate them for making them look bad and will tell them to chill out. The best thing about free markets is it gives the hard working people an excuse to work even when all the lazy people around them want to hold them back. When you stifle people‚Äôs incentives you will breed the wrong culture and reward the lazy and punish the prolific. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I‚Äôm not saying that companies don‚Äôt use unethical business practices but they usually suffer for it. Walmart lost a lot of business, including mine, thanks to that. I know HEB (a Texas grocery chain) exploded in the wake of Walmart cutting quality. It also allowed WholeFoods to build an organic/natural goods market which Walmart could have afforded to compete with and beat them out of it had not gambled everything on bulk low prices which they aggressively negotiate for (no actually they demand for their business). This has caused them to close many super stores and move to neighborhood markets which have give or take 10 employees. Literally the market in action.</p>

<p>HAHAHA</p>

<p>And ‚Äúlargest middle class in the world‚Äù is a useless metric if you can‚Äôt afford quality education, healthcare or rent on it.</p>

<p>And don‚Äôt even start about quality of goods. Go to a Dutch supermarket once and you‚Äôll be embarrassed of what passes as ‚Äúfood‚Äù in the US. Not to mention quality regulations are significantly lower in the US.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre clearly wearing propaganda tinted glasses so let‚Äôs just leave this because you‚Äôre not even bothering to use facts.

    <div class="md"><p>I never said we don‚Äôt need government regulations. The only thing we need to do is update the Fair Labor Standards act of 1938. Minimum wage should be increased to a livable standard but I think it should be parallel to property values. This has been universally done in states like California but that hurts the rural Californians business competitiveness because with lower rent and prices on goods, they have the same standard of living as others who may make more but pay more to maintain said standard of living. When it is raised to reflect  the NYC standard of living it hurts small towns which may get paid less but keep more and spend less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow fuck this. I&#39;m not like a huge fan of Musk like some are but I do appreciate some of what he&#39;s been doing to try to help bring us into the future. I really like how big of an impact he and Tesla have had on renewable energy and making it more accessible and efficient. With that being said, I seriously hope nobody with a more sinister agenda than simple payback or crypto mining has compromised and damaged the company, it would be a terrible shame.</p>

<p>They are an automated manufacturing company. They are gearing up to be the Amazon of manufacturing where they can make anything at a lower cost at a higher quality than anyone else on the planet within 10-20 years. A lot of people are threatened by this. They want Tesla to go bankrupt. Thing is, it won‚Äôt.

<p>The efficiency curve is being improved on constantly, which, considering the fact that they are all leading edge technology makes it pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Not only are they constantly inventing new methods of doing things, they are inventing things they need to do it...inventing more reliable and efficient manufacturing methods and like I said...accurately assessing the scale needed to operate at the levels being anticipated.</p>

<p>And it is exactly a Ponzi scheme. Investors your money into it with no chance of the company ever making a profit. People buy cars years in advance and the money is long spent, and then new investors pay for that car to made long after the fact. Money is constantly losing value, so what you paid years ago is now worth a lot more than the price of the car that you paid for. It&#39;s 100% a Ponzi scheme, but instead of the cash payouts being paid for by the new investors, it&#39;s the car that is worth considerably less than it was sold for years ago that is paid for by the new investors.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really kind of odd to announce that an investigation is taking place to see if he acted alone. This would simply give a heads up to anyone else involved to cover their tracks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you know of, see or suspect anything suspicious, please send a note to [email address removed for privacy] with as much info as possible. This can be done in your name, which will be kept confidential, or completely anonymously.</p>

<p>How is email, especially using your own account, anonymous? You would set up an ombudsman type system that allowed truly anonymous reporting. Which they probably already have like most corporations have to report corruption. Nearly every government contractor has to have a system like that in place.</p>

<p>Just a bizarre email. I am not positing any theory about it. Just pointing out the oddity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up poor. I‚Äôve worked a lot of jobs. Never for a union. They were fine. I think unions were great options when businesses were letting employees die and we didn‚Äôt have the other mediums of recourse like we have today.</p>

<p>Some of us are union workers but we‚Äôre all customers and when I‚Äôm around union workers I have to treat them like children and worry about their emotions and  get on their good side to get anything done. When someone does their basic job I‚Äôm so grateful like it‚Äôs a miracle because it basically is. Why don‚Äôt we make the entire world like the DMV so we can all be miserable all the time except when we‚Äôre working and can act entitled and make others miserable. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm a progressive at heart, but the nature of experiments in progress like business and academics is mostly idealistic failures that need to be learned from and losses minimized</p>

<p>The problem is incentives and freedom. I believe people should be free to organize unions, and businesses and customers free to move to more competitive markets which they are doing. The experiment achieved huge success in making the world safer for workers. Just like trains and horses made the world much faster, but I‚Äôm still not going to ride a horse because it once served a purpose </p>

<p>there are many employees that are a great fit for their jobs and out work others, universally coworkers will hate them for making them look bad and will tell them to chill out. The best thing about free markets is it gives the hard working people an excuse to work even when all the lazy people around them want to hold them back. When you stifle people‚Äôs incentives you will breed the wrong culture and reward the lazy and punish the prolific. </p>

<p>Why even include the motivation and point out that they were right to not be promoted? If they had the access that high they could stay on and sell information. Unless the job was industrial sabotage.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, just struck me weird, &quot;to everyone.&quot; Then a little comment about how he was smart not to promote or pay them. Arguable.</p>

In fact, Spain is more attractive than the Netherlands to American companies.

    <div class="md"><p>see, I don&#39;t mind this. I just like seeing that people go over the accepted fact. </p>

<p>And if 99 people don&#39;t see a thing wrong with it, maybe the 100&#39;st sees something wrong, because he has personal experience. </p>

<p>With me, I just fibnd it curious how this was phrased. you want to know? I maintain a few projects at work. If we found out that someone had injected code that made batteries go boom, I would promise you that I could within 4 days there would be an update that would roll back the dangerous code, to a pre-state that was not dangerous but still workable (let&#39;s say a few minor features are broken, but ok), and within a week, we would be up on going through all his committs, line by line, and making sure he has not injected something nefarious. And I say It straight out. My company is at best mid level, and the projects we are making are not small. if our code fails, maybe a few people have to stay longer, but that&#39;s it. I mean, our code is basically unimportant, big, and we can do 4 days, and all that happens when our code fails is &quot;oh... well, I guess we will have to do it by hand. &quot;</p>

<p>If you have a product where the battery can explode, the reasonable assumption would be to have a team which is well paid and has nothing else to do then jump in when shit goes down like this, and read code. Just to make sure there are not other surprises hidden. </p>

<p>With a dedicated specialised team, I cvould guarantee you even larger commit sets are not a problem. </p>

<p>If you now see how musk takes this..... it gives me a wrinkle. </p>

<p>I mean, just from the german perspective, if you say, sorry, industrial espionage, first thing is, you call it cyberterrorism, then you get aid from the people. Bump the minimum punishment for the fecker who broke the code up to a couple of years in prison, and you are good to go, cybersecurity unit looks good, yoiu look good, professional. If you are going internal, it is usually done to keep other people from looking at your code.</p>

<p>With one strange exception. </p>

<p>The project is open source. meaning everyone could have taken a look at the code. </p>

<p>Mind you, what I would have expected, is find the person who agreed to the contributer, slap him with conspiracy to commit terrorism , get the boys in blue to confiscate all his equipment, throw him in jail untill be breaks down and names names, and then go after the people. because the issue is, if the code don&#39;t work, it&#39;s sabotage. If the code don&#39;t work and it causes batteries to explode, it&#39;s terrorism. And of course you would be more then willing to work with the feds to ensure even the computers and internal files of the people who paidf him are checked , because if you can slap like general electric with a charge of cyberterrorism.... </p>

<p>IF you play it down..... it don&#39;t fit the picture. </p>
