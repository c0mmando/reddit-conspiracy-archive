       I agree! I think the reason why the gov paid media is letting this out, to cause a fight between the left and right, to distract us from the test. The gov in watching our reaction to this. And if this doesn't make us go crazy, it could be our kids next!

       AND the kids are being housed at a former Walmart, which there were all kinds of conspiracy theories about over the last few years....tunnels being built between them, FEMA operating underground, etc

       Where is the outrage among the folks who supposedly care the most about exposing pizzagare and pedo rings, and all of that?  Why is it fucking radio silence?

       It’s appaling and just demonstrates further that few if any of those people actually give a single fuck about kids being abused and mistreated. It’s ALL part of their partisan agenda. Fuck them and their thourough hypocrisy

       Many of the "pizzagaters" expressed the same outrage about Tucson. Remember Tucson and how it was swiftly dismissed as fake news even though it involved coyotes bringing children through camps where they presumably had to sleep outside? Right, that was all just fake news. And that's before even examining the evidence about it being a rape camp. You believe stories because you are being told to.
      </p>
      <p>
       What made that event different from what's happening in McAllen? Well, for one John McCain and Mayor Rothschild were being accused, and since Media Matters et al are funded by the big R, you got all claims conveniently debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       And @swampsparrow, to address your spurious claims, "pizzagaters" aren't simply wholesale pedophile investigators, many of them are solely following the allegations made in DC. Some are human trafficking researchers but the fact you're implying that it's a political stance says more about how you view this issue than anything. @swampsparrow, where were you three fucking days ago when you had no idea about this issue? right, probably talking about some other media narrative you were given permission to talk about.

       Guys. Listen, I legit think this might actually be true. I know its supposed to just be a conspiacy but... it makes a lot of sense. I think they just thought since everyone would think "No way this can be happening, it would be too obvious" they went ahead and did it.

       Did he really sign an executive order? Damn I saw he was considering it. I thought he'd make congress push a bill through. I hoped he'd use this as a bargaining chip for chain migration which is the real killer issue for our country. Turns immigration into a virus model.

       Even in your logic what we are doing is illogical. Why keep the biggest financial burden, the children, while sending would be workers back to Mexico?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, we should be sending the whole family back if we are drawing some legal hard line.

       That's a lie.  75+&amp;#37; of Mexican and Central American families are on welfare according to government statistics.  They never will be anything but a burden on white people.

       in its heyday. People here were really worried about children, I guess that's changed. It's amazing how little traction this story gets here. The linked comment has better details than anything I've ever seen from Pizzagate.

       This post has been making the rounds on other subs. Thought i might see it here eventually.

       Be on the lookout for disinfo in the media stream. The conversation becomes about pizza instead of the fundamental problem of young children being needlessly taken from their parents and what should be our immediate goal, which is reuniting these families.
