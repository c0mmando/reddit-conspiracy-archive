<p>I&#39;m not understanding this. It&#39;s like this recent turn of events is being astroturfed on here in favor of the UN. I&#39;m scratching my head. </p>

<p>What has happened to this sub? What ever happened to the UN and Lucis Trust talks among so many other things? UN is not the good guys so how is us backing out of one thing bad? We should back out of the whole thing and kick them out of our country. It&#39;s headquartered in New York.  </p>

<p>I look forward to your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. It&#39;s a farce so why are people so pissed about us leaving? The whole of the UN is a farce and Africa could tell you that and how many UN authorities abused the poor there. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a wretched cancerous tentacle of the new world order but some how this is bad? How and why? Because Trump did it? The astroturfing that he did for Israel is also blatant to smear him. 
People can be so blind. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not conflicting with you just kind of ranting and speaking my mind and speaking in generalities. </p>

<p>One of the first things he did was cancel the TPP. He’s threatened to leave NATO if everyone doesn’t start paying their share. He quit the Paris Climate Agreement. He wants to cancel NAFTA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question to everyone who bashed every move he makes - do you really think he’s doing all this without a plan, or any basis for why he’s doing it? Like, do people actually think he’s actively trying to make the United States worse? What would be the benefit of that? Just because he’s shaking things up that absolutely need to be shaken up? He’s not just doing things willy nilly. He has teams of very smart people guiding his decisions.  Meanwhile, we’re cruising along economically. Pushing numbers that have never before been seen. If we had this economy under Obama, it would be the lead story on the news every single day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think he&#39;s doing almost everything he does with no plan more than:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Glorify himself</li>
<li>Play up to his base</li>
<li>Remove any options to stop his authoritarian tendencies</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the far more relevant question over all is why this sub doesn&#39;t spend a LOT more time worried about him than it does. Just like I continue to be surprised about how this sub never seems to talk about who these &#39;very smart people&#39; are--since many of them are worthy of conspiracy theories on their own.  </p>

<p>So I guess we&#39;re all confused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, he left his life as a 70 year old NYC billionaire to become President (for free, mind you). Trump was universally beloved before politics. Now he’s the most hated man in the world. Why would someone do this? He had to have known his policies would be divisive. The answer is that it HAS to be done in order to cut out the malignant pieces of our corrupt government. If Hillary had been elected it would just be more of the same. It takes someone who is not a politician to fix this mess we are in. What has Trump done that is bad for America? He doesn’t cow-tow to the other leaders of the world? Good! He shouldn’t! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He quit the Paris Accord but hasn&#39;t mentioned any ways to help the correct the problem. I&#39;m not thrilled he backed out of the Iran deal. But I agree with cancelling the TPP so that&#39;s cool. The Paris accord and the Iran deal were both bad deals, but to not come up with anything better, or even mention trying to do something better is reckless.</p>
