        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-20 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/kleenex_wipes.html">kleenex_wipes</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is a stretch but it’s interesting to say the least. So as most of us know XXX was recently murdered in Deerfield Beach, Florida while leaving a motorcycle shop, he was 20. There are two suspects in this murder, both were seen in hoodies, the shooter wearing a red mask. The shooters fled afterwards in a dark SUV.  Most people think it was a robbery since the shooters stole XXX’s Louis Vuitton bag, but it wouldn’t be that surprising if it was a premeditated murder.  </p>

<p>Okay so here is the conspiracy part. There is this Florida rapper named Soldier Kidd (@soldier.kidd on Instagram). If you look at Soldier Kidd’s Instagram (which I highly suggest you do), you can see there is a ton of “XXX” in his photo captions, as well as in his Instagram bio. This is also apparent in his close friends Instagrams as well. Another thing we can obviously see on Soldier Kidd’s Instagram is a red mask which he has clearly shown in a photo with one of his friends, his friend is making an X with both arms. Soldier Kidd went public and denied any allegations in the crime that took place and gave his condolences to XXX’s family. </p>

<p>So this brings us to Drake who is very well known around the world. Drake and XXX had a very exclusive feud for one another the beginning of this year. The feud stems from Drake “stealing” XXX’s style from one of his songs and using it for his own. XXX started the #helpinghandschallenge where he went and donated a bunch of clothes, games, etc to children in need. This was posted on his YouTube on January 22, 2018. Drake put out “God’s Plan” on February 16, 2018 where he does the same thing. Many people said this was Drake’s way of squashing the feud with one another, or in another way, Drake making fun of XXX by dropping an absolute shit ton of money for random people, like millions. Although this makes sense timeframe-wise, XXX posted several vulgar tweets calling out Drake for stealing his style and flow on his own tracks (Feb. 19, 2018), but quickly deleted them and claimed he was hacked. He posted an Instagram photo captioned “Please stop entertaining that bullshit on Twitter, my accounts were previously hacked” (Feb. 25, 2018).  Another key piece of the conspiracy is this, XXX posted a story photo on Instagram with the caption “IF ANYONE TRIES TO KILL ME IT WAS @champagnepapi (Drake’s username) IM SNITCHING RN” (Feb. 24,2018). I’m assuming that the Instagram story was allegedly hacked as well since XXX refers to his “accounts” being hacked. </p>

<p>If you recall Drake’s recent feud with Pusha T, where Pusha T disses Drake and brings up an illegitimate kid that Drake allegedly had with a stripper. This kid comes into play in XXX’s situation as well, people speculate that XXX found out about Drake’s hidden child and Drake threatened XXX with his life. (This is by far the furthest I’ll reach in this, but fuck it, it makes sense if this isn’t true anyways)</p>

<p>So this is all just my speculation, I don’t have any real sources that I’ve researched for credibility, but here are some real cold hard facts. </p>

<p>In Drake’s song “Look Alive” part of the song reads as follows:
“Seven hundred, three high fives look alive, look alive
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, fuck &#39;em dog, we gon&#39; see how hard they ride
I get racks to go outside, and I split it with the guys
We up on the other side, niggas actin&#39; like we tied
I&#39;ve been gone since like July, niggas actin&#39; like I died
They won&#39;t be expectin&#39; shit when Capo go to slide
&#39;Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us, but I
Bitch, come through, you, and you
I&#39;ma get the money, D-D-Drizzy get the loot
Pull up with that Draco
Play with Drake and I&#39;ma shoot
My weapon be an instrument, man I&#39;ll blow you like a flute
Nigga play so he feelin&#39; it
Pull up broad day with a K, now he shiverin&#39; 
Drop a nigga like he littering
We at the door like we the delivery
He not a plug, he middle man
That-that nigga brown like cinnamon
I got the rounds like Sugar Ray Robinson
Shot to the chest have you gaspin&#39; for oxygen
I&#39;ma spay &#39;em, just like Febreeze
Came a long way from sittin&#39; in the nosebleeds
Now a nigga on the floor talkin&#39; to the athletes
Now I&#39;m so close to the game I could steal the stat sheet”</p>

<p>The song was dropped on Feb. 6, 2018.</p>

<p>So, back to Soldier Kidd.  Soldier Kidd refers to himself as “Capo”.  If we take another look at the lyrics we can see Drake bring up a Capo in reference to the guy (who is apparently named Capo) killing the people on the “other side” even though that Drake and his people he was feuding with said that it was behind them, obviously in this sense that would be XXX. XXX was starting shit with Drake and Drake’s response could be “Play with Drake and I&#39;ma shoot/My weapon be an instrument, man I&#39;ll blow you like a flute/Nigga play so he feelin&#39; it/Pull up broad day with a K, now he shiverin&#39; /Drop a nigga like he littering/We at the door like we the delivery/He not a plug, he middle man/That-that nigga brown like cinnamon/I got the rounds like Sugar Ray Robinson/Shot to the chest have you gaspin&#39; for oxygen”. Real quick, the first 3 lines are pretty self explanatory, the 4th is interesting because XXX was killed in broad daylight.  The 6th line is also interesting because XXX was shot in his chest. Hm. </p>

<p>In another Drake song, “I’m Upset” part of the lyrics read as follows:<br/>
“SMS, triple X
That&#39;s the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin&#39; if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That&#39;s the only kind of shit that gets you some respect”</p>

<p>The song was dropped May 27, 2018. </p>

<p>Obviously if we listen to the song it’s pretty obvious that Drake is referring to pornography in this sense, but if we take it another direction, in XXX’s murder he was shot in the chest, below the neck, hence the lyrics. In regards to the last line, maybe this murder is Soldier Kidd’s was of earning respect, maybe this is Drake’s way of telling XXX that this is what it had to come to, I don’t know but it’s interesting. </p>

<p>I’m really bored and this kind of stuff is all over Twitter so I figured I’d look shit up and see what I found. I’m no detective or anything, but this makes for a pretty interesting, but morbid read.</p>

<h1>Motive</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-reg-xxxtentacion-shot-miami-20180618-story.html">Article 1</a> says XXXTentacion&#39;s own lawyer believes it was a robbery.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rapper XXXTentacion had gone to a bank with plans to buy a motorcycle before he was shot and killed at the dealership, his attorney said Tuesday. Detectives are investigating the killing as the violent end to “a random robbery,” lawyer David Bogenschutz said.</p>

<p>XXXTentacion, whose given name was Jahseh Onfroy, was leaving the dealership in Deerfield Beach on Monday when two gunmen ran up to his black, $147,000 BMW i8 and at least one of them fired, said Keyla Concepcion, a spokeswoman for the Broward Sheriff’s Office.</p>

<p>A Louis Vuitton bag was stolen out of the BMW and the shooter wore a red mask, according to the celebrity gossip news website TMZ.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Red Mask</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Some have extrapolated that the photos show evidence of some involvement in the Miami shooting on June 18, 2018.</p>

<p>&quot;I ain&#39;t had nothing to do with it but I&#39;m going to stay positive, keep my head up, you feel me? Like I always do.&quot; (Soldier Kidd&#39;s Video Statement)</p>

</blockquote>

<h1>Drake Lyrics</h1>

<p>Reason for beef with Drake:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“He could have reached out to me personally and spoken to me and it definitely would have been more respectable. But he dropped that preview and it sounded a bit like ‘Look At Me’ and he could be a huge, huge help in this situation to get me out of jail, because I’m facing life. So that’s just how I feel,” XXXTentacion told XXL, according to Hot New Hip Hop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://heavy.com/entertainment/2018/06/xxxtentacion-drake-feud-details-killed/">Source</a></p>

<p>There is no proof that Drake meant those lyrics to be for XXX. It could just mean sexual. Look at his music video done before the rapper was killed, it&#39;s a Degrassi reunion, no one was shot and killed in the <a href="https://youtu.be/rIhx2wZ8jnA?t=141">video</a></p>

<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>

<p>I think this theory of him continually being shown is excessive and unfounded. I hope this thread can help people understand what happened and help them get some closure. Anyone submitting the same old theory, you can reference them to this thread right here.</p>

<p>And a final word from the girlfriend of XXXtentacion that I think is important:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;I know y&#39;all don&#39;t f**k w me, but this isn&#39;t about me. Just please stop tagging me in disrespectful threads and arguments. I honestly don&#39;t care for any of the hype. I lost someone close to me. Leave me alone,&#39; she wrote on Twitter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had his uncle with him. They blocked him off got out the car screamed get the fuck out. His uncle farted and X said wtf is going on and they shot him 3 times. They also claimed the assialants had red bandannas. This looks like a robbery gone wrong and I can see that XXX raising his voice screaming wtf is happening probably is what triggered the man to shoot. Others are speculating that they made it look like a robbery when it was really premeditated murder since they didn’t give X a chance to get out since he had gun in his face. Perhaps this could be to push the gun agenda or maybe he had too much influence. Every single person that X has interacted with has always said he’s wierd. One girl claimed he worshipped Satan. His best friend ski mask the god even ended his friendship with him in an attempt to distance himself and even Claimed X tried to sacrifice him. It just doesn’t add up. Killing someone in broad daylight for a couple thousand dollars? </p>
