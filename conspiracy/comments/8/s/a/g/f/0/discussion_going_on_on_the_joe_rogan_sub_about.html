       I read an article about that guy yesterday. It literally changed my mind. I have tried to stay away from the Sandy Hook stuff, maybe i'm a coward, I just didnt want to have to make a decision on a minefield that tricky. But I was inclined to think it

       I'm seeing that. The thing is I don't want to go all in on sandy hook like I have on 911 and lose friends and family. The social pressure to accept the narrative is very strong. It has been better up until now to just go "LALALALALALALALA"

       Possibly because I'm indifferent to human relations, but I write this off as casualties of Truth. I really won't tolerate people who shut their ears to such matters, who won't even entertain it, who get all bent out of shape just because their belief system is being challenged.

       Either someone has tapped him on the shoulder or its a conscious effort purely for his own personal commercial reasons.

       Some of the episodes with Edgy Brah almost come across like interventions. When the topic turns to chemtrails and the lack of a single photographic  image of earth being available, Joe can't call 'bullshit' quicker if he tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing is in regards to chemtrails there's now 'operation solar shield', so his wrong there. And his first port of call to debunk the lack of photos of Earth is to claim the Japanese Himawari-8 satellite takes a picture of Earth every 10mins. Again his totally wrong. The image/animation used is the Photoshop/cgi composite known as 'the blue marble earth' which they then overlay with the relevant cloud cover. If you look in the websites ftp files under the 'site description' folder it clearly states they use the nasa blue marble image.

       I don't know if it even is being covered up mate. Ive been indoctrinated via school etc to believe in the globe earth though the past few years I've watched various video's about the flat earth. They make some good points re. curvature seen-not seen/aeroplane instruments staying level etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not one that would ridicule anyone who's adamant the earth is flat. I simply dont know myself and truth be told it's not a particular topic or issue that bothers me. Partly because I'm too stupid to get my head around the whole gravity, atmosphere, etc type of thing. It just doesn't compute to me how we cant sit in a balloon x meters above the earth and wait for the earths rotation before coming back down and ending up miles away from home. The earth spinning at x kmph, the axis, the moons etc it just goes over my head!
      </p>
      <p>
       I must admit being downunder it sure doesn't feel like im upside down!
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy for me is does Eric Dubays voice make anyone else feel sick after a while?! I literally can only handle 15min of him talking before i have to turn it off. Bizarre.

       There's no clear motive- the flat earth people say it's a conspiracy to "cover up god." It doesn't really make sense, nor does their explanation of why, if Antarctica surrouds the planet, no one has run into it on a plane or boat. It's an obvious disinformation campaign, if you ask me.

       I've seen so many references to Discworld which is a science fiction book series by Terry Pratchett on a flat planet, that I often wonder if it really just his fans doing LARP and having a bit of fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've tried to keep an open mind about it but the videos and other materials I have looked at lead me to believe the people that made them don't really believe in it and are probably just having some fun trolling people.

       first picture that pops up when you google search her. 1. She does not look black, the mixup is completely understandable. 2. She does look like she’s from planet of the apes, look at that hair cut. This was one of the biggest media over reactions ever. Roseanne wasn’t even thinking about race when she said that.

       It is strange man. I think maybe with conspiracies becoming more mainstream this is the backlash.

       People shut down. I really struggle to understand fully why but I have noticed it more and more. I'm not convinced by the sandy hook conspiracy narative but don't feel the need to argue against it when I don't know much.

       Look up Wolfgang. He's done a lot of research. Lenny Pozner tried to sue him. He had to drop the case. Why? Because you can't sue somebody for lying if they aren't lying.

       I will man. Had a quick search earlier but google just spewed up a lot of articles about being sued by family and hkw he was a conspiracy theroist. First vid that popped up was a de bunk as well. I'll dig deeper when I have time.

       Amazing how easy it is becoming to shape and sway opinions. We all use the same tools and they don't seem to be balanced. Maybe he is a crackpot but I should be able to form my own opinion on what he says.

       Ive not looked into him in particular, but i find it odd how google results are often the opposite of what im looking for, or refutations of a position i am researching. Gets a little frustrating after a while...brick walled in multiple search engines.

       If it were the Joe and anyone else show it would suck even worse than that so terrible example. Eddie is one of Joe's closest/best friends so Joe will never not have him around. You can skip every episode he's on you know.

       I've communicated with him via email and this guy just goes about his business, really doing this for the truth and nothing else. I keep hoping that he might have a bigger internet presence or something so others can help him maybe financially or something (since the opposition is continuously trying to sue him to ruin him financially), but he just quietly does his thing.

       Wolfgang's story is incredible and I think it lends tons of evidence to the argument that it was hoax, especially how he has now been discredited, and had an uphill battle the whole way only to end up backing off due to threats to his family.
