       One of the comments is like "It's okay if they've never molested anyone!", as if they won't do it in the future or anything. I'm legitimately disturbed. I usually lurk in this sub-reddit and use it for reading material before bed, but holy fuck I had to make a post today because I'm legit seeing a huge fear of mine play out.

       You should have seen the top comment I removed. It had like 6x the votes of any other in the thread. Top comment +200, next +6. A comment positing ideas that 90% of the genuine users on our sub would fucking shred, and 10% would ignore.

       I always think how odd it is that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is very into pedophilia investigations and accusations against those with power/fame, while at the same time saying that pedophilia accusations are a tool that the Deep State or TPTB use to shut down those that they want to silence (like the LV shooter's brother or the hacker who leaked the CIA Vault tools to WL).
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar to this, does OP and others want to prosecute thought crimes, no matter how heinous the thoughts are?

       I've been following and tracking the recent "normalization" of pedophilia and continue to be impressed at the downfall of pedophiles in high roles. But with all the recent ongoings (Harvey Weinstein et al) and the reports of these sickos, people are giving credibility to pedophilia. Are these shills or people being lured into a trap?

       They're serious about preying on kids. 
It's indescribable to non rapists. Bottom line, we gotta change the dialogue. People prey on kids. Arm them with a voice, and non lethal protection. Game changer.

       She did an inventory of all the people that got caught with child porn and exactly what the porn was they got caught with. The reason we even consider this type of 'tolerance' for pedophiles is because none of us know what child porn is. Turns out, a lot of it is babies getting raped to death. Pre-pubescent kids being reamed out by old people. It's rape....horrific rape, plain and simple. That kind of blows the 'non-offending' idea out of the water...if these people are viewing horrific images like this (and they are), they should be fucking shot in the head, period. Not to mention, anyone that watches CP is also spurring on it's production via being a market for it, i.e. they're promulgating little kids getting raped.  Also, not to mention, the pedo recidivism rate is almost 100&amp;#37;. Prison doesn't make them better. There is no help to be gotten for them. They're not 'attracted to children', they're pedo-sadists. They enjoy watching the destruction of something innocent. If they really loved kids (like they say), they'd kill themselves because they'd understand their mere existence can do nothing but cause harm to children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't necessarily blame the 'tolerance and acceptance' crowd, because they're ignorant of what this evil really is. But once you know what these people are, the only people who could even conceive of granting any kind of clemency to their existence are other pedophiles. They've been trying to 'normalize' pedophilia since the 60s....the 'we're victims who would never hurt anyone' angle is a rehearsed talking point. They've been hoping to piggy-back to LGBTQ wave for decades now.

       Lori is my hero. We are in the trenches together in the Maine swamp. Maine allows pedophiles to expunge their record. Except, all other citizens have permanent criminal records, including charges not convicted, unless your crime was against a child. That's normalising the fk outta pedophiles. Prosecution is opposition to justice. Law enforcement and prosecution  are cock blocking justice for child victims.

       And it's worse than that, but I won't elaborate in lieu of self preservation.

       I feel the comments are trying to draw a distinction between someone who has the thoughts and urges and someone who acts on them. And they are two very different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the former person, they may very well be unwanted thoughts and urges. I agree that a person like that needs clinical treatment. They've not committed any crimes. They clearly have mental issues. And the social stigma of something as abhorrent as pedophilia can be a huge barrier to them seeking out or receiving treatment. There are other barriers: who wants to fund that kind of service? Virtually nobody. So that person is pretty fucked, and not necessarily through any fault of their own, but often because they were abused themselves, or just psycho-sexual retardation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society too is fucked as a result. We don't research these people. We don't learn how to treat or curtail the incidence of pedophilia in our communities. And so, obviously, child sexual abuse keeps on recurring, at the same or perhaps worse rate. And kids are acutely traumatised and lives ruined, and the effects of abuse cycle down through generations as the abused often become abusers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to understand the difference between incidence of pedophilic thoughts and urges and acts of child sexual abuse. I don't think anyone in that thread's excusing or paving the way for child sexual abuse.

       It quite obviously is a sexual orientation. Why would you choose to be a pedo? Choose a feeling that will have you out casted and put in jail?

       People that have these feelings DO need help because we DON'T want them to do anything! Letting these people lurk about with NO ONE to talk to is more likely to end up in crime happening! It's common sense.

       It is not a sexual orientation.  It is a sick, disgusting, and perverted behavior that will be stopped.  A lot of pedophiles were molested when they were children, and they repeat the behavior.  How is that a sexual orientation?
      </p>
      <p>
       They did not choose to be molested as children, of course, but people are responsible for their behavior as adults.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a lot of places, like DC, pedophilia is the norm.  This also has to stop.

       We said the same about gays 50 years and now people have accepted that some are born different to others. It's not out of the realms of possibility that it is a sexual orientation. Many who are brave enough have come out and said that they don't want to feel that way but their brain is programmed to!
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, if being a pedo is not accepted in society, why would anyone CHOOSE to be one? Why would anyone of CHOSEN to be gay 50 years ago??
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is saying it's okay to touch up children lmao but it's quite obvious they have no choice in the way they feel and helping them overcome it is the best way to stop them from actually committing crimes. Start thinking a bit more progressively...

       I thought the title of this thread was an exaggeration then I see you trying to justify pedophilia. With your logic , murder and rape is not a choice it's an identity. I don't give a flying funk about why someone desires to hurt children I just want them all to be hanged to death by the balls.

       Murder and rape are actions. Raping a child is an ACTION. Having sexual thoughts about children is a FEELING. There's a huge different you're missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The aim of the game is to keep these people with these FEELINGS away from children so they don't commit ACTIONS. Best way to do that? Give them counselling and help so they don't go out and commit an act. It's in the best interest of children to do this. It's not normalising everything. Anyone with two brain cells can acknowledge that pedos don't CHOOSE to think this way. Why would anyone choose a sexual orientation that will land them in jail? lmao.

       Unless we torture the crap out of people, chemically castrate them and destroy their essence we can't rehab the desire out of someone. Keeping people with desire to do harm to others is impossible on a planet with billions of people with their own agenda.  There are pedos who are caught, served time, released and heavily monitored and re-offend multiple times ( even chemically castrated ones). Why would anyone murder someone if it would land them in jail? Why would anyone rob a bank if it would land them in jail? etc etc etc...Pedophilia has been around since the start of humanity and will probably be to the end. But that doesn't mean society should coddle this deviant behavior. The only way to minimize the harm pedophiles cause to society is to treat them with no mercy and make it certain that pedophiles will face the worse possible consequences.

       Yes that's a big question indeed. If was emperor of the world first I would do everything possible to ensure we had a fair and thorough justice system with harsh penalties for anyone involved in false or biased prosecutions. Then I would sign a decree that anyone convicted of raping a child under 13 face death by decimation. Anyone convicted of forcibly raping a child between the ages of 17 and 14 be sentenced to life in prison. Mandatory 20 year sentences for statutory rape convictions on persons under the age 16 to the age of 13. Minimum 5 year penalty for anyone openly advocating pedophilia or soliciting a child for sex. Death by torture and revival for the period of one year for anyone convicted of raping and murdering persons under the age of 17. Lawyers, judges, police officers, government officials, teachers, priests, or anyone in a position of power and trusted to care for and protect groups of children will be subject to aggravated penalties if convicted. The penalties may include being forced to work in a brothel for year. Or working in a nuclear reactor for one year with no Personal Protective Equipment. Forced to attend ALL Cleveland Brown games and tapings of Oprah. Fortunately for pedos, and unfortunately for all the children that will be harmed in the next few centuries, I'll probably never become the Emperor of Earth.

       Look it up, it's literally not a sexual orientation, it's a paraphilia, and you keep conflating the two. It's relevant because your comparison to homosexuality is harmful and based on a bad assumption.

       Okay so it's paraphilia, what is your point? It's something we have very little understanding of. We don't know why people feel that way just like we didn't understand why people were gay. If they had a choice I'm sure they would choose to be a pedo 😂😂

       My point is just that in treating as though it were an orientation, you give more social legitimacy to it than by treating it as a mental disorder, which in turn harms the ability of people to get or administer psychiatric assistance.

       It is a mental disorder and people still struggle to get help. I'm not legitimating their thoughts but if they feel more comfortable coming forward about what seems to be uncontrollable thoughts, we can help them and stop them committing crimes.

       You don't choose a sexual orientation, but you do choose to feel such a need to control, such a need to be young, such a need to never change, such a need to defile something beautiful. I state that it's about being unwilling to accept your own changes, to accept your life, and rather than look at death, you'd rather "play" with kids. Mature, or die a flower pretending to be a seed.

       Where are people saying it is alright? Or "normalizing" it? I would love to know that. Look, I in no way think pedo's are normal and I think they are mentally fucked, disgusting people. But, that doesn't take away the fact that this video says they shouldn't be judged when they don't act on their desires. Do you think people should be judged or tried in court because they fantasize about killing someone? I have thought about killing someone plenty of times. And Weinstein is a sexual predator, not a pedo, same with Cosby and most others. So, what "high profile" pedo has been taken down?
      </p>
      <p>
       But mainly, here is my question to you: If you care so much about pedophiles and taking them out, why don't you start doing something about it? There are plenty of disgusting pedo's in your own town. You could begin there and it is where you should begin. There are tons of people around the world who go online, act like young kids, start getting messages from sick fucking pedo's, set them up, then turn in the evidence to the police. Then, the police will get to work on it and most often convict them.
      </p>
      <p>
       That won't happen though. You would rather just try and prove some sort of conspiracy instead of doing something about it.

       That really is a good Idea. If we got even like 2-3% of the people, who are apparently disgusted by this, to do just that and set up pedo's online then it would make a dent. More importantly, it would probably bring with it some hightened awareness as we could all tell others in our lives what we are doing and hopefully influence others to do the same.
A big problem IMO is just that people dont take it seriously enough to do something about it. If we showed people you actually can do something, I believe a lot of good people out there would join in and make this world more of a battleground for them where its not quite so easy to just hide in plain sight as they usually do (boy scout leaders, political or religous figures, ect)

       People don't take it seriously and I know that by the responses get whenever I share that. You are the only person who has ever said that it was a good idea. It just goes to show that the people who post this stuff about pedos don't really care about actually stopping it. They seriously only care about proving a conspiracy theory, which is fucked. They would rather sit around and go through some dumbass guys emails, scour property records, look up LLC's, etc... to send out a theory when they could be spending that time stopping it in their own town.

       I imagine it as if it's some sociopath who wants to kill people.  Do we want to have people with these feelings isolate themselves with no way to address the issues/thoughts they have (and have it lead to an actual murder) or to help them feel like they can talk with professionals to try and help and address the issue?  It's an interesting debate and I guess that why it was a Ted talk.

       All acceptable actions began as thoughts. Once those thoughts became acceptable, actions followed. It's only a natural progression in the human mind. In cases where the action is decidely UNnatural, this simply cannot be. Either it remains underground, or it is crushed, in a dreadful way most times (like the frankfurt revolution in germany in the 19th century). Legitimacy like this cannot but have parents up in arms, though I must ask: If the child is without guardians, who needs to care? If our lives are simply too busy, and we don't have children, then who will ever notice, or feel a need to notice? Champions are needed, now is a necessary time for such words and actions. Do not let the pedophile thinkers in with needy words and soft messages, for we ARE better than those.

       Since when has sexual orientation been tied to gender? Surely it's just what your sexual desires are geared towards in general? Either way. It's irrelevant to the encompassing point being made.
