        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe it means that when world war iii comes and America falls, Reddit Admins and various government spies in reddit&#39;s big subs like politics and topminds of reddit will give your information and posting history to the revolutionary fronts that destroyed the US. If they find that your participation in this sub is fairly frequent, they will find your home, round you up and send you to a concentration camp to be shot en masse.</p>

<p>These people CANNOT be working for anyone but the government. It is pretty obvious that they work for the government, hands down.</p>

<p>Also, beware whatever you say and watch on youtube, because again your watch, search and comment history will be used to provide evidence for revolutionary fronts to round you up.</p>

<p>Facebook and twitter is the same thing.</p>

<p>But back to reddit.</p>

<p>It is pretty much evident since gamergate, reddit censorship has been becoming more omnipresent and you cannot say anything bad against the government, Trump or Hillary or anyone else, you cannot say anything bad about the current social quo, where nationalists are on par with fascists and if you are male or female you are respectively male or female, and you cannot say anything bad about communism or global warming. </p>

<p>Now, they bridgade subs like this as a facade and deterrent. It can come in the form of &quot;I&#39;m fed up because of shills&quot; posts (Despair), blatant bridgading of pro government or communist statements, or other low handed activities. This is all a facade. In reality, they want us to stay as long as possible until their big day comes.</p>

<p>This big day is world war iii, and if it happens, revolutionary groups will take over america and destroy free speech. Any proof or data of criticism of the elite&#39;s worldview, socialism, marxism and communism will be given to the government and will be used to round people up. Just commenting, viewing and participating such sites instantly invites you as a target. Once the revolutionaries (ISIS, Mexican Gangs, Russian and Chinese Troops) enter your home, they will instantly take you to fun camps where they will keep you for a few days then shoot you along with other dissendents.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter which site you are in, they will still round up dissendents in voat or other alternatives.</p>

<p>THIS WILL BE USED TO KILL MILLIONS.</p>

<p>THE BRIGADES ARE JUST A FACADE.</p>

<p>What? Plenty bad about Trump and Hillary gets posted here all the time.</p>

<p>This subreddit is almost nothing but bad about government and status quo.</p>
