<p>Not saying it doesn&#39;t happen, but that&#39;s a given. It&#39;s been proven over and over again and it&#39;s obvious when it happens. So why are there so many threads pushing that narrative instead of more pertinent things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if your “shills” are really just people who come here to look at stuff and debate you? Every time I’ve seen someone called a shill it’s because they made a point disagreeing with a flat earther or someone who claims that pretty much every celebrity is in a secret order that’s out to get them. You guys also act like you’re some kind of force for good, but all I’ve ever seen here is circle jerking and insulting people who disagree with you. I mean honestly if I was running this supposed “shadow government” that so many of you guys seem to believe in, I wouldn’t even bother sending people to infiltrate this place. The only thing any of you seem to collectively agree on is that you’re awake to (insert theory) while everyone else is a sheep.</p>

<p>All joking aside, your comment is an example of what bugs me about this place. If the attitude was one of discussion and equal respect rather than condescension and paranoia, this place would be much more appealing. It’s one thing to say “I believe this, but it’s possible this isn’t true” and it’s a completely different thing to say “ThIs Is ThE tRuTh My BrOtHeRs, EvErYoNe ElSe Is A sHiLl.” I’ve only really seen a slightly toned down version of the latter on here.</p>
