       SS I've seen an increasing amount of there are shills/forum sliding posts here recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if those posts are the shills forum sliding so we focus on the reddit drama rather than anything of substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying it doesn't happen, but that's a given. It's been proven over and over again and it's obvious when it happens. So why are there so many threads pushing that narrative instead of more pertinent things?

       You're right. My intention was to say adress it within the thread, which reporting would be the best way to go about, instead of clogging up the feed making redundant posts about what they are doing. But to be fair I don't know the rules by heart.

      <p>
       And I do appreciate the well written and sourced posts exposing vote manipulation/ forum sliding / fake accounts and bots in a technical way with verifiable evidence, they are free and far inbetween.

       What if your “shills” are really just people who come here to look at stuff and debate you? Every time I’ve seen someone called a shill it’s because they made a point disagreeing with a flat earther or someone who claims that pretty much every celebrity is in a secret order that’s out to get them. You guys also act like you’re some kind of force for good, but all I’ve ever seen here is circle jerking and insulting people who disagree with you. I mean honestly if I was running this supposed “shadow government” that so many of you guys seem to believe in, I wouldn’t even bother sending people to infiltrate this place. The only thing any of you seem to collectively agree on is that you’re awake to (insert theory) while everyone else is a sheep.

       Your rhetoric, your use of "Your", "You guys", and shadow government in quotes , and the fact that you left a 300 word comment discrediting skeptics in this sub with an analogy using flat earthers on an hour old thread with no votes leads me to believe that this thread got on the shills' radar.

        I’m saying that calling everyone who disagrees with you a shill is stupid and arrogant. I wouldn’t care what anybody here believed if they weren’t so determined to deny any evidence that contradicts their beliefs and usually insult the person who provides said evidence

        Why would this “get on the shills’ radar?” This is what I’m talking about. You do not warrant some sort of coverup crew that follows you around to discredit you. You post unpopular opinions with a shitty attitude and you get downvoted, simple as that.

       Right? With coordinated pizzagate or Tucson attacks on the users of this sub, it's all too obvious.

       My man who do you think runs the whole illuminati? I’ll give you a hint. He knows when you’ve been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake.

       All joking aside, your comment is an example of what bugs me about this place. If the attitude was one of discussion and equal respect rather than condescension and paranoia, this place would be much more appealing. It’s one thing to say “I believe this, but it’s possible this isn’t true” and it’s a completely different thing to say “ThIs Is ThE tRuTh My BrOtHeRs, EvErYoNe ElSe Is A sHiLl.” I’ve only really seen a slightly toned down version of the latter on here.

       I would guesstimate that is 75% of their activity here. In between pushing specific ideas and agendas, they tie up honest users in fights they don't even care to win. They just want us mired in futile debate over nonsense issues. I have a theory they get paid by the
       <em>
        response
       </em>
       . Anyone can make a 1000 posts or comments in a day, it doesn't mean anything, where is the value to their employer? But responses indicate their effectiveness.

       I think the real shills are the ones creating chaos by calling everything a shill. Preying on confirmation bias and paranoia.
