       I'm trying to make sense of this strange, strange world we live in without getting too serious and ending up being morbidly cynical. It's tough sometimes when I look at everything with a clear mind...
      </p>
      <p>
       Each of us is having a subjective experience in an objective 'reality'. There are physical and biochemical processes unfolding that are bigger than humanity, we are starting to contribute to some of them. I don't know exactly what's going on but there seems to be some element of consciousness suppression and manipulation of the masses through media happening. This makes sense to me because when I observe human behavior on large scale, behind all the Instagram posts and Facebook updates, I can see trillion dollar industries maintaining their grip on power, certain companies working with world governments surveil everyone's every move,  certain people making billions off keeping people ignorant, unhealhy, and apathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people as idealistic and compassionate as they can be act with self-interest before anything else. I don't really blame them, it's a survival skill. I'd like us to live in a world where there was a solid infrastructure for all 7.5 billion of us but I'm not sure we have the resources or labor or cooperation to create that kind of world. I'd like us to be able to expand beyond the Earth and terraform moons and planets, reach other stars but I'm not sure we have our priorities right anymore. Many others also want this but they feel powerless to do anything most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm rambling now. I'm not sure where else on reddit people even wonder about things like this and where else people would begin to have any information to help me understand. If this is not the right sub, please point me to right one. I'm still trying to 'find the others' as Terrence McKenna would say.

       I've recently been told by a girl that messaged me on a dating site that all the gods/goddess are actually entities that harvest energy from humanity to feed themselves. She knows this because these entities constantly 'fuck with her'. They need our adoration like influencers need followers and some of them feed off fear apparently. I have no idea what to make of it, she was convinced to the point of wanting to start teaching others how to 'wake up'.

       Really? I feel kinda bad for her because she is convinced this is all real and has lost nearly everyone in her life it seems due to it. She thinks the entities are 'taking over people' in her life and are responsible for the state of the world.

       She is somehow a trained massage therapist with 12 years of experience and finished a coding bootcamp last summer. She is trying to get into the industry too.

       We are truly too insignificant for all the constant special attention from all those claimed superior entities. Every person suffering from such delusions make it so that every deity/alien/supernatural's lives revolve around humans. Yet none of us have our lives impacted by some unexplainable event- every single day is as reality-consistent as the previous one. Nothing extraordinary ever happens because if it did, the entire paradigm of reality would collapse, and we - in masses - would all abandon our 'old' reality and, in a frenzy, desperately attempt to find, examine, contemplate, and enter the 'new' (supernatural) reality. No...

       I looked a little more into paranoid schizophrenia and I think this is a good explanation for this girl's beliefs and personality. She was very pretty and smart, well put together profile, so I was caught off guard when she dropped this H-bomb of a red flag on me.

       That really doesn't sound that batshit to me when it concerns the energy harvesting. I used to be somebody that believed in a loving, kind 'god' and I just don't believe that nonsense anymore. I've met enough human vampires in my life--people that I wasn't doing a damn thing to and they still got the sheer pleasure of fucking with me. They love to feed off pain, misery and suffering from others. If there's human vampires, why wouldn't there be something on a larger scale feeding off this shit too?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've shunned all the religious beliefs I used to have and goodness knows the new age shit sounds crazier to me than what you're saying is crazy coming out of this girl's mouth. To look at all the many kinds of suffering in this world and be able to say "We're here to learn lessons!" "We're here to pay back karmic debt!" with a straight face really takes the cake. And I'm definitely not into the love and light nonsense. I should've learned this one a long time ago. If somebody's doing something bad to you, you can't just keep on being kind to the person and being a welcome mat for them to step on, a target they'll keep coming back to. It's nothing but an abuse cycle if you keep extending an olive branch to those that will only break it in half and throw it back in your face. I'm not going back to being that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah for the tl;dr version: I think this world's a trap and I do believe whatever created/maintains this trap is evil and I also think they feed off this shit. The real fight is being able to defeat these fuckers and getting out of this world once and for all imo.

       Well, if she is telling the truth and your gut feeling is correct, I'm going to raise you a few chips and ask you this...

       If you are in tune with the highest good and are striving to be of service to all, without any iota of Creation excluded, what the fuck can any of these entities or Agent Smiths do to me or to you?

       Well, the founding fathers made it pretty clear that
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/k9K3R02">
        non-Whites could never be citizens here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       When multiple cultures/societies meet, one ends up dominating the other whether it be through assimilation or war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hispanics and Blacks come from countries with lower average IQ's. Both groups overwhelmingly vote democrat and vote for bigger government as it means more freebies. If the 2016 election was only on Hispanic/Black voting, President Trump would have won 0 states while he would have won 42+ if only Whites voted. Both groups have also shown much different voting patterns than we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blacks are 13% of the population, yet commit 52% of the Crime. 80%-90% are on welfare. Many blacks clearly feel they are being treated poorly here and people like Maxine Waters have openly called for Whites to pay reparations to them for slavery. South Africa right now is kicking White farmers off their land due to claims of racism and Zimbabwe did the same years prior. We can see this happening here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hispanics have a higher crime rate than Whites and Asians do. They haven't really assimilated as many only speak Spanish. 70%-80% of all Hispanics use government assistance and they have a much higher birth rate than Whites do. Hispanic countries for the most part are dangerous shitholes and I would expect the US to go down a similar path. Hispanics also are not happy about the result of the US-Mexican civil war and could seek payback.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we see a future for Whites in the US where we will have even more amounts of people on government assistance which will mean higher taxes, we see a one party country where only Dems can win and we see two groups who might be looking to get some payback for events of the past. The US in its existence has been majority White. It has become one of the richest, safest, smartest and most free countries ever in history and we are doubtful of the chances of that continuing when Whites are no longer the majority. We also know that culture cannot be replicated, and would like to preserve it's existence.

       More that it's stupid. You really think you're going to be turned into a slave because you're not going to be a racial majority? I mean come on.

       None of the material on here bothers me. I'm just an observer collecting interesting information. There is little I can do to change any of it, and most of it already happened and I can't do shit about it. You do not have much of a way to affect change, so it is ridiculous to think you should bear the burden of responsibility.

       Find the position of neutrality. If something does come along you can do something about, then consider action.

       You'll never know. So, knowing that, live your life on your own terms. Do things that make you happy. Don't be a dick to others, but also don't take shit. Help people when you can, realize they are slugging through this mud pit just as you are.

       I think is greed and corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need a better understanding of the word corruption cause it rots what it touches. So we have a corrupt system by nature in which any position of power is meticulously controlled and who is in it is selected.
      </p>
      <p>
       That corrupt "Big brother" manages to control people cause it's based on greed. Most of the earth's territory is unpopulated, if civilization made a conscientious effort to make all places habitable and expand the populations areas, instead of concentrating near businesses so you know where to spend your money and make all life mandatory utilities be behind a pay wall, you can control the population that has nature there at it disposal for use. How can the earth be in danger? The earth would sneeze and wipe out the whole civilization but th  earth will still be there. Who are we giving the power of knowledge, food supply and communications? There is currently a race not for the betterment of mankind, but to control mankind cause they're stupid and we're not. I think the psychopaths believe their own lies. So they don't care a war is started by lies, we are idiots, sheeps need guidance, who cares if it is for slaughter? It's for the good of me and my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any investigation or product that wants to develop, needs investment, needs someone that can support it, if you have the money you choose what develops and what enters humanity as a rule.  Look at fossil fuel cars or the lies tht are being taught today in the textbooks, is all neatly controlled and has an agenda, but the agenda expands across generations so it's very hard for us to be able to discern the whole thing, there is a mix of jesuits, jews, masons, nazis... There is always a group to blame, but no names, even if we know the Rothschild funded Israel or that the Rockefellers manufactured a lie with oil scarcity or that by the hand ogf Alan Dulles and United Fruit &amp;co. hundreds of latin american civilians perished cuase they wanted better conditions...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all kind of strange to think about it cause that is what civilization has evolved too, live by and for the money, the catch is, the people on the top have a lot to spare to consolidate power.

       Money. It makes no sense whatsoever.

      <p>
       The vast majority of it does not and never has actually existed. It is literally created out of thin air by people who already have way too much of it.

       That really doesn't sound that batshit to me when it concerns the energy harvesting. I used to be somebody that believed in a loving, kind 'god' and I just don't believe that nonsense anymore. I've met enough human vampires in my life--people that I wasn't doing a damn thing to and they still got the sheer pleasure of fucking with me. They love to feed off pain, misery and suffering from others. If there's human vampires, why wouldn't there be something on a larger scale feeding off this shit too?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've shunned all the religious beliefs I used to have and goodness knows the new age shit sounds crazier to me than what you're saying is crazy coming out of this girl's mouth. To look at all the many kinds of suffering in this world and be able to say "We're here to learn lessons!" "We're here to pay back karmic debt!" with a straight face really takes the cake. And I'm definitely not into the love and light nonsense. I should've learned this one a long time ago. If somebody's doing something bad to you, you can't just keep on being kind to the person and being a welcome mat for them to step on, a target they'll keep coming back to. It's nothing but an abuse cycle if you keep extending an olive branch to those that will only break it in half and throw it back in your face. I'm not going back to being that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah for the tl;dr version: I think this world's a trap and I do believe whatever created/maintains this trap is evil and I also think they feed off this shit. The real fight is being able to defeat these fuckers and getting out of this world once and for all imo.
