       Alright, so I'm not sure how to word this, but I've never posted here before. With the rise of the alt-right, which I think is retarded, came the rise of these Jewish conspiracies about Zionists owning the media, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to not believe any of it, because it sounded absurd on the face of it, but after how much shit I've heard about it, I have to start asking some questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could somebody explain to me what the crux of the main conspiracy is? I've noticed that the conspiracy arguments are always shot down with "that's anti-semitism", but that's a bullshit argument. It's just that a lot of people pushing these conspiracies, really do hate the Jews. So it's kind of a weird thing to get any objectivity on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm just curious if any critical thinkers out there believe in these conspiracies, and could maybe give me some sources or something to look into? Another thing I wonder about is George Soros. I'm constantly hearing conservatives bring his name up as the epicenter of all bad things that happen, but I've heard it enough times now that I figured there might have to be something there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the sporadic nature of this post, it's kinda hard to get my thoughts together enough to know what to ask. Thank you everyone!

       Intro-level is good enough for me, I'm just trying to learn as much as I can before I make any kind of judgement call on it. I have heard about most of the major Hollywood people being Jewish, so that's pretty interesting.

       Jews controlling the media, academia, Hollywood, as well as being deeply and thoroughly entrenched in our government and judicial system, is not a "conspiracy theory." It is an indisputable fact, and you can find verification of this fact very easily. It's not exactly something they can hide; they can only try and intimidate people into not talking about it (and they do a very good job of this).

       I'm not saying it's a "conspiracy theory" in the sense that it's insane or implausible, I'm just referring to that because I don't have any solid info to go off of right now. That's why I came here to ask you fine people about it lol.

       Ashkenazi jews are special and have an average IQ of 115.

       This really shows up at the extreme end of intelligence scale. 1% of the population while being 30% of all Nobel Laureates:

       It means that they are likely only getting that award because they are Jewish. Jewish people tend to have a very strong sense of tribal nepotism.

       Welcome!
      </p>
      <p>
       Its simply true, read the Talmud if you don't believe me. How do you think they got so over-represented in the fields of media, government, and banking? And why do you think they tend to be over-represented in fields that can shape society and public sentiment?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't consider that anti-semitic, they are just looking out for themselves and trying to gain power and influence. I can't blame them for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have a great allegiance to Israel and other Jewish people, and that group cohesion gives them success. The rest of us goyim are busy fighting each other and looking out only for ourselves, which allows them to succeed, often at our expense. Props to them for developing an international ethnostate system that has been so effective.

       Lol most Jewish people I know are pretty casual and have normal people jobs in offices. My friends don’t even like the state of Israel, as small of a sample as that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like they’re regular normal people, we play d&amp;d and go out to eat together. Defs not the control the media type.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I’ve only met one extremely wealthy person in my life. He was catholic like myself. I know next to nothing about him. It seems much more likely that there is a plain class based de facto aristocracy than an ethnostate.

       I know man, I have Jewish friends too and they’re totally normal people. What we are talking about is another level of society. Can Jewish people at those levels promote and support other Jews, or people who support and Jewish interests (shabbos goys).
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also important to remember that there are two main factions of Jews, the Zionist faction in the Marxist faction. I think the Marxist faction is far more problematic.

       It's absolutely true that Ashkenazi have the highest average IQ (115) of any ethnic/racial group on the planet. However, this only explains a small percentage of the massive over-representation in societal institutions. More info here:

       I'll be honest, that sounds fucking absurd lol. Jews or anybody else, that just doesn't sound reasonable. There are certain things in the Spirit Science videos that make sense, and are very interesting. Space Jews however, sounds like quackery. I do appreciate the info and help though!

       Do you know what the deal is with that "penis facial" thing? Because I don't believe in Satanism, or these other weird rituals that people talk about, because it just sounds absurd. I know the elites are doing fucked up things, but I don't base it around superstition, I base it around money and their control of us. So I'm curious what you think that story is all about?

       Well it's exactly what you heard. Beauty treatments made out of a babies penis foreskin. Babies in North Korea. Much worse practices go on behind the scene. And there is no such thing as basing rituals around money and control. That is their religion and beliefs. Blood sacrifes, pedophilia and other things like that. Note that this was revealed just a couple of weeks ago. It has not hit the mainstream media. Blood sacrifices and other rituals are practices that they practice for their selfish gains. Just like Sandra Bullocks dates to use a babies body part for her own beauty. She still looks like though.

       I have a question McPick, a serious question. You say that the US government has been subverted, but as I recall, the government has been fucking us for a longgg time. So were they subverted a couple hundred years ago, or is it just the politicians/elites that are in there now just openly fucking us?

       I guess what I'm saying is, I don't see the need for subversion or a grand conspiracy to explain why our government is insanely corrupt and hell bent against us. I thought that's basically what government was used as all throughout history.

       You must be new here, it's not unusual to find people here who unironically believe Nazi propaganda.

       I even saw someone say that Hitler is only demonised nowadays because he tried to represent the common man over the elite. Seriously.

       I'm not exactly new, but I'm new to posting. I definitely see what you mean, that's kinda why in my OP i mentioned that it's hard to get an objective answer. Because you're either labeled "anti-semetic" if you question Jews at all, or you have people who legitimately hate Jews for whatever reason, as the ones giving you the information. So it's pretty hard to decipher what is propaganda, and what is legit, I definitely see what you mean there.

       When talking about influence over some major institution in society (like the mainstream mass media for example), there's a big difference between saying that "the Jews control X" vs. saying that the very small group of people who dominate institution X also happen to be mostly Jewish. The first is easily interpreted in a way that is false and potentially racist. The second is often factually true.

       The best person I've ever heard who explains this phenomenon without any stereotyping or racial overtones is Jeff Gates (author of "Guilt By Association"). Before he disappeared from public life for unknown reasons (insert conspiracy here), he did a very interesting interview here:

       That's what I was kind of thinking phisch, I think it has more to do with that being the identity of the people fucking us, and less to do with "Jews being inherently evil", but I really have no idea.

       In addition, if you've never investigate the holocaust in detail before, you may want to learn about an American Jew named David Cole. He became very interested in the history of WW2. He traveled to Auschwitz with a camera operator and made a documentary titled "The Truth Behind the Gates of Auschwitz". Check it out:

       Sure thing. In fact, the story of David Cole got even more interesting after he made that video in the 1990s. Afterward, the JDL (Jewish Defense League) put out a $25,000 bounty for his murder. He later faked his death only to be "outed" 18 years later. You can hear more about his strange life story in a recent interview here:

       On Youtube it is (or at least was) broken up into 15 minute segments. I watched one a night for 24 nights and finished the whole thing. The soundtrack is very good and I believe it can be enjoyed at 1x speed but might sound annoying and trippy at 2x speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I second that recommendation. Great movie.

       Contrary to the neonazi sentiments here, media is run by the CIA, not Jews. Hollywood is also heavily influenced by the CIA and Pentagon. The three letter agencies of the military intelligence complex are Catholic dominated. The international Jewish conspiracy theory was actually created by Jesuit priests in their La Civilta Cattolica journal during the mid-late 19th century. Hitler picked up his antisemitism from Catholic antisemite Karl Luger whose political party reprinted articles from said Jesuit journal.

       The media as a whole is not controlled by a single entity. There has been/is certainly CIA involvement in media outlets as made clear by the church committee. But go ahead and look at the CEOS, presidents, directors of most of the big media companies. A huge amount of these positions are held by Jewish people. Now is this a Jewish conspiracy or do Jews just happen to hold influential positions?

       Red herring fallacy. The CIA is behind civilian media companies when it comes to public influence. The media companies comply with CIA agendas and for example they employ intelligence agents as journalists.

       But the discussion was originally about Jews. Red herrings are essentially changing the argument to something unrelated. Nothing I brought up was unrelated to the discussion. I also admit that I'm aware of CIA involvement! I'm simply stating that many individuals in positions of power in the media happen to be Jewish.

       Utter ignorance. The Mossad was started by a Knight of Malta,  Reinhard Gehlen, just like the CIA with Knight of Malta Donovan. Furthermore, the head of the Mossad during 911, Ephraim Halevy, admitted his organization worked for the CIA. He was even awarded the CIA director's award for his cooperation with US intelligence. You men are faced with embarrassment every time you encounter me. You cannot deal with any of these facts and you will never admit the papacy is the problem becuae you boys are in bed with the priests.

       Do you know what the deal is with that "penis facial" thing? Because I don't believe in Satanism, or these other weird rituals that people talk about, because it just sounds absurd. I know the elites are doing fucked up things, but I don't base it around superstition, I base it around money and their control of us. So I'm curious what you think that story is all about?
