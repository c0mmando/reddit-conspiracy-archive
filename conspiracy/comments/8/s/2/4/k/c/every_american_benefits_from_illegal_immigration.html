       Sorry, but it's the truth. Immigrants clean our houses, they watch our kids, they drive our trucks, they trim our trees, they build our buildings, they pick our produce. They do it cheap, they do it well, and they do it without complaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are some of them actual criminals? Sure. Plenty of Americans are actual criminals, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can talk about better ways to insure that immigrants coming here don't drain resources, don't take jobs away from natural-born Americans, and don't commit crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're talking about zero tolerance for illegal immigration, up to the point of putting children in cages and building a giant, useless wall, then we also have to talk about paying nine bucks for a bag of carrots and a grand a week for daycare.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't have one without the other.

       I'm not trying to pick a side, but the original argument like 25 years ago was that the willingness of illegal immigrants to work unskilled jobs drove down those wages, making it harder for US citizens to earn liveable wages. Part of the issue was also that a lot of the US dollars they earned were leaving the country instead of stimulating the US economy, but that's been happening, to some degree, for a while.

       As someone that used to manage kitchens a couple decades ago I would much rather have a non or broken English speaking Mexican or Guatemalan working along side me than a young white or black guy and I'd pay them the same. This is just personal experience and I'm sure it's subjective but they showed up on time, busted their ass, and were 100 times more dependable than the alternative.

       Not the ones I've worked in,  it's like the exact opposite.  Doing bare minimum, high/tweaked out, coming in hungover, calling in sick frequently, hanging out on he phone, bad attitudes,  getting a lot of send backs,  walking off and disappearing, etc... We use to put ads up, now we rely on word of mouth.   Haven't had to fire anyone in a year coming up.

       Salaried jobs are typically skilled positions though. With unskilled jobs, higher supply of labor means lower demand (in this case that translates to lower wages). There are smaller divisions within unskilled labor as well. Keeping with the restaurant example - that's why front of house workers, on average, make more than cooks. I'm definitely not saying one job is harder than the other either. Again, I'm not here to defend an opinion, just wanted to point out the other side because OP was over-generalizing. This post is better suited for r/economics or r/politics anyway.

       What you describe is part of what right wing/middle way media has been shoveling for 30 years along with 'right to work', unions are corrupt, tax cuts for job creators creates trickle down, abstinence works, tough on crime, lock em up,  deregulation, greed is good and on and on.  All helping Americans fuck themselves to the slowest wage growth since the gilded age while funneling money to the top 3%.

       You need to look into it more. They drive down wages for jobs. They live ten per house or apartment don't pay taxes. Get benefits that Americans don't get.  They do work but Americans would do those jobs also.

       What is one way to make sure someone pays taxes? Ship them to another country after they have been here for years generating money or get a path to legalization so the IRS can make sure we recoup some of the accidental investment?

       Illegal Immigrants pay taxes and often overpay because they do not file a return. What are these “benefits that Americans don’t get”?

       What a silly statement. There are plenty of people in need of employment. Illegals do not contribute in any way that can't easily be replaced. They are a net sink on the economy.

       If millions of undocumented immigrants were deported, their jobs wouldn't be filled by jobless Americans - because we keep being told there are virtually no jobless Americans.

       The wall that will be a Line right? As in it will have two end points? And those ends will be at two bodies of water? God I wonder how anyone will ever get around it..... oh wait maybe just go around it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you think illegals don’t contribute in any way that can’t be easily replaced you may want to visit a real farm some time, they work for less than any American would be willing to work for and they are content doing it..... thinking they could “easily” be replaced is ignoring the reality that the American agricultural industry basically went from slave labor to underpaid immigrant labor....
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell my tiny town in the mid west more than doubles in size every fall when the migrants come to help with harvest and I can say first hand it would be nearly impossible to replace them with Americans without costing everyone a lot more at the grocery store.....
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not disagreeing that things can be done to protect American skilled labor jobs like construction, roofing, painting, cooking etc but some jobs like field hands are a win-win for everyone, if they’re happy making $0.85 for every 90lb box of oranges they pick then right on because I like being able to afford oranges..... why rock the boat with this belief that Americans will happily do these jobs they are not even applying for in the first place...

       Illegal immigration is at an all time low.

       A very very large amount of illegals come in through the borders themselves.

       Which is why we need to recoup our investment even if that investment is accidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we spend years educating people allowing them to generate money in our economy and reap the benefits, then ship them off to another country that gains from our investment.

       Firstly let me just start by saying I'm a minority myself. I was born here but I'm Dominican.
      </p>
      <p>
       My father has a small construction business through employees he has hired throughout time are told to pay their taxes, and even the contractor he works for hires illegals and makes them pay taxes. And it's a huge multi million dollar business.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said a lot of these guys have straight up told me that they came through border patrol checkpoints. Vast amounts of these illegals wound up close to checkpoint locations by our imagination services and were illegally allowed to enter the country by of course paying a hefty fine. Typically $5-10,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more than sure this type of shit goes on still.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple issues here and this is one of them. I'm all for people coming to this country to make something of themselves and their families, as long as you aren't a low life piece of shit I welcome all. I know I've made a decent success of myself and it wouldn't happen anywhere else.

       Just we know were on the same page I want you to explain to me why I should be outraged. These people live in a third world country decide to have kids THEN decide this isnt what they want. Drag the poor fucker across a continent pay human trafficker to smuggle them and my outrage is with the US being forced to take away the kids? At what point is it OK to blame the immigrant for the continuous terrible decision making? Are we suppose to give the kid back to this person incapable of making safe decisions for their kids? Do we give the kid to the coyote to give it another go across the desert? What the fuck do you want?

       Wage suppression and  a workforce made up of millions of people with no rights is horrible for all and any worker.

      <p>
       As a liberal and mostly Democratic voter I am opposed to illegal immigrant labor and the excessive number of legal visa workers as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of importing technology workers we most certainly should be training our own workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this nation's oligarchs want a labor made entirely up of foreign workers who have no rights and can be sent home if they don't like the below living standard pay.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The biggest cost shifting racket today is the use of imported labor. Recruiting, hiring and training Americans is expensive, because America is a first world society.Citizens expect first world working conditions. That makes it hard to shift labor costs onto the public, so companies prefer foreign labor. That way, they can pay lower wages and they avoid having to deal with employees who know their rights or have ideas about forming a union. Plus, foreign workers don’t sue for things like discrimination or poor safety conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        There’s a cost to this sort of predatory labor system, but those costs are shifted to the public in the form of depressed wages and high social costs. The migrants in every hospital emergency room are not having their bills picked up by their employer. When Pablo decides to get drunk and drive over an American, his employer is not paying the victim’s family or covering the cost of Pablo’s incarceration. The fact is, there is nothing more expensive to a society than cheap labor, it’s just hidden from public view.
