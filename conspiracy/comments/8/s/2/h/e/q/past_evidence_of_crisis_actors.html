       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't sure where to ask about this, but I figured if anyone keeps track of it, it's this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is inspired by Ann Coulter's
       <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/media/392774-ann-coulter-calls-immigrant-children-child-actors">
        recent claim
       </a>
       that the photos and videos from detention centers where kids are separated from their parents are staged. I offer no comment on this particularly, as I don't want this discussion to get derailed with political stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wondering, however, if there were ever some clear moments that this kind of thing was caught. Where, for example, it turns out that someone has a documented history as an actor and has no business being in the place where some alleged incident took place.

       Crisis actors are real, and employed by first responders to simulate victims when they train for natural and man-made disasters.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the "government-employed stooge pretending to be a victim of a fake shooting" meme is entirely a creation of conspiracy theorists.

       here is a clear video of a crisis acting scenario. Some people believe the Boston bombing had crisis actors. If you watch the videos there is some compelling evidence. Also if you research the amount of money spent on creating propaganda in the CIA, it’s astounding. These guys have greater than Hollywood budgets to create a narrative. It’s know that false flags are real, and it’s also know that the CIA has its hands in the media. These aren’t theories, they are fact. So it makes sense that they would create fake terrorist attacks to push a narrative rather than actually murdering people like they did on 9/11.

       I would debate, but since it’s 2018 and we have google, you literally just have to type a few words into a search engine to find out that what I’m saying is indeed true, and the video is clear evidence of a false flag. If he were to elaborate maybe I would have taken more initiative to answering him, but it’s pretty clear he has his mind set in his ways, because again, it’s 2018, and if you don’t believe it now, you never will.

       So a video can’t lie? I feel like we’ve reached the point (it’s 2018, like you said) where videos can be manipulated in such a way that it is not solid primary evidence.

       You may not think a lot has changed, but there is more change behind the scenes then you think. A decade ago, nobody would ever listen to the Bushes about crimes against humanity, but there they are in the news talking about trumps atrocities, even though they themselves are the cause of millions of innocent deaths. A little at a time, the entire country has changed their entire view on 911 not being a conspiracy. A decade ago, everyone knew it was a conspiracy. Little by little they change peoples minds.

       If you aren’t paid then I suggest you do some more research instead of blindly arguing. There people behind the scenes aren’t on your side. And if you are on their side, then you are paid for misinformation to control the population to believe a narrative that will most easily allow them to achieve what they want. The banks, the corporations, the families that have ruled this world for hundreds if not thousands of years. To get what they want, and that might not be bad in the long run, but human life is not in their best interest. It’s the continuing of current leadership and way of life for themselves.

       When you examine the notion of crisis actors through an emotional lense it seems to make sense. People dont realize how compartmentalized the government is, or how serious they are about Non-Disclosure agreements. The idea of crisis actors makes sense. If a politician is trying to push an agenda unsucessfully, they know attacking your emotions will work. Dead kids, tragic love stories etc. There are people whose entire job it is to manipulate your emotions and ideas to maintain and grow power. Not saying i believe in many of the crisis actor stuff, but it definitely makes sense.

       Please don't tell me you seriously think that the government hires actors, pays them to pretend to be the parents of children killed in a made-up school shooting, and stops anyone from talking by making them sign NDAs. That's ridiculous.

       The only two that I ever entertained the idea of them being crisis actors were Gene Rosen and that parent who was smiling and laughing before coming on camera the day his daughter was murdered. He then did an acting exercise to get into character, and suddenly became sad and concerned for the speech he was about to make. Nothing else has convinced yet.

       I don't really buy the Sandy Hook parent one, because what kind of moron crisis actor would be standing near a podium with reporters with cameras all around him, and be "out of character" and laughing, then decide to start his performance at the podium.  It's not like he was caught on a hot mic or hidden camera.

       It is not at all "out of character" for someone in severe grief to experience a range of emotions in quick succession. He's going from being with, and talking to, a small group of people to facing up to a horde of media and making a public statement about losing a child. Nothing is normal about that situation and people in grief can act in strange ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do find odd is people who think that the government is planning an executing these huge conspiracies but hiring bad actors for the public roles. And why would the government want to fake school shootings anyway?

       There are like 27 crisis actors documented on 911. One of the guys (white male) literally has another handler (2 suits a black male and a white male, black male interacts) in a suit coach him during an interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all the recent shootings and crisis actor accusations, remember 911 has several that have stood the test of time. So if you're looking for a "proof of concept" if you will, you can web search for examples at least as far back as 911

       If he was just laughing, or just upset, I wouldn't have brought it up. It's that he seems to make an attempt to go from that funny grand-old-time period of grief to the broken voice period.. for the camera. It doesn't seem natural at all.

       You literally have no idea how grief works. It changes from minute to minute. You're up, you're down, you're tired, you're wired, you're hungry, you can't eat, etc.

       I'm with u/agalarga – your comments show you have no experience with how people handle grief caused by the loss of a loved family member. Some people absolutely can laugh one minute as they think of that loved one, then be crying the next. As u/agalarga says, some people can't eat or sleep. I see nothing odd about a man having to take a moment to prepare himself to speak publicly before a crowd of media about his loss.

       Nayirah al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيره الصباح‎), called "Nurse Nayirah" in the media, was a fifteen-year-old Kuwaiti girl, who alleged that she had witnessed the murder of infant children by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait, in verbal testimony to the U.S. Congress, in the run up to the 1991 Gulf War. Her testimony, which was regarded as credible at the time, has since come to be regarded as wartime propaganda. The public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton, which was in the employ of Citizens for a Free Kuwait, had arranged the testimony. Nayirah's testimony was widely publicized. Hill &amp; Knowlton, which had filmed the hearing, sent out a video news release to Medialink, a firm which served about 700 television stations in the United States. That night, portions of the testimony aired on ABC's Nightline and NBC Nightly News reaching an estimated audience between 35 and 53 million Americans. Seven senators cited Nayirah's testimony in their speeches backing the use of force. President George Bush repeated the story at least ten times in the following weeks. (Wikipedia)

       in the UK, they have staged VIP hospital visits in the past, used actors to play the part of patients.

       they don't want VIPs to meet and greet real sick people, so they use actors.

Not only was Sandy Hook used to convince US people we need to disarmed, we're also supposed to believe we need invasive inquiry into everyone's mental health which would lead to blacklisting.

       No, not wait.  There it is-a reply to the OP who wanted to know if there were instances of actors involved in these crises, and if you doubt there's something about David and Francene Wheeler that reeks of bad acting and deceit, you're either deficient in reasoning skills, naive enough to not see what the truth is regarding these actors, or trying to support the lie that is Sandy Hook as the msm presented it.

       Do you have any proof other than your totally subjective view that something about them "reeks of bad acting and deceit"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you genuinely proposing that they and other families agreed to bring up a child for years (with, presumably, child actors playing their children), then let someone kill or spirit that child away while they pretended to be grieving, and then for years after the event they continued to pretend they had lost a child in a school shooting, with some setting up foundations in that child's name and others getting involved in artistic, social or political causes to honour that child, all in furtherance of some conspiracy? (Not to mention all the first teachers, responders, neighbours, etc that must also have been involved.) And what would be the point of this conspiracy anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet none of these people has got sick or disillusioned with having to live this this charade for years and revealed the truth to the media? Who would agree to doing this for the rest of your life? Would you?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the only evidence you can point to to support this theory is that you think these people aren't acting in the way you think they should be? And yet you think that people who don't buy this steaming pile of crap are those ones deficient in reasoning skills, naive or supporting it?

       I wonder if one might attempt to give credence to Coulter's baseless claim (since endorsed by Don Jr) by pointing out any evidence of past crisis actors in totally unrelated circumstances. Instead of noting how this seems an instance of floating a theory in order to make someone second guess the sick gut feeling they get when they see these images and think about what's going on, reduce the whole thing to "it's a liberal plot."
