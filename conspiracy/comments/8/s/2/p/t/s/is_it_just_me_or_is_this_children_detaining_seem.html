       We have know about the children being detained for months now, and in a matter of days the story goes national with pictures of children and stories circulating through the net.  I seriously think this is happening both to smear the current gov, and to distract from the previous gov.

       Maybe, but I think it's just straight up political propaganda.  It is an election year, after all.  I would guess that the democrats did a lot of focus group testing and found that this was something that resonated with potential democrat supporters, and now they are trying to gin up some good old fashioned outrage, which democrat voters love more than almost anything else in this world.  That would explain why it's suddenly a major issue now, but no one gave a fuck about it when it was happening under the Obama administration.

       I don’t believe there is democrat vs republican anymore. I think it’s all one entity and this is all planned. Trump was planned, the Russia narrative was planned, literally everything was planned. They are dividing us racially, financially, ethically, religiously. We are more divided than we have ever been if you take into consideration the population of earth at the moment. I think they are preparing for another world war. (A reset button) to give the human race a few more centuries.

       The Uniparty definitely exists, that is to say, a lot of the high level career Congressmen are all working together for the moneyed interests that fund them, as opposed to representing their constituents.  However, they are not all powerful and have opposition from within their own parties.  I don't think Trump was planned.  Based on the reaction from Uniparty politicians and the talking heads in the media.  I do think that the Russian narrative was planned, but it was intended to give Hillary justification for aggression against Russia and Russian interests after she won.

       Divide and conquer is real, but humans have all ways divided themselves along those lines.  The powers that be wan't you to believe we are living in the most divided time period ever, but looking at history, that's not the truth.  It's worse than it was in the 80's and 90's, but still much better than in the past, and the farther back you go, the worse it gets.

       I agree with you here.  But I think they want a repeat of the late 60's and early 70's political violence, not full on civil war.  But I guess if shit goes awry, all bets are off.

       This is what is ironic about your mentality. It is more self-assuring to think one person or group does have control over reality, even if they are the evilest person or group imaginable than to consider the prospect that no one person or group has that much control. The chaos is far more frightening than evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the basis for the entire conspiracy mindset. Unfortunately, it leaves you blind to the many people and groups that have control over smaller realities. The cult leader, the corrupt mayor, dirty cop, the cartel leader. They don't work together for some grand plan, but while you are investigating NASA on the moon they are down the street picking pockets.

       If they had went to an official port of entry and claimed asylum, they would not be separated.  They may still be detained, but not separately.  The reason they are separated is because the parents broke the law by crossing illegally.

       But this is inhumane.  It's wrong.  It's your duty as an American to stand up to your govt when it's wrong.  I did the same thing when Obama was using the irs to attack his political opponets.  Now I'm doing it to trump because of this as well as a few other unrelated things.  But for me right now, this is the biggest one.

       Why is it wrong?  Should we instead hand the children over to CPS like we would if an American citizen was arrested and jailed?  Should we deport them immediately while their parents await trial/asylum processing?  Because we can't deport the parents if they claim asylum, until their application has been processed.
      </p>

       The simplest way to stop this is for people to stop coming here illegally.  Don't break the law, and certainly don't bring your kids with you when you do it.

       We can't deport them because they are claiming asylum.  Once they do that, they cannot be deported unless and until their asylum application is denied.  The parents broke the law by entering illegally.  They are in jail.  The children are housed separately, temporarily, until their parents asylum status is determined.  Then, whatever happens, happens together.  Either they are deported, together, or they are granted asylum and stay in the US, together.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not senseless.  What is senseless is breaking the law and bringing your kids with you when you do it, in hopes of using them as a "get out of jail free" card in case you get caught.

       I haven't been people claiming that. There was that cop who got caught molesting a kid and threatening his mom with deportation. But I think some people are pointing out some hypocrisy from the far right here, who often thinks Democrats are constantly fucking kids and running sex rings. Here we have kids being separate 
 from their parents and put in cells and literally nobody on the far right is soecualting that anything nefarious is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, for most liberals, this is much more about inhumane immigration policy as opposed to the child trafficking angle.

       It doesn’t matter what political party you are in, all of the leaders are taking part in it. And I don’t mean small time leaders, I mean the big wigs behind the scenes. They are all trafficking children, and that’s their leverage that they hold about each other. Every time there is a story that breaks about a discovery, it gets buried and bashed by the media. Pizza gate is a joke now, even though there is clear evidence our leaders are taking part in child trafficking. It’s not about republicans vs Democrats. It about the people vs fucking monsters. Stop falling for the god damn distractions.

       It seems far fetched I understand, and they expect you to think that, and most people do think that, that’s why it’s not gaining any traction.

       Someone asked that lady "what about the girls?", which nobody is talking about.  These stories are all about the boys centers.  But where do the girls go during this process?  Not sure why I'm asking you other than you sound smart.

       All the administrations are doing that, but most likely not the little guys, but the businessmen and the cultist government leaders who take part in ritualistic behavior. The religious ones who are known internationally to be pedophiles. I think even Trump is part of it.

       If these children aren't being processed through quickly, then that is a violation of their 5th amendment right.  And to speak frankly, this is the slippery slope many of us have been worried about.  Detaining children isn't just illegal, its immoral.  They didn't have a choice in any of this and should not be punished.  If you don't view this as punishment, then we aren't on the same page.

       No matter how you try to justify it, if they crossed the border

Try crossing over into any other country in the world saying that you're seeking asylum, and if you didn't go through the proper channels, there will be consequences.

       Because putting your wife or children through a lifetime of psychological trauma is worth "seeking asylum". It's not exactly a thought process that makes any logical sense to me. If it were my family in a position like that, I would seek out the proper channels, and do things the legal way, rather than risk having my family raped, murdered, or taken away while I'm detained.

       A speeding ticket is a civil infraction, which means neither misdemeanor nor felony. But nice try with the false equivalence. Take your kids and go shoplifting. When you get caught and arrested, are they going to jail with you? If there is another guardian available to take them, they will go that route, but in the case of illegal immigrants, we can't verify relationship if we can't even verify who it is that just got put into custody.
      </p>

       To make matters worse, they are endangering the children just bringing them over the way they do in most cases. Here in AZ, temperatures can get up to 120 during the summer, and still be in the triple digits well after midnight, when a lot of these people are traveling. Dehydration can and will kill someone very quickly in the conditions we see here, especially when there is a lot of physical activity involved. There's also the risk of rape or murder by the coyotes that may be bringing them over. Add in the face that there are also predators and venomous snakes in the desert, and you're looking at another potential for death. These people are risking their families lives. The part that pisses me off the most is the fact that they are endangering the lives of their children, when they could go to a port of entry  and apply for asylum.

       Its not just this administration, this has been the policy for years. If someone is detained/awaiting trial, their kids arent going to sit in a cell with them - the kids aren't even being "detained" per se. They do try to find places for the kids, usually people that come illegaly have family or friends here that the kid can go with.

       Not OP that you were replying to but I tried to be a foster parent with my wife and the process is so unbelievably fucked up and impossibly hard that it’s not worth it. It’s easy to look at one half of the picture and not consider the other but OP does have a point about the kids being put into foster care. If there’s not enough foster families for the kids to go then they have to go somewhere, which is a whole other argument that I don’t feel like discussing. And not to mention that you can only apply for foster parenting in the state that you live in unless your state has partnered with another state. For example: if you live in Texas you can only foster Texas resident children. If you live in North Dakota however, you can foster South Dakota, Minnesota, and Montana resident children, but not Native American children. Not trying to argue, just tryin to bring some perspective to the conversation.

       It is it not illegal to seek Asylum in America. No laws are being broken, they did not sneak into the country. The applied for asylum at the border like you're supposed to do.

       Yes. Those are the facts. When someone tells you something you don't like you just go "No." and reject reality? These kids are Asylum seekers. The whole point of this rule is to deter asylum seekers. Seeking Asylum is not illegal. These people are supposed to be waiting for an official hearing to verify their claim of Asylum at which point they are allowed into the country. These people are not sneaking in.

       We have agents on the bridges denying entry to anyone who comes to a port of entry from stepping one single foot into the country to prevent them for seeking asylum in the "United" States of America.

       So yes many of these parents have resorted to crossing the border, which the current administration had decided to prosecute as a criminal charge, which is a new policy. Other administrations had the option, but now Jeff Sessions wants to send a message.

       And why do you think a parent would do that? Because they hate their children? Or maybe shit is so bad where they live that this seems like their only option. It's like those people in the burning world trade center jumping to their deaths. The fire forces you out because you feel like you have no choice but to jump into the unknown and see what happens.

       Playing devils advocate here, but are you saying these people who bring kids should be given a free pass and let go within our borders? If thats the case, word will get out -"Hey man, if you got your 'kids' with you while hopping the border and La Migra pulls up on you, they'll let you go cause you got kids!" - then thats going to open all sorts of doors; human traffickers will abuse this, drug cartels could abuse this to get people/drugs across, and a slew of just general people could abuse this - whether bribing someone to let them use their kid or some shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unfortunate that this shit is happening, it really is, but honestly these parents shouldn't be taking their kids across borders illegaly. What do they think is going to happen if they get busted? And not to mention how dangerous it is to cross the border illegaly, putting your kids in that kind of danger?

       I completely agree with that, but from what I've read when looking into this the kids are seperated for an extended amount of time because the illegal parents are able to submit a plea for asylum (BS in my opinion that they can do that once caught and get their application to the top of the stack). And unfortunately, getting deported isn't usually done the same day IIRC, its not a simple "judt drive them back" type deal. Which sucks

       You've been asked what your solution would be twice now and haven't answered.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one thing to just complain, but the problem is real. So what is your solution? If you are going to scream and be outraged at what someone is doing, then suggest a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you see, that's the problem: No matter what solution Trump does, the left are going to be outraged. It's what they do. There is a fricking election coming up. Have you heard ANY of these people screaming about this (despite ignoring when Obama was doing it) offer any actual solution?
      </p>
      <p>
       People get all worked up, like always, and then when the election is over, they are on to something else. Hell, next week it will be something else. Last week, it was Trump meeting a dictator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, just maybe, it's all about the elections and not really all that sincere. Maybe you are just being riled up by people that want you to get riled up. Manipulated by people that want to pull at your heartstrings for votes.

       I've never claimed to have a solution. It's not my job to have a solution - and despite you giving blame 100% to democrats, it is not solely their job either. Both sides have been a problem in this and I get why: there is no obvious solution. Immigration is hard. And it's downright impossible with the two sides can't work together and keep blaming each other.

       Sorry, there is not a mountain of evidence -- or any evidence at all -- to support the absolutely lunatic idea that the entire national media is controlled by and deliberately covering for child traffickers. Anyone who believes that is capable of believing anything. The question is why someone believes in something that has no evidence to support it.

       The page you linked didn't give me proof that Sessions started this. It says he wants a zero tolerance policy, which I can only infer to being harsh punishment of the laws in place. That seems in character.
      </p>
      <p>
       The link also states that the parents can work with HHS or ICE to contact their children via phone(24/7 ENG or SPA) or video chat.

       At most, you've made me think the situation is just being handled sloppy.

       This is bullshit propaganda. There were 90,000 illegal alien children in "detention" centers during 2014 under Obama. Why wasn't this being reported the way it is now????? The democrats are scared that they're losing their momentum so they had to send the MSM new immigration talking points.

       I’m not denying the situation is toxic. I’m just stating that it’s probably a distraction. We have killed millions of innocent people oversee in the past two decades and that’s way more toxic than this and the media is silent. The only tome they seem to actually do journalism is when it’s a distraction or a narrative.

       We're getting closer and closer to the next election so it's just time for mass spamming of bullshit to make the current president look bad. Which isn't exactly much different than what has been going on during the entire time, it's just that it'll get much worse.

       So these families have to be detained. Now the question is what to do with the kids. Send them to stay in an adult facility with grown men or women? Women would be the traditional answer. Then ask what’s the cutoff for a “child”...18? I see a lot of criticism but not a lot of solutions for the problem.

       Main reason why they allow immigration is to prevent a UNIFIED AND ARMED MAJORITY. If your an immigrant and you just came to America, last thing you want to do is stand up against the government or be a apart of any movement. This is also why they keep them illegals in a constant state of limbo, never fully legalizing but also not kicking them out. They want them to be in a perpetual state of fear, so when the people begin revolting, they will still go to work and abide by the rules. Once you look at everything from the perspective of taming the inevitable revolution, it will all begin to make perfect sense.

       They allow immigration to prevent a UNIFIED AND ARMED MAJORITY. If your an immigrant and you just came to America, last thing you want to do is stand up against your host government or be a part of any movement. This is also why they keep illegals in a constant state of limbo, never fully legalizing but also not kicking them out. They want them to be in a perpetual state of fear, so when citizens begin revolting, immigrants will still go to work and abide by the rules. This is why they want as many immigrants here as possible as the bigger the proportion, the more they can write off any movement as being a small portion of the population.

       Yes. Kidnapping is a good word.  I don't understand how people can make post after post after post about tucson, and then look at what this admistration is doing and just not give a shit, or in most cases, think it is completely justifiable.  It proves to me that these people who care so much about child trafficking truly only care about partisan politics, not about children or their suffering.

       The whole thing seems manufactured. All the ad campaigns for Father's Day were strangely positive. Not making fun of Dad for fogetting to be a basic adult or making him seem like a dunce, but very emotionally driven advertisement. It was frequent enough that it caught my eye. Cool, they're trying to make money, I get that. Then you pop on reddit and there are many anecdotal heartfelt dad stories reaching the front page. Alright, its the season, but I don't remember it being this big of deal last year or the years before that; maybe its the constant ads thats got me feeling sometype of way. Except... that video clip of the children being separated from their parents being replayed over and over again is just a black screen with a child crying out, "Daddy!" Now, I don't know whats going on here, but it feels like manipulation. Not a just a simple distraction, but emotional manipulation. There are so many questions that this boarder fiasco brings up, but its the fact that both sides (outside of the administration) are speaking out that makes me think its more than just saving face on Father's Day. Anytime they come together its to fuck us. So my questions from all of it is, "How are they trying to fuck us this time?"

       It's a 100% manufactured controversy. It's like the media has a big bingo cage roller full of topics to be upset about and pulls out a new ball anytime there is no negative news. The media could easily talk about what is happening in Arizona, or record low unemployment and high jobs numbers, but they chose to talk about the migrant children thing. They could have talked about the migrant children last week, last month, or 4 years ago. Nothing has really changed. They just all got together and decided this was going to be the big story this week. If they wanted to try and smear the president they could just as easily have all talked about "climate change" reaching a tipping point, gun crime in America, or healthcare. As the news on the economy was so good last week, they had to have negative news to cover it up. I'm guessing this next week the big news story will be "ahhh the economy is going to crash" due to Trump's tariff language, but we will see.

       Maybe so, but throwing children in cages for no reason other than them being from a different country is still wrong.  And then to turn around and use them as a bargaining tool for political gain is just unbearably terrible.

       You do realize Trump did those things right? It's not like Russian collusion or the piss parties where Donald can come out and say he didn't do it and that it's all media Bs. He fucking did this. He is separating children from thier families and sending them to concentration camps. This is no distraction, this current events.

       Maybe it is.  Although trump and sessions' "zero tolerance policy" on immigration was posted in april, from my understanding it wasn't implemented until last october.  So my question is, although what is happening woth immigrant children is horrible, why was it not known what was happening until now?  It leads me to believe that it is possibly a distraction.  Maybe.  It's hard to say it is without something to point to to say "this is what they are distracting from".
