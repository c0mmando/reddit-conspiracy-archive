       It’s been 9 months and the Las Vegas shooting has been swept under the rug. No one talks about it and there are still so many unanswered questions. So much other stuff is going on in the world that the biggest mass shooting in the United States can be forgotten about completely.

       What would have been the purpose of this being staged? Nobody appears to have gained from it, no sweeping gun laws have been introduced, the metal detectors that everyone thought would be introduced haven't been, and the media  have barely made a sound about the event since it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are sincerely looking for evidence and not just one of those people who thinks every single attack is fake, maybe you should focus your attention on local hospitals / doctors /nurses. I'm sure they would know if there were lots of real gunshot wounds.

       I think the lack of bullet holes in the event tents is suspicious, but doesn't prove that the shooting was fake (IMO it proves that a marksman did this, not an alcoholic gambler with an AR w/ bump stock &amp; scope). If the deep state pulled this off, they aren't going to not kill people! Let's get real. Why fake a shooting when doing it for real is easier. Evidence? There was a bullet hole in that fuel tank. There was pictures of blood splattered sidewalks  There was at least one guy interacting with a cop who seemed to be shot in the chest and ribs. There's lifeless bodies laying in front of the stage. There's plenty of audio signatures on videos taken from various angles that are consistent with gunfire in tandem with ricochet. Just because the news uses actors posing as victims doesn't mean the event didn't happen. The news has always done that and always will.

       I just attempted to copy and paste from one of my prior comments where I addressed this issue, but accidentally deleted it instead, so it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway the point is that the idea that it’s “easier” to wantonly mass murder a bunch of people than simply to stage a shooter drill and simulate victim interviews on the news is the most retarded concept anyone could actually believe, which is why I highly doubt anyone really thinks it.
      </p>
      <p>
       No offense to you. But it’s like saying it’s easier to now the yard than to stay inside and say you mowed it. There’s no evidence of anyone or anything having been shot. In an actual mass murder, there would be evidence of gruesome carnage, extensive damage, and healing wounds. You wouldn’t be appealing to a blemish on some random water tower to “prove” that a record-breaking mass shooting happened in front of thousands of witnesses and recording devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of the other stuff you listed is, frankly, meaningless. You can’t post any evidence of a real shooting, because there was no real shooting. “Audio signatures?” Get real man. Do you think when you hear gunfire in a movie theater that you’re actually under attack? Christ.

       There's audio from every corner of the event and it sounds real to me. This isn't anything gunshot sound FX in a movie. It's a recording of actual gunfire and there's evidence of the sounds of bullets hitting pavement. Do blanks make that sound?  There are countless people in the videos reacting to gunfire. Are you suggesting that they are all actors or what? The guy who's shot in the chest talking to a cop is a the best actor I've ever seen if that's the case. The dead bodies covered in blood? Are those actors? I don't really grasp the motive of who or why they would create a giant illusion of a mass shooting when all the elements of a real shooting are present.

       I agree with your threads asking for evidence, and then none gets provided and everyone in it resorts to personally attacking you. You bring up a very valid point in that nobody actually presents true evidence of a real shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, your lawn mowing example isn't a great one. If my girlfriend wants me to mow the lawn, and I do it, it would be asinine for her to question it. The warm lawn mower, the freshly cut grass. The clippings on the sidewalk. All evidence. If I try to stay inside and then convince her I did it, then I've got to come up with persuading reasons that explain away why the lawn mower wasn't fired up, the grass is the same length it was before, and there was no evidence of any grass being cut. That's gonna be a hell of a lot harder to do.

       There are no grass clippings with Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear with me on the analogy. But my point is that there is no good reason to think anyone or anything was shot that evening. Also it’s 100% easier, less risky, and overall simpler and preferable in every single conceivable way to stage a fake terror event rather than actually kill a bunch of randoms for no reason while leaving participants in the scam unhurt all while, again, leaving no evidence of a real shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one who has realized Vegas was a hoax thinks that government entities have reservations about killing innocent people. We just know that if/when they start doing this — for some stupid reason which endangers them and risks a chaotic failure to their plan — there will be no shortage of graphic evidence of real bullet damage and gunshot wounds that would not be squandered.

       Yeah that concept I had patience with at first, but I’ve heard so many people say it and I’ve thought about it so much that I just get pissed off at how stupid it is now.

       Like really guy, the goal is not to kill a bunch of random people. It’s gun control, or instituting metal detectors in public places, or any other number of insidious goals, but if you’re a conspirator would you rather be convicted (if you are caught) of 1st degree mass murder or staging a hoax?
      </p>
      <p>
       These people act like someone in the FBI can just snap their fingers and an MK Ultra subject is just going to go on a suicidal killing spree with no motive. It’s utterly..... stupid.

       Honestly since the shooting I have believed blackstones videos where he says people did die but that it’s adding up. Like the fact that paddocks room door to the other suite was locked from the outside after his death. Who would have had access to that. There is honestly so much and no one cares anymore

       I read a really extensive reddit post going into it that saudi hit team was there while MBS was there. Shortly after vegas attacks the saudi purge happened, but there was a more recent instance where there was gunfire at the saudi palace but he was just shown sitting next to Putin at the world cup soccer tourney

       I personally know someone who was there, live, in the concert, and he said as he was running away with everyone that the girl next to him got shot in the head and blood splattered all over him. Keep in Mind this person is a HUGE conspiracy theorist, and though he claims something fishy with the shooter and motives, he doesn’t deny that people were shot because a girls head basically exploded right next to him. So be a little bit more rational guys. Not everything is staged.

       Calm down I was just stating the facts. There is no doubt the laser experiments across the lakes are done incorrectly and as I stated there is compelling evidance that shows that the earth is not exactly as it's been described. Thats all I meant. I couldn't care less neither option impacts my life in any significant way.

       I know a handful of people from my town that went there and talked to them about it. They were too far away to see dead bodies but did hear gun shots and saw the chaos.

       A lady who lived in my town, Kelsey Meadows, was killed during the shooting. I didn’t know her personally but my parents did, as well as some coworkers and friends. It was a pretty big deal since it’s a small town.

       Seeing folks regard everything is fake or staged reflects on the state of society currently. What’s most fucked up is how there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       bullshit aspects, ‘heroes’ who never existed prior to and disappear following events. This makes sense, and can be argued the people just want privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is fucked up, but it is ALSO fucked up how many people in this country and around the world are beginning to be held responsible for fucking up.

       Life is not an ‘always’ and ‘never’ situation except to the hopeless, the deluded, and the emotional limited and unstable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Vegas....international cases are WAY more involved than simple domestic instances. Remember whom owned the floors Paddock occupied. Remember how much has been publicly convoluted, and keep in mind that while an investigation is underway, you and me and the public are welcome to expect Jack and Shit, collectively.

       Don’t know what this was about, or who this was, but without doubt the amount of time involved and the regard to upper floors (and the US owned 32). Four Seasons still owns 35-39, I believe (the local rumor is there will be a renumbering of floors, and perhaps a renaming of the Mandalay). Nonetheless, IF an international person of interest had any connection to this, THAT would clarify why this is not only taking so long, but also why it is all so convoluted.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have speculated (argue, scream, speculate - no one knows but tempers and attitudes flare) it was Saudi, Israeli, or ‘other’ (I’ve read some outlandish shit).
      </p>
      <p>
       Attack on US soil - connective to Saudi-owned land. 
Were Paddock a paid (foreign) agent, well....

      <p>
       You and I will both be surprised if ANY fact is shared publicly any time soon. Not unlike 9/11, it is highly probably there are key people awful high up and connected in ways which we conspiracy-thinkin folk cannot really imagine. We can and will speculate, but we are stuck with logic and what we can see/read/experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       That which we are unable to imagine, we are unable to consider and - therefore - unable to consciously articulate, prepare, nor propagate. The higher this goes, we are essentially throwing paper wads into the wind...

       I lived through 9/11 as an adult, and the Vegas shooting reminds me of it in many ways. The official narrative is immediately and forcefully shoved down our throats, all other narratives are dismissed or gagged, and we are told to pay attention to other things.

       What would have been the purpose of this being staged? Nobody appears to have gained from it, no sweeping gun laws have been introduced, the metal detectors that everyone thought would be introduced haven't been, and the media  have barely made a sound about the event since it happened.

       If you are sincerely looking for evidence and not just one of those people who thinks every single attack is fake, maybe you should focus your attention on local hospitals / doctors /nurses. I'm sure they would know if there were lots of real gunshot wounds.

       I think the lack of bullet holes in the event tents is suspicious, but doesn't prove that the shooting was fake (IMO it proves that a marksman did this, not an alcoholic gambler with an AR w/ bump stock &amp; scope). If the deep state pulled this off, they aren't going to not kill people! Let's get real. Why fake a shooting when doing it for real is easier. Evidence? There was a bullet hole in that fuel tank. There was pictures of blood splattered sidewalks  There was at least one guy interacting with a cop who seemed to be shot in the chest and ribs. There's lifeless bodies laying in front of the stage. There's plenty of audio signatures on videos taken from various angles that are consistent with gunfire in tandem with ricochet. Just because the news uses actors posing as victims doesn't mean the event didn't happen. The news has always done that and always will.
