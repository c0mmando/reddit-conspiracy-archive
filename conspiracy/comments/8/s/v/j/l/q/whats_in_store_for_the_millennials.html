       Our generation might see some serious shit, so I was thinking a bit of commiseration would be in order.  What do you see happening in the next few decades, and how are you preparing it?  Or, better yet, how are you trying to reform the system?

       I'm not a millennial, and I think they get a bad rap.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they are way more thoughtful than preceeding generations. They are also exposed to a great deal less television, which has been the primary vehicle for disinfo and brainwashing in the past. They save money, avoid credit, are miles less wasteful, and highly adapted to universal instantaneous communication. They reject a lot of the negative norms many of us normal people have become accustomed to. I think it will be a highly experimental generation, wildly creative, sort of like an improved version of the children of the 60s. There will be good and bad ideas, but I think most will be good, and at the very least well meaning. Mistakes need to be made to learn, and I have to say I am way less afraid of their mistakes than those of my generation, and ffs the baby boomers before mine? Can't wait for that cancer to get out of power and into convalescent homes. They are traitors to their own youthful ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The caveat is what I see as a general weakness, a loss of ruggedness. Their helicopter parents protected them so hard, their sensitivity is turned up to 11. They think the world shouldn't be
       <em>
        allowed
       </em>
       to hurt them. There needs to be some balance, the world can't be perfect and safe for everyone at the same time. The world is not safe, at all. I grew up on steel playground equipment. If I fell, I broke shit. These kind of basic lessons were removed from the millenial experience. But, I think as they grow up this lack will be tempered by experience.

       Just speaking for myself... I was raised in the nineties by a "so fucking what" attitude. Other than my ego and feeding said ego I honestly couldn't truly give a shot less about anyone else on this planet save my immediate family. I pray for zombies every morning and wistfully hope for the collapse of modern society. I'm fairly certain that this doesn't apply just to myself though. I think in light of this revelation you should be asking how far millenials are willing to go satisfy our image need to watch things burn...

       Those who came of age in the late 1990's had it good for a few years. They got to know and expect both economic and social improvements. Then a certain 5-4 court decided to stop a vote count and install a royal son into the White House and things went from the brightest light of day to a dark night.

       Something like this has been bouncing around my head for awhile. The millenials as lazy idiots meme is bullshit, and probably created by TPTB out of fear. My kid sisters are millenials, as are all their friends, and a smarter more hard working bunch would be hard to find.

       I think you're spot on. Most millenials just want a fair chance. We value our civil liberties, and as a whole we distrust the state. It seems to me as if there is a big target on the backs of millenials by those in power, and everything is being done to divide us and get us to judge and criticize each other's beliefs.

       You are exactly right. The power you guys have in communication of ideas is terrifying to the dinosaurs. Your facility with tech even more so. You are the great unknown to them. And lack of TV leaves no traditional attack surface on your minds.

       I agree with this a lot, though I think missing a component. I’m a millennial and I think my generation has a strong sense of justice and fairness. We’re idealists - we see something wrong and we think we can do something about it. if we just holler loudly enough, if we throw a temper tantrum, it’ll be fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad truth though is that life isn’t always fair and this world isn’t always just. And what happens when idealists get worn down by reality? They become cynics. That’s where I feel my generation is starting to head. They’re losing hope and getting cynical and tuning out with memes and Instagram. At least that’s what I feel I am seeing in my small corner of the world.

       I agree with you, and idealism often leads to cynicism. But cynicism isn't a permanent condition either, just another stepping stone on the path to realism and wisdom. Not everyone makes it there though. And cynics are those who
       <em>
        care
       </em>
       . You can't have a shitty attitude about something you don't care about.
      </p>
      <p>
       And justice...well I didn't mention it on purpose. I don't like the old school idea of "justice" (lock everyone up who does things differently), anymore than I like this new incarnation,
       <em>
        social
       </em>
       justice. I actually think yhe whole social justice movement was created by a malicious group to further divide our society. And I am sincerely hoping that this bizarre cultural phenomenon is one of those things tempered by experience.

       I am a millennial and I am WTFing @ your post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Save money and avoid credit? Are you kidding? 68% of millennials have $0 in retirement savings and are unable to afford an emergency payment more than $400. Of millennials that save for retirement, the average savings is around $70000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millennials are saddled with the most college loan debt of any generation. Many have useless degrees that can't get them jobs that even make a living wage. They are also dating less, having fewer children, and just trying to keep their head above the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millennials are too distracted just trying to make ends meet to ever become any threat to The System. They can't afford to buy houses or have children. They can't participate in the economy in the way the world needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as we have Feminism pushing this anti-male agenda, we see the downfall of monogamy. Less marriage, less loyalty, less children means more Millennial Males attempting and completing Suicide while the women use the last of their good looks in their mid thirties to lap up the cum off the cocks of the few millennial men who still have testosterone, were born over 6 feet tall due to not being exposed to toxic chemicals, and who actually have money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millennials are going to be the loneliest generation with the highest suicide rates.

       Th environment is fkced.  Plastics are working their way up the food chain.  Methane hydrates are starting to cook off.  Coral reefs are dying
       <em>

       .  The oceans in general are sick.  And apparently some jackasses somewhere in China have been pumping out CFC's for a few years.  Fracking and extraction industries are polluting groundwater everywhere.  Few rivers or waterways are free of farm run-off.  And even with all the cancer-causing herbicides
       <em>
        (that are showing up in beer. BEEER!! is nothing sacred?)

       and fertilizer, over the past ~15 years, nutritional yields in most crops have fallen.  The dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific off OR/WA aren't getting smaller.  Gulf of Mexico hasn't come close to recovering from the British Petroleum spill.  People's toxic load is getting higher and higher as the water, air and soil become more saturated with chemical run-off and factory emissions that precipitate out.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everybody on the planet disappeared right now, there would be a layer of strata with as unique a chemical signature as that of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_boundary">
        K-Pg boundary layer,

       except the meteor was us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate change is happening, whether one wants to say its humans or not.  We have no idea how the weather patterns will settle out.  If the Gulf Stream craps out, say goodbye to temperate Europe.  Geographically, what crops a region will support is changing.  People are going to migrate.  Warmer weather means more opportunity for viruses to mutate and disease to spread.  The rise in temps in US over the past 10 years has led to an increase in the tick population.  Even without pre-historic viruses released from melting permafrost and glaciers, who knows what mutations are waiting to happen in all the battlefields where there is spent depleted uranium rounds, or the water we've been dumping our meds and peeing gigatons of caffeine into.  Mussels in Puget Sound have measurable levels of Oxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's not including human capacity for violence or even just really big mistakes.  The weaponry available for the average infantryman has gotten crazy.  Our desire to kill synergized with our manufacturing skills.  Genetic engineering is at the stage where ham radio and electronics was in the '50's: accessible to pretty much anyone with 50$.  There's well-meaning bio-hackers paving the road to hell via experiments in their kitchen and on themselves.  Imagine what the not-so-well-meaning bio-hackers are paving the road with.  And then, of course, there's the nuclear stockpiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your ancestors mostly had a good run but, since nobody wants to sacrifice their own personal comforts or conveniences to ensure the survival of the species there's no political will for genuine solutions and all the world's societies are going to keep mucking about with the strange attractors that stabilized into the system we humans took millions of years to evolve in.

       Millennials are fine. It's the Gen Z I'm worried about. With that said, I'm concerned that AI and automation will take away many labor and service industry jobs. The programs and robotics replacing these jobs are so advanced and technical, "retraining" these people to work on these machines and programs will not be possible. The industrial revolution replaced a lot of labor but created the service industry. Advertisement, marketing, accounting, satellite industries, but with this new paradigm shift AI is going to bring the economy, I just dont see people really finding a place in the work force for it. All I can think of is jobs that involve extreme dexterity, like plumbers and electricians, will be safe. It will be a very, very long time until robots can do tasks like that.
