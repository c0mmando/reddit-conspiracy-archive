<ol>
<li><p>Quantitative easing allows the Federal Reserve to purchase corporate debt.  </p></li>
<li><p>This causes required yields on corporate bonds to fall.</p></li>
<li><p>This causes corporations to issue more debt.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>GE is too diversified now.  They got clobbered in 08 because of GE Capital (mortgages etc).  Nobody is loyal to GE appliances anymore (although they are very reliable).  Their aerospace used to be huge, now meh.  Their energy os down with the rest of the energy sector.  In short, GE is not a barometer for defense MIC anymore IMO.  I&#39;ll have to read up on the recent slide (I believe it was $12 during the low of the recession so interesting).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama happened...... He expanded wars, paved the way for russia, syria and iran hate etc. Basically, they got their men into the gov, so their production portfolios got interest, since they had shit to make. </p>

<p>Notice how trump was lnt planned, and how its been all tipsy turny every since, with the corporate media saying one thing (but always being pro war), and the gov being devided(somewhat), thats because trump wasnt their man, hillary was. So the corporate media went ahead with their fear mongering and enemy consent manufacturing from day one. Because remember trump.promised to bring the boys back home. Obama may have promised the same, but we all know he was their guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it was a matter of corporate perception of the president. In 2008, major corporations were terrified that Obama would actually deliver on his populist rhetoric and his promises of sweeping political/corporate reforms. They, like most Americans, really believed he was an outsider and he would drastically change the system and end the foreign wars and downsize the military, invest heavily in renewable green energies, you know all the things that he ran on, that people really thought would be his platform.</p>

<p>I can speak to this first hand. In 2008 I worked for a major corporation at one of it&#39;s smaller sales sites outside of Atlanta. We had a small site, but we were breaking sales records. Our boss told us that if Barack got elected, they would likely shut our site down. We were doing so well and making so much money for the company, I didnt believe him, but thats exactly what happened. We all got laid off the VERY DAY Obama was inaugurated in 2009.</p>

<p>This taught me a lesson, that regardless of what the president actually does, the perception of what he MIGHT do factors in very heavily to corporations as they set budgets and hiring projections and establish 5 and 10 year plans. If you look back at many of the business journals at the time, you will see that by 2009-2011, almost all the major corporations had all-time high record cash reserves. There was a lot of regulatory / economic uncertainty, so instead of investing it back into the economy, or into hiring employees, many corporations just sat on their cash to feel the situation out. They expected massive corporate tax increases, closing of corporate tax loopholes and strong regulatory reform, because these were the things Obama ran on and specifically promised.</p>

<p>By the end of Obama&#39;s 1st term, it became apparent that he wasnt going to do ANY of the things he had promised, and in fact once he got into office, he was actually even more of a wall-street puppet  than Bush. Once the major corporations realized Obama would be their guy, there was enormous sigh of relief and this resulted in a huge influx of those cash reserves back into the economy and big companies began hiring again en masse.</p>

<p>Obama was a very eloquent speaker, a damn good actor, and he literally came out of nowhere. He was seen as the wildcard we all needed. The idea was doing shit the same way for generations got us into this, so we need an entirely different approach. He knew exactly what the people wanted to hear. There was a lot of anger towards major corporations and corporate greed at the time was seen (accurately) as one of the biggest problems in the country. The madeoff scandal was just being exposed, and people still had Enron fresh in their minds.</p>

<p>Now here comes the first black president with a very strong mandate of hope and change and sweeping reform. He was so good  at speaking and acting people and corporations really thought he was serious. If you look back at his campaign speeches in 2008, you can see he really captured the feelings of a nation and engendered a sense of positivity and optimism at a time when confidence in government was at an all time low. But it was all just a well-crafted illusion. Everyone thought he would govern like no president had before, because he had the popular mandate to do it but it turned out he did exactly the same shit they all did. Once corporations realized it was all just rhetoric and marketing hype and he was just crafting a message to appeal to the masses, corporations began to relate to him. &quot;it was all just marketing hype, just like we do!&quot;</p>

<p>Its really an object lesson in supply side economics. Corporations are so deeply entrenched in our system and they control the day to day prosperity of Americans so tightly. If they arent happy, they can make sure no one is happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>QE3, started up September 2012. This made it so that the FED essentially bought up a bunch of federal debt with very low interest rates and increased the money supply. It&#39;s basically like being in extreme credit card debt up to your eyeballs and then someone gives you a lower interest rate credit card to cover your expenses. To outside observers it seems like you&#39;re doing well financially because, well, you&#39;re buying expensive stuff, wearing nice clothes, and driving a cool car, but the reality is that you&#39;re in a worse position than you were before. </p>

<p>Couple that with margin trading, and basically all of the market growth you&#39;ve seen since 2009 has essentially been bought with excessively loaned money which has resulted in inflated/padded prices. The market is slowing down now, and once those positions start getting liquidated on the market what will end up happening is a large portion of many publicly traded companies will become worthless, and the companies that survive will end up being mostly consolidated into ownership by big banks (mores than they are now). I&#39;m only an armchair trader, but I expect that within the next 2 years we&#39;re going to have a bigger recession than the 2008 recession.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, nailed it, but let&#39;s connect the dots a bit more:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Quantitative easing allows the Federal Reserve to purchase corporate debt.  </p></li>
<li><p>This causes required yields on corporate bonds to fall.</p></li>
<li><p>This causes corporations to issue more debt.</p></li>
<li><p>This leads to share buybacks.</p></li>
<li><p>Share buybacks result in huge nominal stock price gains (share price = equity / shares outstanding, so decreasing shares outstanding for a given equity level will increase share price)</p></li>
