       Etymology is defined as: the study of the origin of words and the way in which their meanings have changed throughout history
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted to mention that finding the origin of common words we use today without giving much though about can open doors and provide answers for truth seekers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give one example that I learned from Jordan Maxwell about the word "church." Church is derived from Kirk which is derived from Circe.
      </p>
      <p>
       KIRKE (Circe) was a goddess of sorcery who was skilled in the magic of transmutation, illusion, and necromancy. She lived on the mythical island of Aiaia (Aeaea) with her nymph companions. She was know for turning men into pigs and other animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the word church originated from a sorcerer that turned men into pigs. I wonder if the modern church has the same agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods feel free to delete this if you feel the need. I understand it's not a conspiracy but I do believe it's crucially important to understand etymology if you are looking for the truth, which is what I believe most of this sub is trying to do.

       Interesting, I've looked into this as well and have seen it related by many people. Maybe there's a conspiracy after all to obfuscate the true origin. Even if this particular example is incorrect, I still believe in it's importance. Thanks for the post.

       Even looking up money on Wikipedia it has more details than that site.  That site looks very PG13 to me.  I wonder if we look up words with known nefarious origins what that site would say...
      </p>
      <p>
       The word "money" is believed to originate from a temple of Juno, onCapitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. In the ancient world Juno was often associated with money. The temple ofJuno Moneta at Rome was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was located.[10] The name "Juno" may derive from the Etruscan goddess Uni (which means "the one", "unique", "unit", "union", "united") and "Moneta" either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).  From Wikipedia.

       Hmm good to know. I'll still check it out but I'll keep that in mind.

      <p>
       Yeah, the money system is really interesting. I still haven't figured out exactly why money and water are so connected. I'm sure you know but for example cash is called liquid, underwater on a mortgage, river banks, bail outs, etc. I asked an extremely wealthy man about it and mentioned admiralty law as a possible reason. He just laughed and said nope.

       The word Kirk comes into English from either Ireland (Christianity came into England from Ireland) or the Danelaw (when the Norse ruled the northern British Isles.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Church comes into English from France (most likely Paris since it starts with a CH, French imported from Normandy had a CA spelling) years after the Danelaw in Britian collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       To clarify the CH and CA French spellings from around 1100 ad.  2 different French words for hunt are Chase (Paris) and Catch (Normandy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapel and Cappella are both words for the physical House of worship.  We still use chapel and a chapel can in modern times be used to describe a room in a building devoted to worship.  Most hospitals have a chapel.  Cappella still exists in our language in the word Acapella. The first Acapella music was chanting monks.  It was a form of religious, not secular music without instruments.

       You should look into the Tyndale translation of the Bible.  It predates the King James and was translated from the Greek instead of Latin.  The gospels were written in Greek.  The phrase Alpha and Omega was kept in the Latin Bible since the letter Omega was added to Greek alphabet after that alphabet migrated from Greece to the  Etruscans to Rome.  Omega was a unique word, letter and concept related to Greece.    I feel I should point out the word alphabet comes from the first 2 letters of the Greek letter system,. Alpha Beta = alphabet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tyndale didn't think the word church s used by the apostle Paul meant a building with a hierarchy ie a church with priests.  He believed Paul was speaking of a fellowship, just a gathering of believers. Mattew 18:20 states whenever 2 or more believers gather Jesus will be there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm rather rusty on this topic but IIRC Tyndale believed cicre was cognate with circle, when Jesus or Paul preached the crowds would gather in a circular shape.

       if you're interested in this, find some Jordan Maxwell interviews. he discusses etymology and word-play used by governments and the elites throughout history (such as why Capitol Hill is called "Capitol Hill", and why we call banks "banks").

       Thanks. Yeah, Jordan was one of the first guys that got me interested in alt history. Im a big fan of his work. I'll make a suggestion back to you: Michael Tsarion. IMO hes one of the top guys in the business. Extremely knowledgeable and thorough. Definitely worth your time if you haven't heard of already.

       I suggest delving DEEPLY into the occult world before you begin to study etymology. In that etymology itself is one the MOST powerful tools in any occultists (see lied) tool box. For instance what exactly DOES apocalypse mean? And can we please finally have one?!

       Great advice. Researching occult knowledge/rituals/symbolism should be mandatory for anyone trying to figure out how this big game works. If anyone denies the importance of occult they have no chance in finding truth. I've always believed that the apocalypse means an unveiling (of knowledge.) It's not about raining fire and the Earth cracking I'm half.  I'm sure you'll tell me I'm wrong now though lol.

       You are precisely  correct.  Apocalypse is a complete,  full revealing of that which is hidden. The occult translates to that which is hidden. One can never hope to know the truth without learning to wade through the deception.  I suggest you with Crowley's book of Thoth for insight into correlation. From there his "book of the law" is a wonderful representation of the processes by which we are commonly duped.  Further I suggest you study Michael Aquino. Ask yourself how a standing satanist became a 3 star general.

       The problem is the "root" of most etymology can be entirely made up or at least heavily shaded by the sensibilities of the presenter. Much like history itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about as useful has astrology or tarot cards.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can invent all sorts of shit. And just think about how much different claims are today than the true reality of what's going on. And people living and breathing today believe the shit (women believe they're oppressed, and men are all predators out to rape them, and that we're giving up our liberty for protection).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now recognize how much the lens of history is going to distort that, then imagine how much a fallible person with an agenda is going to distort that, and so on and so forth.

       I understand where you're coming from. The hardest red pill to swallow is that no one can be 100% certain of anything. You can't even trust your own eyes. Eyewitness testimony is constantly incorrect. Almost everything we accept as truth is hearsay. We really know absolutely nothing. Science is constantly being tweaked because earlier conclusions were incorrect. Nothing is 100% true and correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with everything, we simply do the best we can with the information available at the time. We must also openly admit that we could be wrong and be willing to change our opinions/beliefs if more information becomes available.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, you're not wrong but you have to admit that it's fun thinking about the unknown and all the other amazing things in the world we've all been dropped in. Or maybe not, there's no wrong answer.

       I actually love the study of etymology however it's worth noting words do not have meaning they have usage.  There are a great many words with multiple usages depending on time place people etc.  Just because a word was used to convey one idea hundreds of years ago may be meaningless today.

       Absolutely correct. Letters like Y and J are often interchangeable, meanings evolve and things get mucky. With that said and it's just my opinion obviously, I still think to there is value in trying to go back as far as we possibly can to get a better understanding of how words are used today. If it's a miss, whatever, it's worth a shot.

       Like I said I live the study.  I think it's important in understanding language and social evolution.  I just think the origins of the word church for example are meaningless for telling us how the word is used today.

       Fair enough. I get ya. What about a word like Aryan? Most believe it means Hitler's wet dream of the superior race with blonde and blue features.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my research (which could be wrong) I've found that its actually means "A person whose goal is spiritual advancement. He truly knows the value of life and has a civilization based on spiritual realization" or "the exalted or noble one; exalt, lofty, shining, glory"
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm getting at is that words have been hijacked and distorted much like the swastika. Was this intentional? I believe the ancient civilizations had sacred knowledge. I think we need to reclaim this knowledge and use it to our advantage, whatever that might be.

       Thomas Hobb's once said, human judgement is distorted by self interest and can easily be swayed by rhetoric that is often not in the public good nor the individual good.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said Aryan can also refer to a Christian splinter group in early church history.  Around the fourth century.
