NYC holds many agencies, management companies, production studios, etc. not sure how many were housed in the towers, as they seemed to be more business type buildings, but NYC (along with LA, and to a lesser degree Nashville &amp; Toronto) is in the top for hot beds for celebrities at any given time. Models, actresses, sports players, photographers, producers, directors, writers, musicians, broadway stars, playwrites,
Composers. I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if NYC beats out LA for the hotbed of celebrities on any given day considering how compacted Manhattan is. </p>
