        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I&#39;ve heard of connections that the Grateful Dead had with possible CIA people, and heard some theories of them using LSD and other drugs as social engineering experiments. I met a guy in rehab years ago who toured with the dead and said they were all about devil worship.
I understand the implications of Sex, Drugs,and rock and roll, and that self indulgence and aggrandizement is akin to, if not the modus operandi of much of satanism.
As you may know, the Grateful Dead originated in Palo Alto, California in the mid 1960&#39;s.
They were friends with many influential people, such as Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, various authors and beatnik poets/artists etc..
Kesey originally tries LSD as part of university testing, (i believe it was CIA sponsored through a university, correct me if I&#39;m wrong but that&#39;s what i believe Tom Wolfe and Kesey himself stated) and was so impressed,( possibly pressured??) to go around the country doing Acid tests with the Merry Pranksters with the Grateful Dead as music along with all sorts of lights and strange audio and visual and other artistic creative endeavors by the testers and testes.
You can read all about that in Wolfe&#39;s book, the Electric Koolaid Acid Test.</p>

<p>I, myself, do not believe that they all had bad intentions when doing this and later throughout their touring, and i personally have done tons of LSD, mushrooms, DMT, various other psychedelics and other narcotic substances and of course cannabis, but i no longer do hard drugs anymore as it is not conducive to my situation, although i will still take psychedelics when i feel, i do not abuse them and take them in a spiritual manner. I cannot smoke cannabis or do anything else for the time being. Drugs, with all situations that i have ended up in, good and bad alike, have really helped me to grow and learn, I have been on top of the world growing medical cannabis commercially making crazy money, and I&#39;ve been a hitchhiking Dharma bum dirty kid on and off the streets for almost 8 years, with breaks here and there in between up in the mountains and other places, been to 45 states etc...</p>

<p>Anyway back onto the topic,
I know that Bob Weir was the adopted black sheep of the family involved with the governement/military, and that he has officially  been to Bohemian Grove in the later years of his life, maybe for longer. I also saw somewhere an article that mentioned documents stating that the Grateful Dead were CIA assets.
The Grateful Dead&#39;s album covers, as well as some songs have many occult symbols and references, as well as how their name can be taken depending on how you look at it, optimistically or otherwise, since we create our own reality to an extent, many things are left up to us to decide.
We can choose to look for the Gold (grey) in between black and white, or choose to focus on one aspect more than another. Hence, the middle path, or narrow path many teachers, prophets etc.. Have talked about over the years.</p>

<p>I made this post to have a discussion and to see if anyone had any further information they could point me to, that isn&#39;t some dudes on youtube who simply choose to look at the negative possible aspects of tbe Grateful Deads work throughout the years, and refuse to accept the possible aspect that maybe they all did not have nefarious intents. I am a firm believer of Love, and that as a species we will not evolve further until we all just come out, accept each other and responsibility for our actions, and maybe then send all the psychopaths to an island or out into space or something.
I want to believe that it is a possibility that they, or perhaps individuals within the band, knew what they were doing, but they took the bad along with the good because of the incredible power that LSD and other drugs can have to help people awaken, and how people touring and meeting like minded people all over the country could help change the world for good, along with the bad. Perhaps Jerry was such a bad heroin addict, not just because heroin feels amazing and because he was a rock star who toured for 30+ years, but because he knew the negative aspects of his or others&#39; within the band&#39;s actions, and was numbing himself? Just speculation, but....</p>

<p>Any discussion is welcome but, please, as i expect you to have already since you are here on Conspiracy, keep an open mind.</p>

<p>TLDR... Is it possible that the Grateful Dead were CIA or other government assets with nefarious intentions, or were they aware of the duality of nature and just on a mission to spread music, peace and love where available?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never heard anything relating GD to the CIA or anything. Not saying this isn&#39;t a possibility, just I have nothing to add. It honestly wouldn&#39;t surprise me. But my curiosity is certainly piqued. </p>

<p>Tom Wolfe is in my top 5 american literature authors. Loved <em>Electric Koolaid Acid Test</em>. I read one by him called <em>A Man in Full</em> the other day, hadn&#39;t heard of it...but it was surprisingly fantastic. Had me in tears laughing a couple times haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have heard this for years, and I am not convinced they are. I do find it strange they went to Bohemian Grove. However they have been in some trouble with the law and it would seem if they were working for the CIA this wouldn&#39;t happen.  </p>

<p>I really just think they were in the right place at the right time and became responsible for creating a sub culture that will out live them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really see a lot of occult symbology with them. Maybe you could point some things out you have noticed?  Most of the time it is pretty blatant. They remain mostly positive forces even today. Probably the worst it got was when jerry was addicted to heroine really bad. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t take a Dead Heads word on them being Satanic though.  A lot of those guys just spew whatever pops into their heads without a second thought. Maybe they were tempted for a while by the powers that be after they proved themselves to be worthy?  Hence Bohemian Grove?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya there, i know to take a anyone&#39;s statement with a grain of salt, even i do take heed with what they are saying. 
I have met many people whilst traveling that followed them for years, and although i haven&#39;t always listened to them, i&#39;ve always been rather awake, aware, and &quot;on the bus&quot;.
You can look their album names and covers, the skulls, the roses,   the skeletons, the allusions to many folk tales and fables throughout Robert Hunters lyrics(although i personally don&#39;t think he is a bad one, i just think he is aware of the beautiful duality i mentioned previously in the post).
Moreso when you read Bob Weirs lyrics to songs such as &quot;Hell in a Bucket&quot; and there&#39;s a few others, i have the complete annotated Grateful Dead lyric book, I&#39;ll have to look at it to find more examples. I have it with me, I&#39;m here at the hospital with my wife, we&#39;re about to have our first child, a son, I&#39;m excited.
Anyway I&#39;ll be posting more soon, stay tuned.
Thanks for your input!</p>

<p>There are some interesting lyrics and the symbolism is totally there to a degree. That with there location and time when starting the band(height in the 60&#39;s) as well as the friends that hung out at 710 I am sure it could get pretty occulty quick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a HUGE deadhead...that being said I cant help but think about the connection to satanism and the letter people. I am not so sure about BG but the moloch altar is quite suspicious and the cremation of care ceremony is minimized by those that attend but its also very secretive too so who knows if the GD has this connection but I would LIKE TO THINK NOT. However my thinking ISNT FACTS at all times so there is that. Peace yall!!</p>

<p>the cremation of care </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation_of_Care">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation_of_Care</a></p>

<p>Wait this is just a play about... bioethics and the myth of Care? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As Care (Cura) was crossing a river, she thoughtfully picked up              some mud and began to fashion a human being. While she was pondering              what she had done, Jupiter came along. (<em>Jupiter was the founder              of Olympian society, a society of the major gods and goddesses who              inhabited Mount Olympus after most of the gods had already              appeared.</em>) Care asked him to give the spirit of life to the              human being, and Jupiter readily granted this. Care wanted to name              the human after herself, but Jupiter insisted that his name should              be given to the human instead. While Care and Jupiter were arguing,              Terra arose and said that the human being should be named after her,              since she had given her own body. (<em>Terra, or Earth, the original              life force of the earth, guided Jupiter&#39;s rise to power.</em>)              Finally, all three disputants accepted Saturn as judge. (<em>Known              for his devotion to fairness and equality, Saturn was the son of              Terra and the father of Jupiter.</em>) Saturn decided that Jupiter,              who gave spirit to the human, would take back its soul after death;              and since Terra had offered her body to the human, she should              receive it back after death. But, said Saturn, &quot;Since Care first              fashioned the human being, let her have and hold it as long as it              lives.&quot; Finally, Jupiter said, &quot;Let it be called <em>homo</em>              (<em>Latin for human being</em>), since it seems to be made from              <em>humus</em> (<em>Latin for earth</em>)&quot; (see Grant, 1960; Shklar,              1972).                </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off I want to say I am a &quot;dead head&quot; or at least somewhat born into the culture, had a stepdad who did some of their most famous artwork, was even brought to a show in 94 and 95 right before jerry passed, I was four years old for the latter. Ive always appreciated their style and free spirit, very different than most other popular music. On the other hand after learning about the occult independently of the Dead it took me a long time to admit that yes their symbology matches occult symbology to the dot. Simply undeniable, and when you look at what a cult like following they have created, and the destructive nature of much of the lifestyles they lead, the reoccuring symbolism starts making more sense. Their three most common symbols are The lightning strike, The skull, and the rose. You cant get much more occultic than that. My familiarity with the occult leads me to believe its not all bad. There are aspects of it that are sound. Many core tenants of say hermetic philisophy are higher truths. I believe in a way this is the power they hold over us. Knowledge of reality and how to position themselves in a way to control the lower realms. I also believe them being in this position allows them to harness and tap into spiritual realms and such to create great art and music. Art is expression. Who would be in a better position to not only tap into the collectives subconscious and create something they can connect to. But also allows them to in a sense, provided they adhere to the laws they practice, steer humanity in a direction they want. Do I think the band members were aware of this influence? I am unsure, but in my mind I think many of these artists and musicians controlled by the occult, are maybe discovered by these groups as having a special talent of say music. They are then given means drugs, ceremonies rituals, knowledge, to give them the extra edge they need to get to the top. Meanwhile these musicians may still have good intentions. But to the secret societies they have become assets. Tools to be used to fit certain peoples agenda. Lets not forget Robert Hunter their main song writer and one who turned the band on to LSD just like Ken Kesey and Charlie Manson for that matter, were all subjects to cia program Mk ultra</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your contributions, i believe those two guys are the ones i was speaking of, they seem intelligent but i did have to call bullshit on some of what they were discuagain, but i can&#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water, I suppose.
I&#39;ll have to dig through it more after this baby comes.
And Zane is a nice guy, i have a bunch of friends that have chilled with him at shows and festivals, and i considered buying some blotter art years ago when i was about 14 haha.
I have friends who are from Oregon and are friends of Zane and Sunshine and others.
I think it&#39;s debatable whether or not all of their intentions were clear, or if it was a deal where someone was like &quot;hey, we&#39;ll give you all this LSD pass it around&quot; or if they were just turned onto it and went from there.
I know the great Owlsley became their sound engineer for some time, so i think some things are obvious.
Look forward to digging deeper, thanks again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you and misvanjieee are so keen on Owsley, the far right-winger, let&#39;s look into his CIA connections :-) -- although plenty of liberals are in the CIA too.</p>

<p>Short quotes from John Potash&#39;s excellent book <strong><em>Drugs As Weapons Against Us:</em></strong></p>

<p>&quot;....key people appeared to push Kesey&#39;s and the Merry Pranksters&#39; LSD promotion.  Augustus Owsley Stanley III (best known as Owsley) came from a wealthy and powerful Kentucky &quot;blue blood&quot; family....his grandfather was a governor and then a U.S. Senator from Kentucky.  Owsley had dropped out of the University of Virginia while studying engineering.  In 1958, at the age of 21, he enlisted in the Air Force and served for 18 months.  His behavior afterwards suggests he did continuing undercover work for Air Force intelligence and MK-Ultra....[Sorry, I&#39;m skipping some stuff here]....Owsley began manufacturing mass quantities of LSD in 1963.&quot; [End Quote]</p>

<p>After Ken Kesey stopped working at a San Francisco-area hospital that was conducting CIA-funded MK-Ultra LSD studies, Kesey began getting lots of his LSD from Owsley (for the Kool Aid Acid test events -- the first raves I guess).</p>

<p>I&#39;m skipping lots more stuff here to jump a few pages forward.</p>

<p>[Quote]
&quot;At the nearby UC-Berkeley campus, students were organizing and protesting as part of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement.  Clearly, during two of the biggest leftist mobilization of students, the civil rights Freedom Summer and the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, MK-Ultra-linked LSD promoters worked hard to spread the drug amongst them.  U.S. intelligence had already launched FBI Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro) tactics against Marting Luterh King Jr. and the civil rights movement in the South.  The CIA&#39;s Operation Chaos joined the FBI&#39;s Cointelpro targeting.  Also, MK-Ultra was extremely active at Stanford University, 40 miles south of Berkeley.</p>

<p>&quot;Student accounts of the Free Speech Movement at Cal-Berkeley suggest that certain Merry Pranksters targeted the radical leftists of Berkeley&#39;s campus.  For example, Denise Kaufman described how she had just enrolled at Berkeley when she....&quot;[End quote].  </p>

<p>[Quote from John Potash&#39;s book <strong><em>Drugs As Weapons Against Us]</em></strong>
&quot;Owsley had teamed up with William Mellon Hitchcock as early as 1964.  Billy Hitchcock&#39;s Mellon family, as described earlier, was one of the country&#39;s wealthiest families who held many U.S. intelligence posts.  Hitchcock provided unlimited financial and technological resources to the band The Grateful Dead.&quot;</p>

<p>and they distrubute fake drugs that are really more like ghb or some truth serum but would fool most people.  then they bait people into crimes, mostly to see if old guys will attack younger women/girls but also there will be campfire circles that a provocateur will interrupt with profanity to see if one of the guys will try to fight him or something like that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would hardly call a band that toured as much as the Grateful Dead lazy. Lets not forget the time they spent in the studio as well though they really didnt like doing so and were almost sued in fact to finish albums there was time spent to make many albums: again not lazy. It may have appeared to be lazy hippy life but that was obvious propaganda and posturing in appearance for their audience that worked in their very well oiled machine that gave many people jobs (and still do a few in Marin and on tour). But certainly not lazy. Poor Jerry wasnt the healthiest of fat men and he still managed to do what he did best for a great many years. I feel in my heart of hearts that it was actually recovery and detoxing in an inexperienced facility that killed Jerry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe lazy is the wrong word</p>

<p>they are the perfect example of an artistic project that speaks of wonderful things but sits comfortably inside a box, and that box ends up like a flag that draws people to it that are then manipulated and put at risk.  </p>

<p>&#39;come to the festival of peace and love and good vibes and hang with jerry and friends with tie die and dancing bears&#39; </p>

<p>this spider stuff is what pisses me off</p>

<p>watch a grateful dead show from 1969, then watch one in 1980, it&#39;s like watching mannequins in comparison.  their stuff has a lot of heart but they are playing the same stuff for like 40 years and it is only intermediate level difficulty.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great topic. I have become increasing suspicious of all things psychadelia. It seems this entire movement was not merely co-opted by the CIA, but there are some interesting theories which suggest it was actually created by the CIA. All these random drug using hippies were given disproportionate media attention and were submitted for mass consumption to the populous. But why?</p>

<p>You have to remember there was an enormous population (baby boomers) who all were going through the same phases of youthful rebelliousness at the exact same time. It seems this entire movement of psychadelic &#39;counter culture&#39; was manufactured to appease them and give them something to latch onto that was at least somewhat predictable and controllable.</p>

<p>Think of it like a &#39;controlled burn.&#39; In forestry they do controlled burns to burn up all the underbrush of the forest in a controlled manner. If they dont, it will eventually catch fire anyway in a less controlled situation where it could spread and become catastrophic. Now apply this metaphor to popular culture. There were potentially volatile elements in the country as the massive post ww2 baby population came of age all at the exact same time. They were all questioning authority like all kids do at that age, but they made up such a huge bulk of the populous. They needed something to latch on to lest they become radicalized and potentially dangerous. Popular culture provided that.</p>

<p>I look at old Life magazine articles of the &#39;merry pranksters&#39; and wonder to myself why a bunch of loser ass hippies riding around the country in a bus was worthy of national media attention. It&#39;s similar to the popular culture distractions that happen today through reality TV and such. But at that time the stakes may have been even higher with so many assassinations, riots, civil rights movement, cold war nuclear threats, vietnam protests, the country could have quickly gone to shit if the wrong things gained influence. Hippies, free love and acid served as a very convenient distraction for all of this. Keep in mind surveillance wasnt as sophisticated as it is now, and police and weaponry were still somewhat archaic. Unlike now, a massive violent popular uprising was a real potential threat.</p>

<p>We know that the CIA experimented with acid directly on our troops. If you start looking at the names and the geography, it all seems to point to palo alto, and stanford university as well. Experimental psychology theories were really taking hold and becoming popular at this time. </p>

<p>The merry pranksters and Timothy Leary, mr acid himself, had CIA funding and CIA ties. Leary has an incredibly sketchy past. He was no regular hippie. He served at the Army Specialized Training Center and was involved in Psy Ops, and recieved 4 medals. He popularized Acid more than any single man.</p>

<p>Someone was paying him to go around the country and popularize acid and the media was covering his every move extensively. For a few years in the late 60&#39;s acid was legal and he openly promoted and distributed it. He coupled his acid popularizations with a heavy dose of new age and occult symbolism and philosophies, which also really took hold and were popularized in the 60&#39;s like never before.</p>

<p>He was portrayed by Nixon as public enemy #1 and was even the plaintiff in the case that declared the marijuana tax act unconstitutional, which of course led to the controlled substance act we still have today. All this is just too coincidental to be authentic and stinks of a greater strategy that was being played out on a national stage for all to see.</p>

<p>Now as for the greatful dead, they were the official band of Leary&#39;s &#39;human be ins&#39; which were held quite famously at Golden Gate park in 1967, &quot;the summer of love.&quot; And all these strange characters with questionable pasts and psy ops and military ties, were all in the same place at the same time introducing their new philosophies to the public and being unusually documented by media, especially for some random drug taking musicians. The dead provided the soundtrack for the world famous &quot;Electric kool aid acid tests.&quot;</p>

<p>This was all presented as a spontaneous grass roots movement of peace and love and just feeling good, but theres a lot to suggest there was concerted strategy behind a lot of this.</p>

<p>And of course the dead were there through all of it. This only scratches the surface, but personally looking at all the occult imagery and symbolism they used in their lyrics an their music, as well as their close affiliation with Leary and his past, leads me to question the authenticity and innocence of the entire hippy movement. </p>

<p>But of course they werent alone. The beatles, probably the most famous band in world history also popularized psychedelics extensively. </p>

<p>It really takes a critical mind to analyze the youth culture of the 60&#39;s. These things are so deeply ingrained in popular culture that most people just take them at face value and few people question their origin, or whether there was a reason or purpose behind these strange things that were being so openly and widely popularized by multinational corporations and a well consolidated media in what was just 10 years before, a culturally conservative society that paid no attention to drugs and drug users. I am of the mind that popular culture doesnt just happen by chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding weir and bohemian Grove - I used to live on the property right next to bohemian grove, growing cannabis. Monte rio, where it is located, and the surrounding areas, where weir lives, is a pretty small, tight knit community, and Bobby is very well known here. It&#39;s not a strech at all to imagine he was invited by another local member of the grove, simply due to his celebrity status, wealth, and proximity of where he lIves to the grove. Fwiw I never saw anything suspicious when hiking around the grove, but my landlord said he was once approached by men in suits in the woods and asked to turn back...which does not make sense to me...why would they be wearing suits deep in the woods like that? Wouldn&#39;t hiking clothes make a security team for that kind of location much more effective? Idk if I buy it or not but that&#39;s my experience with the grove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look at this from a different angle.  I think, hope really, they were organic and had influence and were sabotaged.  My first Dead show was in 1981 at the Uptown Theater in Chicago when I was in high school.  I was hooked from then on.  Back then I got my tickets via their PO box thing and while there were never any empty seats their wasnt a massive scalpers market either. I could show up at a show anywhere in the country and get a ticket for face value.  There was a sense of family and community among Deadheads.</p>

<p>By 1990 it seemed things had gotten out of hand and I stopped going on the road.  I caught three shows at the World Music Theater near home and the crowd had completely changed.  Frat kids in polo shirts pounding beer bongs and instigating fights with longtime Deadheads became the norm at shows. </p>

<p>I still wonder how the Dead became popular with a crowd that truly ran counter to the music and message, and if this popularity was planted to blow the whole scene up.  By 95 it was a shit show, and the last shows in Chicago were more like a Dave Matthews / Jimmy Buffet crowd hybrid than a Dead thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Music is one of the most powerful tools of mind control, ever since our ancestors pounded on the first war drums. Grateful Dead and all of those other Laurel Canyon bands were all CIA-approved, just like the LSD. Phish inherited the MK-CULTURE in the &#39;90s, but now electronic festivals seem to be the favored method for mass musical mind control. I loved a lot of this music, but it&#39;s hard to reconcile with its more sinister purpose. If these hippy free love drug movements were truly &quot;counterculture&quot;, why were they given so much media coverage?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have known a LOT of Deadheads over the years and I can not think of a single one of them who ever struck me as Satanic. I think you are totally barking up the wrong tree, it is just not a part of the culture and I think I would have realized it if it was. They have a lot of faults, but that is not one of them that I ever saw. </p>

<p>Does the CIA infiltrate the Dead? I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m sure they are an intrinsic part of the illegal drug dealing that goes along with the whole scene. I have to say one of the scariest nights of my entire life was when I went to a pot growers event and recognized a lot of people in the VIP smoking tent from Dead shows. All of a sudden I knew a lot more than I wanted to know about who was a big time drug dealer, like into the danger zone. That was terrifying. </p>

<p>I never liked Jerry&#39;s guitar playing [which I know is heresy among Deadheads], I thought it spoke of a lot of pain. People in pain use painkilling drugs, the CIA need not be involved past importing and dealing in order to control people and to make off the books money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mazel on the new baby its a very intense journey ahead...BUT AT LEAST IM ENJOYING THE RIDE...</p>

<p>There are some interesting lyrics and the symbolism is totally there to a degree. That with there location and time when starting the band(height in the 60&#39;s) as well as the friends that hung out at 710 I am sure it could get pretty occulty quick. </p>

<p>[Quote from John Potash&#39;s book <strong><em>Drugs As Weapons Against Us]</em></strong>
&quot;Owsley had teamed up with William Mellon Hitchcock as early as 1964.  Billy Hitchcock&#39;s Mellon family, as described earlier, was one of the country&#39;s wealthiest families who held many U.S. intelligence posts.  Hitchcock provided unlimited financial and technological resources to the band The Grateful Dead.&quot;</p>
