    <div class="md"><p>I did and it&#39;s flat out wrong. </p>

<p>Germany does take in Ukranian refugees but most of them are not accepted as asylee due to Ukraine being classified as secure country of origin.</p>

<p>It helps do disregard the right-wing propaganda sites and check the actual German sources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Turkey is also a &quot;secure country&quot; and leaving a &quot;secure country&quot; as you pointed out does not make you a refugee.

    <div class="md"><p>This from the NYT answers both questions:</p>

<p>&quot;And while asylum seekers from other war-torn countries have seen their applications overwhelmingly accepted in the European Union — 95 percent of Syrians, for instance, and 89 percent of Eritreans get full refugee status — Ukrainians have either seen their applications languish or faced rejection.</p>

<p>In 2014, of the 2,985 Ukrainian asylum applicants whose cases were processed in the European Union, only 150 were granted full refugee status; 2,335 were rejected; and the rest got other forms of protection — an acceptance rate of only 22 percent.</p>

<p>Still, it was better than the flood of immigrants from Kosovo and Serbia who pushed across the border into the European Union in 2014. Without even the justification of the conflict that Ukrainians face, only 8 percent of Kosovars saw their applications accepted, and just 2 percent of Serbs.&quot; </p>

<p>Perhaps you need to ask better questions. </p>

I perceive the claims of racism to be an obvious deflection so as to avoid answering to the situations their policies have led to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh absolutely, a few people realise the racism line is bollocks, but we still have a long way to go here because it’s quite a politically correct country and people will shut down any discussion about Islam just by pulling the race card.  Which of course makes no sense when Muslims can be any colour.   Luckily for you your country isn’t as politically correct and I don’t think the Muslim immigration is quite as bad - yet!  I really hope when the time comes America will resist the islamisation and not bend over backwards to tolerate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with race. Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<p>The Quilliam Foundation released a document stating that the grooming gangs in UK consist of 84% asians(I&#39;m going to be a bigot here and take it one step further by saying 80% were palestinians).</p>

<p>Now with this information in mind, let&#39;s pretend you&#39;re a girl walking down the streets of UK at 7p.m. and see a group of people in front of you. Would there be any variable in play that would make you turn around? would it be racist to take the skin color in consideration at this point? It&#39;s a damn survival instinct, we have it since we left the caves hundreds of thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>Now we can apply the same principle to the migrants. Read the news each day and hear all the bad things that happen, and you will want to protect yourself in any way. Maybe it&#39;s not all real,might as well be TV fear mongering(tip of the day: ALWAYS CHECK FOR FACTS). Average Joes that turn on the TV and hear about terrorist attacks every few weeks, are concerned for their safety and might even turn full on racists. </p>

<p>If every day I would turn on the TV and hear about white people being evil, every day of the hour, I would soon be brainwashed into thinking that they are a problem. </p>

<p>So to answer your question: I don&#39;t know, I guess it depends on which channel I am on and for how long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe the Irish were among some of the most looked down upon people coming into our country, less than a century ago. My great grandparents were Irish immigrants, and they weren&#39;t well received here. Blue eyes and all. I guess they don&#39;t count though</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just from observation, I don&#39;t believe this is true. For example, Americans seem to have no issue with Japanese or other Asian immigrants. Also, Pakistani or Indian immigrants for the most part are accepted.</p>

<p>I think for the most part, Americans want immigrants to show they are &quot;part of the team&quot; when they come here. That means lightening up on the culture they came from and adopting a more American lifestyle. You can debate whether this is good or bad, but I think that is how most Americans judge immigrants. The more they are willing to assimilate, the more they are welcome.</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s no different than any other country. If I moved to majority Muslim country and ran around with women in bikinis and drove a big pick up truck blasting American music, I probably wouldn&#39;t be very welcomed. In fact, I would probably end up jailed or killed. However, if I moved there and started dressing like them and following their traditions, I would probably be accepted over time.</p>

<p>A lot of this just comes down to common courtesy and decency. If I wanted to move to another country, I would adopt certain aspects of the people of that country so I could fit in. If I didn&#39;t want to do that, I wouldn&#39;t move there in the first place. This just seems like common decency to me.</p>

<p>Not to mention, everyone who wants America to have open borders, what is the end game there? Everyone just comes to America and the rest of the world becomes a Mad Max style hell hole? That&#39;s not sustainable. Open borders are not a solution, it will only make the gap between the rich and poor even worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See the Immigration Act of 1924, a fave of Sessions and Bannon, which cut all immigration from the African and Arab worlds (gee I wonder why). It actually didn&#39;t reduce immigration from Latin America but we can see that&#39;s now a big part of the program. As Trump defends defacto child concentration camps by erroneously comparing the situation to EU countries, it&#39;s not a big leap to find the administration&#39;s ultimate goal as quite comparable to that old immigration act (don&#39;t forget the &quot;shithole countries&quot; comment).</p>

In the 90s we had a influx of Bosnian and Croatian immigrants into the Midwest. White people. Some were hard working and become citizens. Some are useless criminals. The point is it was regulated. They were inoculated and had tests ran for disease.  Background checks for war crimes. It wasn&#39;t a cattle call. </p>
