        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So hear me out</p>

<p>I have no real facts or information to back this up, this is just my genuine little conspiracy theory thats been swirling in my head.</p>

<p>I think there’s a really wealthy person out there who views any and all drug users as degenerates unworthy of life, and so through their wealth and influence they’re filtering Fentanyl into the drug market, and dealers are picking it up bc its cheap, and through that is killing off users left and right. I lost a friend this year who died from coke that had it in it, and Ive read about a few rappers and other people that died from drugs laced with it. </p>

<p>I think this fabled person Ive thought up, hopes that people dying will scare off others from using, and eliminate the users who are too far gone to stop.</p>

<p>This probably isnt true but I just cant fathom why drug dealers would willingly use it, I know its cheap but why kill off your customers/user base?? Theres no way its worth it in the long run, profit wise. So my thought is that its someone up high who just wants any and all drug use to cease. Like the war on drugs is one of the dumbest things ever, if safely regulated some drugs could be fine for public use. But some people feel very strongly against regulated drugs, leading to the illegal market we have today, leading to the DEA and a plethora of other butterfly effects. </p>

<p>Imagine if coke/weed/shrooms/acid/molly were legal and modified in a laboratory for safe use? That would kill the illegal drug trade and stop the importation of drugs across our borders, killing cartels (yay!) but then that puts a debt in a lot of wealthy peoples pockets.</p>

<p>So my thought is there is wealthy people who are for drugs (bc money) and on the opposite spectrum wealthy (likely religious) people heavily against drugs and since they cant destroy the cartels and drug market by themselves, they’re instead killing the users and creating panic within the community as a way to cause some type of damage.</p>

<p>Just a lil theory of mine I wanted to express somewhere.</p>

<p>Have a great day, thanks for reading</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Its drug dealers who increase profits by cutting. Fent is cheaper, a little goes a long way. If pharmaceuticals werent so hard to get, there wouldnt be secondary pill market. Drug regulations cause these problems. If you want real answers, go to r/opiates, they will set you straight about the whys of fentanyl cutting.</p>

<p>My personal background as a 12 year opiate addict gives me some insight into that world, i dont mean to be argumentative, i just feel that the entire situation is gravely misunderstood by most people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cigarettes are a drug/tool used just like any other by governments. 
Look at what Australia’s gov does - they know ciggies are exceptionally addictive and hard to quit, so instead of investing in quit programs etc, they raise the tax on them by 10% twice a year, every year. People still pay. Meanwhile, they outlaw the sale of nicotine for vapes which are much safer and help people quit. I’m guessing Nicolette and cancer council are lobbying hard to keep vapes out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They also make naloxone (narcan)..... So now they are repeatedly overdosing then being brought back with narcan. Governments are encouraging addicts not to quit, but to do drugs with friends or at &quot;safe injection sites&quot;. It&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;m not saying that isn&#39;t safer, it is. It just doesn&#39;t solve the problem like more detox clinics or more money invested in mental health. There isn&#39;t that much money to be made if you actually solve the problem.</p>

If the guy that shoots up 10 times a day but ODed on one shot this time everyone thinks this is good i spend a little more and it lasts way longer.

    <div class="md"><p>Ive had a lot of friends have issues.  A few are gone.  It&#39;s interesting that most friends of addicts do not really know anything about it.  When a friend died after some fentanyl laced shit i was explaining to mutual friends what we are talking about now.</p>

<p>People really think drug dealers are intentionally murdering their customers.  It&#39;s weird.  </p>

<p>For this and many other reasons addicts need to speak up. It&#39;s like Harvey milk saying everyone needs to come out of the closet because everyone has a relative or friend that&#39;s gay and the hate will go away.

<p>Also some addicts consider someone ODing a good thing because that means someone has really good shit. If the guy that shoots up 10 times a day but ODed on one shot this time everyone thinks this is good i spend a little more and it lasts way longer. People are still using even with the risk unfortunately because most people who cut dont really know what theyre doing and can add a little too much and fuck everyone. </p>

It’s such an easy way to kill the dregs of society, I’m not complimenting whoever is doing it but it is diabolical. Someone goes to use their drug of choice that they have done hundreds or thousands of times before. Only this time Fentanyl is added. As is another number for the statistics of just another dead junkie, and the 2 17 year olds that are charged with murder for giving it to the kid who died.

    <div class="md"><p>They don’t know how to cut it yet. It’s new and the same thing happened with mdma and other drugs in the past. Fentanyl is a drug dealers dream because it’s 1000 times stronger then hydrocod and that goes for about 5 to 6 dollars a pill so think about that for a second. If you could cut it 1000 times it’s 5 thousand times the profits.  It makes no sense with xans as people instantly would know  it’s not xans, same with coke.  What is happening is drug dealers are testing products trying to find the correct formula to ratio. However this shit is the size of a grain of salt and would require dilution and procedures most drug dealers don’t have. What people are getting is the bad batches sold cheap on a black market and assholes who cut corners are buying it to try and hook their user base. </p>

<p>Colors are off on the products you can see it, wrong shade of blue or yellow or the wrong size pill etc.</p>

<p>Pills don’t taste the same but your pretty much screwed once you pop it in your mouth. If I had money I would invest in drug kits because I see them being a big seller in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right, selling this as xanax and especially coke makes no sense, it&#39;s not remotely like any of them.  I&#39;m not entirely sure why heroin would be cut with it unless the quality of heroin has gone totally down the drain.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s possible to dilute it down to something consistently heroin-like in strength, but it probably relies on some complex chemistry or expensive equipment.  I think there are lab-grade dry bulk mixing systems that can cut it or some kind of solvent-based technique that blends it well and then can be dried/evaporated into a dry base that can be further cut using the usual dry bulk methods.  But all of this is too complicated for most people without high level organic chemistry know-how.</p>

<p>I think the opiate problem would get a lot worse if a moderately simple/reliable technique for cutting fentanyl down to oxycodone/hydrocodone strength existed. Fentanyl is easily synthesized (it doesn&#39;t require opium-derived precursors) and doesn&#39;t require a big supply chain of opium producers, it&#39;s concentrated enough that smuggling it is trivial relative to bulkier heroin.  If a reliable method to thin it down for mass consumption that didn&#39;t result in mass deaths existed I can see where it would make a fortune and be almost unstoppable.</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>but it does. if its at the right level, uniformly, as to not kill the users, it just makes it more addictive. a lot of cocaine users are rich, but dont use that often (lawyers, bankers etc going out in manhattan)</p>

<p>&amp;#x200B;</p>

<p>what if suddenly they were all fiending like H addicts? demand goes up.  and if less actual coke needs to be used w the fent kick, its cheaper to make too.  from a business perspective it makes a ton of sense</p>

<p>the uptick in coke fent deaths recently i think is either due to stupid street dealers cutting poorly, or some Heisenberg a/b testing </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have actual talked to someone who had the fentanyl laced benzo however as he put it that it actually was a pill for cancer patients in great pain and he almost died from it and he didn’t know it had the fentanyl. 
Being super trashed isn’t what people are looking for with benzo’s most drug users use benzos to come down from a high or to avoid the effects of the comedown. </p>

<p>I will explain why so that last statement doesn’t sound contradictory.
People who are high on lsd, mushrooms might use benzos to comedown off the drug not that the effects of the comedown are horrible just they might be prone to panic attacks. However when it comes to other drugs like opioid’s, alcohol, meth or coke the comedown of the drug is mentally horrible and the physical effect are horrible as well and they are trying to bypass the horrible comedown. Aka one drug user my use benzos to stop a high while another user avoids the comedown after the high.</p>

<p>Note if your at the point of avoiding the comedown with benzo’s you have a problem that will only progress with benzo use. </p>

<p>This is why lacing benzos with fentanyl is extremely dangerous because it’s used not to get extremely high but to come down from a night of extreme drug or alcohol use and that’s why people are dying from it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your close...... The same pharma companies also make the antidote, naloxone. So now there is an epidemic of overdoses stemmed from fentanyl and the price and sale of the antidote has gone through the roof. There is a reason no government is actually solving the problem(detox clinics, mental health, less prescriptions etc.) All of the government funds are going towards programs that are prolonging the problem like safe injection sites. Everyone on the front line knows that these programs are just bandaids that don&#39;t solve the problem. Yet no one in power is actually doing anything. Why? Big Pharma. Business is good right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its a form of population control. It is absolutely UNBELIEVABLE how many people in the US are addicted to this shit these days. I am talking about like 25&amp;#37; of an entire graduating class. They get on it because pharmaceutical companies flooded the country with prescriptions for pain pills and xanax type drugs, then they cut their patients off. The patients also had kids who stole their parent&#39;s or grandparents&#39; medications and distributed it. Then all of a sudden there is a crackdown, everyone goes to heroin and bootleg pills from drug dealers on the street and now they are all dying of fentanyl overdoses. Sounds fishy to me. </p>

<p>Oh and this epidemic is way worse than people realize, because people aren&#39;t just dying from overdoses they are also dying from HIV, Hep C, and bacterial infections in their hearts from shooting up. The true number of dead from the opioid epidemic is much higher than reported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work as a Lab Tech at a Bay Area hospital. The corporate side is complex.  Despite there being a crisis , I see more deaths from people who take Rx meds than Heroin/Fentanyl/etc. </p>

<p>That being said , there&#39;s a pretty complex system with the majority of illegal drug trafficking. A lot of times Fentanyl will be substituted for Heroin because its about 30&amp;#37; cheaper.  Dealing heroin without being addicted to it is pretty rare.  This isn&#39;t to say that it&#39;s not done.  But addicts of heroin often convince themselves that they should sell heroin to keep up their addiction. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t really have a full time job and a heroin addiction once you&#39;ve reached dependancy. Even with meth and coke people can get motivated to find work to support their addiction.   With opioids your goal is to not do anything stress related and let the high take over your life for brief moments. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why epidemics spread like wildfire in bad economies.<br/>
Anyways as their body builds up tolerance they start using more of their supply and their clients need more but have less money.  So they&#39;ll start to figure out ways to cut corners on that process - enter Fentanyl.<br/>
Cartel networks can face issues.  There&#39;s a lot of meth that gets cut with bad shit if people want to do some damage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this - partially. I have a feeling it is the Chinese government trying to destroy USA like a covert war (isn’t that where fent is made?) o feel this way anyway for Xanax and coke. </p>

<p>I do know however, as an ex heroin user, i had dealers (Mexican cartel) who specifically put fent in their product because the users (myself included) were so heavily addicted that we wanted that extra bump up. It’s almost like street cred for them that they have fire. Regular dope stops working good &amp; you still get semi sick when you have been taking fent (such a tiny amount I’m sure) for so long. BTW This was confirmed that it was fent and not something else with drug test I’ve taken when i went to hospital, rehab, detoxes, etc.</p>

<p>What a smart way for another country to take down future generations though, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t agree with it.</p>

<p>If anyone was cutting with fentanyl, it&#39;s be the dealer, not the distributor.</p>

<p>A lot of times big bust happen and the quality of dope can get very low, and the dealers usually get cut product and then most often cut it again themselves.  This lowers the quality of the drug considerably. And if you have weak product, customers(fiends) will go to someone with better.  So they resort to cutting with fentanyl when they get it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with coke and other uppers being laced with fentanyl, when a user wants to speed ball, they usually get heroin(any opiate), and cock/meth/whatever upper they prefer. It&#39;s just my opinion and what I&#39;ve experienced.</p>

<p>Usually, fentanyl is added to powdered form of heroin, it&#39;s easy to cut dope with it. I have no experience with tar type of heroin so I&#39;m not really sure, but I would imagine it is/could be added.</p>

<p>A dealer would usually let customers know it&#39;s got fentanyl, they don&#39;t want their customers dying, although if a person has a certain stamp(on the baggies) and they overdose and or die, that&#39;s a double edged sword for the dealer.  It&#39;s going to drive people to the dealer that has them because they know their good and will also attract police attention, and that&#39;s usually when their phone goes off for a few months.</p>

<p>No one is killing the users but themselves.  No one forced them to play with poison. In most cases it starts out innocent and goes waaay south, I know.  I would like to think drugs should be decriminalized.  I also don&#39;t think it would change much besides maybe raising or lowering drug related arrests.  I never met a casual meth user who used for a long time and wasn&#39;t extremely addicted.  Same with heroin.  I met functioning addicts, but they are that, functioning addicts. Some tolerable, most not. IMO. Prohibition only seems to be making it worse.</p>

<p>Even with all the deaths that we are having with this opiod crisis, it&#39;s relatively low,it is an unfortunate blight on civil and social circumstances, but would decriminalization  make it worse? I&#39;d hope not, I don&#39;t know. Smartest thing to do it to stay away from it.  You want to party, prepare for the consequences. It&#39;s a hard situation.</p>

<p>TLDR: I don&#39;t think any bigwigs or anyone of influence is lacing dope with fentanyl, it&#39;s usually the dealer, not the distributor.</p>

<p>I also believe they will find a way to synthesize fentanyl into pot. So the government can fully control the sales of marijuana now that&#39;s it&#39;s legal in Canada.  Maximum profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to burst your bubble man but at least from my experience this is not a Conspiracy. I know drug dealers that willingly mix it with heroin. The problem is (even they admit this) that no one really knows how to measure the fentanyl they are mixing in so what they do is just scoop a little and mix it. They throw it on the streets and wait for the word. They actually have dudes or a dude that puts his ear to the street and comes back with with the word on whether it was good or not. Then they will add more, cut it more with fillers or keep it the same. The sad truth is that when users die their business goes up because everyone wants that high. When your tolerance is so high that no matter how much dope you take just makes you feel normal so you can function than you start looking for that original rush and fuck it, you&#39;ll take the risk that comes with the fentanyl, hell you will actively seek it out. Now getting fentanyl to the streets (whoever supplies it) is where the conspiracy would lie if anything. But as far as the drug dealers knowingly mixing it in well, thats all about the money. </p>

<p>Unfortunate Source: Was a user, dealer and used to know many dealers. </p>

<p>PS: Fuck that life. I&#39;m never going back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this. The war on drugs was such an absolute failure. I believe that somebody has flooded the illegal drug market with substances designed to kill off user population in an attempt to rid the world of the &quot;undesirables&quot;. </p>

<p>Look at the k2 that&#39;s been laced with brodifacoum and is inducing acute coagulopathy. The individuals ingesting this are quite literally bleeding to death. Consider the types of people that use k2.. it&#39;s usually people who can&#39;t use substances that would cause them to fail a drug test (possibly due to probation).</p>

<p>I agree that all of this seems purposeful. We are always on the lookout for the next big virus or out break of disease that will wipe out a considerable percentage of our population. They aren&#39;t calling it an epidemic for no reason. The number of death&#39;s per year continue to increase exponentially and I don&#39;t foresee that stopping anytime soon. With narcan as readily available as it is, we are promoting a culture that enables addicts. Treatment should be an involuntary part of this process. Commitment to treatment centers, etc. If an individual overdoses to the point that requires first responders to start chest compressions and assist respirations, they should not simply be monitored for 2 hours then be able to sign themselves out of the hospital. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i just got back from 3 months at a rehab, and over 50% of the people were there for something that was laced with fentanyl. also almost every death story i&#39;d heard from them involved it. i&#39;ve been around drugs my whole life, but this shit&#39;s on a new level and killing like no other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A wealthy yet moralistic cabal is offing drug users with Fentanyl?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced.</p>

<p>However, I am absolutely convinced that the CIA control the heroin supply out of Afghanistan and that Tor was only released by US Intelligence to facilitate distribution of illegal drugs on a global scale.</p>

<p>I would not be at all surprised if the opioid crisis has been stage managed alongside the illegal drugs trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a contributor on the benzo sub and many people have first or second hand experience with counterfeit xanax with fentanyl in it. I&#39;ve only ever had what the doctor prescribed and some other things from a couple sources so it never managed to get to me but it really has no place in anything other than heroin if that. A VICE report on the analogues carfentanyl and sufentanil came very close to implicating the government as a go between for Chinese labs and street level heroin dealers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s become a huge problem in Canada in the last 3-ish years. There have been a couple of documented deaths where marijuana was laced with fentanyl and I attributed it to the impending nation-wide legalization of marijuana, due sometime this year.   I figure the government is scaring civilians off of street drugs so they buy the governments’ drugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They also make naloxone (narcan)..... So now they are repeatedly overdosing then being brought back with narcan. Governments are encouraging addicts not to quit, but to do drugs with friends or at &quot;safe injection sites&quot;. It&#39;s ridiculous. I&#39;m not saying that isn&#39;t safer, it is. It just doesn&#39;t solve the problem like more detox clinics or more money invested in mental health. There isn&#39;t that much money to be made if you actually solve the problem.</p>
