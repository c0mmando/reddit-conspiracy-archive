       I've never visited this subreddit before but figured this would be a good place to put this. As you may have heard, the rapper XXXTENTACION was shot earlier today and was pronounced dead after being comatose. But there's a few things that point to this being completely false.
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost, when the reports came out that he had been shot, the witnesses reported that he merely looked dead, not that he was. There are a few videos of X floating around and in NONE of them is there blood or a clear gunshot wound. Since he was leaning toward the center console and there were no holes in the door of his BMW i8, he must have gotten shot in the head from the driver's side, and as previously mentioned, no visible gunshot wound. Even when they took him out of the car, there was no blood anywhere in the car.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why would he do this? I don't think it's a secret organization or anything; I believe he set it up himself to get out of a court case for beating his girlfriend and will probably live out his days in another country. Plus, all of these obvious flaws indicate that it was probably only one, somewhat dumb person setting this up and maybe paying off the cops.

       Come on. You make this whole fucked up post just to talk shit about a dead kid? Have some respect.

      <p>
       You obviously didn't see the video, he was leaning towards the driver side door and it was clear that he was gone. Not all gunshot wounds are bloody messes depending on where they hit.

       Sometimes. If a woman kicks me in the balls or slaps my child or kills my dog or.... There's a long list of shit that makes it ok to slap a woman. Just like there's plenty of reasons to slap a man.

       Nah. Sounds like he got robbed. Witnesses are saying they took a bag from his car and he was out buying a motorcycle. Not hard to see someone wanting to take the money he was going to use for that.

       I don't think it's like that. I thought of the possibility too, but a lot is pointing to this crew just killing him and bragging about it, check out that other recent post about X. Also, I believe he was taken to the hospital and died there.

       Usually when someone is shot and instantly killed their isn't a lot of blood. This is because they are dead, their heart is not beating to push the blood out.

       Xxx posted something on his Snapchat about a year ago saying that “they put something in the air that is making everyone horribly sick”, and then went on to basically list all of the symptoms of sickness from ch*mtrails. Just something to note

       Not quite... He was mid filming a music video and that was one of the scenes. He just made it seem like it was but you could tell it was just a vid. Also he came out a few hours later saying it was fake

       Yeah I saw that. I was thinking of putting an edit on this post that said that all of the pressure put on him may have caused him to fake a death. But Drake's fans may have actually killed him, who knows?
