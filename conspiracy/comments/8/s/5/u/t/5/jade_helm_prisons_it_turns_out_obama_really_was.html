        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are a lot of people suddenly losing their shit over family prisons made for illegals. It&#39;s interesting that no one seemed concerned about it all those years <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/opinion/mr-obamas-dubious-detention-centers.html">Obama was the one building these.</a> He&#39;s the inventor and founder of them, afterall. Hell, Obama invented <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/immigration/obamas-immigration-agencies-separated-children-from-their-families-too-2/">ATEP</a> in 2008 which separated families by thousands of miles. It&#39;s interesting that a major portion of the Jade Helm conspiracy revolved around Wal-Mart&#39;s being converted into FEMA camps, and yet, that&#39;s sort of what happened. They <a href="https://www.brownsvilleherald.com/premium/article_02526130-ef47-11e6-ad49-773f627be369.html">really did </a> end up doing that. It&#39;s interesting to note that Jade Helm took part primarily around the border and within the border states. What exactly were they doing?  </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yV0wi39s124?t=38s">Prominent Progressives </a> aren&#39;t even running from it anymore. Obama&#39;s policies led to children falling into the hands of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/obama-administration-placed-children-with-human-traffickers-report-says/2016/01/28/39465050-c542-11e5-9693-933a4d31bcc8_story.html?utm_term=.9e7af65122f1">child traffickers.</a> Actually, Obama literally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/failures-in-handling-unaccompanied-migrant-minors-have-led-to-trafficking/2016/01/26/c47de164-c138-11e5-9443-7074c3645405_story.html">gave the children to child traffickers</a>. A few million dollars worth of &quot;hot dogs&quot; at the White House, eh?</p>

<p>Now you have an obvious fake news campaign blaming Trump for the policies and facilities Obama created. If this doesn&#39;t wake you up to fake narratives, nothing will. It couldn&#39;t be more obvious that the elites are losing, and are throwing the kitchen sink (literally their own creations) in a last gasp to stop the momentum. Make no mistake there&#39;s an information war for your mind, and situations like this really shine the light on the fake news and the corruption. </p>

<p>Spread the truth. Stop the lies. Fight the fight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s a crazy issue.  There&#39;s really only one &quot;right&quot; answer, try arguing this issue, and you&#39;re a dick no matter what.  Nuts.  Very well played move, because the right can&#39;t possibly come up with a good counter point.  It&#39;s a shitty situation, regardless of what side you&#39;re on.  I think it&#39;s just this week&#39;s outrage.  I totally see your point about if people can&#39;t see the media just trying to get reactions out of people.

<p>Not just about this issue, but looking back at my life...Oh My God.  It&#39;s so crazy how clear it is now.  Crystal clear.  </p>

<p>To be equally clear, I think it&#39;s shitty that kids are being separated from their families no doubt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes me wonder with Nielsen claiming that many of the children were with strangers. I know that that&#39;s not unheard of because I knew someone growing up who I later learned was living here illegally throughout their childhood living with her aunt and uncle. We always just thought her parents abandoned her but we later learned they just sent her here to live with them here because they were well off. They had money so I doubt she wasn&#39;t brought here safely but for some families without the means have probably chosen to risk them going with coyotes to get here to family that&#39;s already here. While I feel for families that feel desperate enough to risk that we bear some responsibility for it for not securing our borders enough to stop that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that many children have never made it to their family and been told either they died on the way or to not raise a stink about it or worse things will happen. I am firmly in support of a wall and against amnesty for DACA recipients but no kid should ever be put through that. They&#39;re innocent. I feel like amnesty will only encourage it to keep happening. We can discourage this by not giving people hope that putting a child through this is worth it. </p>

<p>Businesses that hire illegals need to be punished. State governments that give out licenses and benefits need to be removed from office. The road to help is paved with good intentions and what we are doing now is not working. It only encourages all of the people involved in this business of human trafficking to keep doing it. Legalize weed and stop rewarding human trafficking. Cut off cartel streams of revenue. </p>

<p>My counter point is just to point out how those dem policitians (in an election season) are screaming and hollering about how terrible this is aren&#39;t offering solutions and aren&#39;t being asked what their solution to the problem would be. It&#39;s just a campaign of &quot;this is not who we are.&quot; Well, clearly it is, because Obama had been doing it, too. And so did the prior admin. And the admin before.</p>

<p>I think most people recognize that they need to filter the propaganda and &quot;issue of the week&quot; through the lens of it being an important election season and one side has suffered incredible losses of power and are desperate to win.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure that is the reason.</p>

<p>So why aren&#39;t they giving ALL of the facts, then? Why did they share photos of 2014 and then not only delete them when it was pointed out that they were photos from 2014, they actually went so far as spreading the word to quickly delete them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of them have attempted to cross legally. I&#39;m well aware of the violence they are fleeing and I am in favor of helping them stop that in their own countries. It has to stop that we feel obligated to help anyone that shows up here. How many people can we take? Because we can&#39;t just take every person from a country that has violence levels worse than ours. Any nation that takes in tons of people at once will be irrevocably changed as assimilation requires generations and immersion. The border states are filling up with so many people that they live in their own communities and never assimilate. When our border states all resemble the countries they just came from then what?</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean their skin color. I mean living with a proper immersion into the things that made us successful enough to be able to be a place people can come to live a better life. Because all that&#39;s going to happen is the same thing that happened to California where the state now has the largest income gap in the country and a whole host of other problems.</p>

<p>There has to be a way to help people without just letting the entire world come here. We should feel no guilt in wishing people coming here properly respect and adopt our ideals. If you love what you have you don&#39;t change it.</p>

We have so many people coming over here illegally that any legit asylum seekers will be lumped into them and right now it seems impossible to tell where the truth lies in which ones were attempting to cross illegally and which applied the legal way since everyone involved is saying different things. If we discouraged illegal immigration to the point where the risks outweighed the benefits it would create a situation where the people who do show up are more likely to be asylum seekers than people attempting to take advantage of our immigration situation where the risk of crossing illegally is outweighed by the benefits once you get here.</p>

<p>The current method is detaining everyone. That&#39;s not a solution, it&#39;s just concentrating everyone into a specific area and then shipping people home, with or without their family in tow. </p>

<p>Just because we&#39;d have a harsh immigration system doesn&#39;t mean people would stop trying. And even if it reduced numbers, we&#39;d still have people illegally trying to enter. All any of this does is lower the number of attempts. It&#39;s the exact same scenario with a presumably lower number. </p>

<p>Ok, so what is &quot;the way to do things&quot;. We have an awful lot of complaining and outrage, but nobody telling anyone what the &#39;right way to do things&#39; actually is.</p>

<p>This is an important election year. Democrats are trying to win elections. Democrats that purposefully ignored all this happening during Obama are now suddenly outraged. None of them are being asked what their solutions would be. None of them are offering solutions. They are simply on a campaign of &#39;this is not who we are&quot; when in reality, they were doing the same damn thing and it more or less has been the way for over a decade, so yes, it IS who we are. It is who they are, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you cross the border illegally you&#39;re a criminal. The first time is a misdemeanor. The second a felony. And, during Obama presidency traffickers got smart and took advantage of the law. They knew if you showed up with children and asked for asylum the Obama administration would set you free to await your case. Under Trump, this policy has ended. The children are being placed in facilities that are like dorm rooms. They get 3 meals a day. They can watch tv, play video games. They get free medical attention for any medical needs they might have. And they are only there for at most 20 days. When during that time the government attempts to place them with their actual parents or legal guardians. It is quite a humane and reasonable process considering we have no idea if the adult their with is their parent or a trafficker.

    <div class="md"><p>Transparency and oversight is very important in a situation like this. I agree. Asylum seekers must ask asylum from the first country they enter. So if you traveled through Mexico, you must ask asylum from Mexico. And here there are traffickers taking advantage of the law. Than there is the logistical nightmare of dealing with this. There are tens of thousands of people entering illegally. This isn&#39;t a simple situation with an easy fix. The Flores ruling stated that children could not be held with their parents. They must be turned over to Health and Human services. So, yes, the law has to be changed. But politicians on both sides are just interested in yelling at each other and make exaggerated claims.

My point was that you said &quot;When our border states all resemble the countries they just came from then what?&quot; and we already have areas that look like this. Not nearly as extreme, granted, but still troublesome for a developed nation. The point being that we&#39;ve already descended to having these shitholes without immigrants; what&#39;s the difference?</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t done a damn thing about our own poverty/drug/violence problems. It does not matter how much we&#39;re spending on border control, there&#39;s still plenty of our tax dollars available to improve our impoverished neighborhoods. The government doesn&#39;t do it so there are still people to oppress. </p>

Sure it does. If you want wide open borders so anyone can come through unchecked (MS-13, ISiS, Drug Dealers, Criminal Rapists) then you should be living in a city where its majority those people, and have your own home&#39;s borders open to anyone as well</p>

<p>Look, I agree kids shouldn&#39;t be separated, and something should be done. That something = laws, borders, security, legal ways to immigrants, checks and balances, being a humanitarian and taking X amount of asylum seekers a year, and being meritocracy based.</p>

<p>The problem is the media is acting like this is a new thing, trying to paint the current admin as completely responsible when this has been ongoing for <em>decades</em>. Luckily we&#39;re beginning to shine a light on it. The truth will come at a major cost, however... we ignored this for way too long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, it&#39;s not new. Notice how no one is saying how the separation goes <em>against</em> the law. Started under Bill Clinton, i believe. Also, when someone is deported, they are separated from their children as well. </p>

<p>This is a <em>human trafficking</em> issue, through and through. That is why the media is only bringing it up now. It is going to be exposed and they are trying to get ahead of it. </p>

<p>Remeber when g.w. bush and obama wrote and executive order giving amnesty to all illegals in america if they reported?  That&#39;s how much power the president has over inmigration.  It would be even easier for trump to adjust the current policy to atop children from being separated from their families.  But he isn&#39;t doing that.</p>

<p>Instead he:  said it wasn&#39;t happening.</p>

<p>Then said it was in line with biblical teachings</p>

<p>Then blamed the whole thing on the democrats.</p>

<p>If you think for one second this president has the moral high ground on anything, you&#39;re deluded by partisan politics.</p>

<p>You&#39;re telling me that the folk hero president who is going to arrest all the pedos in govt and lock away all the corrupt politicans in d.c. is right this second using poor immigrant children as a bargaining chip?!</p>

<p>Wake the fuck up!!  Trump is a human dumpster fire!!  Who gives a fuck if this is democrats policy! (Which, it strangely wasn&#39;t the immigration policy until recently).

    <div class="md"><p><em>A former director of the CIA and NSA said Wednesday that hysteria in Texas over a 2015 U.S. military training exercise called Jade Helm was fueled by Russians wanting to dominate “the information space,” and that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott&#39;s decision to send the Texas State Guard to monitor the operation gave them proof of the power of such misinformation campaigns.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>20% of the people in our prisons are foreign born. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-homeland-security-release-data-incarcerated-aliens-94-percent-all">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/departments-justice-and-homeland-security-release-data-incarcerated-aliens-94-percent-all</a></p>

<p>Note that 94% of those were here illegally. The legal immigrants don&#39;t seem to be much of a problem but the illegals do. That&#39;s what you get when you reward people who are the type to come here knowingly in violation of your laws. They know it&#39;s illegal and say &quot;fuck you&quot; and do it anyway.</p>

<p>Why is it a concern they don&#39;t assimilate? Why would it not be a concern that we would allow people in who don&#39;t want to adopt our way of life and respect it? </p>

<p>Very few of our places resemble their countries. We have a few extremely violent areas. How will we ever improve those areas if we are spending over 100 billion a year on people who come here illegally and make it worse? </p>

<p>If all of our states resembled those shithole countries they wouldn&#39;t be coming here in the first place, would they?</p>

<p>You reward what you expect and things that are free are not as valuable as things that must be earned. By allowing legal immigration and doing things like citizenship tests where they learn about our history and laws they respect it more than just handing out citizenship to people who started out by coming here illegally in the first place. </p>

<p>Next are misdemeanors, the penalty for which can include up to one year in a county jail. The least serious are infractions (mostly traffic offenses), for which the maximum penalty does not exceed a $100.00 fine plus court costs.</p>
