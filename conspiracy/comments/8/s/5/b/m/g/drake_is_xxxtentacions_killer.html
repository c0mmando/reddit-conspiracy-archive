        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Drake has had beef with x for a while. He went into detail about it in an <a href="https://youtu.be/OspnBqCudoY">interview</a> over copy x&#39;s song. Less than a month ago drake releases I&#39;m upset and says
&quot;You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin&#39; chess
So what&#39;s next?
Jump up out the bed like I’m possessed
I go out on tour and I say I&#39;m drinkin&#39; less
End up gettin&#39; loose and gettin&#39; pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That&#39;s the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin&#39; if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That&#39;s the only kind of shit that gets you some respect&quot;</p>

<p>Is he talking about his beef with XXX in this? X did try to check him about stealing music even going as far as to threaten him, who knows what shit x had on drake, possibly career ending? So drake ended up hiring a killer to shoot him dead. Not only as a power play but to prevent possible blackmail/dirt being released.</p>

<p>The final thing that points to drake killing x is this <a href="https://goo.gl/images/qfa9nW">picture</a></p>

<p>This shit is all the way back from February. Xxx knew drake was going to take his life for months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only time he shoots below the neck, aka not a headshot, is when he shoots his nut inside hoes. Totally makes sense.</p>

<p>That being said, I think there&#39;s a lot more to pop lyrics than the facade.  I believe that these highly coded messages, which truly take time to unravel, are meant to APPEAR coded in an &quot;adult&quot; way meaning like &quot;hehe I know he&#39;s talking about busting his nut.&quot; Thus people who &quot;get the meaning&quot; get the decoy meaning.  While the real meaning COULD be more.  I&#39;ll not saying this particular example is definitely proof, but I think that throwing people off with sex, drugs and money is part of the chess game of pool culture manipulation.</p>

<p>I could go super in depth with this, but for example, in Taylor Swift&#39;s video Look What You Made Me Do, she&#39;s bathing in a tub of diamonds, a reference to the Kardashian diamond heist which is also connected to Kanye who she had beef with over stolen lyrics.  Anyway, I know this is way too deep down there celebrity bullshit rabbit hole, but they&#39;re all connected. It&#39;s all just money games of them rubbing in our faces how they can lie to us, confirm their own lies amongst each other, and continue to lie at greater profits since their lies have more perceived power.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure in that video where Kanye goes off at a concert here straight up says something like &quot;Drake, I know you got killas.&quot; And honestly, I think saying it&#39;s even &quot;Drake&quot; that did it in the first place is a joke.  Saying these puppets have autonomy is a lie they try to convince us of.  Maybe he was involved, maybe he was convinced by his handlers to do it, maybe he had nothing to do with it but his handlers knew they had to deal with it.  </p>

<p>And the best part is, the entertainment cartel doesn&#39;t care about the artists that make them money.  They&#39;d gladly blame Drake for it so that when push comes to shove he takes the entire fall when really it was just another money scheme.  Honestly, I bet Drake&#39;s death would get them just as much money as a whole tour, and his time is running out in the spotlight, so maybe he dispensable by now.</p>

<p>What about this quote implies what you said?  </p>

<p><strong>&quot; Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over.

<p>I personally think he got put into witness protection, it would make sense with the IG post saying if he dies it is Drake, and he is snitching on him right now (XXX on Drake) although I have no idea what he would have on Drake that would be enough for witness protection (although Drake was a child actor so I&#39;m sure he has some weird stuff in his past)</p>

<p>Here are lyrics from the Phryme song Era from February of this year talking about XXX being put in witness protection.</p>

<p>&quot;The extra extensive extent we&#39;ve gone, To send you in witness protection, Exit with this throne. I can hit you niggas ex. Or I can get you niggas x.Or I can get you niggas XXXTentacion. Bitch we not the same thing, me I come from a different world. I flip you out yo&#39; frame like the wayne wayne, then hit ya girl. Run up bare-faced broad day, the fuck I&#39;ma wrestle for.
