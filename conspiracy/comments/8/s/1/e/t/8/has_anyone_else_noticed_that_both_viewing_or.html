       Go ahead and try it yourself. If anyone is able to find a Snopes article that is able to be archived, then please let me know so I can edit my post. But as of now, every single link I've tried searching for or archiving with Wayback Machine just comes back with the error message:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sorry.
       </p>
       <p>
        This URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I find this incredibly odd, and can only think of one reason why a site like Snopes would want/need to be exempt from an archiving website like TWM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side note, when you google the quote above about "this URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine", you get a bunch of articles/blog posts about other shady shit that was quietly removed from the archives (like
       <a href="http://archive.org/post/1088264/this-url-has-been-excluded-from-the-wayback-machine">
        this one
       </a>
       about a documentary or something called
       <em>
        Lobotomized by Drugs
       </em>
       , which I'm now interested in looking into).
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have more information on that? Other theories? Thoughts? I'm interested in hearing others' opinion on this issue.

       The robots.txt file does nothing to stop automated scraping it is only an honor bound agreement for search-engine indexing so that sensitive data isn’t included in search results, and so that crawling-bots don’t get stuck in infinite loops.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s essentially a mutually beneficial agreement between search engine indexers and website hosts. However, it is entirely unenforced — there is nothing stopping you from attempting to index the entire internet provided you had the processing power, storage to do so.

        Do you collect all the sites on the Web?

      <p>
       No, the Archive collects web pages that are publicly available. We do not archive pages that require a password to access, pages that are only accessible when a person types into and sends a form, or pages on secure servers. Pages may not be archived due to robots exclusions and some sites are excluded by direct site owner request.

       I don't know, I guess you'd have to get into the legality of it at some point.  If you publish on the internet publicly, then shouldn't archiving be something that should be allowed regardless?

       The internet is build (almost fundamentally) on respect. If someone puts in their 'robots.txt' file, "Please don't scan me you idiot internet bots" the bots usually respect that.

       Archive.is' ownership (and funding) is a little mysterious and seems to be a single-entity. It could very easily disappear, to be honest I'm guessing it probably will in the next few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wayback Machine is not infallible, but it is part of Internet Archive which shouldn't disappear anytime soon. Just try and use more than one archiving site if you're after longevity.

       Holy hell, so after just a few minutes of looking more into the
       <em>
        Lobotomized by Drugs
       </em>
       story. Aparently it's a theory involving the Columbine shooters, and how they were raped by the police months before the shooting, and they tried desperately to cover it up? And then some guy named Mark Taylor tried to blow the whistle about it, and was arrested on BS charges and institutionalized. Even the

       Whole new rabbit hole to me, and I've only just started looking deeper into it. Just thought I'd share with everyone else, see if other people have some sources or more information about this conspiracy theory.

       If you find an article that you believe may be edited or deleted in the future, I would say archiving from both sites would be more than adequate to make sure it's accessible in the future. To be absolutely certain, you can also take a screenshot.

       That didn't happen. Same for the rest, rightists twist the stories to make them sound salacious like the laughing about getting a rapist off, she didn't laugh about getting him off she laughed at the prosecution losing evidence (pants iirc) so again, twisted into a lie.

       That's not even the point. The fact is, the put a big red
       <strong>
        FALSE

       Yes. The truth is indeed important to me. And calling out websites that the MSM pushes as the gatekeepers of truth on their bull shit is indeed important to me. The fact that you make statements like:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Hillary ones aren't true though

       also 2:22 she laughs about the crime lab loosing some of the evidence (the piece of the panties that had blood on it so they could test it)that would put him in jail.........the part where she laughs that she was going to get him off this "miscarriage of justice" while laughing is a real kicker

       The State Department under her command absolutely approved the Uranium One deal and those involved from the Russian side most definitely donated to the Clinton foundation shortly before and after the deal went down. You can verify all of that with a quick google.

      <p>
       Maybe she didn’t laugh about defending the rapist. But considering she was laughing on national television about causing the death of Gadaffi and destroying a sovereign nation I’d venture to say that she did laugh about it. She’s been married to a rapist for decades so that doesn’t help much either.

       Are you familiar with the term straw man?
      </p>
      <p>
       When did I ever claim she eats babies? I only every claimed she did things that there is actual evidence for.  Dismissing everything I just showed and told you, simply because there are other people out there that make ridiculous claims, is the definition of a straw man fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plugging your ears and yelling “blah blah blah” and feigning interest when you have no comeback to presented facts (and are obviously very interested/invested in defending this woman) is pretty much the most childish way you could possibly have a conversation with people.

       That’s absolutely true. I had an argument with someone the other day in a default that claimed Politifact and Snopes were unbiased legimate sources. The fact that he was using information from sources that didn’t pertain at all to what we were talking about also didn’t help very much. But guess who got tons of upvotes and who was downvoted to hell.

       The two sources you mention literally outline where they get their info from and how they draw their conclusion... I mean they may be bias in what they choose to cover, but to write them off is frankly ridiculous (and is likely for the reason you and the below poster is claiming people listen to them for).

       And they literally discredit themselves in their “outlines” 90% of the time. Politifact is 100% biased to the left in how they rate things. If a democrat said it they’ll twist whatever info they need to make it true. If a republican said/did something they do the exact opposite. But that’s not surprising considering their senior staff is 100% democratic and usually the spouse or relative of a Democrat in office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Snopes isn’t
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       bad as Politifact but they also usually discredit themselves in showing how they got to their conclusion in the same way. But that’s bound to happen when it’s ran by people with no investigative background using google. They have a formula that goes like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrat=Honest
Republican=Liar
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to see what I’m talking about just google “Politifact bias” and click images. There were way too many examples to pick just one. Do the same for “Snopes bias”.

       Believe it or not this is not the first time I've had this conversation, and I have to say the evidence that i have seen as bias is extremely EXTREMELY thin. But that being said, I would posit this to you: given that Snopes and Politifact both give detailed frames around their ratings in which they both list both their sources and how they drew their conclusions, what more would you like them to do? What would a genuinely good fact checker look like if not that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have an example from either that you feel really exemplifies their bias that maybe we can discuss?

       Ok, so in your first article, it doesn't actually address bias, but has a snarky fictitoius exchange taht does link to an claim they say is bias. It is claim rated "half true" by Ron Paul for his claim that there was a federal income tax rate of 0% until 1913. The Politifact rating says this is half true because there were numerous attempts to implement a different rate, including a decade in which it was in fact not 0%, what is wrong with that rating?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which claim is incorrect in the 2nd image? I'm being sincere, I'm not sure which one of those is supposed to be incorrect?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems more like you're just looking at the top of the posts which read "POLITIFACT SUPER BIASED" followed by a list of examples that do not support that conclusion...

        The Snopes.com web site was founded by David Mikkelson, a project begun in 1994 as an expression of his interest in researching urban legends that has since grown into the oldest and largest fact-checking site on the Internet — one widely regarded by journalists, folklorists, and laypersons alike as one of the world’s essential resources. Snopes.com is routinely included in annual “Best of the Web” lists and has been the recipient of two Webby awards. Snopes.com personnel have made multiple appearances as guests on national news programs such as 20/20, ABC World News, CNN Sunday Morning, and NPR’s All Things Considered, and they and their work have been profiled in numerous major news publications, including The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and Reader’s Digest.

        Over twenty years later, Snopes.com has come to be regarded as an online touchstone of research on rumors and misinformation. The site’s work has been described as painstaking, scholarly, and reliable, and has been lauded by the world’s top folklorists, including Jan Harold Brunvand, Gary Alan Fine, and Patricia Turner. Hundreds of the site’s articles have been cited by authors in a variety of disciplines, and various of their articles have been published in textbooks currently in use in the U.S. and Canadian school systems.

       Because I don't want old versions of my websites out there. I also change some of the existing content from time to time and don't want the old images and writing out there. I control what I can control. Both Google and Amazon (who owns the WM) are good about this. As are the other search engines out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be a copyright issue for Snopes as well. Or they don't want someone surfing their website on another website. Not good for ad income.
