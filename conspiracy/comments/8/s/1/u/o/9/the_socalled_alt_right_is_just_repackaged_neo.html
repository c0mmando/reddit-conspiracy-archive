       It isn't any different. The term 'alt-Right' was literally chosen specifically to replace the normal designation of neo-Nazi (just like New Right and Third Position were before it), since calling yourself that wasn't cool in the halcyon days of 2010, and because it would obviously generate immediate push-back from the same people who wouldn't ally with Nazis for decades before then, and prevent politicians who couldn't openly support Nazis as political allies from joining them. So the entire term literally started as just a marketing campaign to trick the stupid and cowardly. The fact that some old school Nazis, racist skinheads, and/or gangs had a problem with the new generation of physically weak and cowardly racist dorks whose entire lives revolve around the internet a couple of times doesn't change anything. It has certainly grown to encase a 'wider variety' of white nationalists since 2010, but that is absolutely not how it started.

       Anybody who says we defeated the Naziss needs to look around. Right wing Christians and Trunp supporters are awful reactionaries and closet Nazis. We need to stand up against this resurgence. We must stand up against the normalization of far right nationalisms.

       Yeah, I just scrolled down and saw that. Going by his own statements in the past, I'm guessing he's just doing this bait people into arguing with him.

        When I was "trolling" I was experimenting with the limits of this now unfamiliar sub. After a long thread in the inside many months ago I got the idea to attack rule ten. I went around posting very controversial subjects, the main one being that the Nazi Party was inspired by left wing totalitarianism. When tmor instantly attacked the posts i was able to label the attackers tmor, or chilly, or any other veiled name for shill. I wanted to protest rule ten by going around it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of my posts are (yes I tell myself this) a complex form of satire that my post, Confessions of a Monarchist Pagan, outline. To some my humor may be trolling, but to me conspiracy would be dead if we couldn't have a laugh.

       Yes.  Historically it has been.  I'm fine with homosexuals getting civil unions.  I think the main problem is that Christians tend to think of marriage and holy matrimony as the same thing.  If one of us slaps a different name on it, it might not be such a big deal.

       Not everyone who is a Trump supporter is part of the "alt-Right", but if you're part of the "alt-Right" chances are
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       good you voted for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it another way, it would be inaccurate to say all (lets be generous and also say "most") Trump supporters are neo-Nazis, but most neo-Nazis are supporting Trump in the current American political climate.

       No, alt right was literally made up by leftist to slander the people on the other side of the aisle.  I know many many many conservative people and they don't fit any definition of nazi, but the left has definitely tried to label them as that.

       Alternative Right was a "journal" site started by Richard Spencer. It had not been a known or promoted quantity prior to this. Labeling things Alt Right since has been done by people from all sides of the political spectrum, but a poor little rich boy Neo Nazi moron coined the initial term.

       the left actually uses this word for the "middle" conservative middle class and mixed them in a pot with the real swastika on the neck nazi guys.
And now there is no middle just YOU ARE A NAZI  if you are against what we want.

       While this has certainly been done, some who claim to be Alt Right themselves have attempted to infiltrate the Trump movement and various conservative causes, deliberately muddying the waters and hiding behind the popular zeitgeist on the right. Plenty of crossover in policy wishes (if not values) as we've seen.

       Thats part of the reason they rebranded just like Monsato. Imagine the rally called Unite the White Supremists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead they could easily advertise a rally to unite the various factions of white supremists and places like The_Donald could link directly to The Daily Stormer, a website by White Supremists, and all the while much of the right at The_Donald can claim ignorance of the role the subreddit played.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is working as intended. As a side effect, it attempts to endear the Alt-Right to the right by having a similiar name. Smart marketing move by them.

       As outlined  before, the left had little to do with this. The rebranding to Alt-Right was spearheaded by White Nationalists. Likewise, The_Donald is not very inclusive to the left. It can be deduced thier advertising of White Supremist rallies was more a decision by the right.

       this guy got nothing to do with what you call the " alt right" or even the real right wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       he's a guy who was friends with the bush's and does all kinds of shit to make the people looks stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he does a rally there are his people that nobody knows and everyone on the so called "right" hates him.

       You can go to the most right wing or alt right sites on the interner and you will find no supporters pf that guy.

       Have you never heard him speak? He had a little feel-good rally in DC during Trump's inauguration, saying things like "Hail victory, hail Trump, hail our people" and regular-looking people in khakis (and a noticeable absence of swastika tattoos) were giving seig heils.

       there is no alt right believe system i don't know where you got that.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is more like this. There are people who are not left but also not skinhead or whatever nazis.
they are the around trump candidacy "alt right"
THEN comes Spencer..calls himself the leader of the alt right..talks all kinds of shit..
And the left wingers took that happily and now we are at discussions like this..
      </p>
      <p>
       While the alt right hated him since that speech and laughed about him when he got punched.
this guy had a following before the trump era "alt-right" even knew about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       i was on websites and between people who you definetely would call nazis and everyone was like who the fuck is that guy and what is he doing etc.
Then they've done their internet magic and ..right before he crowned himself leader of the alt right he was on partys with the bushs and clintons etc and they laughed in pictures and all that.
I mean..his wife who he kept secret before he started talking about ethno states is jewish shouldn't that give it away that he is not what he seems to be.

most "chads" are alt right..
Yiu kniw that the neckbeard basement dwellers are the leftists right ?
the nintendo switch face guys etc.
Sure the alt right got formerly known as anonymus in the back but even them..go on /pol..most guys there are pretty much just conservatives and people confuse it with the transsexual and incel infested /b which is dominantly left wing

       Agreed. I was raised a Jehovahs Witness and they are instructed to be very neutral politically. So no voting, being a member of a political party, etc. Now that I'm not a member I have pretty severe distaste for labels. I argue with both liberals and conservatives alike and get labeled the other when I talk to one. I'm a moderate I suppose :( I just hate the lack of progress because of the extremists on both sides.

       The label was created more for the Libertarians and Tea Party political groups. Neither of those groups were or are specifically associated with Neo-Nazi types.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the corporate politicians who decided that the new breed of Neo-Nazis that came out during the Obama administration and gained prominence during the next presidential election were to be labeled Alt right.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been quite an effective tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This hasn't been the work of the left or the right. Instead, what we are seeing is a well thought out plan by those who hold the majority power in both parties attempting to fight back against a possible revolution in the way politics work in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both political parties had lost the confidence of their base. We saw that during the last election through the support both Sanders and Trump received.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both parties are actually in a major upheaval. This creation and promotion of the alt right and alt left are designed to bring the base  back towards the center while further alienating the true progressives on both sides of the political spectrum...

       Now certainly, other small constituencies within the right's counter-culture -- MRAs, 4chan shitposters, gamergate people, etc. got on board with it, but it's core has always been racists and anti-semites.

       Racists come up with A LOT of really stupid shit all the time but they do not get amplified through major media networks. I get who came up with it man, its the way its applied when people are accusing someone I have a problem with. Again just look at the example of the sub reddit I posted its a mirror of any leftie sub now where anyone who supports conservative ideas is "alt right" and idiots can point their fat fingers and can scream NAZI!

       It didn't start getting amplified through major media until after Steve Bannon labeled Breitbart the "Home of the Alt-Right."  When a fairly high-level figure within a Presidential campaign makes a claim like that, yeah, the major media is going to look into who he's talking about.  (It also didn't help that Sebastian Gorka wore a Nazi-allied group's, Vitézi Rend, medals to Trump's

       I don't like my fellow lefties pointing fingers and screaming Nazi at people.  If for no other reason, I think it's counterproductive, but more than that, I know what it's like to be called a Stalinist, or a communist, or a tree hugger, or unamerican, or unpatriotic, or a terrorist sympathizer, or a SJW, or a Feminazi, or a cuck, or a Neville Chaimberlain, or told that liberalism is a mental disorder, or told that if I have a problem with being called any of the above, that I'm snowflake.

      <p>
       I wish we could all take a step back and lower the level of our political discourse, but I don't see that happening anytime soon, and I can't even begin to talk to fellow lefties (I've tried) about toning down their shit when there's a guy like Trump in the White House, who is all about ramping up the negative discourse.

       You have to be retarded. Are you one of those who protested the police then demanded they take all the guns away?  Socialism, communism, progressivism and liberalism all demand full government funding. This means centralized power and an out of control government. True conservative and libertarianism gives the power to the people. The problem you have is you don't want to concede that people who disagree with you deserve the same power and freedom to exist as you.

       Pro Gun I believe is supposed to be for militias. Which you are not. Militias were needed as the colonies just wanted to rape slaves and natives while pillaging the land, not create a government. So it was put into the constitution. It wasn't for right wingers to threaten killing everyone over a disagreement. Which right wingers always always do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also public shaming is not "censorship". If you feel bad about what you say or if you have a problem with a company exercising it's right to have you as an employee then I suggest you read the constitution. Otherwise you're just going to be another right wing fascist claiming everyone else is what they truly are.

       <li>
        The slave trade was not invented in 1776. The English, Dutch, French, and Spanish raped their way across the world for centuries. Americans didn't start the I'll treatment of the natives. They didn't exist yet. Europeans started that.

        Censorship?  What are you talking about?  Conservatives believe that every person should be judged on merit alone. If you want to hire, fire or serve someone that is your business. No government should regulate true fair trade.

        Your point is that you don't understand more than one idea in a single paragraph?  Point I one that a well regulated militia is necessary to ensure a free state. Point two the people have the right to bear arms. Two points. It doesn't say membership in a militia is required. Learn how to comprehend what you read.
       </li>
       <li>
        Now you are changing your original argument. I believe my first few words were that these things are terrible no matter who is responsible. You insinuated that the founders of our country invented the idea 300 years after it had started. Never did I deny anything about natives. "manifest destiny was horrible". My quote, remember.

        No threat snowflake. I was pointing out that you can move out from under mom's skirt, no one is coming to get you. Have you read a paper (liberal owned) or watched the he need ( liberal owned) recently. A lot of left wing nut jobs and criminals are shooting the hell out of people, every day. Not a lot of NRA members or CCW permit holders doing that. Oh yeah, none of the shooting events have been NRA members.  Huh. Strange.

       <li>
        Libertarianism is the definition of freedom to piss on whatever you d OK my like. Trump, religion, whatever. Freedom of speech is #1 remember. If you two say fuck the Pope that's your business. I could care less. As far as Trump is concerned, he was a rich liberal from Manhattan until he ran as a Republican. Now he is a racist somehow. He married 2 immigrants remember. Also hired the first female superintendent on a sky scrapper build in the early 80s. Gave tons of money to o Jesse Jackson for years. But you know, the R behind the name is automatically for RACIST. Right?  Also I am against dope. I think any pursuit of a buzz is wasted time and resources. If you want to concentrate the medical properties o f marijuana and administer it without the high then go ahead. But my libertarianism doesn't let me demand a government big enough to put my nose in your business. If you want my tax dollars to pay for it then I have a problem. What is wrong with porn anyway?

       Not that I disagree with you assertion regarding some of these folks, but the term 'alt right,' like most political terminology, was coined by the left.  So, if that term was chosen to replace the normal designation of neo-Nazi, then it was the left which chose to replace it.

       Nope. It was coined and popularized by the right. Richard Spencer often gets credit for making the term as popular and ubiquitous as it is, though he may have gotten the term from another member of the Right's blog.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also love to see any kind of evidence that "most political terminology" was coined by the left, but since you already failed out on this point, I'm not going to hold my breath.

       So its been years now, YEARS of the left calling/labeling anyone even 1% agreeing with the current administration, as a nazi. Disagree with me? nazi. have some questions about....  Racist! To the point where people don't beleive it, and it has become a joke/meme.

       You guys sound so simple minded when asking these questions. I'd say youre not even worth debating about conspiracies cause its obvious that msm and people that act in political interest created these words to reach their goal. But all you do is let them divide you. Meanwhile one group supports the ethic and morale side the other group the natural and logical one. When there are too many foreigners in your country and you know that 15y from now your country will turn in to a shithole because of that would you think ethically or logically? Yes, keep more migrants coming in and weaken your economy while they reproduce like rabbits in their home countries or say stop this is enough we cant allow more to join and lets try to solve the problems they suffer in their countries? Simple huh?
Why do you need people to answer these fucking stupid questions? Beeing right winged always will be a natural process of natural human thinking. Always. Remember that.

       there is no alt right believe system i don't know where you got that.

       it is more like this. There are people who are not left but also not skinhead or whatever nazis.
they are the around trump candidacy "alt right"
THEN comes Spencer..calls himself the leader of the alt right..talks all kinds of shit..
And the left wingers took that happily and now we are at discussions like this..
      </p>
      <p>
       While the alt right hated him since that speech and laughed about him when he got punched.
this guy had a following before the trump era "alt-right" even knew about him.

       i was on websites and between people who you definetely would call nazis and everyone was like who the fuck is that guy and what is he doing etc.
Then they've done their internet magic and ..right before he crowned himself leader of the alt right he was on partys with the bushs and clintons etc and they laughed in pictures and all that.
I mean..his wife who he kept secret before he started talking about ethno states is jewish shouldn't that give it away that he is not what he seems to be.
