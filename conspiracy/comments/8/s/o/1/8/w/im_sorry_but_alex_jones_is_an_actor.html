       I'll be the first to admit that I don't know Alex Jones' entire legacy. From what I hear, it's not all so bad. In the last couple years, he has been so off the rails, that I wonder whether he could be an artificial archetype for conspiracy theorists used to discredit all conspiracy theorists. Perhaps governmental involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all 3 branches of government republican controlled, and he releases what has to be the most contrived reaction to the US having bombers attack Syria. I'd love to hear when Alex got into Syrian politics. Geopolitics and the US election aside, why does he automatically care so much to want to shut off the feed that ended up getting uploaded to YouTube without him complaining?

       On top of this, you have him acting legitimately ridiculous when covering a story of drag queens teaching children to read. However you feel about the true story, it's hard to deny how over the top Alex is:

       I'm not a regular on infowars, personally, because I think it's been infiltrated. I've tried to be as unbiased as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there is more evidence to support and more evidence to refute my claim, but I think it's a worthy topic to discuss in the r/conspiracy community. I'd love to see the evidence on both sides. To be clear, I don't generally prefer to support a presidential candidate based on party. Fuck em both.

       yeah that's fucked up. But I definitely would like to get more context. Do you have any links or anything that shows him saying why he did it?

       Thing is, he doesn't do this regularly, which if he was, then cointelpro would makes sense. But a one time thing, that doesnt necessarily mean he's a psy op

       I stay the fuck away from anything to do with Alex Jones, so I don't have any other links, but to the best of my knowledge, he hasn't said anything about the gun rally.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as far as it being a one-time thing, I have no idea why he did it, because it totally exposed himself. If I had to guess, he was just taking orders, and they told him to go cause some chaos at the local gun rally so that the media coverage of the event could tell the public that the "crazy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones" rants and raves about gun control, to associate pro-2A people with crazy conspiracy theorists. It was a huge fuck up on the part of the deep state and they probably quickly realized this when it went videos came out. If he did it regularly, there would be a lot more video of him exposing himself, and his show would obviously not be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       His job is to give people who already subscribe to conspiracies limited information, and make everyone else think he and all other "conspiracy theorists" are bat shit insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what they say about Alex Jones. He is the go-to conspiracy theorist for the media. Do you really want a ranting raving lunatic representing us? Someone truly concerned with waking up the public to the atrocities committed by our government would absolutely know that acting like that is like the WORST thing you could do.

       Alex Jones may not be the real deal anymore at this point, but it's imo understandable to at least have some residue of respect for what the man's done in the past. I am of course biased, as I loved his parts in the Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly, and his Bohemian Grove docu was my entry into that rabbit hole. For that AJ will always have some cred with me, not to mention all the other docus he made/produced from 00-09, which all had at least some truth and eye opening moments in them. Just for all that I think he at least started out genuine, he seems though to have become more of a snake oil salesman and disinfo agent the last couple of years. The man did contribute greatly to the side of truth seekers however, if only for the amount of people that had their minds opened up by the subjects he broaches, to realize the extent we're being played with by TPTB.

       He was let in. That motherfucker didn't sneak himself and a cameraman into Bohemian Grove undetected. No way. It's one of the most heavily guarded places on Earth, but you think that by some miracle, of ALL PEOPLE, it was Mr. Token Conspiracy Guy himself who happened to succeed?

       That thought crossed my mind before, and it's a possibility I guess. But hey, still put the name "Bohemian Grove" in more people's minds, and made the concept of an "in club" of all the powerful fucks existing at least a bit more mainstream.

       Job Ronson, who wrote The Psychopath Test and The Men Who Stare at Goats snuck in with Alex Jones to Bohemian Grove.  Granted Ronson, has a much different take on what goes on there than Jones but they definitely weren’t let in.

       That's why you are having difficulty seeing what is right in front of you. You have a strong emotional investment in him, similar to a father figure. This is partly why they keep the same faces on television for many, many years. Creates a strong bond with the audience.

       in the end, though, I have found wayyyyy too many people, welders, construction workers, people in Europe, in India, etc who listen to him and now know what's up to see that he helped spread a global consciousness awakening to the bullshit going on, which is much more valuable than not

       This. Alex Jones is a limited hangout / gatekeeper with admitted CIA connections. His over the top behavior is intentionally ridiculous to discredit conspiracy theorists. He gives good information some of the time, but he's also guilty of serious lies of omission.

       Bill Hicks didn't somehow morph into Alex Jones- a person with an almost diametrically opposite agenda (Hicks was left, Jones is right, Hicks was pro-psychedelic drugs, Jones doesn't even want to legalize weed).

       How insulting. Hicks was the real deal, a political revolutionary who was genuinely funny, advocated deep psychedelic experiences on mushrooms and was very familiar with Terence McKenna's work. Here's Bill Hicks on the topic of government conspiracy:

       First, it's important to understand that his mission is to corral conspiracy theorists into following him and his viewpoints, ie be an effective gatekeeper. The government can't stop everyone from believing conspiracies. What they can do is control where they get their info.
      </p>
      <p>
       His first approach was from the left as Bill Hicks. This was somewhat successful. Interestingly, there's a video of Hicks doing a right-wing radio host character a la Rush Limbaugh with a gravelly voice and everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Hicks dies tragically. Some time later, Alex Jones appears on the scene. When you look at his early work, he wasn't as far right as he is today. He was more anti-government overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, it's an interesting theory with some pretty compelling evidence, but of course it's just a theory. Just don't dismiss it out of hand because it sounds crazy, because truth is stranger than fiction.

       Fuck God damn. Well thanks for in info, are you saying Stanhope works for sacred cow?

       And secondly, "AJ is Bill hicks" I hope its not true but I've been saying forever in gonna make a post here about it just to display evidence, because the theory is not bad. Maybe I'll stop being lazy and do that.

       Fuck man. So then what we can hope for is that there is no real CIA mockingbird shit going on and it really is just a big funny joke that they are in on? I'm not positive. Is it possible even for there not to have been some sort of deep state swap with the original bill hicks.

       This one will fuck you up. How is Alex so comfy on a comedy stage? Even a radio guy would have a hard time on a comedy stage in a night club right? I think so.

       Dangerous he isn't. The dumb bunnies, preppers, and paranoid people that take him seriously may be that but they'd still be that whether he was around to pander to them or not and they were there long before he came along to cash-in on them.

       He is dangerous because make legit conspiracies seem ridiculous. The moment Alex Jones hops on it, it loses credibility. Look no further than the gay frog meme.

       You need to get used to the idea that the powers that be, officialdom, and the mainstream media, will all try to dismiss and make any and every conspiracy appear to be "ridiculous" even when there is more than enough evidence for any right thinking person to take them seriously...
      </p>
      <p>
       and like Lenin said "The best way to beat the opposition is
       <em>
        to be the opposition
       </em>
       " so I seriously question just how much of the so-called opposition really is genuine no matter how credible they are or how popular they seem to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact the more credible ad popular they are the more likely they actually are to be a part of that controlled opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the most serious conspiracies like the JFK, MLK, RFK assassinations already demonstrate that the people behind those were absolutely ruthless with a long string of other highly questionable deaths that followed them that silenced all kinds of people who knew certain details or facts about those events that no one else did. How ruthless do you suppose the ones behind 9/11 who'd deliberately murder 3,000 ordinary people simply going about their business are?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if Alex Jones represented any kind of a real threat or danger to the people behind any of the conspiracies he dwells on and raves on and on about they'd shut him up and shut him down in no time flat. The same goes for a whole host of others who make a living off peddling a variety of different and conflicting versions of the conspiracies themselves.

       I first encountered Jones on Coast to Coast AM  courtesy of Art Bell.  He has always been a self serving egomaniacal shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I recall it he was a semi-regular guest who eventually was bounced from the show by Art, a rare distinction reserved for only the most notorious of B.S. artists.

       I listen everyday. For me that reaction to the bombing in Syria was impressive because he used to be more principled, more “libertarian”. He later backtracked. Overtly the problem is he has decided to back a man and the dirty politics involved over principles. Basically it’s been a lot less Lew Rockwell and Ron Paul and a lot more Roger Stone and the latest alt right superstar. Mostly icky.

       I had a discussion some time ago about a chemical being released into the environment that was feminizing frogs. Alex has long been saying the water was making the frogs gay, which is not totally correct, but close enough to correct I really wondered what his spin was about. The water was making it more likely that the frogs would be born as females. Adjustment of the prenatal hormones, I believe. Why say the frogs are turning gay? Just seems like he took the raw facts of the situation and turned it into the most inflammatory way to describe it. What's easier to refute as a relatively uninformed consumer- there's a large corporation dumping chemicals in the water system that is affecting the frog population's prenatal hormones to the point that they're breeding mostly females, or TPTB are turning the frogs gay. It just screams distraction and disinformation.

       only to those that refuse to do the work of discerning, for example, between the two perspectives you stated. Alex Jones has repeatedly expressed contempt for that class of people. How is it possible that someone of your obvious intellgence, safichulo, is not able to recognize this? He has always been this way, for better or worse.

       Not quite. Atrazine turns frogs into hermaphrodites. Jones surely knows this, so he must have some ulterior agenda with the "they're turning the frogs gay" thing. Either that or he's got the IQ of a clump of moss, but the former seems more likely.

       It could be an attempt to turn liberals and moderates away from the conspiracy theory community, as those groups tend to shy away from homophobia and things touched by it.

       Turning the frogs gay implies that there are chemicals used in an agenda to turn people gay. It's not explicitly stated, but the take away I've gotten from lots of people is that it's part of an agenda to increase homosexuality to decrease population.

       I always have to laugh when I see homosexuality and depopulation conflated. They seem to forget that attraction to the opposite sex is not a requirement for reproduction
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       child rearing. Currently opposite sex couples in America are only twice as likely per capita to be raising children as same sex couples. Where there's a will, there's a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then I suppose fear mongering is most effective among those who are allergic to research.

       Indeed. Propaganda in all its forms are frightening enough once you witness the effectiveness at massaging people's desire to identify in a society run by individualism. Throw in sensationalist claims and you can work people into a rage of belonging against the opposition.

       Looked at jones' twitter yesterday and saw his promotion of the Fonda tweet. So many people overlooked the context that I simply could not believe it was organic. What I saw on jones' feed confirmed that even those who claim to be against "fake news" will still chug from a different flavor of kool aid. The only difference is that they are more unaware they are doing so, and actively claim they are too smart for that.

       It will be hard to verify 100% a this time. There are only the chan threads that uncovered this left to verify, but the proof those chan threads link to doesn't exist anymore since the website where Alex stole the pic from took down this pic in the meantime and also did Alex take down the video where he was crying about this pic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex was showing a picture of a girl sitting in front of a piano, but the lower half of the pic was blacked out, because it was "too disturbing and explicit to show to you." Then he cried about how fucked up this is. (claimed it came from Anthony Weiner's laptop I think)
The chans cropped and reverse searched that image and found it on a site advertising for piano lessons.
Girl was just sitting there in underware, but not at all explicit or even suggestive in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably can still find the chan posts by googling for keywords like "Alex jones fake cp piano lesson"

       Alex has been around since the early 90's at least. He has actually done some pretty decent work over the years. His bohemian grove expose was actually really good. Today however, I genuinely question his sanity. The type of outlandish shit that comes out of his mouth nowadays, and his over the top baptist televangelist preacher/ wwf wrestler / cartoon baffoonery / yelling persona is completely repulsive. I dont know if he was infiltrated at some point or if he was just CIA plant from day one. Sometimes I think he is just character acting as a form of ironic/absurdist comedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       He s clearly a disinformationist of the highest caliber. For the past few years, even before this last election, he had lost any credibility in my eyes. Based on the knowledge he previously revealed about the levels of corruption in both parties, and the corruption of the US gov't system as a whole, it's kind of surprising to see how he has become so partisan. He's really trying hard to push the narrative that Trump is this rogue maverick that is genuinely for the people. We will see in time he's just like all the others before him, (but thats a whole different topic) Alex really used to come across as somewhat open minded and nonpartisan.
      </p>
      <p>
       He gained some legit influence and popularity over time, and mainstream exposure and exposing conspiracies just dont mix well. He probably figured out it's a lot more profitable to push a specific political agenda then it is to just educate and inform for the sake of educating and informing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's really ended up doing a lot of damage to all conspiracy movements. People tend to oversimplify things and think in stereotypes. So now anytime you offer any alternate theories or question official versions of events the only comparison that is in most peoples minds is the most popular conspiracy theorist, so the response is, "oh, your just one of those Alex Jones types."

       His New World Order videos, particularly Endgame, are pretty good summary documentaries for when you're first stepping into the rabbit hole, and I really liked his appearances in Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly. He's certainly a gateway/gatekeeper but really everybody interprets everything on their own. With Alex Jones there is nothing too extreme or out there just like on Coast to Coast - it's easy to say there's either covert support coming to him from the establishment because they're controlling him, or that they merely tolerate him because of how radicalizing he is, - but I would personally like to think that he's genuine and simply imperfect because he's trying to appeal to the simpleton average American.

       I totally agree with that post. Jones is doing a lot of harm and completely lacks integrity. However, I think he's a profiteer, whose father was a fire and brimstone preachers, not actually a government agent. He's got a massive ego and desperately needs to eat some psychedelic mushrooms, but that's not going to happen.

       Exactly. He was a local crank in Austin, on the public-access channel. The Austin filmmaker Richard Linklater found him so over the top that he made bit roles for Jones (in the animated/rotoscoped movies "A Scanner Darkly" and "Waking Life"). The British documentary filmmaker/journalist Jon Ronson included Jones in a British documentary and accompanying book, "Them: Adventures With Extremists." This gave Alex Jones some valuable visibility, and during the Bush 43 presidency and many scandals/outrages (Katrina, Iraq, etc.) Jones got a lot of web traffic. But his material was too overblown to get good advertising even during the blog boom of the mid/late 2000s. He saw the advertisers that *did* want to sponsor his podcast and websites, and they were sketchy little companies selling vitamin supplements and "prepper" supplies. So he started branding this stuff himself and selling it mail-order out of his Texas office. That's his whole business.

       I spent the whole time thinking he was going to derail the entire pedogate investigation, muddying the waters with a whole bunch of nonsense about interdimensional, shape-shifting child molesters. And it unfolded 100% like that. He wouldn't even honestly represent the Wikileaks emails correctly, making easily debunkable, exaggerated claims that could then be safely "debunked" as the primary evidence. He's a gatekeeper if I've ever seen one.

       He's great. Been following him since about 2000. He won me over with his exposé of bohemian grove and being ok with his vhs tapes being copied to spread the message as long as they were given away for free. You have to realize that a lot of conspiracy stuff was consumed by small print books and VHS tapes before the prevalence of the internet and conspiracy theorists were pretty copyright centric but AJ just wanted the message spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's sensationalist in his presentation for sure but you kinda have to be on radio to avoid being boring. Real conspiracy research is dates, places, names and very very boring. So his style is meant to be engaging.

       You gotta understand that given the nature of the very conspiracies he describes, people like AJ would be out there to discredit these conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's hard to believe, but there's a reason all these people in the thread are saying he's one of the bad guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this video will help. He shows up at a pro 2nd amendment rally in his hometown of Austin, TX and randomly starts yelling crazy stuff in his bullhorn while there was another guy leading the rally trying to speak to the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crowd complains that they can't hear the speaker, and begging him to stop. They even were trying to get him to come up and speak in front of the crowd because they thought he was on their side.
      </p>
      <p>
       He kept just yelling random nonsense and almost ended up in physical fights with people there, and the guy leading the rally said that they were going to have to stop the rally because "someone doesn't want to play nice", obviously referring to Jones drowning out the speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       People from the rally caught on pretty quick and called him out as a disinfo agent, and said "you're not part of the team!" "you're a provocateur" "proof that AJ is working for the bad guys" etc.
      </p>

        Here's the video.
       </a>
       It's probably the best evidence, if not proof that he's a deepstate shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like to complain about the editing job of the video, but don't let that distract you from what's going on.

       What I dont understand is how he maintains such a following even after his "Y2K Special".
That should tell you everything you need to know about his methods...
      </p>
      <p>
       I wont lie, I used to listen to him myself.  But literally every time it was "the country is going to implode in July" or "the government is taking your guns at the end of 2016" etc etc. Well none of us are being thrown on trains to the nearest Wal-Mart concentration camp!
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure he's entertaining and maybe that's how he has become so popular. But I honestly think he does more harm then good. Peddling horrible products at an extreme mark up. There are plenty of great people with their own youtube channels/podcasts who are completely legit and on the up and up. I say support those smaller guys instead of buying the latest InfoWars silver detox kit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess Ill never get it. It's almost a cult-like mentality with some listeners and they believe every word as gospel. Its crazy.

       I'd say he's waking people up to some heavy anger and a very zenophobic way of looking at the world. He says Bernie Sanders supporters are terrible people, which is false and divisive. He doesn't support legalizing weed which is unfortunate. He's a profiteer, not a truth seeker.

       If you get your card to grow, you won't be put in prison for growing. If you're caught with personal amounts of weed in a decriminalized state, they don't take it away. How about you do some fact checks before you start saying I'm false.

       They do take it away, or they are allowed to. Come on, man. Decriminalization means it's still illegal. It's treated like a traffic ticket, but it's still a crime, and you can get a ticket. And most medical states are very restrictive; you can't just get a card to grow. Where do you live?

       I've always felt that he is a gatekeeper for the elite. He mixes in truth with disinformation and misinformation. He is the gatekeeper for those who want to fight or defend by force. While someone like David Icke is a gatekeeper fir the whole "we need to unite as one, we can't fight them toe to toe".
      </p>
      <p>
       A gatekeeper is someone who harbors in people who are seeking truth or are puppets by nature.

       No, and I'm not disagreeing with you. The conspiracy lies in the fact that Alex deliberately aggrandized that the frogs were "turning gay" to steer the course of conversation away from a company dumping chemicals that made prenatal frogs more likely to be born female:

       I listened to Cooper right from the early 90s. Have his Babylon series. Cooper was not perfect and was, IMHO, far more wacky and unstable than Jones. Cooper hated literally everyone who dared disagree with him or was a competing voice in the alternative media.

       He's a total crank and nutjob.  But I will say that his first 3 or 4 documentaries were required viewing for me back in the day.  He could spin a compelling yarn back then.  I'd never heard of Bohemian Grove, so that was opening.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm still waiting for the foreign troops to take over in service of the one world government.  The videos and website had a lot of that. You were supposed to be terrified that foreign troops training on American soil to imprison us all.

       And every urban training exercise was the worst thing ever.

       Simply money.

      <p>
       I even thought that conspiracy stuff is easy money.  I'm sure many of you have thought that too.  Hey I could start a channel and do outrageous stupid shit and get paid.  Right?  Not like we have the internet to find lots of topics.

       Government is possible, they just covertly pay him to continue being a complete idiot.  It honestly makes sense.  Distract people and he just wants money.  Easy shit right there.

       We all know pay offs happen, so a stupid thing like him seems obvious.

       Alex Jones has commodified conspiracy theories. He's a huckster and literally is in the business of packaging and selling conspiracies to his "audience" for profit. And as with many things packaged and sold for profit there is, let's say, some "creative marketing" involved.

       The awakening we all have experienced has been in the elites plans for a long long time. Its all part of the plan. They need alot of woke people for some reason, so that one day there will be a huge clash of some sorts. We may even believe we win that war, when that happens, but we wont. We will all be chained to the blockchain some years down the line.

       Alex Jones isn't an actor; he's an agent He admitted he has family in the CIA. He hires employees straight out of Stratfor, the Israeli Intelligence firm. He shows up to pro-gun rallies with his bullhorn, an issue he supports, but for some reason, he attempts to shuts it down. Not even O'Reilly or Limbaugh act as over-the-top as he does. He wont say shit about Zionism or Israel, the biggest red flag of all. I agree with probably 90% of what he says, but he poisons the well and there's no reason to listen to him.

       Has anyone else listened to his podcast with Joe Rogan? It changed my opinion a lot of him and it was interesting to hear him talk about things a little more calmly and put together. I honestly don’t know what to think of the guy at this point and see the validity to all of the points everyone is making. Just wanted to know if anyone else listened to it and what they thought. It made him out to be just a guy who wants to find the truth but can’t help himself from going waaaaaay over the top when he delivers the information. His points make a lot more sense when he isn’t shouting and is coherently delivering the information, idk man it’s confusing

       Sensatiolism gets views. So in reality everyone becomes an actor. You want the biggest actor in the news atm? You trump and his family, they are contantly pulling stunt to get hype going.

       More of the royal you. I need to transition away from that, posting on the internet, never really speaking to just one person, so I use 'you' interchangibly from general for everyone to directly reference a previous poster. Which is the same shortfalls as trying to show emotions or sarcasm via text. Never works right, everyone has their own interpretations of the words.

       I've met him several times and used to listen to his show a lot around 2001-2006. While he is a natural showman and intense radio personality, he's not faking it. He believes what he says. His jumping on the Trump train I found a bit out of character for him, so I don't know if he struck some kind of deal. Although, I do get the fact that AJ has always been anti-establishment and Trump was not the establishment choice for president, so he's got some common ground. I don't share his worldview and find his forever-doomsday vibe a turnoff, nevertheless, his show has served as a powerful tool for whistleblowers and journalists exposing parts of the news that don't and won't get reported on by the mainstream. Of course, like anything, you have to take it all with lots of salt. The guy is/was on the radio something like 6 hours a day for the last 15 whatever years, so yeah. He's "on record" saying lots. He's not right all the time, and his ego gets in his way. Still, he's been proven right about many important things (and of course wrong about many things too)
