    <div class="md"><p>The narrative of the shooter is meaningless since the whole fucking thing was staged. No bullets, no ballistics, just sounds from speakers and crisis actors. The entire country and Vegas itself has all but forgotten about it because it didn&#39;t happen. There are no victims stories, reflections, or exposes. Nothing, just poof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously staged -- shows no gunshot wounds, medical activity, or bullet damage. Star of video admits he has no training. Just cheap moulage -- very cheap, not graphic at all. </p>

<p>This footage was available within 48 hours of the event and it is still the &quot;go-to&quot; video to &quot;prove&quot; that people were shot. How unlikely is that if this were a real shooting? There would be a mountain of videos like this by now as well as documentation of healing wounds, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I feel you. But there’s a reason they do it and it’s because it has a very very high success rate.  Luckily I used Cannabis at a young age and I’ve learned that’s one reason cannabis is still illegal federally because it basically makes your subconscious immune to any subliminal influences.  But I’m there in hope with you Bro. </p>

If such a graph existed for humanities ease of life the trump dip wouldn&#39;t even be visible if you went back a few hundred years. Tech is still improving life faster than we can destroy it. It is beyond amazing how we defy the odds century after century all the way back to when we ran with our cousins(other bipedal apes). Why would I Fuck this ride up with a physical revolution when I&#39;m on the coolest ride that has ever existed. I&#39;ll play the long game and hope being a good person is enough.</p>

They don’t even realize that the foundation for Vegas strong is a scam by Ceaser’s Entertainment group. They’ve gotten millions of dollar from the Vegas strong shit. And they’ve only helped 14 families. And a spokes person for “Vegas strong” went on the news and said they weren’t going to be helping any more. They’ve only given out like 10% of their donations to families. (Those are all rough numbers) </p>

<p>I’ve talked to a few that don’t believe it. But the majority of them I’ve talked to think I’m crazy because i don’t settle for what’s on the news I guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newly available evidence, previously under seal, undermines media narratives that the Pulse Nightclub shooter had a motive to attack an LGBT nightclub. Mateen scouted other venues that night that were wholly unrelated to the LGBT community, but they were too defended by armed guards and police.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/05/as-the-trial-of-omar-mateens-wife-begins-new-evidence-undermines-beliefs-about-the-pulse-massacre-including-motive/">https://theintercept.com/2018/03/05/as-the-trial-of-omar-mateens-wife-begins-new-evidence-undermines-beliefs-about-the-pulse-massacre-including-motive/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The motion filed by Salman’s lawyers makes clear that in the days leading up to the Pulse attack, and indeed on the day of the attack itself, Mateen scoped out and considered numerous venues – such as Disney properties and shopping malls – none of which had any connection to the LGBT community or gay life. Moreover, once Mateen decided to attack nightclub, his phone records reveal that he searched for “Orlando nightclubs”  – not “LGBT clubs” or “gay bars.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a recent example in The Guardian where they assumed as fact that Omar Mateen was a self-hating homophobe and that the Pulse Nightclub shooting was &quot;homophobic.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But self-loathing can turn deadly. Omar Mateen, who committed America’s most deadly homophobic attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in 2016, pledged his allegiance to Isis but was also alleged to have made sexual advances towards men. His ex-wife said she believed he was gay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm while that is all interesting to note, and important to the narrative, it doesn&#39;t necessarily discount that he wasn&#39;t just looking for degenerates, capitalist pigs, or infidels in general and picked this as being the most degenerate, aside from the security concerns. It also doesn&#39;t make his phone call irrelevant either, as all of these are targets worthy of jihad. Still, I&#39;ll take into mind what you&#39;ve posted. You have to admit at least we have way more details about Mateen than we do Paddock, not to mention Paddock&#39;s brother being left off the hook which is even stranger... </p>

<p>Hmm, almost like he came and left more than once.  Possibly he arrived once with no luggage (because he had brought it all in already) and this is what the valet is referring to.  Unless that valet worked 24/7 and had perfect recall memory, he may not have seem the times he arrived w/ baggage.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we know from LVMPD footage that the Campos of the day fired into the hotel room, he says this on camera, </p>

<p>Well, if he&#39;s truly a nobody security guard, after a day with this much excitement you may have misremembered or wanted to make himself sound more manly, or maybe he did fire into the room from an angle or somewhere meaningless.  Not sure what your claim is on this.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and they used a fat clone on the Ellen show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, someone you&#39;d never met IRL and had only found pics of online (possibly from sources that manipulated/misidentified the photos), but you can tell it&#39;s a fat clone?  Not that you are comparing a picture of a stranger from 3-5 years ago to today?  Could you PM me a link to your FB so I can go through your pics and grab 2 of them with some subtle change so I can claim you are also a clone?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Newly available evidence, previously under seal, undermines media narratives that the Pulse Nightclub shooter had a motive to attack an LGBT nightclub. Mateen scouted other venues that night that were wholly unrelated to the LGBT community, but they were too defended by armed guards and police.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/05/as-the-trial-of-omar-mateens-wife-begins-new-evidence-undermines-beliefs-about-the-pulse-massacre-including-motive/">https://theintercept.com/2018/03/05/as-the-trial-of-omar-mateens-wife-begins-new-evidence-undermines-beliefs-about-the-pulse-massacre-including-motive/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The motion filed by Salman’s lawyers makes clear that in the days leading up to the Pulse attack, and indeed on the day of the attack itself, Mateen scoped out and considered numerous venues – such as Disney properties and shopping malls – none of which had any connection to the LGBT community or gay life. Moreover, once Mateen decided to attack nightclub, his phone records reveal that he searched for “Orlando nightclubs”  – not “LGBT clubs” or “gay bars.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a recent example in The Guardian where they assumed as fact that Omar Mateen was a self-hating homophobe and that the Pulse Nightclub shooting was &quot;homophobic.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But self-loathing can turn deadly. Omar Mateen, who committed America’s most deadly homophobic attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in 2016, pledged his allegiance to Isis but was also alleged to have made sexual advances towards men. His ex-wife said she believed he was gay.</p>
