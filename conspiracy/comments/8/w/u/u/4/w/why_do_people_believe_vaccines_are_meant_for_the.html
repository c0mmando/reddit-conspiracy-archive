        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you have had business courses, or if you have any working experience, one thing you surely have learned is that the one motivation of a business is : money.</p>

<p>With no $ income, there is no business. And for the business to prosper, the company has to always generate more money. That&#39;s just how it works.</p>

<p>Now, why would it be different for pharmaceutical companies ? what is the business of pharmaceutical companies ? They are not non-profit companies. They are for-profit. <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/value/2015/07/19/7-facts-you-probably-dont-know-about-big-pharma.aspx">Actually, big pharma, together with the banks, is the most profitable industry. It&#39;s also one of largest in market value</a></p>

<p>They are in the business of manufacturing drugs meant to heal whatever disease they claim they can heal.</p>

<p>Now, if this industry is going to manufacture vaccines, there has to be a money incentive. Only in the world of tinky winky and laa laa they would do it just because they are sad and can&#39;t sleep at night at the idea that some poor little children somewhere on this planet die of diseases that could potentially be prevented with the help of a syringe.</p>

<p>The industry that is among the biggest, and that returns the highest profits of all, would venture into manufacturing a product that makes them very little to no income ? And that would eradicate some diseases (less potential future income) ? and prevent some diseases with no side-effects whatsoever ?</p>

<p>Does that make sense to you ? It doesn&#39;t to me.</p>

<p>They have to be making some money one way or another with the vaccines. If it&#39;s not with the vaccines directly (the promoters of vaccines online constantly repeat that big pharma makes very little to no money with the vaccines), then they have a business case for generating $$$ another way, like I don&#39;t know, the long list of potential side effects, whose number of victims could be statistically estimated.</p>

<p>Now, imagine you are one important shareholder of one pharmaceutical company, and this company&#39;s CEO says : &quot;we are going to invest tons of $ in measles vaccine research, then manufacture a vaccine against this disease. However, we will sell it with a very low profit margin. We hope to eradicate this disease within 10 years (=we won&#39;t need to sell this vaccine anymore)&quot;. What&#39;s your reaction ? It will probably be : &quot;WTF!&quot;, followed by many exclamation marks and all kinds of insults that go through your head. Then : &quot;how does that even make a business case ? It&#39;s a no for me, end of the discussion. Another such idea, and we are going to hunt for another CEO&quot;</p>

<p>Big pharma is in the business of selling drugs and medical treatments. In order to make more money, they need to sell more drugs. And in order to sell more drugs, they need more people sick. A 5yo will understand that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know enough about medical science to give an informed answer. All I know is that people don&#39;t get polio (and many other diseases) anymore, so being completely against the vaccines as a whole seems like a mistake, as does using &quot;unvaccinated people don&#39;t get the diseases&quot; when they&#39;re living in a place where most everyone else is vaccinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if you are right about Polio, that&#39;s a vaccine schedule of 1 vaccine, not 70.</p>

<p>However I would warn people about the Polio vaccine, as it&#39;s been admitted it contains a cancer-causing virus.  It&#39;s also been discovered that what we thought of as Polio outbreaks were actually DDT poisoning.  Polio is really a disease of poor sanitation, so not a worry in the first world.  Most people with Polio would get no symptoms whatsoever, so we are causing more harm by using vaccines which regularly induce brain damage and cancer.</p>

Clean water is a Governmental operation. As far as vaccination, there are several necessary and positive vaccinations. However getting a vaccine ion the schedule is a gold mine for big Pharma. And I most certainly could be wrong, but there is little or no study of the interactions or the delivery schedule of vaccines. Science is open and honest. Unfortunately this is an area in which massive profit can eclipse the public good. </p>

<p>And why do you think that trust has been broken ? Can you, generally speaking, realistically expect to cheat/fool/betray someone over and over again, and have this same person to blindly trust you ? If you still have trust, maybe you&#39;re a fool, that&#39;s what you are.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good that you mention this, because if I had to imagine again like in my OP a meeting between one company&#39;s CEO and one of its main shareholders, it could go like this (regardless of what the science has to say about herd immunity) : </p>

<p>CEO : &quot;So, we have a good narrative to maximize the sales figures. We have to achieve &quot;herd immunity&quot; in order to get rid of the disease, which is a goal anyone will want to reach. Now, listen to this : this herd immunity comes when at least 95% of the population buys our product. We can even legally mandate buying this product. How about that?&quot;</p>

<p>Shareholder : &quot;wow! it&#39;s like you just got a license to print money. Apart from energy supply maybe, I can&#39;t think of any product that at least 95% of the whole population would be committed to buy. This makes like the best business case ever. I can smell the sweet dollars dropping into my bank account by the millions already. Be sure that I will vote in favor of a raise of your pay at the next shareholders assembly&quot;</p>

<p>My point is, I don&#39;t know whether this herd immunity concept is valid or not, but I know for sure it makes a very good narrative to maximize sales, which is the goal of any private for-profit company.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Herd immunity is a valid “thing”. It is taught in immunology classes all over the world, so not a local belief. It all started when a scientist noticed that milkmaids who had cowpox never got smallpox (yes, the viruses are related). Take some scabs, inoculate most people in the village - everyone is saved from the smallpox. What about those who refused the needle? The others were not sick, so those around them didn’t give them smallpox. “Their herd” protected them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/07/14/yolo-county-officials-perplexed-by-unusual-spike-in-whooping-cough-cases/">Why didnt the herd immunity work in this case ?</a> </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t we apply the process you described to aids ? It&#39;s well known that some people (somewhere in Africa at least) are naturally immune to hiv. Couldn&#39;t we take scabs from them and inoculate to others, see if that saves everyone too ? </p>

<p>If not, maybe the right conclusion is that herd immunity does not apply for each and every disease. </p>

<p>In the case of measles, we can read that the vaccine is 80-90&amp;#37; effective (hard to give a precise number). And we need 95&amp;#37; of people vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Which means it will never be reached. Not even with 100&amp;#37; vaccinated.</p>

<p>We also read that actually getting measles gives you a very good, life long immunity. Whereas with the vaccine, you get up to a 20 years long immunity, and if i&#39;m not mistaken, it&#39;s not even a good immunity that you develop because you can still get it. The 2nd shot being given at 18 months, that means any adult who didn&#39;t get measles as a child, who was vaccinated, becomes a threat to society, passed 20yo, and becomes exposed himself/herself.</p>

<p>I believe you that they teach about herd immunity at medical schools. I am just questioning things. If you can answer, i&#39;m happy to read you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow... I think many of you need to seperate your hatred and lack of trust in pharmaceutical companies (which I am one), and separate it totally from the immunisation issue</p>

<p>jsut because the industry has become untrustworthy does not mean the concept of vaccinations is.</p>

<p>there is a damned good reason WHO said it is one of the most important advancements of our civilisation</p>

<p>I am guessing none of you have shared a classroom with people who wear metal braces thanks to Polio...</p>

<p>or have a kid living across the road from yo cause his family is anti-vax yet his schools has been hit by an outbreak... you got kids? I for one am pretty pisssed at the decisions of the people cross the road putting my family at an increased risk cause some bastard from Germany went on a world tour spreading disease...  yeah, good luck wit that</p>

<p>I suppose you lot thought typhoid Mary should have been allowed to go about her day.....</p>

<p>This is all fear mongering. I knew someone who drown. I still go swimming weekly. I have relatives who died of cancer, most probably because of exposure to nuclear radiations. I still consume electricity at home that comes from nuclear plants. I know of people who died in car accidents. Yet I own a car that I use very regularly. </p>

<p>You get the point. You have an anecdote about a guy (with a weak immune system) who got crippled by polio. We all have anecdotes. And the Earth keep revolving around the Sun.</p>

<p>Now, why don&#39;t you answer my questions. They are valid questions. Or are you here just to spread fear and parrot the &quot;keep quiet and vaccinate&quot; mantra ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you think about it, it should not even be posted on this sub. Because it&#39;s not a conspiracy. Pharmaceutical companies, like companies selling tyres, hammers, diapers, shampoo, whatever, aim at maximizing sales and profits. That&#39;s capitalism 101. Try and make such a post on another sub however, and you be called a conspiracy nuts who enjoys seeing sad little defenseless children die.</p>

<p>Like I said to someone else, I don&#39;t know whether there is such a thing as herd immunity, but what I know, is that this concept makes for the best business case ever. You are convincing people that every single person has to buy your product (and do it several times). How awesome is that in terms of business ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the diseases prevented by vaccines were targeted because of the horrible way that babies died who were exposed to someone sick in the community. Our babies now in the US just die from poverty, abuse &amp; neglect, not from Haemophilus influenza sepsis or diphtheria. Families are spared the trauma of consistently losing one or more children to infectious diseases. But, I do agree that we have gone overboard. Chicken pox deaths were real, but not very common (as opposed to polio, back in the day). Did we REALLY need that vaccine? On the other hand, I cut my fingers all the time, so if you can give me some shots to keep tetanus away, sign me up please!</p>

<p>Absolutely this. From my experience browsing content related to vaccines, there is nowhere near as much outrage and violence, when you ask questions on other yet very sensitive topics, such as nine eleven or even WW2 related events. Vaccines has become like a religion. You cannot even ask questions. You can only say amen and shut your mouth and whip yourself if needed.</p>
