    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s no more proof that it&#39;s a LARP than half the stuff naive people call proof of conspiracy.</p>

<p>Consider that if Q is on AF1 and took a picture, anyone who didn&#39;t know who he was on the plane would be able to figure it out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to think of Q, I&#39;m not really following what&#39;s going on that well.  But &quot;proof&quot; seems to be replacing the word &quot;evidence&quot; in a lot of places.  Evidence can be circumstantial, which is not proof of anything.  Words matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s the same issue, because the same people who believe in Q know that the MSM lies.  They want to cling to anyone who is giving them something they can verify to be true later.  Even if Q isn&#39;t who he says he is, the number of coincidences in info drops is still probably higher than the number of truths the MSM tells.</p>

<p>I do agree that it looks bad.  But optics do not equal The Truth.  How many outrages occur daily on the internet, only for people to later find out that they didn&#39;t have the whole picture? </p>

<p>Q being who he says he is could be false while his information remains largely true.  Time will tell.  If this is the death knell of Q, then we won&#39;t be hearing much more from him.  Wouldn&#39;t <em>you</em> agree?</p>

<p>This is what Q said:</p>

<p>&quot;Who would have thought the &#39;Twitter&#39; phone could be so useful. Do &#39;reflections&#39; violate NAT SEC rules? Where must one be located in order to obtain a reflection on the back of a phone of that image? Image provided here has been distorted (stretched). Q&quot;</p>

<p>This is what Q said:</p>

<p>&quot;Who would have thought the &#39;Twitter&#39; phone could be so useful. Do &#39;reflections&#39; violate NAT SEC rules? Where must one be located in order to obtain a reflection on the back of a phone of that image? Image provided here has been distorted (stretched). Q&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assume everything is bullshit and go digging for something to probe. File away ideas for future testing. As events come to pass make mental note of credibility of differing sources, only way to assess sources of intel is to watch credibility over time.</p>

<p>Q style has provided entertainment that touched on interesting history to delve into. The style was largely horoscope, especially early on. Take it for entertainment value, but when horoscope says today is going to be a good day look external signs supporting the claim.</p>

<p>Assuming best case scenario. The boogieman is real and real progress is moving forward to lock them away -- not a LARP. Every day there exists risk that the platform be taken over and redirected. That probability increases over time as the Q approach is analyzed and new strategies field tested to redirect. What would that look like?</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t like is that the platform turned to cheerleading. Encouraged sit on the sidelines waiting patient and docile. Blind trust -- not research, field hypotheses, discredit claims and build out bigger body of research. Q started to spoon-feed and slow-walk people. As opposed to individuals taking lead on decentralized analysis campaigns quickly chewing through source documents such as the Clinton emails.</p>

<p>The accounts circling Q jumped the shark as well. We began seeing the PC-culture style of attack and destroy any disagreement in the room. That suggests to me we&#39;ve got some cheaply paid reputation management operating around the community doing a lazy job of their work. That same style of lazy attack-and-destroy-any-disagreement readily visible over at politics and often in this sub. There&#39;s been plenty of opportunity to tune in and spot that style of attack as people operating in the reputation management space balloon.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the Scientology style cascading levels of private subs floating around out there. Promote Q and their messaging, you&#39;ll find yourself invited to some private rooms. Cough up some personal details and really dedicate, you slide on down to the next level. Beyond idle curiosity such places are to be avoided. Be a ghost. Engage widely to maximize visibility of your personal research. If you&#39;re being dragged down into private sub spaces your time and efforts are being redirected out of sight. You&#39;ve been too effective. Stay on the move and put the majority of time practicing free association and seeking out fresh takes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with it because it&#39;s true. We should all be extremely cautious, careful not to get too carried away, and search our emotions when trying to prove or debunk something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a q reader, and I don&#39;t see how I&#39;m being taken advantage of.  I now read the relevant court documents.  I listen to the entire speech.    Hell, I even tuned in for the entire hearings of Rosenstein, as well as the Wray and Horowitz testimony.  Sure as hell tuning into the Strzok hearings no doubt!<br/>
I think the problem lies with people who don&#39;t take in all the facts, and start cherry picking those bits that fit their narrative.  As far as the picture, with all things Q, there are cases being made that it wasn&#39;t but it is, but it wasn&#39;t.  With all the proofs that Q has made, focusing on one pictures out of the hundreds seems also like you&#39;re just cherry picking the pieces that fit your narrative.  No worries, you&#39;re free to do that.<br/>
Before I go I will add that I keep it in the back of my mind that Q could be a pysop.  I think as long as you realize this, the information being uncovered by the anons is astounding, and very interesting.<br/>
If nothing else, it&#39;s the greatest form of entertainment I&#39;ve ever experienced.  If this is the future of LARPing, sign me up, point me to the gofundmepage, I&#39;ll green light production of season 2 of Q right now! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is a farce, to keep 4fags and weaponized autism on a wild goose chase instead of using their obsessiveness and skills to piece together actual real conspiracies.. Than it pisses off the other half of the conspiracy population seeing half the community enamored with such obvious bullshit and than infighting in the subs.. Just keeps us running in circles, just like our 2 party system that sees the US keep the same foreign policy&#39;s no matter who sits in the oval office. Quit being dragged along by this guy&#39;s I mean seriously. </p>
