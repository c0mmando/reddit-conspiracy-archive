        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have another conspiracy theory to share with you all.  Similar my previous analysis <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vr9h4/an_analysis_of_the_limousine_liberal_attack_on/">on the &quot;Limousine Liberal&quot; attack on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, I hope to provide an interesting case study in how propaganda or fake news is spread, from right-biased publications to social media.  I&#39;ll also provide some evidence and speculation on more sinsister connections.  Here are the highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Since last year, social media, and right-biased media sources have pushed an inaccurate story that the <a href="https://i.redd.it/dirjfee0cb811.jpg">Candadian government has passed a law to take children away from their parents over gender identity issues.</a></li>
<li>The story originates from a bill passed last year in Ontario.  Concerns over the inclusion gender identity as a wellness criteria are misrepresented by right-biased news sources to produce the smear.</li>
<li>The smear gained traction after it was disseminated on Facebook and other social media sites.</li>
<li>A suspicious facebook page, similar to now defunct Facebook groups used by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43093390">Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA)</a> played an essential role in the smear&#39;s promulgation on social media.<br/></li>
</ul>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Earlier this week I posted an analysis <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vr9h4/an_analysis_of_the_limousine_liberal_attack_on/">on the &quot;Limousine Liberal&quot; attack on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>.  I showed how it originated from a Breitbart.com attack, and how it was disseminated on reddit by a handful of suspicious accounts.  I presented weak evidence (which many disagreed with) that the accounts were similar to those used by the IRA.   </p>

<p>Yesterday, a rapidly rising thread on <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a> caught my attention.  <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/8wlsee/your_child_now_belongs_to_the_state_this_is_a/">&quot;Your child now belongs to the state&quot;</a> it blared.  (Full disclosure: I wrote comments on that thread with much of the same information I&#39;ll present here.)  The thread hits the top of <a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a>, with a current score of 2.1k.</p>

<p>The same <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8wjc87/lgbt_news_and_as_usual_canada_is_just_infinitely/">content also appeared on /r/The_Donald today</a>, currently at a score of 7.2k.  Both of the users who posted those threads are new accounts, the poster on The_Donald registered just 5 days ago.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing about these posts was the source, which purports to be a pro-LGBT Facebook page.  I spent some time tracking down the origination of the smear, and also it&#39;s connection to the Facebook page shown in the reddit submissions.</p>

<h1>Origination</h1>

<p>The smear regards a piece of legislation in the Legislative Assembly of Ontaria: Bill 89, <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/mcys/en/2017/06/ontario-passes-legislation-to-strengthen-child-welfare-and-improve-outcomes-for-youth.html">Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act, 2017</a>.   The <a href="https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-41/session-2/bill-89/status-of-business">bill is passed</a> on June 1st, 2017.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/78yz3y/heres-the-new-bill-canadas-far-right-is-freaking-out-about">Vice News reports on Bill 89:</a>:</p>

<p>&amp;amp;amp;gt; The bill is a sweeping overhaul of the province&#39;s child aid and youth justice systems. It has just recently passed its second reading in the legislation without anyone voting nay (this includes the Tories,) and, this week, will be going through it&#39;s final committee review. It has been dubbed by the Liberals as &quot;historic&quot; and criticized by youth advocates as being too weak.</p>

<p>&amp;amp;amp;gt; Alongside many other changes, the bill has updated the criteria for analyzing the wellbeing of a child to match the human rights code. These include &quot;a child&#39;s or young person&#39;s race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, family diversity, disability, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.&quot;</p>

<p>Between January and June of 2017, several Christian online publications, including <a href="https://arpacanada.ca/news/2017/03/09/bill-89-human-rights-dont-buy/">arpacanada.ca</a> and <a href="https://christiantimes.com/article/ontario-approves-measure-that-allows-government-to-take-children-from-parents-who-oppose-gender-ideology/72273.htm">ChristianTimes.com</a> publish increasingly hyperbolic criticism of the bill.    </p>

<p>BuzzFeed reports on the article on June 12th:  <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ishmaeldaro/ontario-bill-89-gender-changes?utm_term=.gf2DeGDqB#.nuJr3Nr5P">No, Canada Will Not Take Your Child Away If You Disagree With Their Gender Identity</a>.  </p>

<p>When the bill passes on June 1st, the criticism is picked up by dozens of conservative and alt right publications.  The first specific claim that the government will take children appears on June 5th in conservative publication Heat Street.  According to BuzzFeed:</p>

<p>&amp;amp;amp;gt; A story on the conservative news site Heat Street received more than 167,000 Facebook shares, comments, and reactions with the headline &quot;Canada’s New Law Lets Government Take Children Away If Parents Don’t Accept Their Gender Identity.&quot;</p>

<p>On it&#39;s surface, the story is not particularily novel so far:  conservative news sites published inaccurate alarmist claims about an otherwise innocuous bill, seemingly due to the fact that it included gender identity provisions.</p>

<p>Where it gets interesting is how the story is published and shared during the week of June 5 - June 12, 2017.  Here&#39;s a timeline:</p>

<ul>
<li>June 5th, 2017:  Heat Street publishes &quot;Canada’s New Law Lets Government Take Children Away If Parents Don’t Accept Their Gender Identity.&quot;  The article has been taken down - <a href="http://archive.is/i3xUj">(archive here)</a>.</li>
<li>June 6th, 2017:  Breitbart.com exclaims that <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/06/06/new-ontario-law-enables-govt-to-seize-children-from-parents-opposing-gender-transition/">&quot;New Ontario Law Enables Gov’t to Seize Children from Parents Opposing Gender Transition&quot;</a></li>
<li>June 6th, 2017:  Russian owned RT.com reports <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/391164-ontario-gender-identity-children/">&quot;New Ontario law allows govt to seize children if parents oppose their ‘gender identity’&quot;</a></li>
<li>June 7th, 2017:  A LGBT news called <a href="https://www.nostraightnews.com/canadas-new-law-allows-government-take-children-away-parents-dont-accept-kids-gender-identity/">NoStraightNews.com reblogs the Heat Streat article</a> </li>
<li>June 7th, 2017:  A Facebook group with over a million likes, LGBT News (NEWSLGBT/), posts the NoStraightNews article.</li>
</ul>

<p>LGBT News is the same source of the screen shots used on today&#39;s top reddit posts.  (Though interestingly, someone mucked with the dates in the screenshots!)</p>

<p>If you&#39;re playing close attention, you might wonder:  why would a puportedly pro-LGBT page be recirculating right-wing attacks on a bill related to gender identity?  I think that BuzzFeed and Vice missed the most important part of the story.</p>

<h1>The Russian IRC Playbook</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/10/05/russian-propaganda-may-have-been-shared-hundreds-of-millions-of-times-new-research-says/?utm_term=.d05843f67c22">The Washington Post has reported extensively</a> on the IRA&#39;s sophisticated use of social media manipulation on Facebook during the 2016 election.  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/10/these-are-the-most-popular-russian-facebook-ads-from-each-month/?noredirect=on&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_term=.ee32f14aebe0">This catalog shows</a> examples.  Facebook users can use this tool to see if they&#39;ve intereacted with IRA content.  </p>

<p>In general, the content is less about explicit promotion of political causes, and instead designed to be a steady drumbeat of emotional agitprop that would influence voters.  Alarmist content from fake activist sites was used to stoke conservative fears and drive turnout.  Popular LGBT and black activist sites posted content designed to sow distrust, and voter apathy.  The reach was wide with over 19.1 million interactions, and it worked. The Post quotes social media analyst Jonathan Albright:</p>

<p>&amp;amp;amp;gt;  “A lot of these posts had the intent to get people not to vote,” Albright said. “This is a concerted effort of manipulation. Based on the engagement and reach and the outcome of the election .. I’d say it’s been fairly successful, sadly.&quot;</p>

<p>Fake <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/4/10/17219676/facebook-black-lives-matter-page-fake">Black Lives Matters groups</a> were backed by (actual) fake news websites created by the IRA as farms for content into Facebook groups.  <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2017/11/a_fake_website_made_by_russian_trolls_is_still_running_and_still_co_opting.html">Slate reports</a> on one such site, BlackMatters.US which continues to be operated by the IRA.  BlackMatters.US is still alive, though there has been no new content for months.</p>

<p>The IRA engaged in similar trolling operations in the LGBT community.  One of the most popular <a href="https://www.advocate.com/politics/2018/5/11/russian-trolls-fake-lgbt-facebook-group-was-very-popular">IRA Facebook pages, LGBT United</a>, was focused on the LGBT community.  </p>

<p>Is Facebook still hosting a Russian trolling operateration masquerading as a LGBT news?</p>

<h1>LGBT News</h1>

<p>A deeper dive into the content on the LGBT News Facebook group reveals similarities between already known Russian trolling operations.  </p>

<p>The majority of the content is nominally normal, the things you might expect to find on an LGBT Group.  There also appears to be a subtle mixture of Russian agitprop.<br/>
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/uXB1mhB">Like Putin is an &quot;Alpha Male&quot;.</a>  </p>

<p>There&#39;s Trump criticism as you would expect in the LGBT community, but it is <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ikRQ9OQ">milquetoast</a>, or even <a href="https://imgur.com/a/uXB1mhB">subtly propagandistic</a>.  This criticism often balanced by counter-points that have a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/bxsvQMg">&quot;right to be heard&quot;</a>.  </p>

<p>Democratic politicians are consistently painted in an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Uf1nDb5">unflattering or demeaning light</a>, even on stories where they&#39;re <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mOBsYF5">ostensibly promoted</a>.  A picture is worth a 1000 words!  That post about Maxine Waters, incidentally, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8wh7kr/rep_maxine_waters_owed_an_apology_from_top_dems/">shows remarkable similarities to posts</a> by a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/user/warmongerhillary">one week old redditor, WarmongerHillary</a> who has been spamming pro-Democratic subs on recently with content exclusively critical of Democrats.</p>

<p>The LGBT News page also posts content that seems to be designed to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/EAPC6rC">sow general malaise</a> on democratic ideas like pluralism.  There&#39;s vaguely racist and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3sIKnnH">Islamophobic content</a>.  None of it is blatant, just a subtle drip of light vitriol to infect the subconscious.  </p>

<p>The group is also used as a source for alarmist artictles on right-biased news sources, like this story at <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/10/03/gay-news-site-celebrates-lgbt-history-month-by-declaring-that-everyones-ancestors-were-gay/">The Daily Caller</a>.  Or <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8wjc87/lgbt_news_and_as_usual_canada_is_just_infinitely/">today&#39;s post on The_Donald.</a> and on <a href="/r/Liberatarian">/r/Liberatarian</a>.  LGBT news also promoted this Breitbart (/NEWSLGBT/posts/499324133595509) about Milo Yiannopoulos&#39;s march through a Swedish Ghetto.  </p>

<p>LGBT News relies heavily on NoStraightNews.com, a site that bears interesting similarities to the fake BlackMatters.US website.  NoStraightNews.com <a href="http://domrating.com/nostraightnews.com">has minmimal backlinks, and almost zero organic traffic.</a>)  98% of their hits are coming from social media.  </p>

<p>It seems unlikely that neither the LGBT News page, or the NoStraightNews.com sites are legitimate.  An important question here is:  who would benefit from driving voter apathy in 2018 for Democratic LGBT community members?</p>

<h1>The Mercers, Breitbart, and Cambridge Analytica</h1>

<p>In my last post about propaganda and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I attempted to illustrated the connections between the White House and Breitbart News.  To recap, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon">Steve Bannon</a>, who served Trump&#39;s as Chief Strategist during the election and in the White House, was a founding member at Breitbart, and also served as CEO before and after his White House tenure.  Breitbart is currently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekah_Mercer">owned by Rebekah Mercer</a>.  Mercer is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/01/05/rebekah-mercer-the-billionaire-backer-of-bannon-and-trump-chooses-sides/?utm_term=.f862f49051b0">a top Trump donor and confidant.</a></p>

<p>I missed something important in that last post.  Mercer inherited Brietbart from her father, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer_(businessman">Robert Mercer</a>), a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/26/robert-mercer-breitbart-war-on-media-steve-bannon-donald-trump-nigel-farage">&quot;big data billionaire&quot;</a>.  Robert Mercer was an initial investor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica#Channel_4_News_investigation">Cambridge Analytica (now Emerdata)</a>  Cambridge Analytica was implicated in a vast conspiracy to harvest psycological profiles from millions of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">people&#39;s Facebook data</a> on behalf of the Trump campaign.  Reporters at the New York Times also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-russia.html">uncovered a number of links between CA and Russian government and business officials</a>.  The Times reports that psycological profile surveys of Americans &quot;included extensive questions about Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.&quot;</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>It&#39;s possible that the entire &quot;Your child now belongs to the state&quot; smear is completely organic.  It starts with critical and increasingly hyperbolic criticim of Bill 89 from conservative christian publications, and progresses to a red meat attack by the broader conservative media.  It&#39;s possible that the LGBT News site is legitimate, and possibly just reblogged the smear out of incompetence.  New and enthusiastic conservative redditors just happen to be the ones to find it and post it here.  To me, this explanation seems lacking.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that the entire smear campaign is a well cordinated one, complete with a still operational troll Facebook profile with a million likes, backed by a literal fake news site.  </p>

<p>Many people pointed out that in my last post, the connections to Russia are weak.  I&#39;ll acklowedge that&#39;s true here as well.  Though the similarities between previously identified Russian trolling, and what we see in this current smear are striking, maybe an entity besides Russia is using the same techniques.  If so, could that entity be connected to the Mercers, and therefore Trump?  Could Emeredata is working in concert with the Russian IRA, and the Trump campaign, and if so, who is coordinating the overall effort?</p>

<p>The author of that meme seems to have intentionally left out the context of that quote. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that s. 14(1)(b) of the Code does not require intent by the publisher or proof of harm, or provide for any defences does not make it overbroad.  Systemic discrimination is more widespread than intentional discrimination and the preventive measures found in human rights legislation reasonably centre on effects, rather than intent.  The difficulty of establishing causality and the seriousness of the harm to vulnerable groups justifies the imposition of preventive measures that do not require proof of actual harm.  The discriminatory effects of hate speech are part of the everyday knowledge and experience of Canadians.  As such, the legislature is entitled to a reasonable apprehension of societal harm as a result of hate speech.  The lack of defences is not fatal to the constitutionality of the provision.  Truthful statements can be presented in a manner that would meet the definition of hate speech, and not all truthful statements must be free from restriction.  Allowing the dissemination of hate speech to be excused by a sincerely held belief would provide an absolute defence and would gut the prohibition of effectiveness.</p>

<p>The benefits of the suppression of hate speech and its harmful effects outweigh the detrimental effect of restricting expression which, by its nature, does little to promote the values underlying freedom of expression.  Section 14(1)(b) of the Code represents a choice by the legislature to discourage hate speech in a manner that is conciliatory and remedial.  The protection of vulnerable groups from the harmful effect emanating from hate speech is of such importance as to justify the minimal infringement of expression.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have to disagree with the idea that a man with a popular reality tv show, household name for decades, and involved in politics/presidential races since at least 2000 is an unknown.

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand most people don&#39;t pay attention to anything outside their immediate concerns. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re dumb, or lazy, or anything negative, it&#39;s just that their own lives consume all of their attention.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a minority of people who care enough about politics and what&#39;s going in the world to pay attention to it. And of that  minority it&#39;s an even smaller group that doesn&#39;t treat it like a team sport, and really tries to see the truth and think of the best solutions to our problems.</p>

<p>I like to think im in the latter group, but it&#39;s difficult for anyone to hold a mirror to themselves. People in r/politics downvote me for being too conservative and people here downvote me for not trusting the administration, so I&#39;m hoping that means I&#39;ve retained some independence. </p>

<p>When I argue with Trump apologists I&#39;d love to be able to convince them of the conman he is, but I know that it&#39;s an extreme long shot. Instead who I&#39;m writing for is people who might be new to paying attention,  or are starting to leave their &quot;team&quot; and think independently. I to reduce Trump&#39;s cult of personality as much as I can because he&#39;s dangerous. He is part of a growing new phenomenon in politics that has figured out that  in an age of limitless information that facts no longer matter. An age where you can say rediculous things like, the world is flat, and hundreds of thousands of people will believe and rabidly fight to spread that disinformation. It&#39;s a world where real conspiracy is muddied by fake narratives. Their goal is to make people think that nothing is real and everything is possible. Once they are in this state truth doesn&#39;t matter and the powers that be can make whatever &quot;facts&quot; they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a well thought out comment.</p>

<p>A republican in the traditional sense of the word. Trump is a demagogue figure, but a charlatan through and through. Selling yourself as an outsider is nothing new, but still extremely effective. </p>

<p>Tiberius Gracchus and his brother Gaius did the same thing. Gaius Marius as well (however, given what he did for the Republic, I&#39;d hesitate to give him the same categorization of the Gracchus brothers).</p>

<p>Julius Caesar is probably the most famous and well known ancient demagogues that ran for Roman office, even though he was patrician. He rose to Pontifex Maximus, further increasing his support with the plebians. Keeping such figures as Publius Clodius Pulcher and Gnaeus Pompeius on his good side, he was able to gain incredible authority in a short time span.</p>

<p>Whether or not these ancient demagogues truly believed in what the represented politically is up to you. I tend not to think so, with the way that Roman society was set up. A human experiment to see if you can increase the individual and collective ambitions of the state.</p>

<p>Sorry for the digression, I just find the parallels between Ancient Rome and the current USA to be fascinating.</p>

I recommend doing a case study of info dissemimated through liberal-leaning outlets as well, because your analyses are very informative and I would seriously hate for others to attack your credibility for appearing partisan.

<p>Uhh yeah...I imagine the vast majority of US redditors did as well. If US public schools don’t teach critical thinking, then where do we get all our doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc from? Surely you can’t think that critical thinking is something you only pickup in college or grad school?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>idk what your public school was like. But 95% of what I did in public school was memorize facts, &amp; regurgitate them onto paper. No critical thinking skills needed, just memorization. No great debates on the issues facing our nation, no freedom to study the things that I was interested in &amp;/or would like to pursue. </p>

<p>Doctors, lawyers, &amp; engineers exist because an individual has a passion &amp; curiosity in those fields. Those are very noble trades to pursue. But just because there are doctors, lawyers, &amp; engineers does not hold any argument that school teaches critical thinking. Worksheet after worksheet does not require critical thinking skills. It requires discipline &amp; obedience to the authority figure assigning them. </p>

<p>The knowledge &amp; information presented to you in school is not pointless. I would argue that all information is worthwhile. It is the way in which the information is structured &amp; presented to me was pointless. I don&#39;t know why the education system is so terrified of allowing children to have control over their own curriculum. Because there is a chance they might fail? Well whoopdy doo look at all the children who currently are failing despite the extremely regimented &quot;common core&quot;. </p>

<p>We do not allow kids to make any important decisions regarding their own education, until they are 18 &amp; graduate. When/if that happens, Then we urge them to make one of the most important decisions of their entire lives. Go to college, &amp; amass an irreversible debt. In which they will be indentured to.</p>

<p>If we let children have control over their own education, there would still be doctors, lawyers, &amp; engineers. But the kids who do not fit those roles would not graduate high school feeling so lost &amp; without purpose. Who is to say that the kid who took welding through high school instead of advanced trigonometry made the &quot;wrong&quot; decision? &amp; just because a person went to law school, does not ensure that he/she will be a successful lawyer.</p>

<p>When I grew up, I realized that life is full of risk/reward analysis. Making sense of that requires critical thinking skills. I was never required to make those decisions through public school, because someone else always made those decisions for me. In short, school did not prepare me for those real world moments. I would argue that it hindered my learning of such skills, in favor of fact regurgitation.</p>

<p>School taught me to hate learning. Those years I spent in public school taught me how to break the rules, &amp; get by. Those years in public school stripped me of my natural curiosity by scolding me for going &quot;off topic&quot;. Since graduating &amp; getting away from that horrible environment I have rediscovered my love for learning. I consider myself a life-long learner &amp; have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge &amp; understanding. If an institution that prides itself on academics &amp; learning successfully taught me to hate academics &amp; learning, there is something very broken about that system. </p>

<p>most schools, public and private, are intended to prepare you for college. you are not going to find “great debates on the issues facing our nation” because elementary, middle, and high schoolers are fucking dumb and uninformed. they give you basic science and math and begin to teach you how to write an essay. Unless you are going into the arts you will use one of these. They teach you how to memorize things, because you are going to have to memorize things in the future, no matter what you do. It also gets you used to doing work on a daily basis, because that’s how a job works. it’s preconditioning. </p>

<p>Because kids are fucking dumb and educators have to take a budget that’s too small and show that the kids they have are generally competent enough to be able to do some kind of work in the future. if they can’t do that, they lose even more funding. </p>

<p>The schools in this country are ridiculously underfunded and the funding that they receive is based on general student performance. That’s why schools teach you how to pass tests, because if they don’t they lose money and there is no field of work that high school alone can prepare you for because they cannot afford to put together programs that teach the details required to actually work in that field. For example, you don’t learn in high school how to be a scientist, because a scientist doesn’t study science, they study far far more specific niches of various fields that are way too in-depth and too expensive to teach. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is interesting. I roam the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> sub from time to time mostly to marvel at how people can drown themselves in speculating about the nature of instagram comments and pictures, and homeless camps.</p>

<p>Then a post like this pops up where you can actually draw straight lines from one source to another, but goes against the political bent of the culture here. It&#39;s been interesting to me to observe this subreddit ignore what might be the biggest conspiracy of our time, citing &quot;no solid proof&quot; and then run off with a conspiracy that leans conservative based on 100% conjecture and denial of Occam&#39;s Razor.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this post does reinforce my pre-existing worldview so I&#39;ll have to treat it even more skeptically than I do the absolute nonsense that&#39;s usually posted here, but I love the work. Please keep this up.</p>

<p>Son: &quot;All caps are cheap. Rhetorical arguments are better, and it&#39;s fortunate I could learn them from my public high school! Much more useful than the mandatory religion classes that my catholic school friends have to take&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Hey Dad! When someone asks a question, am I supposed to respond with a Question? </p>

<p>Dad: &quot;When you or I don&#39;t know how to answer the question then yes, it is important too never indulge in questions that make you think for yourself. What do your teachers say?&quot;</p>

<p>Joey: &quot;They just keep telling us Trump is literally Hitler.&quot; </p>

<p>Dad: &quot;That&#39;s all you need to know, son&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s a narrative that isn&#39;t supported by the numbers at all. If this place was donald 2.0, why would you get upvoted all the time for your pro-democrat opinions, or anti-trump opinions? Simple question.</p>

<p>Like I said, I get upvoted for calling trump a piece of shit, I get downvoted for criticizing democrats. That just wouldn&#39;t happen if this place was the donald 2.0.</p>

<p>But damn, this shit is exhausting.  I was up all night putting together this post.  It takes time to research and read about what actually happened.  And then there’s people, like this guy, who just throw out more propaganda and demand that YOU rebut it.   Sad!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand most people don&#39;t pay attention to anything outside their immediate concerns. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re dumb, or lazy, or anything negative, it&#39;s just that their own lives consume all of their attention.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a minority of people who care enough about politics and what&#39;s going in the world to pay attention to it. And of that  minority it&#39;s an even smaller group that doesn&#39;t treat it like a team sport, and really tries to see the truth and think of the best solutions to our problems.</p>

<p>I like to think im in the latter group, but it&#39;s difficult for anyone to hold a mirror to themselves. People in r/politics downvote me for being too conservative and people here downvote me for not trusting the administration, so I&#39;m hoping that means I&#39;ve retained some independence. </p>

<p>When I argue with Trump apologists I&#39;d love to be able to convince them of the conman he is, but I know that it&#39;s an extreme long shot. Instead who I&#39;m writing for is people who might be new to paying attention,  or are starting to leave their &quot;team&quot; and think independently. I to reduce Trump&#39;s cult of personality as much as I can because he&#39;s dangerous. He is part of a growing new phenomenon in politics that has figured out that  in an age of limitless information that facts no longer matter. An age where you can say rediculous things like, the world is flat, and hundreds of thousands of people will believe and rabidly fight to spread that disinformation. It&#39;s a world where real conspiracy is muddied by fake narratives. Their goal is to make people think that nothing is real and everything is possible. Once they are in this state truth doesn&#39;t matter and the powers that be can make whatever &quot;facts&quot; they want.</p>
