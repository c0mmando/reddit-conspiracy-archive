        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is something I have noticed for quite a while now. I remember a few years back, autocomplete was so primitive it was laughable. But it has gotten so much more sophisticated in the past 4-5 years. I know they customize search results based on previous searches, so for example your auto-complete will be different than mine, but it amazes me how accurate it is for me now</p>

<p>.I get into in depth wikipedia rabbit trails, for example. Sometimes a loosely related concept arises in my mind from the reading and I got to open a 2nd tab, and it&#39;s almost like auto-complete is reading my mind. It can be something thats only tangentially related and auto complete nails it everytime within 3 or 4 letters being typed, sometimes less.</p>

<p>I can be looking at pharmacology journals from downloaded PDF&#39;s and a drug name will come up from a certain class. I may be unfamiliar with the drug, but am familiar with other drugs in the class, so I open a new tab, and type in the other drug, and again google knew exactly where I was going within 3-4 letters. This is reading from  offline PDF files.</p>

<p>Sometimes its me trying to fact check or do further research on something I read. I research some very obscure historical, or pop culture topics, that spark associations in my mind that would seemingly not exist in other peoples minds, or rare names and autocomplete seems to know exactly what i&#39;m looking for, and it pops up. It&#39;s like it has learned to telegraph my own personal logical progressions. When the internet became well established a little over 10 years ago I remember feeling like people would &quot;outsource&quot; their memory to google. Now you didnt have to retain information about historical events or trivia, becasue you could just google it. It seemed to be making people more intellectually lazy. Now it gotten to the point where we not only outsource our memories to google, but they can almost store our thought processes &quot;in the cloud&quot; as well</p>

<p>It even happens with audio files and youtube videos. I can be listening to speeches or seminars and something can be mentioned and I will pause the youtube video, open another tab and type in the name or concept I just heard to research it further and auto-complete already knows exactly what I&#39;m looking for, even when its very obscure topics. Ive even tried to manipulate it and use very esoteric end around search references, and it still knows!</p>

<p>Just a very small example. I was listening to some old Zig Ziglar speeches from the 70&#39;s on youtube. He told a motivational story about a young man who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Over 30 doctors said he would never be able to walk or count to 10, but he beat the odds and became a fully functioning person and even an athlete. The kids name was David Lofchick. I had never heard of him and certainly never googled his name, so I wanted to fact check this and see where this young boy that Ziglar had mentioned in 1976 was today. So I paused the Youtube video and opened a 2nd tab. By the time I had typed in &quot;david&quot; autocomplete knew exactly who I was looking for at the top of the suggestions. Again this is just a very miniscule example.</p>

<p>Im not paranoid to the point I actually believe Google can read my brainwaves, but the auto complete is sometimes so astoundingly accurate it makes me wonder how this is even done. I guess I could see them using the basic functions like &quot;people also searched for&quot; to telegraph where you might go after opening a certain page, but it just seems so much more advanced than that. I can see how that might work for articles or keywords that might be on a page, but how can they do this with youtube audio and PDF files? </p>

<p>Theres been a lot of talk lately about Alexa and android phones recording your reactions to ads and the like, so I guess this kind of falls in line with that. But I am really amazed how well autocomplete knows even the most obscure and rare references before I can type them in. Just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences with auto complete and how google manages to seemingly read my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talking about smartphones, it is already getting so far, that people are convinced, their phones read their minds and show ads accordingly. More people will experience this in future. </p>

<p>FB did admit it records ALL of your interactions with your phone. It doesn&#39;t just record what link you click, 
what you like, dislike or share, but also your finger movements on the screen. Swipe direction, acceleration, speed, angle and also of course, every button you push and every letter you type, even if you hit backspace afterwards and never send or save. Again, they admitted this! There also were some other companies tech guys claiming they found evidence FB app is indeed recording audio and video for some time already. Then few days ago there was something about FB adding some kind of hidden sounds in TV comercials, which would trigger phones and alexas to record audio to capture reaction to said comercial. Think that info also came from FB itself. (?) Not sure, didn&#39;t even read any of the articles, but it seemed to be official? </p>

<p>Anyways, to come back the point I wanted to make, you see how far this google search thing goes and the only information it uses to do this, is what comes from your mouse and keyboard. Now think how far it can go with your FACE as a additional source of information your VOICE...
Eyetracking?</p>

<p>And suddenly people are convinced phones read their minds... Spoiler: Phones can&#39;t read your mind (yet).
What actually happened, is that the game was just set to the next level. First they only guessed what you would like to see next. Now they start trying to influence, what you want to see next. They know everything about you, so they know how to trigger certain thoughts or emotions.</p>

<p>For example they would know that you like going fishing, that you are currently pretty frustrated and almost depressive (slow lethargic movements on your screen) (FB already said it will send friendly &quot;get help!&quot; messages to users they diagnosed with depressions...) and they know that your last vacation was almost a year ago. So they present you some of your friends vacation pictures they recently uploaded, show you pictures displaying people at the beach, articles about vacation. And since they already know how long it generally takes you to compute incoming triggers and to react to them, they know exactly when your thought process of: 
&quot;Damn I&#39;m tired, damn I want vacation as well and damn I should go fishing&quot; is finished And they already know how long in advance you have to apply for vacation at your current worklplace... They know exactly when they have to present you an ad about fishing vacation in october for half the price which you just a second earlier thought about taking. &quot;My phone read my mind!!&quot; No, it wrote your mind! </p>

<p>That&#39;s only lvl 2. Next levels won&#39;t be about advertising so much anymore, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s because your thoughts aren’t that original (no offense). One time I got freaked out because I forgot the name of Smacks cereal. My search was “what is the cereal...” google finished the sentence “what is the cereal with the frog mascot?” Which is exactly what I was thinking. I got pretty freaked out but I had my gf and another friend type “what is the cereal” and the same thing happened for them. So I guess a lot of people overlook Smacks cereal. In all honesty, it kinda tastes like shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recursive neural networks are pretty fricking sweet.  </p>

<p>One of the BEST things about neural networks is that they are hard to steer without completely fucking them up. YouTube reworked their search about 6 months ago, and had to revert it. It had the effect of filtering out 90&amp;#37; of conspiracy related content, but it also made their whole search suck. They&#39;ve fucked with search a few times. I don&#39;t think they can filter it on static rules and implement a tensor based search at the same time, so I think that tendency of AI is helping us in a lot of sites.  </p>

<p>For example, if Twitter or Facebook uses AI to populate their &quot;Trending&quot; or &quot;Top News&quot; sections, they will make more money, because the AI will actually select good topics that people are interested in looking at... BUT, they will inevitably feed conspiracy stuff to users because the AI will know that the person will be interested in the topic, even if it is wrong or if it goes against the &quot;official narrative&quot;.  </p>

<p>I think, for anyone following AI right now, this is a really fun game to watch.</p>
