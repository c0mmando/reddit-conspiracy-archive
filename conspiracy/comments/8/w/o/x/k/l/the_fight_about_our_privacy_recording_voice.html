    <div class="md"><p>Also the leading reason behind the recent uptick in quantuum computing speeds. Once the race to hit 100 qubits really picks up is when the program really starts to work. Only problem is that we need to have 2 points in space separated by more than a light year, connected to the same quantuum computing system so that the distance of travel is far enough to actually reach the speeds needed to predict the future before it happens..  with quantuum computing, if the distance between to places is far enough, you can actually beat the speed of light and start predicting the future with no paradox&#39;s because the information isn&#39;t changing in time, only in distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it is invasive and wrongfully helps advertisement. In order to beat, “overthrow,” the government you would have to outsmart them through means such as exposing their true intentions or forming an organization to fight the government. In short, you would have to commit what they have deemed a “crime” (e.g hacking emails of a politician, or maybe torturing one for info). My point is, they can keep track of you completely, if you do something along the lines of going against them, they will be able to find you, making them damn near invincible. This is just one aspect of the surveillance purpose imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To manipulate you. Something is listening with the intent of influencing the direction of Human history. This has been true for some time.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve embraced a Watcher that you don&#39;t understand. The glowing hand symbiote you&#39;ve invited to shadow your children whip your everyday is something you don&#39;t understand. The Luminaries of your employment ladder don&#39;t understand it either but they do understand that you will dance to make them money if the blinking, chirping, glowing manipulation firefly prompts you to action.</p>

<p>You are now in serious trouble and far worse than you can imagine is in the offening. Your paycheck King lives are a manipulation and soon what you thought was &quot;child trustworthy&quot; will be a genie your monkey mind can&#39;t put back in a bottle.</p>

<p>Just kidding! You know &quot;what&#39;s what&quot;. You&#39;ve &quot;been to school&quot;. You &quot;get a paycheck&quot;. How could anything be beyond your understanding? You are running this world. You are the &quot;New Turks&quot;. The &quot;Disruptors&quot;. &quot;The Future&quot;.</p>

<p>Pick that glowing thing up right now. Who owns who?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If one thinks they are being watched, overheard, and tracked, down to even searches on the internet, they are less likely to search out for things that may paint them in a bad light. They won&#39;t type in key words that may set off an alarm, even if that search is to learn, because it  it may hint at &quot;bad thoughts.&quot; We could end up policing our own quest for information and even our thoughts, for fear of the dreadful &quot;thought police.&quot;</p>
