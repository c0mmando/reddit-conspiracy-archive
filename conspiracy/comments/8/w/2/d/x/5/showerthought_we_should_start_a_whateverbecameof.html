       A place to collect all those stories that went into the news and forum-slided out of our common attention spans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to remember that we are all forgetful and easy prey to forum sliding!

      <p>
       And maybe a place to gather updates, long after the story fell off the news shelves.

       The list is long, consider my post history.  No answers.  So many questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What ever happened to the 3 people who tried to escape the NSA headquarters and were shot at?
      </p>
      <p>
       They disappeared is what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think you have a good job at the NSA and you are really safe and valuable and then you get wind there is going to be a fake high school shooting and you try to get the word out that the NSA is evil and using their power to craft vast mass media lies while gaslighting the entire country,
      </p>
      <p>
       but now you are living in a room in a blacksite being held upside down being told thanks to this or that executive order you have no human rights and your name is erased from history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you were the family of someone who worked at the NSA who disappeared or mysteriously died, what journalist do you go to with this information?

       check my post history to see where I asked all of reddit and not a single person produced a constructive thought and downvoted to zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't just disappear, all attempt to talk about their disappearance is made invisible or irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will soon stop posting here becausse it is too dangerous to let the mucky mucks know that I see through their shit AND because it is obvious the general public has been turned into idiocracy and so will be ruled like cattle by predatorss.

       They weren't trying to escape. Two people in an SUV tried to ram their way in and in the process they both were shot as well as one victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what the fellow above is on about as far as twisting it to make it seem like a good novel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do like the premise of the list though. Try all the living victims of the franklin coverup and that lady that went on Oprah talking Satanic pedo rings. A mixture of curiousity and skepticism for sure.

       Do you have a source for your claims? All I can find is the official story that says two people tried to ram a vehicle into the NSA gate, were shot and shot one victim in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your version is much more juicy but lacks any proof

       there is no proof for anything
      </p>

       but i find the coincidence basically '2 hours before parkland shooting' and then 'completely utterly suppressed' to be 3 very odd coincidences indeed, don't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       what are we supposed to think?  2 terrorists infiltrated the nsa and then when their 10 year plot failed and idk i can't think of any other reason for 2 people to think it is important enough to try to escape the nsa in the first place, can you?
      </p>
      <p>
       if they were arguing over 401k or some privacy thing(lol) it would have been in the news wouldn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       what would be a big enough secret to warrant a. the repression and b. the act in the first place

       (in reverse order but still)

       you tell me, come up with another narrative that makes any sense whatsoever at all im all ears, in fact i dare you

       It wasn't employees trying to leave it was a couple nut jobs trying to break in and cause havoc. How is the official story not more logical? If your job makes you do bad shit you don't try to shoot your way out. You leave at the end of the day or lunch and never come back. Please read some of the official accounts. Furthermore I've seen no evidence linking this to Sandy Hook. Might I ask where you are getting intel or are we just spitballing here?

       Have you heard anything about it weather it’s still happening or the reasons behind it. The only thing I’ve ever come across is that they had a stressful job and it got to them so they killed themselves. Idk to me that shit doesn’t make sense.

       Much of it was around bailouts and has slowed or under reported. There's still much more to come, imho if we're ever going to have sound economics...abolish the FED!

       Imran Awan has a unique background.  His dad worked for Bush as a CIA operative and was VP of a bank in Miami that was later closed because it was laundering money for Noriega.
      </p>
      <p>
       He broke some laws, had crazy debt and then hands over information with a note.  He gets a judge appointed by Obama that is kin to DWS.  The man played his cards but it is far from over.

       I cannot confirm any of this information is true.  His father is Peter Strzok Sr.  He was army core engineers and was a career expert in sanctions and nuclear activity in Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       His brother Mark Strzok is in sales for a crane company that specializes in moving nuclear reactors.  He is married to Mariana Strzok who is the daughter of General James Cartwright.  General Cartwright was pardoned by Obama on his last day in office.   General Cartwright was accused of leaking info on stuxnet (computer worm that damaged Iran's nuclear program).  Mariana and Mark have a son named Devin who is a coastguard graduate and had an emergency meeting in the situation room at the west wing (white house) on May 2015.  Devin works in advanced geospatial tech.
Peter Strzok was the last one to see or read Hillary's emails and request the backups of the server.  His wife Melissa Hodgman who works for the Government was promoted the day the FBI drafted the exoneration letter. Peter and Melissa have 2 kids and both go by the last name Hodgman.  Peter and Melissa had a meeting at the white house with the same person his brother and wife met with.  That persons name is Osbaldo Cantu.
Evidently the Strzok family and their wives all have connections to the Uranium conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there is more info and/or revisions made since I last dug into it. Spellings could be wrong as well.

       The Head of the DNC Debbi Wasserman Schultz, says "Yeah he took some stuff, I don't think it's bad". Then the Evidence gets stolen, then the government says we can't find anything wrong about this. Then he walks.

       I didn't read into it much until I learned he had massive debts, had been arrested for fraud and DUI.  All the items that prevent you from handling sensitive data for the government.  What I found strange - he was hired by a lot of politicians (mainly democrats but a few republicans).  After you read up on it, you get the vibe he was hired to monitor them by CIA or help cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       His debt and background is what stands out though.  I saw this guy in the crowd during public hearings.  Who lets someone like that handle their data much less go the distance to make public threats on getting his confiscated laptop back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get caught up in the political debate - I find stories like this interesting.

       I remember a news story about ten years ago about a 'horrific' crime scene that involved dozens of mutilated bodies. No one was allowed near the scene due to the 'situation' and details will be released in a statement that never happened (?). It was somewhere on the east coast like Pennsylvania. Does anyone else recall this?

       Awesome idea. They depend on short memories to get away with what they do. The media is complicit, they do everything in their power not to remind people of these unresolved stories.

       I just read a story rthat only 4 reporters showed up at the Afghanistan press conference. I haven't heard Afghanistan mentioned in the mainstream media in years, they want everyone to forget that we're still there, and people are forgetting.
