       Do you think Imran Awan would have gotten a fair trial for his massive spy ring scandal in Congress and breach of national security in D.C. without interference by corrupt politicians or a politically biased judge? Somehow the media missed or failed to report this quote on page 10 of his plea agreement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Your client further understands that this Agreement is binding only upon the Criminal and Superior Court Divisions of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. This Agreement does not bind the Civil Division of this Office or any other United States Attorney's Office, nor does it bind any other state, local, or federal prosecutor. It also does not bar or compromise any civil, tax, or administrative claim pending or that may be made against your client.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Any federal prosecutor outside of D.C. can indict him. That includes Huber in Utah..

       Nope. For example from the NCDA's page

      <blockquote>

        What kind of cases does the U.S. Attorney's Office handle?

       <p>
        The prosecution of federal criminal cases in each of the U.S. District Courts is the responsibility of the U.S. Attorney for that District.  Each U.S. Attorney is appointed by the President and reports to the Attorney General.

       You're wrong. Your links show that they prosecute cases in their district but none of them say the crime has to occur in their district.
      </p>
      <p>
       From one of your links:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While the states have broad authority to prosecute many types of crimes, they may investigate and prosecute only criminal acts committed within their boundaries.
        <strong>
         The power of the federal government, however, extends throughout the UnitedÂ States.

       Yes, the Federal Court system, but you don't get to just pick one and go to that Courthouse. That's not how it works. I'm not going to give you a lesson on all the stuff that goes into venue selection but you're just wrong:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Unless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed. The court must set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant, any victim, and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice.

       Nice moving the goalposts. I thought he could be charged with the crime by any district?
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's what you're arguing, prove that's what he was doing? It's moot though, you can't bring the same charges federally as this case has already been decided.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he violated Utah state law, sure but that'd be the State's Attorney not the US.

       What is clear, according to the quote on page 10 in his plea deal in the OP, is that no other federal prosecutors outside of D.C. are bound by this. If they find enough to bring charges, they can. And I think that is what will happen.

       Federal Courts can't hear every Federal case. It has to relate to their district. Or do you have something that actually shows otherwise? I've given you statements from an advocacy group, one of the offices, and the actual law, you've shown a story you didn't even get right.

       Read through that thread a little bit. Even the die hard Q followers know that photo Q was faked. They have no idea what to make of Qs posts last night.

       For the first time in a while, you have a group of woke patriots joining together in unity and setting aside beliefs, race, and hatred, and coming together for truth. That is gorgeous.

       But they aren't coming together for the truth. They are come together to discuss fake things like fake photos and fake dreams of a damning Obama picture to be realised of him shooting an AK47 in terrorist clothes. A fake dream of a damning Hillary tape that Q said he had months ago. These things arent real. This group of "Patriots" isnt waking up to anything. They are being put to sleep by sitting around discussing things that dont exist.

       Many many people in that thread are shook. Q has said in the past that his pics are original. He even double down and said the desk just looked similar to Obama's desk because he moved some stuff around. That alarmed people even more. This is the first time I've seen serious doubt from many users in that sub.

       Jesus christ. So edgy bro. Nobody brigades 4chan. That place is a wasteland to liberals. Sometimes, when Q posts fake things like the photo last night, or his photoshopped picture of a Trump "EO" people in the community get very concerned. Maybe you should see what other Q followers are saying about this rather than assuming anything that goes against your beliefs are from a shill cuck.
