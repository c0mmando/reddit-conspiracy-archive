<p>Because of you, I found myself.  For years, for decades I was the waiter with an assassin’s dreams.  I was the prisoner always carrying the handful of mortar from my cell to your yard.  I was the one who worked hard, and seemed the most dedicated, when actually I was your greatest enemy.</p>

<p>I smiled at your dinners and laughed at your jokes, but in my mind I spat on your food and hoped for miscarriages.  There wasn’t one fucking day that went by that I didn’t know I was going over that wall of freedom.”</p>

<p>Until God deals with the problem we are fucked.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I am a very emotional person and I take on the pain of the world. I hate to see ANYONE SUFFER (except my exhusband and his new mate they should jump in a volcano and make the world a better place instantly!) But anyway sometimes you just have to free your mind from the things you cant change and change the things you can. Sometimes my honey says THATS IT OFF THE COMPUTER!! Thats exactly what I do get off the computer go on a walk or bike ride check out my neighbors gardens in the summer and happily compare their tomato growth to mine. I feed homeless cats and that gives me pleasure as I know they need my help.Anything I can to forget for a minute,not forever as I go back to it all later. Its never going away but for a moment I experience peace. It is quite rewarding going back to the cats for a second to see a totally feral cat that was once totally afraid of me get excited and come to my call...It is sometimes all the progress I can get out of a week. Pray! Pray for these things that worry you and pray for people you hate I mean really put your heart into it its amazing how much it helps.. Be grateful that you have a heart and these things affect you. You could be a demonic heartless asshole and we wouldnt be having this conversation. There are enough of those assholes on the earth and I cannot understand why they havent taken my advice and jumped into that volcano yet. Peace BB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why in the response he/she suggested to check out voluntaryism.</p>

<p>Maybe it would help you to focus on things locally that you can directly control, so you can take some of your power back and not feel like such a destitute victim in all of this. </p>

<p>Dream up ways to disrupt their systems and take money out of their pockets. Willingly engage in business deals that you feel comfortable being in. Support businesses in your immediate area and go away from big business evilcorp whenever you can. Identify gaps in the current system and considering looking into launching a new business that bridges some of these gaps. Do lots of reading and expose yourself to new concepts. Surround yourself with people that are at the very least open minded, or ideally, like minded. </p>

<p>Many things are indeed out of our hands and with just one of us, but many of us together? Many more things become possible to change.</p>
