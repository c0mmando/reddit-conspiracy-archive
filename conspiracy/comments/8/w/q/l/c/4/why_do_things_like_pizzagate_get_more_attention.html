    <div class="md"><p>It’s slightly different when humans are believed to be a direct cause of the warming and changing of our planets climate. Record breaking temperatures all around the world were recorded last week. Wildfires have ran rampant these past few years. So many people are already losing their homes to climate change. I suppose it can be argued that humans aren’t necessarily the cause, but why the fuck is it ignored, and blatantly talked down on? Even if our emissions aren’t harmful, we can’t deny that our climate is changing for the worst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Climate change has been happening and will continue to happen regardless of us being here. Does it cause people to migrate?  I am sure, but so did the last ice age. The climate has never been or will ever be a constant.  That I do actually know and understand about the issue. Is it happening faster because of our terrible energy tech?  Absolutely. </p>

<p>Everyone has their own opinion on pizzagate and regardless if you buy into it or not it had a profound impact on the people of the world. Governments all over the world are making more and more arrests and that industry will be brought to its knees.  Every month we get closer to the top and more of the higher ups are being outed and implicated in this world wide criminal organization.  To me it is a means to an end. Maybe if this cabal is brought down then we can get out the tech that will transform our world  and set us on the right track.  I really do believe that this tech is being suppressed and the evidence for such actions can be found everywhere.  I just feel like if you get the globalists out of the way then maybe we will have a shot at releasing what has been kept from us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s big differences between the gradual changes that have occurred naturally over earth&#39;s history and the abrupt shifts, rooted it artificial causes, currently underway.  Most important difference is that there weren&#39;t humans around during previous changes to care.  The earth will be fine; the human civilization designed around one macro iteration of Earth&#39;s conditions might not be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of pizzagate, but if something good does come of it I&#39;d be glad.</p>

<p>Whether or not tech is being suppressed, we don&#39;t need new tech to build an affluent low-carbon society.  That&#39;d just require more nuclear reactors, bus/bike lanes, and local agriculture/manufacturing than are politically viable at present.  Globalism is a particularly bad frame to take on this, as the main industries supporting anti-globalism, oil and coal, are the same one that have the biggest incentive to prevent better energy tech.</p>

of one today. Maybe you are creationist and feel differently but life did exist during that time and had to migrate all over the world just to survive.  Hopefully we adapt and come out of this ok but I don&#39;t think nuclear is the answer. Fukushima is still leaking radiation and poisoning life today with no real sign of stopping anytime soon. We are looking at thousands of years of a massively radioactive ocean to deal with and that is not something that is just going to filter out in the next few years. </p>
