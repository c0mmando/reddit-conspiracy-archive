        1.Despite CDC claims, our current vaccine scheduling regimen has not  been adequately tested.
       </strong>
       The CDC says, “Following the recommended  immunization schedule protects infants and children by providing  immunity early in life, before they are exposed to potentially  life-threatening diseases.” When the Institute of Medicine (IOM) investigated this claim in 2013 in response to parental concern over the  vaccination schedule they were able to identify less than 40 scientific  studies published since 2003 and noted,
       <strong>
        “First, the concept of the  immunization “schedule” is not well developed in the scientific  literature…Key elements of the immunization schedule- for example, the  number, frequency, timing, order, and age at the time of administration  of vaccines- have not been systematically examined in research studies.”
       </strong>
       (Institute of Medicine.

       </a>
       .)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2.Despite CDC claims, combining multiple vaccines in one visit has not  been proven to be safe.
       </strong>
       “Although CDC recommends polio, hepatitis B,  diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, rotavirus, flu B, and pneumococcal  vaccines for two, four, and six month old infants, this combination of  eight vaccines administered during a single physician visit was never tested for safety in clinical trials. This is at odds with a CDC report that found that mixed exposures to chemical substances and other stress  factors, including prescribed pharmaceuticals, may produce ‘increased or unexpected deleterious health effects.” (

        Combining Childhood Vaccines at One Visit Is Not Safe, Neil Z. Miller
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3.The CDC recommended the TdaP vaccine to pregnant women prior  to licensure of the vaccine,and does not even know for sure if the  vaccine will protect newborns from pertussis as they claim
       </strong>
       : “In  prelicensure evaluations, the safety of administering a booster dose of  Tdap to pregnant women was
       <strong>
        <em>
         not
        </em>
       </strong>
       studied…The effectiveness and optimal consideration of maternal antipertussis antibodies in newborns are
       <strong>
        <em>
         not yet known
        </em>
       </strong>
       , but high levels of antibodies in the first weeks of life after birth
       <strong>
        <em>
         likely
        </em>
       </strong>
       confer protection and
       <strong>
        <em>
         might
        </em>
       </strong>
       prevent pertussis or modify disease severity.” (emphasis mine).(CDC.
       <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6041a4.htm?s_cid=mm6041a4_e%0D%0A">
        Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, October 21, 2011
       </a>
       )  Incidentally, the FDA classifies TdaP a class C pregnancy drug which is  defined as drugs in which “Animal reproduction studies have shown an  adverse effect on fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled  studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of drug in  pregnant women despite potential risks.” (
       <a href="https://chemm.nlm.nih.gov/pregnancycategories.htm">
        FDA Pregnancy Categories
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       – Don’t miss this quote from the CDC in the above 10/21/11 report, “Because information on the use of Tdap in pregnant women
       <strong>
        <em>
         was lacking
        </em>
       </strong>
       , both manufacturers of Tdap established pregnancy registries
       <strong>
        <em>
         to collect information and pregnancy outcomes from pregnant women vaccinated with Tdap
        </em>
       </strong>
       . Data on the safety of administering Tdap to pregnant women are
       <strong>
        <em>
         now
        </em>
       </strong>
       available.” (emphasis is mine). The CDC tells you in black and white that they recommended a vaccine to you in which information was lacking  though you were not informed that they did not have complete  information.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        – Rephrased: Uninformed women were used as guinea pigs in an undeclared trial.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <h1>
       – The very same scenario is occurring right now with respect to the  Gardasil vaccine that the CDC currently recommends.

       <strong>
        4.Metals used in Vaccines have not  been found to be safe.
       </strong>
       Use of mercury in vaccines has been greatly  decreased, however the use of aluminum has not decreased. A study in
       <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/97/3/413">
        <em>
         Pediatrics
        </em>
       </a>
       ,  which is the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics  states,
       <strong>
        “Aluminum is now being implicated as interfering with a variety  of cellular and metabolic processes in the nervous system and other  tissue.
       </strong>
       ” Another group of researchers note, “Despite almost 90 years of  widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science’s understanding  about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also  a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of  these compounds.” (
       <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cmc/2011/00000018/00000017/art00011">
        <em>
         Current Medicinal Chemistry
        </em>
       </a>
       , Volume 18, Number 17)
      </p>
      <p>
       – Rephrased: They have been using aluminum and other heavy metals in  vaccines for 90 years, yet do not know exactly how they affect your  body. Concerns have now been raised that aluminum may very well be  interfering with your nervous system.

       This makes no sense.  If science was never "settled" it would not be science at it.  It would be a bunch of people with titles with completely empty theories.

       It makes sense when you consider that our technology, senses, and understanding of the world around us are limited, and these limitations very often make it difficult to zero in on the absolute truth. Countless ideas that were once universally accepted as "facts" have since been disproven, and many things that we consider to be factual today will one day suffer the same fate. Scientists understand this, and that is why even things that have not been disproven for centuries are still considered "theories" and not "facts". The day something is no longer open for scrutiny is the day science dies.

       Yes, all of those things are open for scrutiny. We currently hold them to be true because we have not proven them to be untrue, but there is no guarantee that it will remain that way for the rest of eternity. We operate under the assumption that our methods are adequate until such a time comes that they are proven inadequate.

       In addition to your assertions and citations – and thanks for a great compilation – the root idea that injecting pathogens (live, dead or otherwise) directly into the bloodstream provides any future immunity to their represented diseases has never been proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human body produces the same fucking antibodies in response to any cellular invader, and vaccines bypass the primary defenses (skin, mucous, etc.) which signal a reaction (fever, sneezing, runny nose, etc.). When the pathogen bypasses those, it can be confused with anything else in the bloodstream that's "foreign"  or "a threat" and creates an auto-immune response, while adding poison. You can follow the rise in peanut allergies with its introduction of peanut oil into the vaccines. Why? To see if it would do exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're all taught that a polio vaccine, e.g., will "stimulate the creation of antibodies to protect against that virus." Absolute bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No vaccine does what it's sold to do, and the "science" is marketing for population control.

       But if you insist.. In short; it's lies and misinformation.
Yes, some vaccinations require extra doses (like tetanus and acellular pertussis) to increase the percentage of people who are immune but many others, like MMR, do not.
       <br/>
       How would you explain the 40s, 50s, 60s generations that got vaccinated and never got measles, mumps and rubella if not for herd immunity?
       <br/>
       Herd immunity is an undeniable fact.

       Educate yourself, using legitimate scientific resources, not antivaccine crank websites.

       Do you understand what herd immunity is? Herd immunity is not when the vaccine works and protect peopls and leads to a decline of cases. Herd immunity is a required threshold of a percentage of individuals that need to be vaccine to protect unvaccinated people. The thresholds needs to be fairly high often as high as 90%-95%.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mumps vaccine is not that effective anymore you do not get herd immunity with it.

       Herd immunity is not a myth and I never said this. The way it is marketed is dishonest since we can never achieve herd immunity for many diseases we vaccinate for for various reasons, mostly because many vaccines do not affect transmission rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason why it is dishonest is that we did not have herd immunity in the past and despite that we did not see huge outbreaks. The importance of achieving herd immunity has been exaggerated for marketing reasons. That is why it was called marketing gimmick in the article.

       We have much higher vaccination rates today than in the past. It is dishonest to claim that we are undervaccinated.

       What has this nonsense to do with herd immunity? Nothing. You are just showing that you do not know what you are talking about if you make random quotes.

       Thus, understanding the limitations of the MMR vaccine on a population level and how best to use this tool is critical to future mumps control. If 2 doses of MMR vaccine are not able to provide sufficient herd immunity to prevent outbreaks, the question is what to do? Choices include the following:

      <p>
       Herd immunity is the concept that when most people in a community are protected against a disease, everyone in the community is better protected. A highly vaccinated community means that fewer people are available to spread viruses and bacteria, which results in lower levels of disease.

       When pregnant women aren't supposed to even dye their hair because chemicals could be bad, or eat certain foods, the push to vaccinated pregnant women with a thiomersal containing flu shot seems fairly insane to me. Especially when you consider the manufactures themselves say there is no evidence to support safety -&gt;

       Acute Oral Toxicity. Lethal dosage of 75 mg/kg on rats.

       Okay, though the idea of damaging cells is kind of a strawman argument. Being 100% honest, you can kill a cell by submerging in dilute enough water. Pressure gradients will literally cause the cell to swell with water until it explodes and thus 'dies'. Before it reaches death it also can inhibit organelle function due to pressure and concentration changes Anything in the world can damage a cell.

       As well, the issue with the original toxicity war in was the fear that the body degraded the molecule into methylmercury, which is in fact, extremely toxic to humans. However, it was later researched and proven in the article I will link below that the body actually breaks this down as ethylmercury, which is not toxic to the human body.

       Do what you want I don't care. Sometimes it helps to read/watch stuff that contradicts with your viewpoint, and this guy was one of the leading world experts on the subject. Not just some random anybody. Did you know the only time thiomersal was directly studied in humans was in something like 1929 (done by Eli Lilly)? They tested a 1% IV solution on meningitis patients, and they all died within 24 hours. They concluded they had died from the meningitis and not the thiomersal, and as a conclusion thiomersal was safe. This study was used for decades as proof of safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article you linked says this
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They are closely related chemically, have a similar  initial  distribution  in  the  body,  and  cause similar types of damage to the brain in toxic doses.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why would you inject that into kids of pregnant women? It even says in your article fetal brains are far more susceptible to damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they go on
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Of greater importance is the re-cent finding that the half-life of ethyl mercury in the body is much shorter .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is laughable. It's known that it ends up in the brain and other places. The fact that it doesn't stay in the blood long doesn't mean it's left the body and been excreted, which is the core reason they say it's safer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like how in your article they mention
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They calculated that infants undergoing the usual U.S. program of vaccines from birth to six months of age would receive more than 0.1 μg of mercury per kilogram per day.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What they did was to calculated the total dose, and divide it by 6 months, and they found kids were just over the the EPA limit. The IOM actually supported this interpretation. It would be like having 6 months of heart medication, say 100 pills, and eating them all in one day. But hey it's safe because we averaged it over 6 months. Kids were often getting up to 5 or 6 shots in a single day, absolutely smashing the maximum EPA limit for exposure. That's the scandal no one wants to talk about. Vaccines aren't tested like drugs (in combination). The assumption that one is safe, doesn't translate to 5 at once being safe.

       Here's a conspiracy pro tip:
      </p>
      <p>
       If your going to link to an article that you think is going to prop up your thesis of metals in vaccines is bad bad news. Then don't link to articles that do the complete oppoiste:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        4.Metals used in Vaccines have not been found to be safe. Use of mercury in vaccines has been greatly decreased, however the use of aluminum has not decreased. A study in Pediatrics
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What the study in Pediatrics actually says:
      </p>
      <p>
       nfants, children, and adults with chronic renal failure who are not receiving dialysis have been shown to be at risk for aluminum intoxication from the oral administration of aluminum-containing phosphate binders. This complication should be avoided with the use of phosphate binders that do not contain aluminum and the use of other measures to control hyperphosphatemia.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as can clearly be seen within in the 1st 39 seconds of this article that is over 20 years old. Has Sweet F A to with vaccines. And it's focus is So let on improving treatment and removing exposure of aluminium for kids with renal failure.

       Not only that, but Wakefield never took the samples without informing the parents. It was done with their full consent and approval, using an experienced practitioner, with no harm or possible harm to anyone, save for Dr. Wakfield's career.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should he have done it? No, it was a mistake by him that was ultimately used as an excuse to destroy his career in order to save the vaccine manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it unethical? No. Every single person involved had been given full disclosure, and fully informed consent had been obtain in all instances, it was simply not the correct procedure to follow in such an instance, and Dr. Wakefield himself has conceded this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should he have lost his license for it and had his career destroyed? Most assuredly not. What he and his colleagues had discovered was front-page news at the time, and the knowledge could have been used to make the MMR vaccine safer. Instead it was buried and discredited, in fear of incoming litigation for completely inadequate and improper testing by the vaccine manufacturers. That is the actual and real unethical part of it all.

       The paper in The Lancet was a case series of 12 child patients; it reported a proposed "new syndrome" of enterocolitis and regressive autism and associated this with MMR as an "apparent precipitating event." But in fact:
Three of nine children reported with regressive autism did not have autism diagnosed at all. Only one child clearly had regressive autism;Despite the paper claiming that all 12 children were "previously normal", five had documented pre-existing developmental concerns;Some children were reported to have experienced first behavioural symptoms within days of MMR, but the records documented these as starting some months after vaccination;In nine cases, unremarkable colonic histopathology results—noting no or minimal fluctuations in inflammatory cell populations—were changed after a medical school "research review" to "non-specific colitis";The parents of eight children were reported as blaming MMR, but 11 families made this allegation at the hospital. The exclusion of three allegations—all giving times to onset of problems in months—helped to create the appearance of a 14 day temporal link;Patients were recruited through anti-MMR campaigners, and the study was commissioned and funded for planned litigation

       This is not true, and is another fabrication. You can read the detailed analysis of specifically that claim, made by Brian Deer, a journalist, here:

      <p>

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Yet, contrary to Deer’s claim, the above documentary evidence from the GMC hearing points to the possibility that the children underwent developmental regression, in the form of autism and bowel disease, after MMR and not before. On balance a more extensive reading of the GMC transcripts than he provides upholds rather than undermines the findings of the Lancet paper.

       Give this a look over. Presumably you read the summary on the link you provided instead of the actual study. I did too. So I searched around for what's actually in the study.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is akin to local news stories on "A new study confirms chocolate is actually advantageous to diets" or "A new study says it's good for your heart to drink 2 glasses of wine a day." It's all bunk nonsense with no real control groups, no real scientific backing other than selecting data points that provide further funding for a donor's cause. If they provide something lucrative for Company A, then Company A gives future funding and keeps churning out studies to help themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the opinion piece I linked you'll see that the Dwoskin group had their hand in funding this nonsense.

       Al Dwoskin has clear connections to providing research into the aluminum/vaccine connection for his own benefit and has also donated thousands to Democrat campaigns, including Clinton. I'm not sure what to do with this information, just thought it was an interesting connection.

       Your second claim is cited via an article published by JPANDS and its writer, Neil Z Miller. It, too, uses cherry-picked data from VAERS of all places. VAERS is used to report effects of vaccine use by literally anyone. A parent with a sick infant seeking damages can report the illness using this system the same as a nurse or physician.

       Downvoters out in full force, how surprising. To add on, the herd immunity myth is absolutely hilarious to dissect statistically:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://jbhandleyblog.com/home/2018/6/7/herd-immunity-a-dishonest-marketing-gimmick">
        https://jbhandleyblog.com/home/2018/6/7/herd-immunity-a-dishonest-marketing-gimmick
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. When I was in medical school, we were taught that all of the childhood vaccines lasted a lifetime. This thinking existed for over 70 years. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given. What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. In essence, at least 50% or more of the population was unprotected for decades.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       tl;dr: Pro-forced injectioners always claim that people who don't vaccinate put them and their children at risk due to herd immunity. Scientists repeatedly claim that a 90, 95, or 100% vaccination rate is required for herd immunity to prevent these diseases from spreading/having an outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to protection from most vaccines lasting a few years at best (if they worked at all during initial administration, many don't) we already have probably less than 50% of our populations still protected from these diseases via vaccine, as their vaccine induced immunity expired years ago. No, most middle aged people and young adults do not go get booster vaccines. According to their theory, at this rate we should be having mass outbreaks, and any person who takes their infant on the bus is exposing their child to dozens of unvaccinated individuals, and have been for decades.

       Aluminum in vaccines:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/wp-content/uploads/FDA-aluminum-paper.pdf">
        http://vaccinepapers.org/wp-content/uploads/FDA-aluminum-paper.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the paper cited by the FDA claiming aluminum hydroxide is safe to inject into infants and gone within a few days after vaccinating. Read the below passage for yourself and decide whether you think this is hard proof of aluminum being safe to use, or if the FDA is misleading you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although based on the most recent data available,
       <strong>
        there are several uncertainties in our analysis
       </strong>
       . First, the published retention function for aluminum (Eq. (1))
       <strong>
        is based on results for only one person, albeit data have been acquired from this adult for twelve years
       </strong>
       [5].
       <strong>
        Ideally, the retention function would have been derived relative to current MRL level intake in new born infants.
       </strong>
       Margin of exposure in pink. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) from pharmacokinetic data in infants or in more than one adult; however, an expansion of this analysis is unlikely.
       <strong>
        <em>
         An infant monkey study could provide these data, however, given the present lack of evidence of harm due to the current aluminum levels, such studies may be a low priority.
        </em>
       </strong>
       Second, the results of Flarend et al. [27], from which we obtained our estimate of the rate and extent of absorption of aluminum hydroxide and phosphate following intramuscular injection,
       <strong>
        <em>
         are based on data from only two rabbits per adjuvant tested
        </em>
       </strong>
       . The low number of animals in that study is not surprising, given that it was primarily an exploratory investigation into the disposition of injected aluminum, utilizing, at that time, a new method for detecting radioactive Al in the body (accelerator mass spectrometry). Ideally, the results of that study should be confirmed using a larger number of animals, in order to increase our confidence in the results.
       <strong>
        <em>
         Nevertheless, the study clearly showed that the absorption of aluminum, at least in rabbits, is neither instantaneous nor complete up to one month following intramuscular injection [27].
        </em>
       </strong>
       We consider this behavior to be more biologically plausible than complete and instantaneous absorption from the site of injection, and more consistent with the view of muscle tissue being a storage depot for aluminum adjuvant following intramuscular vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr and conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
       a. They base aluminum retention levels off only one adult human. Not been tested on infants, the primary concern with early vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       b. They base aluminum absorption rates off a study using rabbits, rodent studies have been proven irrelevant to human studies in many cases. Not only this, but only two rabbits per adjuvant tested, not very thorough.
      </p>
      <p>
       c. The article literally admits that in the rabbit study, aluminum was still present in the body after a whole month following intramuscular injections. The general consensus you'd find though, would claim its gone within a few days after vaccinating. This is clearly some sort of misconception.
      </p>
      <p>
       d. The general uncertain tone of the paper, and even request for more studies to be sure, ideally using an infant monkey, though they admit its unlikely for whatever reason (saying theres no prior evidence of aluminum being harmful? Is it unlikely to be funded by vaccine producers or FDA, for what reason? Wouldn't it be better to just confirm?) Assumptions are NOT science.

       How exactly do you want to test vaccines? Efficacy can only be tested by doing a challenge. What does that look like? Get a bunch of people, vaccinate half for hepatitis (or whatever you're vaccinating for) and leave half for a control group. Expose them and see who gets hepatitis.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one does that. It's unethical. What is done is to track disease and determine how successful a vaccine is. They generally are not 100%, but they absolutely provide immunity on the whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, no one is prooving vaccines as safe. The best anyone can say is there is no shown harm. If anyone could correlate vaccines and autism, believe me, they already would have.

       you do not understand the studies do not investigate whether or not giving 50 vaccines during childhood lead to autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They investigate whether or not children receiving more single ingredient develop autism or whether or not giving mmr in addition to many other vaccines causes autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do not investigate if vaccines per se cause autism. They have not done the studies.

         Amish vaccinate. There was some concentrated effort to promote vaccinations in the community after measles ripped through a couple Amish communities a few years ago. Amish also have autistic children. Lower rate than the general population, but then again, a good bit of autism seems to be genetic. And the Amish gene pool is not...diverse. They also get diseases pretty much unheard of in the broader population, like MSU. Your point is?

       Long ago, medicine said if you make a claim, you back it up with study results.  Hence everyone promoting apricot pits as a cure for cancer moved to Mexico.

       What makes you think vaccines would be the only cause of autism? The claim is that it increases your chances. Smoking causes cancer. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible to get cancer if you don’t smoke. You’re trying way to hard to misrepresent the argument with vaccines.

       There is a risk to any medical procedure. There is a risk in not doing any medical procedure. Fact remains that there is no evidence that vaccinations are associated with an increase in autism. So sorry the facts are not on your side.

       Smoking highly increases the risk of cancer. Science didn’t know that until the first surgeon general report in 1964. That’s how science works. You won’t know long term effects until, can you guess it, a long term has passed. You don’t know how dangerous some of these vaccines can be. There is plenty of documented incidents where vaccines were contaminated and knowingly given to patients anyway. Or patients were used as guinea pigs without their knowledge. You want to trust that same industry blindly because main stream scientists tell you to. The same scientific community that backs marijuana as a schedule one narcotic. It’s naive to ridicule someone who questions this industry. You believe corruption exists but it would never touch this multiple billion dollar market of vaccinations. Quoting sketchy scientific research funded by the CDC isn’t going to change someone’s mind who doesn’t trust them at all. The fact that you won’t even budge an inkling on the fact that corruption could and most likely does exist in the vaccination industry tells me your close minded or brainwashed.

       Based on what ive heard, seen, and experienced/not experienced, id say that vaccines is poisoning people. they always find a new reason to give us vaccines, and the increase in disease have grown paralell with the increase of vaccines(from what i can tell) i dont have any links to sources of "proof" for this statement. But what i do have is 3 people that have experienced major issues after taking vaccines. (In Norway)
1.  a friend of mine and her brother both took the svineflue vaccine a couple of years ago, they were 2 out of 4 siblings that got the vaccine. both developed a major sleep disorder, i dont remember the name of the disease, but they could sleep like 14 hours+ and still feel exhausted.
2. My own mother, she was born in 1975
She and alot of people born that year were offered a vaccine (for HPV ithink) and a disturbing amount of them including her, developed Fibro Myalgia.(a autoimmune dissorder)
      </p>
      <p>
       And to add a little bonus(this is not relevant for vaccines, but it has to do with a medical procedure)
My GF developed a autoimmune disease called ME/CFS (chronic fatigue syndrom, another autoimmune dissorder..) after a knee surgery at the age of 11/12.
      </p>
      <p>
       All totaly dependent on meds just to get through the day.
To me it doesnt make sense that the body would develope those kinds of issues, it basicly makes you allergic to yourself to put it simple, your immune system attacks your body(for no apparent reason)
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah... the blooming of such diseases are in full effect. those that are lucky to not have a physical issue, usually has some sort of mental issue(s)
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaand working at a retirement home ive also seen a pretty big increase in diseases like dementia(and the rate of how fast it developes) just within the last years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This cant be a coincidence... feel free to leave a comment if you have experienced or heard of situations like this. Or if someone could come up with an explenation for these cases.

       One scientific study linking autism and vaccines. That's all I'm asking. Until then, I'll have some faith that the whole world isn't some evil plot, just because you don't understand immunology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do doctors kids overwhelmingly get vaccinated?  Why do pharmaceutical executives vaccinate their kids? Why, why, why? May have to do with the fact that vaccinations protect people from diseases.  I think the world needs a super deadly epidemic and a really effective vaccine. And antivaxer will be a thing of the past, one way or the other.

      <p>
       Yes, all of those things are open for scrutiny. We currently hold them to be true because we have not proven them to be untrue, but there is no guarantee that it will remain that way for the rest of eternity. We operate under the assumption that our methods are adequate until such a time comes that they are proven inadequate.
