       I believe that scientists have absolutely zero clue about how much of an effect carbon emissions actually have on our climate, and therefore can’t possibly quantify any kind of “solution” to the problem.

       Florida was supposed to be on water multiple times by now. I find it funny that when doomsday peddlers get the dates wrong and then push back their predictions for some BS reason, everyone laughs at them and discredits them the next time they make that claim.
than
Yet somehow when Al Gore and “climate scientists” are
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       wrong multiple times, and just push back their predictions using BS explanations such as “The Pause” in order for their models to not be completely inaccurate, the entire MSM and much of the public somehow believes them now more than ever??
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s more conclusive evidence for them having no clue what they are talking about than there is for carbon emissions causing catastrophic global consequences in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Taurid meteor stream, solar flares, and super volcanos/massive tectonic events are far more of a threat to humanity than global warming, IMO.

       Oh dude you have no idea how wrong you are. Rockefellars, Rothchilds and the rest of the "oiligarchs" 
are VERY engaged in bringing the new "green revolution" on it's way. THEY are PUSHING it. They are the very ones who came up with the manmade global warming hoax.

       Watch James Corbett's "How big oil conquered the world" and then "Why big oil conquered the world"! (youtube/ corbettreport.com)
If you feel like you don't have that much time to spend for this, just watch WHY big oil...
In case you don't know The Corbett report/ James Corbett, he isn't some lunatic who reports every lie that fits his narative, but a real investigative journalist with an awesome reputation in the conspiracy theory world. Just saying this, because I know dolts here throw around 1.30 hour long youtube videos, made by lunatics who lie, fake and never deliver evidence/ sources and then those dolts act insulted when you don't watch all of it only to find out it was all garbage. :) Not the case here, promise. He always delivers all sources for his research. (real sources)

       You are totally right that the globalists are the primary pushers for action that responds to global warming.  The elite in almost every country are pushing for actions based on global warming.  It's a very weak argument that people make, when they suggest that the elite want coal or oil as opposed to solar or renewables.

       if anything it helps oil companies by being able to ship raw bitumen to countries that have extremely lax environmental and worker protections, then ship it back at a huuuge markup where they would be taxed to refine it. so less cost building refineries and the upkeep..., just build a once off pipeline. china for instance is still buying ever oil patch and oil company they can in canada. oil is not going anywhere

       i dont think you understand. say canada and us throw these carbon taxes on oil production. these oil companies (chinese companies own a good portion of the oil and oil companies in canada), who really really wants the oil , say you are making it too expensive to refine the bitumen on the continent, we are going to make a pipeline to the coast and refine it china or vietnam or wherever.
      </p>
      <p>
       thats why the trans mountain  pipeline is being built, to ship raw bitumen to asia where it will be refined and then shipped back and resold. this carbon tax is really good excuse to avoid the more expensive labour and tighter environmental regulations in canada. its not going to be shipping refined product, its raw bitumen (the green party has been advocating building more refineries in alberta).  they then promote all this green energy to lower the price of oil (china is buying all the oil and oil companies it can, weather you think its on its way out or not)

       These billionaires own everything.  They own the oil and coal companies and they do or will own the renewable sources of energy.  There is little risk to them in switching from gas to solar or whatever.  They are very good at just taking over industries.

       Maurice Strong: With all the evidence that we’ve amassed in our preparations for the Stockholm Conference, including the views of many of world’s leading scientists, I am convinced that the prophets of doom have got to be taken seriously. In other words, doomsday is a possibility. I am equally convinced that doomsday is not inevitable.”...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ....But perhaps the most remarkable thing about Strong, this ubiquitous figure of the 20th century environmental movement, was his background: a Rockefeller-connected millionaire from the Alberta oil patch who divided his time between environmental campaigning and running major oil companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand how this came about, we have to examine the history of the emergence of the environmental movement. In the post-war period, the desire to control the population put on a new mask: protecting the world from resource depletion, pollution and ecological catastrophe. And, as always, the Rockefeller family was there to provide the funding and organizational support to steer this burgeoning movement toward their own ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joining the Rockefellers in shaping the international environmental movement were their fellow oiligarchs across the Atlantic, including the British royals behind BP and the Dutch Royals behind Royal Dutch Shell. And facilitating the transition from eugenics to population control to environmentalism was Julian Huxley, brother of Brave New World author Aldous Huxley and grandson of “Darwin’s bulldog” T.H. Huxley.
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian Huxley was a committed eugenicist, chairing the British Eugenics Society from 1959 to 1962. But, like the other eugenicists of the post-war era, he understood the need to pursue the now-discredited work of eugenics under a different guise. The founding director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Huxley wrote in the agency’s founding document about the need to find ways to make the cause of eugenics politically viable once again:
      </p>
      <p>
       “At the moment, it is probable that the indirect effect of civilisation is dysgenic instead of eugenic; and in any case it seems likely that the dead weight of genetic stupidity, physical weakness, mental instability, and disease-proneness, which already exist in the human species, will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved. Thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf">
        http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf
       </a>
      </p>

       Huxley found the perfect front for the re-introduction of those “unthinkable” eugenical ideas in 1948, when he used UNESCO as a springboard for founding the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and then again in 1961, when he used that agency as a springboard to create the World Wildlife Fund. Joining Huxley as co-founders of the fund were not only Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, founder of the Bilderberg Group and former employee of the IG Farben conglomerate, and Prince Philip of England, but Godfrey A. Rockefeller of the Rockefeller dynasty. Together, they pledged to “harness public opinion and educate the world about the necessity for conservation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1987, Strong helped to organize another environmental conference, much less known but no less remarkable than the Stockholm summit. Dubbed the 4th World Wilderness Congress, the meeting took place in Denver, Colorado, and brought together Strong, David Rockefeller, Edmond de Rothschild, then-Treasury Secretary James Baker, and a gaggle of other oiligarchs, bankers, Washington power players and globalists, ostensibly to talk about the environment. What they actually discussed was altogether more incredible:
      </p>
      <p>
       DAVID LANG: I suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process. That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, that populates the earth. We have to take almost an elitist program, [so] that we can see beyond our swollen bellies, and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood, or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.

      <p>
       Those were the words of David Lang, a banker from Montreal who spoke during the conference. And to Lang, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and the other bankers and oiligarchs assembled at the meeting, the general population are “cannon fodder” that “unfortunately […] populates the earth.” This candid admission, a perfect encapsulation of the eugenical ideas at the heart of the global conservation movement funded into existence by the oiligarchs themselves, was caught on tape by George Hunt, a businessman in Boulder, Colorado, who had volunteered to help the conference as a concerned citizen and came away horrified by what he had witnessed there. He released his own recordings of the proceedings in the early 1990s to warn the public about this group and its ultimate aims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hunt’s recording captured the moment when Maurice Strong introduced Baron Edmond de Rothschild — whose father’s cousin had sold the Rothschild’s Azerbaijani oil fields to Royal Dutch Shell in 1911 — as a pioneer of the environmental movement and a founder of the concept of “conservation banking.”

       So there's a huge conspiracy to push climate change and

        potentially

       make money on new energy tech, and it's being funded through debt on the hope that it works?

       But there's NOT a conspiracy to deny climate change so that current billionaire oil/gas companies can continue to make the money they are making?

       This chart seems extremely fake (no scales, no margins of error, WAY too smooth, mentions a-historical events like the Hebrew Exodus...). I was curious, so I looked around and found
       <a href="http://www.longrangeweather.com/global_temperatures.htm">
        the source
       </a>
       . There, I found 0 discussion of methodology, which can be compared with
       <a href="https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/climate-campus/global-climate-change/trends/">
        similar reconstruction of north hemisphere temperatures
       </a>
       which discuss in full the data used (ice cores, tree rings, sediments etc.) and the associated uncertainties. How do you reconcile these discrepancies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the "about us" page makes me suspect that at least Cliff Harris isn't a trained scientist, and just appropriated the "climatologist" tag to lend himself authority. His bio cites "Since age 11, he has compiled nearly 100 weather scrapbooks that detail major events throughout the U.S. and the world on a daily basis" as evidence of how smart he is, but no alma mater. And of course, his occupation is just to run a weather station and write for a local column...

      <p>
       Why? Marxists are by definition collectivist just like communists and Nazis were.  Why would I treat a collectivist like an individual?  Maybe so you can take advantage of our individual rights when it protects you and suits you then the antifa masks go on and you try to strip others of their individual rights when it's convenient and suits you as collectivist mobs.

       I've listened to a ton of him. I don't know about that, he says he's a liberal but I think since his popularity he's become a lot more conservative since he's exposed to the worst of the left almost 24/7. Ive been following him since his UT viral video, seen all lectures, read maps of meaning, seen almost all his interviews but I probably missed a couple since there's so many...
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite all that, not really a fan of his politics I think his hysteria about the left is misfocused, the right wing is a much bigger problem and threat to democracy.

       It's not a ridiculous thing to be worried about, it's literally a thing trying to be pushed by the ipcc, the EU and all the 3 letter global government agencies IMF, CFR.  And yes this is exactly how sovereignty disappears. Any moron who has two brain cells to rub together can see that the US republic gave way to the US federation by creating new authorities above but outside of the existing republic that eventually devoured the sovereignty of the individual states, and that same moron might try observing the shit-show that is happening as EU member states are systematically having their sovereignty stripped away by what started as a "free trade union".

       They aren't the ones collecting the carbon tax though, it's just an initiative to get companies to lower their impact on the environment. And it's pretty effective too, the extra revenue is usually used towards social services or national park maintenance while companies become 'greener'. Works well in Canada at least

       Really, the whole idea was hatched by a global entity and is being rolled out by local governments at the moment.  I wonder how many increments until it's all just handed over to carbon tax central in Brussels and reinvested in new and interesting ways to tax the new member states.

       It's settled in the sense that 99% of climate scientist are no longer arguing over whether or not man made climate change is real and a problem. It's such a complex topic that models are always being updated or changed based on new knowledge but the underlying hypothesis still holds true. Too much Carbon in the atmosphere = bad, humans add too much extra to the climate

       I find this quite ironic, tbh. Yes, I've looked at both sides, and I'm not convinced, hence why I said what I've said. How are you not understanding this?

       If you're asking if I have a degree, then... no, I don't. I'm self taught in many topics. Degrees are pointless, imo (ie. garbage in, garbage out - indoctrination).

       That’s what I thought too. But there really are people who think climate change is completely fake. Like, that’s it’s not happening at all. I can buy the argument that it’s not man-made phenomena, but there really are people who think it’s completely made up.

       There's billions of people on the planet, so you're bound to find people that will support any theory, but how common do you think it is that people don't believe the planets warming at all?  I think the percentage of people that believe that is tremendously small compared to people that wholesale believe in man-made global warming and people who believe in global warming but that it's not man-made.

       Instead of arguing against strawmen, you're welcome to propose your own solutions to the underlying problem.  If your side of the issue gave a rats ass of its own about saving the planet, it be fairly easy for them to get support for emission reduction schemes that kept control local and did not increase taxation.

       Um  since you mentioned strawmen I'm going to assume that you deny the global carbon tax reality.  You're just the type that will continue to lie to people and deny that the worst part of the thing you're supporting exists at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude I've been saving the planet since the fucking 80s. And guess what? No matter how many hundreds of millions of people recycle religiously and volunteer hundreds of hours of their time doing ecosystem clean ups with their community, I pull trashbags full of litter out of the river every time I go canoeing (I literally never see anyone else doing this) but none of fucking matters so some fucking scientist over in Europe who have been pushing for carbon taxes to fund their little Ponzi scheme for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want the hard truth about how to save the planet?  Stop shipping cheap food and energy to 3rd world breeders who turn around and literally fill huge rivers with trash while having zero intention of ever changing their ways.  Eventually those billions die off and the planet is saved.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's fucking reality.

       Wow, you're so close to getting it, and yet so far away.  Small scale, individual acts of "saving the planet" don't matter when the larger economic system is designed to make things worse regardless.  What would make a difference would be systemic alteration would be internalizing the externality by a price on carbon.  No Ponzi scheme required, no matter how hard you try to convince yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pricing carbon would also lead directly to less food and energy being shipped to the third world.  The people who support pricing carbon generally also support subsidizing contraception in the third world, which would be the easiest way to calm your demographic fears.  Meanwhile, the groups that oppose pricing carbon also support heavy export-oriented agricultural subsidies, and oppose anything that seems like decent sex-ed or contraception for the third world.  Leaving aside that, however bad the third world's trash may seem anecdotally, the truth is that the vast majority of climate altering pollution comes from the first world.

       I do plenty productive about it myself, but like you said one person doing the little things means jack all compared to the scale of everything else happening.  I don't want someone else to take care of it for me, but nice projection there. You could actually engage in discussing how to solve the issue, but instead you spend your time fantasizing about the psychology of the people who do.

       But yes lets call in the big government to do everything for us.  we can just throw money at the problem and it will magically vanish, even if it doesn't vanish we'll have tax deductible proof that we did something about it! we'll be able to blame all those deniers even though we personally never make single choice in life with the good of the planet and ecosystem in mind.

       What part of what I said is projection?  You've got demographic fears, contraception'd be a better solution for them than mass famine, and contraception is obviously more supported by one side of politics than the other.

       If you're going to accuse me of projecting and being a deceptive debater, you probably shouldn't base your argument on speculations about my motivation and consumption patterns.  You're deflecting from the substance of the issue to whine about people you don't like.

       Maurice Strong: With all the evidence that we’ve amassed in our preparations for the Stockholm Conference, including the views of many of world’s leading scientists, I am convinced that the prophets of doom have got to be taken seriously. In other words, doomsday is a possibility. I am equally convinced that doomsday is not inevitable.”...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ....But perhaps the most remarkable thing about Strong, this ubiquitous figure of the 20th century environmental movement, was his background: a Rockefeller-connected millionaire from the Alberta oil patch who divided his time between environmental campaigning and running major oil companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand how this came about, we have to examine the history of the emergence of the environmental movement. In the post-war period, the desire to control the population put on a new mask: protecting the world from resource depletion, pollution and ecological catastrophe. And, as always, the Rockefeller family was there to provide the funding and organizational support to steer this burgeoning movement toward their own ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joining the Rockefellers in shaping the international environmental movement were their fellow oiligarchs across the Atlantic, including the British royals behind BP and the Dutch Royals behind Royal Dutch Shell. And facilitating the transition from eugenics to population control to environmentalism was Julian Huxley, brother of Brave New World author Aldous Huxley and grandson of “Darwin’s bulldog” T.H. Huxley.
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian Huxley was a committed eugenicist, chairing the British Eugenics Society from 1959 to 1962. But, like the other eugenicists of the post-war era, he understood the need to pursue the now-discredited work of eugenics under a different guise. The founding director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Huxley wrote in the agency’s founding document about the need to find ways to make the cause of eugenics politically viable once again:
      </p>
      <p>
       “At the moment, it is probable that the indirect effect of civilisation is dysgenic instead of eugenic; and in any case it seems likely that the dead weight of genetic stupidity, physical weakness, mental instability, and disease-proneness, which already exist in the human species, will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved. Thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf">
        http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000681/068197eo.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Huxley found the perfect front for the re-introduction of those “unthinkable” eugenical ideas in 1948, when he used UNESCO as a springboard for founding the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and then again in 1961, when he used that agency as a springboard to create the World Wildlife Fund. Joining Huxley as co-founders of the fund were not only Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, founder of the Bilderberg Group and former employee of the IG Farben conglomerate, and Prince Philip of England, but Godfrey A. Rockefeller of the Rockefeller dynasty. Together, they pledged to “harness public opinion and educate the world about the necessity for conservation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1987, Strong helped to organize another environmental conference, much less known but no less remarkable than the Stockholm summit. Dubbed the 4th World Wilderness Congress, the meeting took place in Denver, Colorado, and brought together Strong, David Rockefeller, Edmond de Rothschild, then-Treasury Secretary James Baker, and a gaggle of other oiligarchs, bankers, Washington power players and globalists, ostensibly to talk about the environment. What they actually discussed was altogether more incredible:
      </p>
      <p>
       DAVID LANG: I suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process. That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, that populates the earth. We have to take almost an elitist program, [so] that we can see beyond our swollen bellies, and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood, or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.wild.org/wild-congress/4wwc/">

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8c-NKjOOA0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Those were the words of David Lang, a banker from Montreal who spoke during the conference. And to Lang, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and the other bankers and oiligarchs assembled at the meeting, the general population are “cannon fodder” that “unfortunately […] populates the earth.” This candid admission, a perfect encapsulation of the eugenical ideas at the heart of the global conservation movement funded into existence by the oiligarchs themselves, was caught on tape by George Hunt, a businessman in Boulder, Colorado, who had volunteered to help the conference as a concerned citizen and came away horrified by what he had witnessed there. He released his own recordings of the proceedings in the early 1990s to warn the public about this group and its ultimate aims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hunt’s recording captured the moment when Maurice Strong introduced Baron Edmond de Rothschild — whose father’s cousin had sold the Rothschild’s Azerbaijani oil fields to Royal Dutch Shell in 1911 — as a pioneer of the environmental movement and a founder of the concept of “conservation banking.”

the majority of the People do not have the Resources to think about,
People who spent Time “in the Outside”, have the possibility to Research and understand the Mechanism of Climate do not think that the so called “global Warming” is a Hoax!

       It’s not that people don’t believe it’s fake...are our waterways getting more polluted? Are we trashing our planet? I think we can all agree on that.

      <p>
       Where I don’t agree is with their solution to global warming or now climate change. It’s a financial scam. It’s a financial scam that will have zero impact on cleaning up our world and will only make the poorer more poor and the rich more richer. It’s a financial scam!

       No one thinks the Paris Agreement actually solves anything.  The Kyoto Protocol, which was very different, might have solved it, but only because at that early date the problem was much smaller.  Carbon credits are not taxes on nations that use carbon, the Paris Agreement does not mandate specific mechanisms for national emission reductions, there's plenty of ways to reduce carbon usage without tax revenues going beyond the local level, or even without taxes on carbon at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, because this is a problem that will disproportionately affect nations and communities that have not historically and do not currently have high emissions, any moral system more evolved than "fuck you got mine" should be able to accept that there should be significant economic transfer for rich to poor in addressing this issue.  Moreover, since ethics in economics isn't something y'all tend to support, even someone with a basic understanding of science or geopolitics should understand why some rich-poor economic transfer is required for rich nations and demographics to achieve their own optimal result.

       Because many extremely rich and powerful people become and stay extremely rich and powerful by doing things that warm the planet, and so have both an incentive to convince people that global warming isn't real, as well as the resources to finance campaigns to that effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, the evidence for global warming has gotten so overwhelming that the denialist line has shifted from "its not happening" to "its happening, but its either not human's fault or too expensive to address."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is enhanced by the fact that older people wield more political and economic power than younger people.  Why care if the ice cap will melt by 2050 if you're going to die by 2040?  Moreover, for the older generation to acknowledge global warming as a problem would require them to acknowledge that their lifestyle choices contributed significantly to it.  Baby boomers are notably narcissistic, and thus susceptible to anything that absolves them of guilt.

       I've spent at least a few years researching and talking about climate change, and this point you make is almost entirely the reason why we have deniers and no real movement on the issue. This is really the core of the problem and it's just maddening.

       Maurice Strong: With all the evidence that we’ve amassed in our preparations for the Stockholm Conference, including the views of many of world’s leading scientists, I am convinced that the prophets of doom have got to be taken seriously. In other words, doomsday is a possibility. I am equally convinced that doomsday is not inevitable.”...

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YCatox0Lxo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ....But perhaps the most remarkable thing about Strong, this ubiquitous figure of the 20th century environmental movement, was his background: a Rockefeller-connected millionaire from the Alberta oil patch who divided his time between environmental campaigning and running major oil companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand how this came about, we have to examine the history of the emergence of the environmental movement. In the post-war period, the desire to control the population put on a new mask: protecting the world from resource depletion, pollution and ecological catastrophe. And, as always, the Rockefeller family was there to provide the funding and organizational support to steer this burgeoning movement toward their own ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joining the Rockefellers in shaping the international environmental movement were their fellow oiligarchs across the Atlantic, including the British royals behind BP and the Dutch Royals behind Royal Dutch Shell. And facilitating the transition from eugenics to population control to environmentalism was Julian Huxley, brother of Brave New World author Aldous Huxley and grandson of “Darwin’s bulldog” T.H. Huxley.
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian Huxley was a committed eugenicist, chairing the British Eugenics Society from 1959 to 1962. But, like the other eugenicists of the post-war era, he understood the need to pursue the now-discredited work of eugenics under a different guise. The founding director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Huxley wrote in the agency’s founding document about the need to find ways to make the cause of eugenics politically viable once again:
      </p>

       “At the moment, it is probable that the indirect effect of civilisation is dysgenic instead of eugenic; and in any case it seems likely that the dead weight of genetic stupidity, physical weakness, mental instability, and disease-proneness, which already exist in the human species, will prove too great a burden for real progress to be achieved. Thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care, and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”

       Huxley found the perfect front for the re-introduction of those “unthinkable” eugenical ideas in 1948, when he used UNESCO as a springboard for founding the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and then again in 1961, when he used that agency as a springboard to create the World Wildlife Fund. Joining Huxley as co-founders of the fund were not only Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, founder of the Bilderberg Group and former employee of the IG Farben conglomerate, and Prince Philip of England, but Godfrey A. Rockefeller of the Rockefeller dynasty. Together, they pledged to “harness public opinion and educate the world about the necessity for conservation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1987, Strong helped to organize another environmental conference, much less known but no less remarkable than the Stockholm summit. Dubbed the 4th World Wilderness Congress, the meeting took place in Denver, Colorado, and brought together Strong, David Rockefeller, Edmond de Rothschild, then-Treasury Secretary James Baker, and a gaggle of other oiligarchs, bankers, Washington power players and globalists, ostensibly to talk about the environment. What they actually discussed was altogether more incredible:
      </p>
      <p>
       DAVID LANG: I suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process. That would take too long and devour far too much of the funds to educate the cannon fodder, unfortunately, that populates the earth. We have to take almost an elitist program, [so] that we can see beyond our swollen bellies, and look to the future in time frames and in results which are not easily understood, or which can be, with intellectual honesty, be reduced down to some kind of simplistic definition.

      </p>
      <p>
       Those were the words of David Lang, a banker from Montreal who spoke during the conference. And to Lang, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and the other bankers and oiligarchs assembled at the meeting, the general population are “cannon fodder” that “unfortunately […] populates the earth.” This candid admission, a perfect encapsulation of the eugenical ideas at the heart of the global conservation movement funded into existence by the oiligarchs themselves, was caught on tape by George Hunt, a businessman in Boulder, Colorado, who had volunteered to help the conference as a concerned citizen and came away horrified by what he had witnessed there. He released his own recordings of the proceedings in the early 1990s to warn the public about this group and its ultimate aims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hunt’s recording captured the moment when Maurice Strong introduced Baron Edmond de Rothschild — whose father’s cousin had sold the Rothschild’s Azerbaijani oil fields to Royal Dutch Shell in 1911 — as a pioneer of the environmental movement and a founder of the concept of “conservation banking.”

       The best argument against man-made global warming is that rapid climate change is being seen on planets and moons throughout our solar system that is further than can be explained by normal seasonal weather changes.  If changes are happening all over the solar system, than it is logical that whatever is driving their changes is also a strong contributor to the changes on Earth.  I would recommend David Wilcock's Wisdom Teachings series on Gaia.com as the best explanation of that theory (Season 28).  It is well worth the monthly subscription to gaia to become well versed on the topic.

       If you look at temperature samples over large periods of time you can see that the fluctuations we are experiencing today are nothing new. The climate change supporters hand pick their sample data from a small period of time instead of sampling over larger periods of time; this way they can make climate change seem much more alarming and new than it is. Pollution is bad for the Earth, but climate change is a load of crap and a way for corrupt politicians to steal more money from us.

       Because the people pushing it are socialists who advocate solutions that require government to tax and control behavior. Cap and trade is a perfect example among others.

       There's enough proof out there that aliens do exist and the government has reverse engineered their methods of travel. Reportedly these vehicles are able to travel faster than light. It obviously takes some pretty exotic sources of energy to power something capable of these feats. If earth were really in any danger due to fossil fuels and other methods of contemporary energy generation, I'm sure this would be marched out to the public next week.

       If Man Made Climate Change is Such a Slam Dunk, Why Do They Keep Faking Data?
      </h1>
      <p>
       In  science you never change the data, but in Global Warming / Climate  Change, they keep 'adjusting' past data. Why lower the temps from 70+  years ago to make the past look colder &amp; make the present look  warmer? Maybe because your global warming models don't work unless you  cheat?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are some examples. There are many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Switzerland’s weather bureau adjusted its raw temperature data so that
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150522010938/http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2015/05/18/temperature-fibbers-being-investigated">
        “the temperatures reported were consistently higher than those actually recorded.”
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Homewood documented how NASA has “homogenized” temperature data across Paraguay
       <a href="https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/all-of-paraguays-temperature-record-has-been-tampered-with/#more-12774">

       The  Australian Bureau of Meteorology admits it adjusts temperatures  resulting in higher temperatures for the present and lower numbers for  the past--
       <strong>
        showing a historical warming trend
       </strong>
       --that didn't exist.
       <a href="https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/australian-meteorologists-caught-fudging-numbers">
        The  difference between actually measured temperatures and homogenized  temperatures topped 4 degrees Celsius over certain periods at some  measuring stations.

        “Almost  all the alterations resulted in higher temperatures being reported for  the present and lower numbers for the past–with the higher numbers being  used to demonstrate a historical warming trend–than the numbers that  were actually recorded,”

       I think people realize that the "right people" profit from the politics and business of "Global Warming/Climate Change/ManBearPig". I may be mistaken, but the carbon tax (etc) will go to a non-governmental, New World Order, organization for administration. The continued erosion of State sovereignty.

       I believe that scientists have absolutely zero clue about how much of an effect carbon emissions actually have on our climate, and therefore can’t possibly quantify any kind of “solution” to the problem.

       Florida was supposed to be on water multiple times by now. I find it funny that when doomsday peddlers get the dates wrong and then push back their predictions for some BS reason, everyone laughs at them and discredits them the next time they make that claim.
than
Yet somehow when Al Gore and “climate scientists” are
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       wrong multiple times, and just push back their predictions using BS explanations such as “The Pause” in order for their models to not be completely inaccurate, the entire MSM and much of the public somehow believes them now more than ever??
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s more conclusive evidence for them having no clue what they are talking about than there is for carbon emissions causing catastrophic global consequences in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Taurid meteor stream, solar flares, and super volcanos/massive tectonic events are far more of a threat to humanity than global warming, IMO.
