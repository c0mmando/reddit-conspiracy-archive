        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey, there is a famous story of aliens coming close to a place called Clayton, Victoria, Australia. </p>

<p>A very underwhelming part of the world that has some poverty but would of been almost all farmland in 1966. The year england won the world cup (shudder), and aliens. A flying saucer type craft landed at a school in the previous said area. </p>

<p>Apparently hundreds of school children witnessed this event and it made the very local news. </p>

<p>Ive often found this note worth yet I now think it a fake. My assumption it was some sort of American military thing - Australia is often. Used as a oversized military base. </p>

<p>Indeed I think the very notion of aliens is pretty fake why are the mainstream pop culture and science pushing it so strongly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you talking about the Westall event?- It was near Clayton yes. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s an area of poverty - it&#39;s a big industrial park now more than anything. Coca Cola-Amatil etc are there. Mostly factories and suburbia.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read the accounts, it&#39;s one of the more corroborated and documented events/sightings though I don&#39;t know what it was. I don&#39;t really buy into it being aliens though. I never do really. </p>

<p>People just really like sci-fi which is why you see it in mainstream pop culture. I haven&#39;t seen &quot;science&quot; pushing the existence of aliens really, sorry. I don&#39;t think TPTB are doing anything re aliens right now - there&#39;s plenty of other horseshit going on for them to deal with, whoever you think TPTB are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% agreed - the entire ancient aliens narrative was created by agents IMO and just about all the people that claim to have seen them or know about them are military - a.k.a., soldiers repeating what they&#39;re told to repeat.  William Cooper has a lot of work on this - he was former intel that flipped.  He was caught up in some of the alien propaganda for a while but after some time realized it was all bunk as well.  Cheers, good post</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most of the modern purveyors of this type of theory are false, and I think for the most part the information they have provided is also misleading, but I haven&#39;t investigated a lot of their claims specifically, so I can&#39;t really say for sure.</p>

<p>I think the work of Zacharia Sitchin is very suspect - I believe him to have been a disinfo agent.</p>

I think most of the statements in recent times are sketchy at best and the people telling the story are in it for some money.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll also agree that Sitchin wasn&#39;t perfect but I don&#39;t think errors made him a disinfo agent.  I think the teams at Oxford and Columbia offering their translations have helped Sitchin&#39;s work. There&#39;s many others such as Gerald Clark and Michael Tsarion that back his work as well. You can even translate the tablets yourself. There&#39;s a cuneiform translation app now.</p>

<p>The fact that the Aratta civilization, which was thousands of years older than Sumer, specifically mentioned the Annunaki really made me a believer in the alien creation story. Then when you add in all the other pieces of the big puzzle and everything falls into place (for me, I can&#39;t stress that enough, for me!!) I was pretty much sold. I am also always willing to admit that I could be wrong if I find some new evidence that changes my mind.</p>

<p>But anyway, appreciate the little chat. Good luck in your search for the truth! Take it easy my friend..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting, thanks.  I&#39;ve heard in a few places that Sitchin was a confirmed agent but I&#39;m having difficulty finding it now - it wasn&#39;t merely suspicion or his imperfections that led me to believe this but actual work I had found regarding his past and his life and his associates.</p>

<p>Always fascinating to learn about more ancient civilizations - will have to look into Aratta.  Appreciate your thoughts and best of luck to you as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard similar accusations about ZS so I really never trusted him until other researchers backed his claims.</p>

<p>I&#39;m actually really surprised and disappointed with Micheal Tsarion. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever heard about him being suspect at all. I&#39;m a huge fan of his work and everything I&#39;ve ever checked on his sources were accurate. I know he uses folklore or tribal stories passed on by oral tradition.  So just using that can change a story from 1 generation to the next. </p>

<p>Thanks for that Tsarion info. Take care!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are  conflating my two points, that the entities are real, while the explanation of their nature (&quot;aliens from outer space&quot;) is manufactured.</p>

<p>The modern description of these entities is separate from what they are in reality. Yes, we all know if the historical accounts of Star People, Gods from the Heavens... But not &quot;aliens from outer space&quot;. Obviously they are taking about the same thing but you are underestimating the importance of language in this.</p>

<p>The words, the specific phrase, &quot;aliens from outer space&quot; did not exist before then. If you went back to 1900, 1910 and said &quot;flying saucer, martians and aliens&quot; they wouldn&#39;t know what you are talking about. Yes, looking at history you can see the obvious parallel between the star people and the gods of mythology, but that is not what I&#39;m addressing.</p>
