Unless you see something with your own eyes, there will always be some uncertainty. This day and age, pictures, videos, articles, “police reports”, literally anything, can easily be produced. It’s important not trust media (which I hope most people in this subreddit know). At the same time, being fixated on one theory or outcome is no better than being fixated on a story the news presents. Always just have an open mind and try to see things from as many perspectives as you can. You’ve all probably heard this but a reminder never hurts :)</p>

I entertain that it&#39;s a viable possibility. Some people think so, that&#39;s their belief, yes it robs life of meaning, just like countless other things these days. But really how is a simulation any different from &quot;reality&quot; when everything is perceived in our own brains anyways... What difference would it make???

<p>My theory is that they&#39;re trying to cull the numbers.  There&#39;s been many posts of there being sterility issues on a global scale in regards to males.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if those in power know that our present status as a planet (the amount of people living in areas that are drying up for example) is not sustainable.  They very well could be releasing something, in some form (chem trails, food, whatever) that&#39;s making males sterile.  That&#39;d be a less violent, world changing way to depopulate than nukes for example.  Slowly depopulate the planet by curbing reproduction. </p>

<p>On one side, you have people thinking Earth is overpopulated, and on the other side, you have people who think TPTB are trying to cull the population. See how this could be very effective for TPTB? Both rely on fear. Get where I&#39;m going with this?</p>

<p>Exactly! We all talk about how evil the UN is and such, but, these are the organizations giving us these &quot;stats&quot;. CT&#39;s are kind of holding a double thought here.</p>

<p>It also brings more sense to the phrase: &quot;It&#39;s a small world&quot;. Because, really it is (population wise). IDK, just an interesting thought I&#39;ve been thinking about lately, and OP reminded me of it.</p>

<p>Wow, can you link me up on that? Didn&#39;t find much.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well you can make a country/state more or <em>less</em> relevant by the number of its population. I definitely don&#39;t doubt it. But the taxes wouldn&#39;t match up.</p>

<p>The thing is, there&#39;s places like the favelas in Brazil where the government literally has no control of. They have their own services (water, TV, commerce), their own taxes (to drug dealers), their own police and they might even create their own <a href="https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-43954042">bank and money</a>. It&#39;s expected that <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/mais-de-900-milhoes-de-pessoas-vivem-em-favelas-diz-relatorio-da-onu-20313751">900 million</a> people live in favelas in Brazil alone, but the number could be and probably is even higher. Also &quot;small&quot; cities in China have a population of 500.000! India aswell.</p>

<p>But I would doubt that someone <em>isn&#39;t</em> taking advantage of population numbers to make money tho.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take Texas, a place I&#39;ve spent a lot of time. Between Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Fort Worth and El Paso, you&#39;re talking 8 million people--just within the city limits.

<p>Now go to all the big east coast cities: New York, Boston, D.C., Atlanta, Miami and so on. On the west coast, suburban L.A. has 13 million people all by itself. </p>

<p>it adds up pretty quickly. Right now 81% live in &quot;urban areas,&quot; which are cities and suburbs around those cities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, if you went to India, China, Indonesia, you&#39;d see that there&#39;s an enormous abundance of people. It&#39;s actually mind boggling to see these crowds in person, to see them between the millions of buildings, in giant urban centres. I&#39;m surprised that there&#39;s just 8 Billion of us and I truly hope we will stop at 9B at most, otherwise the immigration into Europe will be fatal to us living here.</p>

<p>In addition to being open minded, I&#39;ll say don&#39;t be lazy. As in put in your due diligence and do more than skimming through headlines and reading the top comments. In my experience, the internet is the place for leads. The library(books) is where your money is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what people don&#39;t understand about the way this manipulation can be so effective. People assume a huge population of really smart intellectuals you would assume there are more that a million professional physicists in the whole world but there isn&#39;t there&#39;s less. And even less when all these theories were being solidified and the text books written. Mark train was spot on with his assertion that a lie is easy to make people believe it&#39;s in the un-telling of that lie where the struggle is.</p>
