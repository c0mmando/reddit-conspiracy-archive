<p>As the people tire of the same old terrorism boodyman used to justify unnecessary war they needed a new plan. A way to justify war with whom ever they pleased. A way that no regular citizen could debunk or prove wrong. A way that only their guys could prove. </p>

<p>Well she lost and then came the CIA Vault 7 leak. It outline how the CIA routinely hack and leave false fingerprints to make it look like who ever they don&#39;t like did the hacking.  </p>

<p>In 2001 9/11 and the terrorism boogyman was used to justify war actions in many countries. Probably many more than you even heard about. How was a new decade of wars going to be justified? This was the plan and thankfully it was not followed through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to discuss Trump&#39;s military ambitions then make your own post and stop forum sliding this one. If I was to bring up the history of the Civil War would you also try to derail discussion by interjecting with stuff about Trump?</p>

<p>Why are we no longer allowed real discussion without the censorship people like you create? Why does the left want to dismantle free speech in universities around the world? Why does the left want to amend the first amendment to only cover speech that does not offend someone? Why does the left want to remove the 2cd amendment? Why does the left try so hard to have lynchings where a person is convicted on accusation alone (6th amendment)? Why does the left label anyone that disagrees with them and then uses that to justify violence(punch a nazi)?</p>

<p>Why do you hate rights and truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I responded to you saying someone lived in an illusionary reality, after they commented that the increase in military activity that you suggested would happen under clinton is actually happening anyway regardless of who potus is. there is no discussion you were trying to have, you asked no questions in the op, criticisms of the conclusion you drew were labeled forum sliding.</p>

<p>Ooh oooh let me try!
Conservatives love war and fake patriotism and guns cause it makes them feel like winners that’s why they fall in line so easily when the government lets them know which country now needs an extra large dose of freedom, maybe that’s why it’s only ever the liberals who need convincing to go to war, since for the right all you need to do is say “terrorism” and you’ll get showered by mating calls of “murica” and the sounds of slide actions being pulled back. </p>

<p>Democrats want government to have power, republicans want corporations to have power. In both cases, the average citizen does not have power. Demonization of only one side can only be described as willful ignorance. </p>
