       The whole two political party left-right thing is theater. They're all actors. They give you Obama followed by Trump. Gotta keep both sides riled up. The political "fallout" for any action is like people fighting over "The Days of Our Lives" episodes. They've done this theater so well and for so long, it has become a religion for a lot of people.

       This is exactly what trump is doing right now, hes reducing funding in areas we actually need funding in, IE social security, healthcare and other services, while increasing funding in the military and militarizing the police.

       Social security is a scam. I would rather that my SS taxes and invest it how I want. Healthcare would be better with some competition incentivizes innovation, improves quality, and decreases costs. Once the government has a monopoly on healthcare, education, guns(security) they effectively own you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free choice is everything. Social Security takes your money and deprives you of free choice. Single payer takes your money and spends it for you and deprives you of free choice. Military and police are one of the few legitimate things we need from the government. The issue is too much bullshit laws the police need to enforce not too much police.

       Anyone from the boomer generation would completely disagree with you.   My father and mother are both able to retire with a passive income due to social security, and invest their money however they want in a 401K if they so choose to.   They literally do not have to worry about retirement due to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Acting like social security takes your money and deprives you of free choice is because its been gutted over the last several decades.

       Return on investment on SS is pretty crappy and not guaranteed to be there. It was a pyramid scheme from the start.

       Especially true if you happen to know that there is no real difference between the contenders. As different as they look, Obama and Trump are really the same guy. They need a different actor for that spot every 8 years. And they get better results if the new guy doesn't look like the guy that's leaving. They sure got that effect with O and Trump.

       I generally agree with that statement and Republicans
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       fuck up a lot but bear in mind Rs have significantly reduced the size and strength if the federal government in the past two years. Tax and regulation cuts hamper the ability of leftists to control their population. Jobs foster independence from the government while job killing regulations foster dependency on the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       ** When evaluating politics and policies ask yourself two very important questions; **
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Does this policy protect freedom or restrict it. The purpose of government is to protect freedom not grant it when it feels like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Does this policy foster financial independence or does it encourage dependency on the government and hurt jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jobs create financial independence. Right now unemployment is at a 20 year low. The unemployment rate for blacks, Hispanic, and female Americans is at an
       <strong>
        all time ever low
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a nightmare for the party who is dependent on votes coming in from people on welfare and other entitlements. It’s not a coincidence that the same party passes job killing regulations and laws.

       Ron Paul is/was by no means the only truly anti-war politician, and I don't like how the libertarians want to gut social programs. My favorite person in Congress right now is probably Tulsi Gabbard, who articulately opposes all the imperialism, supports weed legalization and ending the Drug War, and Bernie Sanders' domestic economic agenda of helping working-class people, not just the super rich. There are other good people too, on the left and the libertarian right.

       It's a link about how Tulsi Gabbard is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. That's what I get on this sub every time her name comes up. It doesn't really mean anything. Her voting record, positions, and rhetoric are outstanding. No one says anything of substance to say against Tulsi, because informed people tend to agree with her. But it's cool and edgy to say tat everyone sucks, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some great people in political office, and they deserve our support. I'm a big fan of my representative, Jared Polis. Bernie Sanders is great too, maybe not perfect on foreign policy, but very well-meaning with a clear, strong economic agenda. These people are doing the actual work that needs to be done politically, while anarchists sit on the sidelines complaining. Stop bitching and start a revolution.

       Please give me a link about "Russian privatization vouchers." I don't even know what that means. People come up with the weirdest shit in order to attack good people. It tends to be an elaborate justification for your own laziness. "All politicians suck and so does the world, so I'll sit on my ass and drink all day." Get off your ass and get involved in the world. Polis is a wonderful person; I've met him many times. And a hard-working progressive and one of the top marijuana legalizers in the country. He started the Cannabis Caucus in Congress, to legalize weed. And what the fuck have you done?

        Nor did he know a thing about Russian privatization vouchers when he was 18. Speaking very little Russian, he went to Russia one summer to witness the fall of communism firsthand. He wound up trading vouchers that were awarded to Russian citizens to allow them to take part in government auctions of companies.

       See though Ron Paul didn’t support the legalization of weed, he consistently voted and spoke abut how the federal government has no business in that type of choice! Also of course against imperialism. But hey he’s out now, I was shocked to hear the level of honesty coming from Tulsi Gabbard regarding foreign policy a few years ago.

       Yep. I gave up hope for a political solution to the problems humanity faces ages ago, especially in the West. Unfortunately the brainwashed masses can't see the Hegelian Dialectic at play. The doublespeak, or law of reversal, what ever you want to call it, has the masses exactly where the elite want them. The docile idiots have been totally subverted.

       I've got no idea why people keep falling into this back and forth, even after they are supposedly awakened. So much of my time spent wasted arguing with people every election about how it's all a facade and the candidates are puppets, yada yada yada..The elite are never going to have one of their political arms suddenly turn against them...Regardless of who's in "power", our countries head down their path, it's all such an illusion.

       Clearly there is a "they". The fact that they (and their activities) are hard to identify is exactly the point here. "They" certainly exist and are powerful and very active. "They" murder opponents with impunity. "They" own the banks and the media of the world.

       This is a very important point and I agree with you almost completely...but I wouldn't say it's ALL theater.  Theater implies there is a single stage-director.  In the case of domestic American politics, I think there is significant circumstantial evidence that there are at least two stage-directors.  For example: if the game ALL rigged and Trump was bound to win, why would the Democrats/DNC/Clintons bother killing Seth Rich?  Was that an act of theater meant only for us "conspiracy theorists"?  Ultimately, the important takeaway for me is that it isn't just countries that have propaganda, but also parties within countries.  Meta-ultimately, it is the bankers' and corporatists' theaters that subtly control the party-theaters.  Thoughts?
