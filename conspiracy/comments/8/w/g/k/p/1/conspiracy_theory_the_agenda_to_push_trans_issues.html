<p>Well, if they are hiding their gender or sexuality, the reason why is implicit in your initial post. You thought there was an agenda to make the public &quot;more accepting, receptive, and sympathetic&quot;, which indicates that some people aren&#39;t those things at present. And why would people want to expose themselves to harassment from people like that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think they will have a choice in exposing themselves to harassment from people like that. It could be a big chunk of the blackmail that, as someone else has said ITT, is he currency of Washington DC and Hollywood.</p>

<p>But it won’t just be from those you’d consider intolerant bigots, it will be from a lot of people that will be pissed they’ve been lied to about so many people (unless of course, you make it socially unacceptable and shameful to question the motives or behaviors of <em>anyone</em> who is trans or comes out as trans, which is kinda what we’ve been seeing).</p>

<p>As I said, I think all humans should be treated with compassion and kindness, so it’s not like I have anything against the trans community. I would however have a problem if I found out tomorrow that let’s say, the previous First Lady is trans (not saying she is, I just know that’s one of the conspiracy theories). I think a lot of people would still have a problem with that. Hence the media driven agenda to push acceptance faster and faster, to a point where it’s now become noticeably forced.</p>

<p>Just spitballing here. None of my ideas are concrete. If you disagree with this theory, I’d appreciate hearing your reasons why.</p>

As if the biggest jerk of them all is trying to make the abuse and harassment of women &quot;no big deal,&quot; so when the true nature of the jerks disgusting indiscretions come to light, he will simply point to the others he exposed and say, &quot;See, no big thing.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In context to the question posed, My comment was addressing the flood of accusations since trump took office. Since he is not pro-woman, it makes me wonder why people feel empowered to come forward, now during this hyper toxic masculine soup of a crap storm. Maybe, if i suggest, there are two sides to the current storm, one; there are evil people trying to suggest with all the allegations that its a normal male &quot;thing to do&quot;, and it&#39;s not a big deal and two; there is a large group of victims that will not let a person of questionable character abuse, harass and demean women present or past with the power of the white house behind him, imply - as his political base did and is doing by way of apathy, ignore the seriousness of the abuse. That maybe the victims see the attempts to normalize it and can no longer sit silently, letting it become normalized and &quot;ok&quot; by his election to our highest office. Sorry if it was confusing. His corrupted character, and his station, to me - allows some to claim those facts alone, make his actions &quot;OK&quot; and normalize something that should not be as common as it is, and in his defense some try to &quot;normalize&quot; such behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would agree that Trump&#39;s election probably acted in some way as a catalyst to the MeToo movement, in that having such an obvious sleazeball as president was the final straw.

</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t hear a peep while Bill was in office. Hell, they covered up for his <em>actual</em> sexual assaults, as opposed to the rather flimsy accusations we&#39;ve seen against Trump. Which just shows how the media is really just using this whole metoo movement as a political tool, rather than it being an organic &quot;tipping point&quot; where Trump is the final straw and they really care. They care until their party is back in power, and then it&#39;s &quot;Look, we fixed all the sexual assault! Everything&#39;s fine again!&quot;. Meanwhile, they just went back to hiding it and covering up for their executives, as they always have.</p>

<p>All they had to do was first sacrifice one big name of their own (Harvey). Then a few big names down the ladder a little. Then turn their sights on the President (which is exactly what we saw them try to do with that whole &quot;TimesUp&quot; movement).</p>

<p>So, <em>two</em> people then. How do you know they &quot;suddenly&quot; became trans? It&#39;s more likely the reaction to Caitlin Jenner made them more comfortable with revealing that they were trans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not saying it’s completely unheard of that they had this notion before. I grew up with them, have known them and been close friends with them my entire life. 
There wasn’t a single person who said “makes sense” 
However, they’re extremely vocal about it now. They take a shit ton of selfies and are obnoxious and profit from the style change. 
Yeah, maybe I’m a bigoted asshole. Or maybe I can smell a phony. Not that they’re intentionally phony, I just believe them to be severely influenced by the current trends of gender politics. You can not deny it’s hip. Hip, and provides a platform for their failed writing. 
We’re friends. But I haven’t given them the support they constantly bitch about needing on social media. I haven’t started kissing their ass because they decided one day they were women. I haven’t been shouting encouragement towards their shitty outfits.
They pretty much made a mockery of women if I can be so frank. They took everything feminists worked their ass off to avoid, highlighted it and said THIS is what it means to be a woman. 
Fuck our genuine struggle. It’s now about cute hairstyles and taking selfies with different blouses and glasses and bitching at anyone who says anything about it.
Honestly, fuck them. They probably just realized they were ugly dudes who received little or no attention and found an easy way to get it. They aren’t gay. They never were gay. It’s about dressing like a woman and virtue signaling how they need to be accepted all day long on tumblr blogs. 
It’s 100% about attention. 
That’s them, whatever. But as someone who’s known both parties my entire life, I can see through that shit and it’s annoying as all hell especially when we grew up with ACTUAL trans people who struggled all through high school and were rejected by these SAME PEOPLE. 
So yeah, fuck them. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve just undercut your whole argument there.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok well you keep on thinking identity politics are real causes and distracting from actual issues in the world. The rest of us who aren’t attention seeking will continue to get the work done that y’all are too lazy to accomplish. 
Identity isn’t a real struggle and it shouldn’t be brought to the main political stage. I honestly don’t give a fuck that they wear dresses, it’s the consistent virtue signaling and asking for attention and recognition. 
If you think narcissism is valid, good for you. 
I however think it’s annoying and distracting.

<p>No, it&#39;s because fewer and fewer people these days feel the need to discriminate against others because of their sexuality. Added to that is the fact that the media are a lot less restricted in what they can print and broadcast these days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No trans people are in the media now more than ever because after the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage Republicans lost the ability to cater to Christians by using keeping gay marriage illegal and protecting traditional marriage for political points.  Look at the 2016 elections as proof.  Many Republicans who were formally against gay marriage came out saying that they would attend the marriage of a gay friend if they were invited, even Rick Santorum hinted at this.  </p>

<p>But now Republicans are attacking transgender Americans because they are now the boogeymen Christian Americans are afraid of.  Think about it how often did you hear about transgender rights or bathroom bills before gay marriage became legal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve watched some stuff about a supposed trans agenda in the elite, mainly Hollywood. </p>

<p>If true, they delve into transsexuality to serve an androgynous god named Baphomet. Kids of these elite apparently go through gender reassignment at a very young age. </p>

<p>It sounds bat shit crazy but there are some celebs that I find hard to believe were born as the gender they are now. (Looking at you Serena Williams 😜) Anyone else heard of this theory?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve definitely heard the theory. And I&#39;m well far enough down the rabbit hole where that doesn&#39;t sound bat shit crazy at all haha. Dave Chappelle talking about it is what first introduced the idea to me. Both back when he did the James Lipton interview, and in his most recent Netflix specials.</p>

<p>Which is why it would make sense that they are trying to push acceptance before any of that info is divulged to the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s to normalize the idea of androgyny for sure.  It&#39;s already at work.  The first famous person I was convinced was a trans was Mike Obama.  When I would talk to people about it they would say &quot;so what if she is?&quot;  That&#39;s exactly why they do it.  At the time of the Obama election if people knew that it would have been a huge deal.  Now days, it&#39;s something that we aren&#39;t suppose to care about.  You have trans playboy models, trans miss universe Spain.  They lie and say these are the first of their kind yet it&#39;s been going on forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe people actually identify as the opposite gender, and you guys are projecting conspiratorial beliefs where they (in this case) don&#39;t apply. Anyone who thinks that trans is a conspiracy: what is your overall comfort/approval of trans people? If it&#39;s a negative view, you might be biased into accepting a conspiracy theory to explain their existence when in reality so many things exist beyond our own perspective. </p>

<p>Also, wtf is with the &quot;vegan diets are a conspiracy&quot;? If that&#39;s true, why do governments around the world support the traditional diet (despite massive evidence of its contribution to cardiovascular disease)? The meat and dairy industries are powerful and put out studies &quot;proving&quot; that their products are healthy or at least not as unhealthy as plant-based advocates are saying. How many of you that believe veganism is a conspiracy actually understand the health arguments against the Western diet? What if you&#39;re being duped by a meat/dairy conspiracy against your own health? It would be like 50+ years ago to believe that tobacco is good for you or at least not as unhealthy as those pesky doctors/scientists are suggesting (when in reality you are addicted to tobacco and will do any mental gymnastics to justify it...just like people who are addicted to meat/dairy/eggs)</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is strictly addressing the extremely obvious push by the MSM to incorporate the discussion into all facets of everyday life. Which I don’t even think is arguable that this is not what is occurring. </p>

<p>As for the vegan conspiracies, that has absolutely nothing to do with my post. If you have a problem with that, then you should be replying to the user that wrote the comment, not to me.</p>
