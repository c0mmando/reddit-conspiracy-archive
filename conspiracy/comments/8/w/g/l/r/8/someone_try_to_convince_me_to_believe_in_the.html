       There is a lot of political mumbo jumbo on this subreddit that seems to have destroyed what this subreddit was once about. To spice things up a bit, I am trying to spark a discussion on why YOU believe in the Abbey Road conspiracy (if you do that is). Please, provide evidence and links so I and other Redditors, who don't really know a lot about this conspiracy theory, can have a change in scenery on this subreddit and possibly be convinced of this theory.

       I'm really interested in this as well, however havent seen much evidence. Just strange coincidences, or maybe they're not. Supposedly the original McCartney was killed because he was going to blow the lid off jimmy savile's pedophile cult, whom the beatles were acquaintances with. Strange that Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington were involved with foundations to stop human trafficking and were supposedly privy to information that would put them in danger. Now they dead AF.

       I believe that he is alive too, but I do like to entertain the idea of the fact that he did die in a car crash in 1967 and was replaced by a man named William Campbell. I did do some research myself but some might have sources I, and others, may not have read.

       It really does seem like they played it up a bit. I mean, I would too if I had a death rumor around me. This conspiracy is insane because there are so many theories around who he was replaced with and when he died. Is it Billy Shears or William Campbell who replaced him? Did he die in 1967 or 1966? Lots of holes in the theories but nonetheless, people actually believe it still. I probably won't be convinced but I want to know why people still believe it after all these years.

       I mean he seemed to get his jimmies rustled when Yoko didn't go Dutch with him to buy the Beatles Discography back in the day. But you could argue that the fact he didn't actually make any of those songs meant he had no emotional connection hence why he didn't just buy them out right himself. Some pieces of  evidence can go both ways.

       If he died in 66 and got replaced, the one who was trying to buy the songs also wrote and recorded Paul's songs off sgt pepper, magical mystery tour, the white album, let it be, yellow Submarine and abbey road

       You mean the theory that says that the guy who calls himself Paul McCartney now was brought in to replace the OG because he died in a car crash and he just happened to be the best McCartney impersonator in the country (as I write this I realize the similarity of this theory to the plot of Bubba Hotep.  coincidence?? you decide!), and that the evidence of this is found in the photos which clearly show a different guy, and in the use of metaphor and symbology in their album covers, not to mention the longevity of this "theory" which has had some legs?  That theory?

       Ive entertained  the theory long enough that a lot of songs sound double edged to me now,.  The first that really struck me was 'waitin for your knock dear' then there are a few others that describe violent car crashes. Then recently i saw people had been questioning the way that he dance, and their birthday song is reaaaly weird "so you SAY it's your birthday" then he is commanded to dance, and take a ch'ch'ch'chance.

       Youd believe less if you knew you were being lied to all day every day. The new found sceptisism prevents you fron being fooled as often. Thats how it affects your life. If your not conscerned with that then good luck out there.

       I remember watching a mockumentary over a decade ago called “Paul is dead”. It was made like a dark conspiracy video with creepy sounds and dark scenes. It’s worth a look if you’re interested in this theory.

       Yes, this is a good doc. If you do research on it you will find the guy who made it implies McCartney (billy shears Campbell) funded it himself. Apparently he was gonna come clean but backed out...

       Evidence- old Paul and new Paul have different teeth. Different ears. Look at their pics side by side. Just simply look like different blokes.

      <p>
       Oh, and Paul 2’s bass playing is not as good as Paul one.

       The interview you're referring to is when he refers to Ringo joining the band. 'PID' people also pretend a clip of him talking about forming a band for the first time (wings) is proof he was replaced because he's saying he didn't form the Beatles, but he didn't form the Beatles, the band already existed and he joined it in '57.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul didn't attend the induction because him and George were arguing at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       "may I introduce to you, the one and only Billy Shears" is Paul introducing Ringo on the album, as the next person to sing is Ringo for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amongst professional bass players Paul's later bass playing is much more admired, for example
       <a href="https://vimeo.com/197194601">
        him playing bass like a lead guitar on
        <em>
         hey bulldog
        </em>
       </a>
       is always a go-to example of what a great and innovative bass player McCartney was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final thing that I would love an explanation for is how did they keep everyone quiet? Not just all the Beatles circle, but people like the apple scruffs? Jimi Hendrix? Bertrand Russell? Andy Warhol? Why did his affairs with Maggie McGivern and Peggy Lipton continue for years despite the fact the only people who would have known about them would also have known if Paul was replaced? Why do

       Read the wired Italy article. They hired forensic experts to debunk PID, as a laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       These experts study facial features and were experts for big court cases in Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
       That claimed ear shapes and teeth were different. Said if they were examining a body they would have to conclude it’s a different person.

       It wasn’t kept quiet, hence we are talking about it. I love how this is evidence for conspiracy deniers... “if it was true people would know about it”.  If people didn’t know about conspiracies there wouldn’t be r/conspiracy
      </p>
      <p>
       So Yeah, people do know about it. It was a huge rumor back in the 60s. And people are still talking about it today. So I argue it wasn’t kept quiet.

       “We all loved paul very much”.  Sure you’ll say George  was saying that we used to love him but not now bc we are fighting. But seems like he is referring to two dead blokes to me. As he mentioned John right before.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the video you said George is referring to ringo....Notice that it goes from ringo saying  in the beginning when he was new Paul was only one who would room with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it appears George points at Paul 2 and says when he joined he was the one who would room with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       If George is referring to ringo does this not just negate what ringo was saying (ie in the beginning only paul would room with ringo)?
      </p>
      <p>
       In your read of the video you are saying George  then points to ringo and says yes in the beginning I was the only one who would room with you when ringo just said Paul was the only one who would room with him...
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the bass playing. I’m not an expert but in the video I watched Paul 2’s playing didn’t not seem as advanced as Paul 1. Any studio album could be any musician, not uncommon practice that bands use different musicians in studio.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would imagine Paul 1’s kids look like him and Paul 2’s kids look like him...
      </p>
      <p>
       And with sgt peppers. The theory is the album introduces the band after the death of Paul 1. The theory is that bill Campbell was in a band called billy pepper and the pepper pots. Which was a studio cover band to cash in on the Beatles fame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying that ringo singing is paul.  It’s a lyric in the album. The first album after paul one died. It’s called sgt peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. The album lyric is that it is introducing the one and only billy shears.

        That article doesn't link to anywhere,
       </a>
       but from what I gather they're a computer scientist and a woman interested in craniometry which is described as a "pseudoscience", they're not forensic experts.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who never met him talk about it, people who knew him (eg the apple scruffs) think it's nonsense. The rumour wasn't huge in the 60s when it supposedly happened, it came out in a student magazine in 1969 - so supposedly no one noticed for almost 3 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul supposedly was replaced after they finished touring, so no one would need to room with the 'new' Paul anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you said you're not a pro bass player -
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/4irgma/does_anybody_or_any_group_make_basslines_like/">
        here's some pro bass players raving about Paul's later bass lines
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand what you're saying about the kids, but the pictures show Beatrice looks like Paul when he was the same age.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual lyrics though are Paul saying "the singer's gonna sing a song, and I want you all to sing along, so may I introduce to you the one and only Billy Shears, of Sgt Pepper's lonely hearts club band" then Ringo starts singing. That's normally how you introduce someone else, not yourself. Maybe Ringo was replaced?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I'm sure you're determined to believe it no matter what, but to me it just seems like nonsense, and no one can ever actually explain the obvious questions that I laid out in my first answer, they just brush over them. Here's another one: were the thousands of hours of
       <em>
        get back
       </em>
       sessions scripted? Because if you listen to the recordings Paul and John regularly make in jokes about when they were kids, or randomly break out in joke versions of songs that came out when they were teenagers, or sing songs they wrote when they were teens and never performed or recorded, etc.

       craniometry isn’t a pseudoscience. The way it was used in the past is now labeled such (ie- skull sizes correspond with IQ) 
The following is from the basic wiki article on it...
      </p>
      <p>
       “Measurements of the skull based on specific anatomical reference points are used in both forensic facial reconstruction and portrait sculpture.”
      </p>
      <p>
       ...are you saying that using anatomical reference points is pseudoscience?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wired article from Italy exists. They are experts. The fact that you are labeling such basic things as “pseudoscience” is interesting and shows you didn’t even read it fully.
      </p>
      <p>
       The PID rumor wasn’t a big deal? It was addressed in Life magazine in 1969, with Paul 2 on front cover. That certainly isn’t a student magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll concede you’re point about the conversation regarding rooming with Paul if they weren’t touring.  But you didn’t address George saying “we all loved Paul” directly after he said they missed John.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I’m saying about the kids is that I don’t know anything about the kids and what they look like. Paul one and Paul two look similar, wouldn’t their kids look similar too? Can you provide some links I’ll check it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding sgt peppers. You are not addressing my overall point. The PID theory doesn’t rest on who sings get by with a little help.  You didn’t address what I said about billy pepper and the pepper pots and the lead singer was William Campbell.
      </p>
      <p>
       If insiders and friends of the Beatles new about this why are you assuming they would talk about it? If for example jagger knew why would he say something publicly about it?  Rumors often come from people leaking information... do they not?

       So if Paul really died then that would be a pretty big secret, right? Wonder how a jilted ex lover would handle something like that... some might say it would look exactly like this. (Video of heather mills threatening to tell a secret that no one could believe and would devastate people)

       I’ve addressed all your concerns with PID mate, if you feel I haven’t ask again. I have conceded where you seem correct. I’m not a musician so I can’t really comment. However, You have skipped over some of my points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn’t born believing in the PID theory. I used to think it was just a joke. Then I looked into it and changed my mind. So there was never any of my “wanting to believe it”.

       Look, I see you are just popping in over here as a guest. I only saw soccer and Beatles posts. This is r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You of course think we are deluded. We think for you normies “living is easy with eyes closed”. So the feeling is mutual
      </p>
      <p>
       So if your not going to address my points run on back over to your football posts and let us folks here discuss matters of real importance... like the elite harvesting andrenochrome from small children for its anti aging properties?
      </p>
      <p>
       Crazy you say? Yeah, this is r/conspiracy. You’re in the rabbit hole. You’re disdain has no power in here.

       Some of the pictures have different eye colors. The ears are also quite different (which is a big tell tale right?) There is writing about the date of death on Sgt Peppers right? There is so much as I went down the rabbit hole one day for hours due to my honey saying that it was BS. I forgot it all but there is quite a bit of compelling evidence.

       Seriously lmk what u think. Im trying to poke holes in any theory and it's not possible. Unless everything they did was a joke. Cuz it's undeniable. I even recorded my own voice and placed it backwards to see if those words translate right and they do. Just crazy stuff.

       Woah! This video is crazy. Completely changed my perspective from when I initially posted this post. I'm like half convinced about the theory now. The way Paul's face looked when he was in the interview when he said "yeah, it's me" (paraphrase) when talked about being replaced is like he feels shame. I honestly think most of the theories though are reaching far af like the bass guitar in the flowers spelling out Paul. But other theories like his facial structure being completely different has me thinking otherwise. There's no way a face can change its physical structure, like his brow ridge. I'm glad you posted this link, thank you!

       This whole video seems stupid, it's just forcing 'symbolism' into everything. You could do it with any theory. Like for example if you wanted to 'prove' that John had died you'd say it's undeniable proof that him wearing white on the cover of Abbey Road is him in heaven as an angel, and the '28IF' number plate means he'd be 28
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       he was alive (PIDers try to apply that to Paul but he'd have been 27, John would have been 28), and his lyrics like "if I aint dead already, girl you know the reason why" if because he'd been replaced, and his complete change in personality in '68 is because he died, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no actual explanations for stuff like how they got all his celebrity friends (eg Andy Warhol, the Who, the stones, robert fraser etc) to stay quiet ad continue hanging out with him, or how the 'apple scruff' groupies that lived outside his house were kept quiet, or why his affairs with multiple women continued despite the fact the only people who knew about them would have noticed if he'd been replaced, or why

       The man who is currently impersonating Paul McCartney has a harelip that was supposedly the result from that car wreck in 1967. To the best of my knowledge, you don't just get a hair lip from a car accident, you were born with it. It is a serious medical condition that could lead to cleft palate. You are born with a harelip number one. You don't just acquire one halfway through your life. Number two your eyes are the same distance apart from the time you're born to the time you die. Nothing can change this. It is scientific fact. Explain to me then why are early pictures of Paul McCartney compared to whoever is masquerading as Paul now show his eyes further apart before the accident and closer together after the accident. Never mind all of the weird cryptic messages buried throughout their music. John Lennon was a huge Lewis Carroll fan and if you take the Through the Looking-Glass approach when dissecting the lyrics and finding Clues, it begins to make a lot more sense.

       I really looked into this and tried to find the answer on thetanster.com After watching a few videos about it, I could definitely see they were different. Faul is talented but the first Paul had a really different energy. I always wondered how Paul turned into the annoying guy he supposedly became.
