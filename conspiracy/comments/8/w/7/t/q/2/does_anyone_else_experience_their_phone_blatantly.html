I understand how data works but it is uncanny in the times that I will hear about something for the first time, completely unrelated to my normal search habits, and then immediatley see an ad for it. This happens most with Instagram which is Facebook. I have an iPhone but I’m sure its universal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of &quot;random&quot; ads I&#39;ve had on instagram is just too obvious.</p>

<p>A picture of me got taken, looking like I was bald on the top of my head. Showed my mom for some laughs. Few hours later a hair transplant ad on instagram.</p>

<p>Hadn&#39;t drank a mtn dew in at least 2 years. Never mentioned it. Got myself a bottle just because. Next day there was a mtn dew ad on my instagram.</p>

<p>Thought about buying a onesie. Got a onesie ad on my instagram. Note that this one was triggered by my google searches. Didn&#39;t talk about it at all but I did google it. </p>

<p>Mind you that I&#39;m dutch and I talk dutch. Language doesn&#39;t seem to matter all too much.</p>

<p>I still have screenshots from the ads. Ill add them when I&#39;m home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. This has happened to me twice.</p>

<p>I was sitting at lunch talking to a coworker and he was mentioning that he was looking into applying for SSDI for his wife. Literally a topic that I have never researched before, never posted about before, and never had conversations, text messages, etc... before.</p>

<p>The very next day, I received an email about applying for SSDI. I have several emails and the email that received the message was my email associated with my FB account.</p>

<p>I disabled FB on my phone and removed messenger. Things were quiet.</p>

<p>Then I was traveling overseas and re-enabled FB and installed messenger again (cheapest way to communicate with family while OS). I started getting emails again about conversations I had.</p>

<p>I disabled and removed again.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve still gotten some fishy emails since, but sometimes these could be coincidence since they are things I have searched online.</p>

<p>Things like location services, Wifi connections etc are the likely causes. Your phone actually listening through your microphone, unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes my friend and I will just be talking, no trigger words like &quot;google, siri, etc&quot; or any commands like it will come out of our mouths, but my friends samsung has lit up and google has turned on its search thing. And then after that happens we try to recreate it with no success. I think that phones do listen, even to candid conversations. But even if they&#39;re listening, that doesnt mean the info is always looked at, but definitely used for target ads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just the first step. If you keep do g this they&#39;ll start reading and taking over your mind. Trust me because it happened to me. I used to get ads all the time back in 2012 but I ignored them. Next thing I know I&#39;m gang stalked and they are all reading my mind. Now my mind is basically gone if they want it to be. I can still think sometimes but most of the time its them saying nigger in my mind or Jew or other slander terms to try and make key feel bad or something. </p>

<p>They have a game with my brain. People have copies of my entire brain and they use it for sex stuff and to increase their intelligence etc...</p>

<p>No jokes.</p>

<p>My one rule of advice is NEVER PANIC. No matter what is hapoebing to you. When you panic you make terrible decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s one time this happened that was SO Random and inexplicable, that I know something had to be spying.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a 22 year old guy, I drink fairly regularly, and about a year ago I went to the store and bought some beer, and there was a little display with a spesefic brand of lime beer salt on it, so I figured hey I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before, I ended up buying it.  That was the only time I had ever seen it or anything like it.  Sure enough when I got home, I went on FB and there was an advertisement for the SAME brand of Lime beer salt.  </p>

<p>THEN about 1 month ago, something similar happened.  I was in a Best Buy looking around with a friend, and I had been talking about making videos at some point, so my friend pointed out a spesefic microphone for videos and streaming.   When I got on Amazon later that say I saw a banner ad for that EXACT microphone at 10)</p>
