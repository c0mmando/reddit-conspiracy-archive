    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm I dunno if there is really a gay agenda. I think the agenda is the de-masculinization of men. They want to turn the traditional man into a big pussy for whatever reason. Because people can’t handle getting feelings hurt we are supposed to call a man who thinks he’s a woman, a woman, even though biologically they are a man. Its ridiculous to think we live in a world where if we call something what it is scientifically then we are looked down upon.   </p>

<p>I also think there is an agenda to try to push Christianity away. It’s funny how we have to be so accepting of everyone in today’s culture, unless you are white, male, or Christian. It’s like the media is trying to brainwash people into hating that person. Which means it’s coming full circle.   </p>

<p>People fought for human rights, the right to free religion, speech, etc. and now we can’t say the truth, it’s a crime to be male, and it’s a crime to be a Christian. </p>

It was Roman ruling families, but their history traces even further back, through Greece, Babylon, Egypt, Sumer.  Jews are just one branch of this sprawling family.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in church but stopped going a few years ago. I had frustrations with the church and I never felt like I had a connection with this higher being. Despite this I still feel that Christianity, as a whole is unfairly attacked. Obviously there are shitty individuals and even congregations that deserve the backlash. But I cant tell if the backlash against Christianity is due to an elite desire to discredit it to push a dark agenda or if it&#39;s people&#39;s natural response to shitty Christian&#39;s and shitty  Christian congregations. </p>

<p>Even though my belief system is in limbo I still feel like I side with Christianity. But I concede that there is definitely some personal bias because all my family and many of my friends are Christian. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just the eternal victimhood talking.</p>

<p>And infiltration?  Christianity and Mithraism grew up in the <em>same basements</em> during its early years in Rome.  And just like most mystery schools, there&#39;s a &quot;Christian&quot; message for the masses, and there&#39;s its message for those in the know.  The only reason Christianity became popular is because it was <em>heavily</em> promoted by tptb in Rome.</p>

<p>They will transition away from Christianity eventually, though.  Sciencism seems poised to be the next big religion.  A materialistic, pointless, hopeless view with a disembodied diety named Science, who only speaks to the enlightened priest class with their white robes and religious props.</p>

<p>being the scapegoat for evangelical politicians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of a &quot;pendulum of gayness&quot;. </p>

<p>At one end, you&#39;ve got discrimination, negative stereotypes, hatred and even violence. This one end is a total demand from the rest of society that gay people conform with the majority in terms of their feelings and actions.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the other end of the pendulum. At this end things are the exact opposite because that&#39;s how a pendulum works. At this end, you got the same thing: discrimination, stereotyping and expectations of conformity. But now it&#39;s against hetero&#39;s and in favor of gays.</p>

<p>In the center is neutrality. The center is where you want to be.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re seeing is the pendulum swinging from the anti-gay side to the pro-gay side. It&#39;s gone a long way from one end and is moving past the center towards to anti-hetero side. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because of two things. One is Cultural Marxism, which today goes by the name of Political Correctness. The other factor is the common tendency for large groups of people to overdo things. Once everyone gets going in the same direction, they tend to keep on going until something fucks up... and &quot;the pendulum&quot; stops, then starts to swing back towards the other direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So they&#39;ve decided to fight for their equal protection rights as citizens of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Legally things might still be headed for equality. But socially, we&#39;re heading past neutral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of the country has been in the center for a long time. None of this crap they are pushing has ever really been an issue. The majority of people don&#39;t give a shit whether somebody is gay or not. Even if they pointed and stared (it is abnormal), nobody really cared. I&#39;ve had gay friends since middle school and I am old. Nobody cared. Gay-bashing has not been an &#39;epidemic&#39; for several decades.</p>

<p>What we have is the fringe fighting the fringe and the media and the left trying to drag the rest of us into the fight. This backfires and the people in the center that won&#39;t take the side of the fringe will get labeled homophobes and grouped into the other fringe making it appear as if that other fringe is epidemic.</p>

<p>You can take pretty much any identity politics BS and apply the above. These battles are between fringe groups and the media is amplifying them.</p>

<p>Feminism pendulum, antisemitism pendulum, racism pendulum etc. All of these fall under the umbrella of political correctness.</p>

<p>The one thing they all have in common is that they represent a bit of a power grab. Go back to, say 1950, and think about what it was like to be gay, female or black back then. Then compare that with the situation today.</p>

<p>The pendulum has swung away from disadvantage relative to a white, Christian majority where important decisions are made by heterosexual male authority figures. What&#39;s changed? People&#39;s perceptions of what&#39;s good and desirable and what&#39;s not.</p>

<p>Maybe. But I also think that there is a small percentage of &quot;thought leaders&quot; who have decided that they know what&#39;s best for everyone else. I also think that there&#39;s a tendency to keep on going (somewhat mindlessly) until we overdo something. It&#39;s not easy to see right now because we still aren&#39;t that far away from neutral.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also old (55). And the change that&#39;s taken place in mainstream social attitudes since I can remember (late 60&#39;s/early 70&#39;s) is huge,. To me, it seems doubtful that so much change has happened of it&#39;s own accord.</p>

<p>When you see a boat make a 180° turn and accelerate hard you know A) it&#39;s not drifting and B) someone is at the wheel. </p>

<p>So I agree with you about media complicity, but see a deliberate agenda that has resulted in battles between fringe groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What they do as free citizens is their own prerogative.  If they want to commit to each other in marriage like any other couple that&#39;s completely their right.  Marriage, at least according to the state, is a legal agreement between consenting parties.  The state doesnt recognize if you had a Jewish, Christian, Harry Potter or Star Wars ceremony, they just recognize the marriage certificate.</p>

<p>Your argument about &quot;moral guide to children&quot; is really inconsequential here.  Let&#39;s look at it though.  The children arent going to be harmed because two people married each other.  They arent gonna catch the gayness because your new neighbors happen to be an interior decorator and an art gallery owner.  They know what right and wrong is because that&#39;s what their parents, institutions and environment teach them.  That&#39;s a learned behavior.</p>

<p>In the end, we&#39;re souls trapped in fleshy bodies.  Questions of the afterlife deal with our ethereal, non-corporeal bodies.  If two souls love each other and want to commit to each other, who are we to judge?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a very individualist mindset. Society should be viewed as a community where an individual’s actions affect more than just themselves. Therefore, we should not only strive to be more moral for our own children, but we should also strive to be good role models for the children of others. Two gay men in a married relationship might not necessarily make bad role models, but it’s not the model we should teach kids as far as what constitutes appropriate behavior. We don’t teach kids it’s fine to fuck their siblings or family members so why would we encourage any other morally deviant behavior?</p>

<p>You&#39;re not showing how children will be harmed.  It&#39;s fear mongering with children being used as a prop.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s none of our business what 2 consenting adults do in in the privacy of their home.  We live under the Constitution not your narrow view of the Bible.

<p>You&#39;re advocating stripping the rights of citizens for alleged harms you can&#39;t even prove?  Based on your own subjective belief about what is morally wrong?   If two law abiding citizens want to get married, how is that morally wrong?  How is that immoral behavior?  What evil or bad thing are they perpetrating on the world?</p>

<p>being the scapegoat for evangelical politicians.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of a &quot;pendulum of gayness&quot;. </p>

<p>At one end, you&#39;ve got discrimination, negative stereotypes, hatred and even violence. This one end is a total demand from the rest of society that gay people conform with the majority in terms of their feelings and actions.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the other end of the pendulum. At this end things are the exact opposite because that&#39;s how a pendulum works. At this end, you got the same thing: discrimination, stereotyping and expectations of conformity. But now it&#39;s against hetero&#39;s and in favor of gays.</p>

<p>In the center is neutrality. The center is where you want to be.</p>

<p>What we&#39;re seeing is the pendulum swinging from the anti-gay side to the pro-gay side. It&#39;s gone a long way from one end and is moving past the center towards to anti-hetero side. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because of two things. One is Cultural Marxism, which today goes by the name of Political Correctness. The other factor is the common tendency for large groups of people to overdo things. Once everyone gets going in the same direction, they tend to keep on going until something fucks up... and &quot;the pendulum&quot; stops, then starts to swing back towards the other direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So they&#39;ve decided to fight for their equal protection rights as citizens of the United States.</p>

<p>Legally things might still be headed for equality. But socially, we&#39;re heading past neutral.</p>
