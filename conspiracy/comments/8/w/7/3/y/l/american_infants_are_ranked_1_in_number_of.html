        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Some numbers suggest the US has the highest <a href="https://www.livescience.com/52790-autism-spectrum-disorder-prevalence-us-2014.html">autism rate in the world</a></p>

<p>-In 1950, there were 3 childhood vaccines typically given when a child entered school.</p>

<p>-In 1983, there were 10 recommended vaccines by the age of 6 years old (24 doses, 7 injections, 4 oral doses for polio).</p>

<p>-In 2010, the CDC vax schedule totaled 68 doses with more than half given by the time a child was only a year and a half old.</p>

<p>-In 2016, the schedule has increased to 74 doses by age 17 with 53 injections and 3 oral doses of rotavirus.</p>

<p>The number of vaccines included in the current childhood vaccine schedule has <a href="http://realfarmacy.com/usa-highest-vaccination-rate-in-the-world-has-the-worst-health/">quadrupled</a> over the past 60 years, with several demanding multiple injections and boosters. During this exponential rise of CDC “recommended” schedules, the health of American children has plummeted.</p>

<p>Autoimmune diseases, learning disabilities, food allergies, chronic ailments, and childhood obesity have all risen. The overall health of this nation ranks very low compared to all other industrialized nations, dead last in many areas.</p>

<p>Vaccine false dogma is so heavy hardly anyone with authority, even in mainstream media, makes the connection between poor health with high vaccination rates. Instead, more, three added for 2016, are getting enforced by mandate or coerced by pediatricians who have the right to refuse medical care on kids who aren’t vaccinated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve said it once, and i will say it again: vaccines are not perfect, but they get the job done. The reason our kids are not dying of small pox and polio? vaccines. We can eliminate diseases worldwide, and then we don&#39;t need particular vaccines afterwards.</p>

<p>For now, lets try our best to improve vaccines so that we reduce the % of kids who get injured, but the answer is not to &#39;just don&#39;t vaccinate&#39; that would be us moving in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>TL;DR  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The study joins a long list of poorly planned, poorly executed, poorly analyzed studies that purport to show that vaccines cause autism, neurological diease, or even death. It is not the first, nor will it be the last. The question is: How do we respond to such studies? First off, we as skeptics have to be very careful not to become so jaded that knee-jerk hostility predominates. As unlikely as it is, there is always the possibility that there might be something worth taking seriously there. Next off, we have to be prepared to analyze these studies and explain to parents, when appropriate (which is the vast majority of the time) exactly why it is that they are bad science or why their conclusions are not supported by the data presented. Finally, we have to be prepared to provide these analyses fast. The Internet is speed. Already, if you Google the terms “infant mortality” and “vaccine,” anti-vaccine blogs gloating over Miller and Goldman’s study and the study itself appear on the very first page of search results.</p>

<p>Such is the power of a bad study coupled with the reach of the Internet and the naivete of peer reviewers and journal editors who don’t realize when they’re being played. Make no mistake, the editors and peer reviewers of Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology were most definitely played. At the very least the editors should have found reviewers who could check the methods by which Miller and Goldman counted individual vaccines and who know that spurious correlations are not too hard to find. They did not, and in failing to do that they failed their readers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao linking an article about people being against vaccines because they&#39;re &quot;unchristian&quot; since they come from animals, a general distrust of modern medicine, or that smallpox comes from decaying matter in the atmosphere doesn&#39;t exactly help your case with it not being pseudo-science. Those fears died down the more people were educated in modern medicine and then had a resurgence in modern times due to people believing whatever shills told them. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m against Big Pharma just as much as the next guy. But diving into debunked science about vaccines when you should be looking into and fighting the opioid epidemic they peddle is truly tragic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Were you a newborn or an infant with a fragile, undeveloped immune system when you received these 100s of shots to travel to 3rd world countries? You can&#39;t even feed infants peanuts(products or produced along side), honey, milk, seafood, even plain water until they are of a certain age for fear of an adverse or allergic reaction, which can actually cause them to be allergic to said things for life(not the water obviously). </p>

<p>Hey everybody, this one adult person got hundreds of shots and is just fine, so the 7 and a half billion other people on earth should react exactly the same way, including newborns! Thank you for your sacrifice to be the template for all mankind.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh?  Your child is a vegitable after that shot?  Ahh.....not a big deal the Gov&#39;t has a compensation program to get you some money.  You&#39;ll be OK, dear.  Money is more important than your child anyway.......that&#39;s why its arranged this way!&quot;</p>

<p>If we felt it was better that people got the care and protection from these products, it would be the entire opposite arrangement.  Gov&#39;t wouldn&#39;t be in bed with these companies and wouldn&#39;t be protecting them when their product kills someone.</p>
