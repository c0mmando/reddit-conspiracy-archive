<p>Lots of people are supporting Mueller based on outrage with Trump,  but federal institutions in the crossfire have lot their credibility.   The bias in the Justice Department and FBI,  even the CIA,  is palpable.    Yes,  the President is a dud,   but the corruption of our institutions in their effort to curtail this dud President is a conspiracy that is no better.</p>

<p>Because that is exactly what Comey said to Congress. He literally said that he gave the memos to a friend to publish in the news in order to get a special counsel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Delusional sociopaths is all we have had for decades,  in case you were not paying attention.</p>

<p>The reasoning that would continue to turn this county over to the two party system of corruption without throwing a wrench into the machine is not good reasoning.    Jill would have disrupted the pattern substantially,   and a conversation that should have happened decades ago would be forced on us,  a conversation we still have not had.</p>

<p>Jill had two sons,  was a physician,  and her position on vaccinations was rational and included vaccinating her sons:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think there’s kind of an effort to divert the conversation from our actual agenda. The idea that I oppose vaccines is completely ridiculous, or that I’m anti-science,” Stein replied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She directed viewers to read two of the scientific papers she co-authored, saying, “I am certainly not hostile to science or anti-science.”</p>

<p>She also said her remarks on concerns about the childhood immunization schedule date back to when she was still practicing and closely following developments in medical research.</p>

<p>Largely when the younger crowd actually votes for change instead of throwing their votes away on people who they know cant and won&#39;t win, establishing a foothold in the status quo to allow themselves to absolve themself of the personal responsibility inherent in the words demos (people) kratos (power) demo-cracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately you are the one that is stupid.  </p>

<p>The post above is obviously referring to Trump collusion, not interference from a foreign government.  Zero evidence of collusion after 18 months of a high powered investigation.  So I don’t believe there was collusion, or Trump would have been charged already.</p>

<p>I’m not saying there wasn’t minor interference by the Russian government, but lets be completely serious - the US has meddled in literally hundreds of elections around the world, including those of its so called allies.  It even proudly bragged in Time magazine how they worked to get Boris Yeltsin elected.</p>

<p>So the hysteria around acts of war etc. sound pathetic.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The tortured logic of a male feminist.  Advancing a double negative as your rhetorical opener.  That&#39;s a bold strategy.</p>

<p>The burden of proof is on you to prove that it did happen.  Rather than do that, or even specifically define what &quot;it&quot; is, you of course launch off into another of your absurdly comical, unhinged tirades.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>conspiring to commit cyber attacks against US citizens (20 years)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1)  That&#39;s not citing the statute, 2) you&#39;re wrong about the sentencing guidelines for the offense, and 3) the conspiracy would require an agreement (with the &#39;hacker&#39;) to commit the crime or exchange the information.</p>

<p>You can read all about it:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030">www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Look at you, with your obscenities; you&#39;re really a big boy now.  You&#39;ve even managed to squeeze in two f-bombs. This is surely the mark of a rational mind confident in his position (and manhood).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And it wasnt cracking a stale reddit joke, and it wasnt during a debate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was factually both of those things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have SO little truth to fall back on that you have to use a stale reddit joke in your debate</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You were going to have a problem with anything he said anyway.  Your seizing on his stale reddit joke as proof of some sort of criminal conspiracy is proof of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You type an awful lot but have zero information... you seem to experience very little of the objective reality, which makes you and everything you say delusional.</p>

<p>The psychological projection with you is intense, man.  Work on that.</p>

Yesterday on the other thread you seemed really upset that Ive got a girlfriend, and now you cant be bothered to read the constitution.</p>

<p>But A) Noooooooo.  You are absolutely incorrect.  <a href="https://youtu.be/mQb2S4DIcNc">https://youtu.be/mQb2S4DIcNc</a>. Please tell me that the statement Trump makes in this video, after watching it, is during a debate?  Please point out again how disconnected from reality you are.  It was neither a joke, nor on Reddit, nor during a debate.</p>

<p>B) &quot;Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.  The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.&quot;</p>

<p>C) yes, I do have a problem with treason.  Its expressly forbidden in the constitution.
Do you have a problem with the constitution?
If you want to defend treason, then yes, you have a problem with the constitution.
If you have a problem with investigations and trial by jury, then yes you have a problem with the constitution.</p>

<p>The burden of proof is actually NOT on me to prove that it happened.  I am not the prosecutor.</p>

<p>Maybe. I dont know, take a class on the fundamentals of US law?</p>

<p>The fact is that Trump knows you are too stupid to disagree with him, and he is correct.</p>

<p>You are incapable of thinking for yourself, and I have sympathy for your handicap, but no patience for it personally.</p>

<p>I advise that on a lucid day, far enough in the future to be disconnected from your present state of mind, that you revisit your conversations online.</p>

<p>&quot;People only disagree with me, because they&#39;re closet homosexuals that really want to fuck me and are jealous of my girlfriend,&quot; really doesn&#39;t read the way that you think it does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please tell me that the statement Trump makes in this video, after watching it, is during a debate? </p>

<p>The real question is by what sort of mental hoops must you go through to suggest that  &quot;please find the missing emails... the press will reward you mightily&quot; is a direct agreement between Donald Trump and a &#39;hacker&#39; to surreptitiously access and personally exchange Hillary Clinton&#39;s data?</p>

<p>So you found him retreading the same water, but slowly at a press conference for grandma to get it.  It still does not come close to a conspiracy violation under 1030.  </p>

<p>Not even in your hand selected, &quot;selectively edited,&quot; clip from ABC.</p>

<p>But you would know this, and the proper sentencing, if you had actually read the law.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The burden of proof is actually NOT on me to prove that it happened. I am not the prosecutor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here you are on r/conspiracy trying to play like you are.  That&#39;s why your bunk accusations are being challenged.  </p>

<p>Despite whatever strangeness is going on inside your head, being challenged on your silly nonsense does not imply that someone wants to have homosexual relations with you.</p>

<p>Whatever causes you to misidentify social cues in such a strange way I couldn&#39;t say, but I do recommend you talk to someone about it.</p>

<p>With that, I&#39;ll wash my hands of you.</p>
