        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously, stop reading any and all news.  Delete twitter, fb etc. Only receive feeds about your hobbies, ignore everything.  Face a few hard truths 1. News that triggers you is more addictive than news that calms you.  2.  All forms of darkness are more addictive than forms of light (this is why 99% of gamblers will purposefully lose, or play games they know are in the house favor) losing is addictive, so too is depression, anger, dwelling on events you have absolutely no control over.   All of these things are addictive. Stop doing them!  3. To get your fix of negativity, you will read that article you know full well will trigger you.  4. Get in touch with the &#39;real you &#39; through meditation.  No matter how bad things get,  that real, essential self doesnt care, it just is.  This is you!  5. Realise you are eternal, you never die, nothing can kill you, you are indestructible.  That real you moves on after this body dies, you continue.  Once you realise that you never die you no longer need fear anything.  6. Concentrate on making your next existence better by helping everyone, be kind to everyone,  lay a perfect foundation for your journey.  7.  Stop feeding darkness with negative emotions,  the light side is currently sitting almost untapped and its bursting with love for you,  you&#39;ll only need to ask it and you&#39;ll be filled with love and light.  All paths give this light,  ask in Jesus&#39; name and it will be given,  ask in Allah&#39;s name and it will be given,  ask in your dead grandfathers name and it will be given.</p>

<p>The first part of waking up is knowing you are eternal.  Your one mission is to spread love. If you are met with hatred face it head on, it can&#39;t kill you, nothing can kill you.  You are not your thoughts, feelings, or your material body. You are!</p>

<p>Start now - say or whisper &quot;In the name of Jesus Christ, fill me with love and light&quot;.  Or in the name of whoever youre comfortable with.   Simple as that!  Now sit back and the miracles will happen. Be sure of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me clarify what I said. I do believe meditation is a powerful tool for bringing focus and understanding the anxiety in one&#39;s existence. I can also open up to more perspectives. However meditation ALONE without implementing what has gained from the experience does not carry the same value. Without going to other steps to implore the what has been triggered, one is still caught up in their own pains.</p>

<p>Specifically to OP, I was referring to the statements of finding the hobby and ignoring the news. Like meditation, said activities can be beneficial. However, its also easy to caught with these activities and blissfully ignore the struggles of others. Its not out of malice per se, but it can be dangerous if there is nothing to be grounded in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One can meditate while observing secondary reality or &quot;the beam.&quot; What I mean is that I can not lose the awareness that I live in a primary reality, and that &quot;the beam&quot; is a stream of stories cherrypicked from the billions, if not trillions, of things that happen everyday. The beam is secondary reality as it most often stories that aren&#39;t happening in my current experience, the now, the &quot;is.&quot;</p>

<p>How much of the beam is true? I can&#39;t tell. It&#39;s a matter of a will to believe. Just like my spouse leaves everyday for work, or goes out somewhere, and she tells me what happened in her experience outside of my awareness. Is she telling me the truth? I don&#39;t know. They&#39;re just stories.</p>

<p>I can shut off the beam and just live in primary reality, but part of the beam is interesting and educational and entertaining. And I don&#39;t have to lose the peace of being rooted in primary reality, the now, the &quot;is.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s very, very important, though, to be rooted in primary reality. The now. The point of creative power. The point of action. The point of love and peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much of this is true. But on the other hand it&#39;s stupid to completely detach yourself from the world. It implies you don&#39;t care about the problems of anyone else but yourself. I understand how news triggers people, but we live in a time when society as we know it hangs on the precipice, and burying your head in the sand isn&#39;t going to do you, or anyone else you care about any favours. If you think society will be the same as it is now in even ten years time you are blind to the world around you. Giving up worldly desire and having events of the material world is an eventual goal of spiritual enlightenment, but it&#39;s very late in the path that such a thing is even possible. </p>

Even talking about the media, like I&#39;m doing, is part of the Darkness. We can create our own culture with the people who are with us now. People who go to church often have access to this kind of activity. I will be meditating more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its great to hear this. i have come to the same realizations in my life. as a whole we must turn the tide of hate with the feeling of love. i believe that people forgot what love is. The word love is thrown around some much these days that i believe that people forgot what the true feeling is.  you have to feel the love in your heart, its the feeling that warms your soul and when feel love all your worries, troubles, and pain go away. its a bond you have with your friends and family that will make you do anything to protect them, to fight for them and protect them. </p>

<p>but to be a loving person you must be able to put your problems and the problems around you, past you. im not saying forget about them or ignore them, but let them go.  you dwell in the past then the past will run you. acknowledge your problems fix them accordingly then don&#39;t look back. and stop being so hard on yourself. DON&#39;T WORRY BE HAPPY!! chill have a good time. nobody has control. let go. </p>
