        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I reckon 80-90% of people I know are very familiar with the show, probably more so than any other tv show.  Probably due to its constant repeat airing on tv since it originally came out.</p>

<p>I then also remember there being a post here with sources claiming that the CIA had huge input into television and movies for to purpose to social engineer people.  </p>

<p>The idea of hypnosis is repeating commands until they stick.  A show like this seem like a great example of it/opportunity for it.</p>

<p>I think it absolutely affected me in many ways growing, whether it be roommates and moving away from home sooner than I probably should have, my general humor or just my outlook on life and how I deal with events in it.  </p>

<p>Obviously this is the norm with books and movies, how they affect someone and can shape their character, but I’m just wondering if there was possibly a more sinister or some blatant social engineering that went into Friends and if so, what that might be.</p>

<p>Or is it simply just the many writer’s opinions and personality/creations and nothing conspiracy-like at all?</p>

<p>Watching through it all now, the show seems to be very liberal for it’s time (I was a liberal up until a few years ago, when liberalism was like this and not so extreme).  I’m right of center now, but watching it, I do find myself agreeing with pretty much all viewpoints on the show and even notice lines and phrases from the show in almost every episode that I use at least weekly.  Mannerisms and phrases, so many, it’s a little surprising to me recognizing them all.</p>

<p>It’s possible I’m looking too much into it, but still, I’m interested to see what others think of the idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is anything to this, it may have more to do with the use of TV itself and less this exact show.</p>

<p>Either way, it did have an impact.  Do you know how many girls were born with the name Emma after the character had her kid?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of effect TV in general can have.  The people who put these shows up, know the kind of control it can have.  At the very least to drive people to think about buying certain products and/or the obvious one of distraction from real world events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that what you’ve said is stage one.</p>

<p>The ‘powers that be’, evil or good, realized that phenomenon a long time ago (like the baby name thing as a small example) and have put it to use for social engineering purposes.</p>

<p>I’ve no doubt MK Ultra and other researches post war from operation paperclip (japan’s unit 731 research results maybe) could be used.</p>

<p>I think lewdness on TV has gotten huge in recent years, probably post 2000 with the rise of America Pie etc (how many people went to college and just played around because of those movies.  That has to be the best marketing the college industry ever got) in some kind of effort to turn most folks into degenerates, or certainly point them in that direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I don’t know about MK Ultra on this one but I do know when you watch tv and listen to music you are susceptible to influences which affect you spiritually. Satan is the prince of the power of the air in this world and what comes on the airwaves can alter you spiritually without realizing it. It’s the same with music why do you think they take out so many musicians? People will constantly reflect with their favorite songs over and over again after they are gone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that since the time of FRIENDS and ER regular American television has become more censored and controlled.  For instance,  Jennifer Annison&#39;s nipples were always hard as a rock.  There&#39;s even a subreddit here dedicated to them.  E.R. showed women and men&#39;s ass&#39;s, naked children and had one episode showing a woman&#39;s bare breasts.  Today&#39;s NBC, ABC, CBS shows imply more than actually put it on display.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t until after high school that I began to realize how much my perception of the world was influenced by television. Particularly, the kind of shows made for adults (like Friends) that teenagers also enjoyed. The most glaring proof that I had been, or allowed myself to be, manipulated were my political views. I was a sheep, I didn&#39;t know shit. I held very strong political opinions despite my ignorance. Shows like Saturday Night Live (which just repeat the same binary political stereotypes) completely molded my   perception of government. The thing with me is that I didn&#39;t go to college, which saved me from further indoctrination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could say it helped normalize things like gay marriage (Carol and Susan), which was a good thing.</p>

<p>As for bad, it was male-emasculating and ridiculeing while glorifying women, this serving the third wave feminism agenda.</p>

<p>You have Chandler, who is a complete pussy in every aspect of his life, and who marries Monica, who clearly settled for him since she couldn’t lock down the man she really wanted (Richard).  </p>

<p>You have Ross, who starts the series off being cucked by another woman, and then he spends the entire series pining after Rachel like a hurt puppy - discarding several attractive women who were also great catches for The One.  </p>

<p>Then Joey is the “hot guy”, but is also a total dunderhead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they women are portrayed as nearly flawless, with few charming exceptions.</p>

<p>Pheobe is flighty and a hippie, but that’s OK, because she’s so damn loveable.  Monica’s only flaw is that she’s a neat freak.  Rachel’s only flaw is...oh wait, she doesn’t have one after the first episode (spoiled little rich girl).</p>

<p>That’s really all you can take from that show.  </p>

<p>I was thinking the idea of a noted first and second wave of feminism would make for an interesting read, with third as this and possible further waves/stages, towards some kind of end game.</p>

<p>Either way, feminism is out of control and turning a lot of men weak.  Is so blatant to see how this show is definitely part of that after reading what you wrote, whether there is social engineering involved or simply that that’s how the writers wrote these characters and it was unintentional.</p>

<p>Third wave is a disjointed mess with no defined organization, no defined goals, and is now a way for the female equivalent of neckbeards to commiserate and blame the other sex for their own failures and mental illnesses.  It is responsible for feminization of men in the west, ironically to the dissatisfaction of both men and women (ever hear a woman bitch about how there are no real men anymore?

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds about right.  I’m actually a fan of Jordan Peterson too and he talks a lot of similar things.</p>

<p>I detest the fact that feminism has gone the way it has.  I consider myself reasonably successful, but I’ve done it through hard work.  The thought that more and more people are starting to think now, because of this crap becoming apparent, that I may have somehow been entitled to it because of feminism/gender drives me nuts.</p>

<p>Same as most professional women I know, also most of the managers i know that are a minority group.</p>

<p>Even if on some levels it has been a factor, all it’s doing is swinging the pendulum higher, ready for a swing back the other way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always loved this comment  from a ‘Joey is an asshole thread’ some years back:</p>

<p>“I&#39;ve always found the Joey character to be kind of a piece of shit. For the first what...5-7 seasons he&#39;s a serial womanizer whose constantly globing off of all of his friends. When he gets a big break he doesn&#39;t start repaying the favors, he instantly leaves his best friend and roomate with an empty room so he can move to a nicer place. He&#39;s constantly mooching, to the detriment of others (as the acting teacher trying to screw over a student up for the same part, as a waiter not getting fired so that he can keep making money, screwing over Chandler when he gets Joey a job at his office)...hell, even in the retconed past/present, he&#39;s a dick, lording his money over Chandler and trying to fuck a married woman.</p>

<p>He&#39;s also a massive selfish hypocrite. When Chandler blacked out and kissed his sister, he got irrationally pissed and it led to him advocating violence against him. When Chandler kissed Joey&#39;s girlfriend, he blew up at him and eventually LOCKED HIM IN A BOX DURING THANKSGIVING DINNER. He also blew up and ratted out his dad for being unfaithful and harangued his sister for getting pregnant before being married. Meanwhile, he: actively tried (and eventually succeeded) in fucking his boss&#39; girlfriend, actively tried to fuck his friend&#39;s ex/baby mama (twice), and attempted on multiple occasions to steal women away from his friends (the dutch girl at the football game, the woman he and Ross helped move in), and dated his friend&#39;s twin sister against her wishes.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m watching through now. I’ll probably have the show waxed in 8 weeks. I’ll make a note from here on out (currently on episode 4 season 2 so anything before then will be missed)</p>

<p>What’s the relevance behind that number?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have them all recorded on my phone but there’s so many I’m sure I missed some. I’m not sure the significance but since I was about 17 (irony) I have been seeing that number everywhere. Mostly shows and movies, but sometimes in personal moments just to me. Saw the new avengers. It’s in there like 3 times. I’m still trying to figure out why this number is used so often </p>

<p>I never actually liked/watched the show haha I run when I hear the theme song</p>
