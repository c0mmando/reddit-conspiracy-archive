<p>FE is not a real conspiracy....it&#39;s rooted in belief, like a religion.  It is not rooted in conspiracy.  It&#39;s a joke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>K, we call the &quot;face&quot; of the moon the one that we see lit up at night.  It&#39;s not &quot;facing&quot; the sun, its a sphere.  Sphere&#39;s don&#39;t have a &quot;front&quot; or &quot;back&quot;.  That term &quot;face&quot; is only used to simplify what we see at night and light hits the moons surface.  It&#39;s used in stories we tell little kids, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>How is the face illuminated by the sun?  It exists.  It&#39;s in <strong>this</strong> system of planets and whatever else.  The suns light can reach it, that&#39;s how it is illuminated.  The sun is not a flashlight, its not &quot;aiming&quot; anywhere at all.  It too is a sphere!  It&#39;s light shines in every direction.  It&#39;s like basic shit, it&#39;s like asking why you&#39;re illuminated by a light bulb in your house!  You turned it on and you&#39;re in direct line of sight with it, that&#39;s how!</p>

<p>This is your argument?</p>

Under those conditions, the geometry between you, the moon/sphere, and the sun are close enough to the same so the sphere and the moon will show the same phase.  </p>

<p>When the moon is a crescent, it&#39;s on the same side of the sky as the sun, and you only see a small sliver of lit sphere.  When it&#39;s near full, it&#39;s on the opposite side as teh sun and you see a fully lit sphere.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just another &quot;cosmic coincidence&quot; that unknowing disciples of the religion of scientism accept.  Just like their very existence.  If their religion were the truth then every one of our existences would be mathematical nigh impossibility.  If a big bang really happened some unfathomable number of years ago then think of everything that must have happened just as it did so that your sperm and your egg met to create you.  Just think of everything that must have happened in the year you were conceived.  Every red light, every decision is calculated into that particular egg and that particular sperm meeting.  If you go all the way back to the so called big bang, the probability of you existing is so infinitesimally small it might as well be zero.  Yet here we all are.   Each of us having virtually zero chance of existing.  Beyond cosmic lottery winners.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all complete nonsense.  Each of us were going to be here no matter what.  There was no &quot;big bang&quot; and there is no &quot;outer space.&quot;  We are all created eternal beings with one choice to make.  Will we be reconciled to God through Christ Jesus or not?  That&#39;s it.  One choice to make that decides where you spend eternity.</p>

<p>Repent and believe this to spend eternity with God:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>Or don&#39;t and spend it experiencing the second death:</p>

<p>Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. </p>

<p>Think it&#39;s unfair?  Too bad, He&#39;s God and you aren&#39;t.  He offers you peace though Jesus Christ and if you refuse it, he will have no problem punishing you with eternal torments:</p>

<p>Pro 1:22  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? </p>

<p>Pro 1:23  Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. </p>

<p>Pro 1:24  Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; </p>

<p>Pro 1:25  But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: </p>

<p>Pro 1:26  I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; </p>

<p>Pro 1:27  When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. </p>

<p>Pro 1:28  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: </p>

<p>Pro 1:29  For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: </p>

<p>Pro 1:30  They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. </p>

<p>Pro 1:31  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. </p>

<p>Pro 1:32  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. </p>

<p>Pro 1:33  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. </p>
