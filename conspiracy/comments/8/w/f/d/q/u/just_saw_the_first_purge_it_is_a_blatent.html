The first half of the movie is pretty decent, then it takes a sharp turn to propaganda town for the last half. I understand that&#39;s part of the draw and overall story of this universe, but certain scenes and &quot;villain(s)&quot; reveals are too obvious. The male and female lead do a pretty good job and I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing them in other films.</p>

<p>I just watched this for the first time a few days ago. </p>

<p>The “rich” can afford to seal their houses and protect themselves and if they want can also afford huge guns and armored trucks to protect them while they go out and kill. </p>

<p>The first half of the movie is a group of privileged young adults going on and on about how the less privileged and homeless are “scum” and their role is to sacrifice themselves to be “purged”. I was told it was a great movie but I ended up just getting annoyed at how much they denigrated people without money. I feel like they equalized it to hunting animals. </p>

<p>Was it presenting this as a truth or as something despicable the rich elitists believe?</p>

<p>Because the former is disgraceful and the latter is realistic, in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s racist whites killing minorities, the whites are Trump supporting Nazis, there&#39;s only 1 right side (Hollywood esque liberalism) and the good guys win in the end and no 3rd party ever prevails w a few twists and turns in a storyline. So easy, and I never seen it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several reasons. It’s wish fulfillment for them and for the audience they’re selling it to. There’s not enough racism in real life (hence all the hoax crimes) so we need to make-believe instead. It’s like The Handmaids Tale. It stokes women’s oppression boner they don’t get in the real world (unless they movie to Saudi Arabia).</p>

<p>And then there’s the more opaque side which is that there are factions with Hollywood influence that use it as a delivery system for their agenda. A major part of their agenda is divide and conquer</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus, you guys are delusional paranoids...</p>

<p>Just because a movie comments on ideas that out actual society presents does not make it propaganda. </p>

<p>This movie is a work of fiction. By your logic, any movie could be said to be a piece of propaganda. Freddy Krueger killed people in their dreams while parents/authority figures say it’s not real, therefore the message is if you have dreams that lead you to question authority you will be killed by unknown forces...</p>

<p>Give it up with your bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s called analyzing a work of fiction for the author&#39;s thesis. It is literally what they teach you to do with written works of fiction in high school - by analyzing symbolism, metaphors and similes, setting and the author&#39;s tone and fiction, references- to name a few. There are many different conclusions people will often come based on their past experiences and perspectives.</p>

<p>But to just take in &quot;entertainment&quot; without analyzing content - or to assume that your face-value perception of a work of fiction is the same as everyone else&#39;s or the author&#39;s/director&#39;s - is just silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>all you have to do is turn on the tv to the morning news to see the tensions being stoked. Muslim! Gay! The Elite! Trump! the movies are no different.</p>

<p>part of the reason people continue to fear black people in the us is bc the way they were depicted in film and music during the sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties, and early 2000&#39;s. Sure there was your Green Mile, your Shawshank Redemption but they were countering; dead presidents, boyz in the hood, friday, the hiphop industry during the nineties, pulp fiction... the list goes on. For every Common, the industry put up three Lil Waynes. For every Mos Def, two Gucci Manes, for every Jean Gray, a hundred Lil Kim clones. This is intentional. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mainstream news has nothing to do with film making...</p>

<p>And you bring up Pulp Fiction? How is this stoking race war? A true filmmaker, like Tarantino, does. It go into filmmaking to make propaganda... so, did Tarantino’s desire to make people afraid of black people start when he was working in a blockbuster as a VHS rewinder and fell in love with film editing? He only made his two short films to get to Hollywood to make on purpose propaganda? And he also wrote/directed Reservoir Dogs only to get closer to making race based fear? </p>

<p>I am not saying some artist’s art comes from a place of hate, but to suggest that it’s all on purpose is ludicrous. Film making is not an easy or quick process, and as someone who worked in the industry (and went to film school) it’s clear “the machine” doesn’t exist for the reasons you’ve stated.  </p>

<p>I just watched this for the first time a few days ago. </p>

<p>The “rich” can afford to seal their houses and protect themselves and if they want can also afford huge guns and armored trucks to protect them while they go out and kill. </p>

<p>The first half of the movie is a group of privileged young adults going on and on about how the less privileged and homeless are “scum” and their role is to sacrifice themselves to be “purged”. I was told it was a great movie but I ended up just getting annoyed at how much they denigrated people without money. I feel like they equalized it to hunting animals. </p>
