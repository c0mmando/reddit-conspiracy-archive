<p>Look at all those health and wellness pages!</p>

<p>This is a crime against humanity as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

<p>And these are only the pages I know about. All of them were owned by my friends. Many other pages have been deleted or unpublished recently. So many pages got deleted in June that <a href="https://swapd.co/">Swapd.co</a> halted the buying and selling of Facebook pages. Check out their PSA about this:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what the Swapd staff think is happening:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/93kw5VK">https://imgur.com/93kw5VK</a></p>

<p>Upvote this post! Share this list with your friends! Help us raise awareness about what&#39;s happening! People are losing their entire livelihoods here and also in many cases their passion/purpose in this world. Our society is losing media companies and activist organizations which are trying to keep people informed about important issues and life-saving information regarding their health. This is very wrong on so many levels...</p>

<p>Yeah free speech goes anywhere pretty much, but it doesnt extend to a private forum such as facebook.  I think freedom of speech mostly just protects you from the government limiting your speech.  You cant come in my house and tell me how much I suck because of free speech.  Well you can but you gotta leave when I say so.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Normally it wouodnt</p>

<p>But in facebooks case it does</p>

<p>Facebook has 2 billion users. And if we&#39;re going to talk about how Russia influence the election by buying a few thousand dollars worth of ads on Facebook then you can&#39;t claim that Facebook isn&#39;t influencing the election when it does billions of dollars worth of that on its own own</p>

<p>It&#39;s already been ruled that private property doesn&#39;t negate the Constitution</p>

<p>If it did then the only places you would be allowed to have free speech are on public land like Parks or government buildings and any private property the Constitution wouldn&#39;t apply apply</p>

<p>The courts have already ruled in the past even on private property you have free speech. There have been cases brought against towns owned by mining companies and the courts rule in favor of free speech. Even though the whole town is private property</p>

<p>Facebook is actually bigger than that because I didn&#39;t compasses entire countries. You don&#39;t have an alternative. There&#39;s no alternative to Facebook there&#39;s no other website you can go to that has all the friends and people that you can communicate with that you could on Facebook.</p>

<p>Is laws on the books that say telecoms can&#39;t answer you. Imagine if your phone company could decide to stop letting you call certain people? Or implement speech recognition and sensor certain things that you say over the phone?</p>

<p>There&#39;s laws against that even the phone companies are private companies companies</p>

<p>Being a private company doesn&#39;t give make you a king</p>

<p>In fact the Constitution doesn&#39;t even Grant any rights to a company. Corporations have no rights under the Constitution. Only the people in the corporations have rights under the Constitution. Because the Constitution applies to Citizens. A corporation cannot be a citizen because it is not a living thing thing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure where to start there.  I guess let me try the simple route...</p>

<p>Freedom of speech is about the government limiting your speech.  No matter how big faecbook is, it is not the government and it does own the space you are using while on facebook.  Its size is irrelevant.   The constitution does not give you the right to a social media platform.  The social media platform gives you a right to use it and speak as much as you would like about things it approves of.  It limits speech all day every day.  It can limit your speech all it likes.  The fact that you dont hae an alternative is extremely irrelevant and will get you sympathy from nobody.  You should stop focusing on where your feet are while speaking cause that is not really what matters either.  If you went to a totally public government owned place and started shouting curse words you would be kicked right the F out.  No questions asked.  </p>

<p>I think you should read the amendment and rethink things.  I am not trying to be a dick here, you clearly believe what you are saying and I can see where your opinion is coming from, but its not correct.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Freedom of speech is about anybody limiting your freedom of speech.</p>

<p>You might be getting your right to free speech get it confused with the First Amendment</p>

<p>Now as far as the first amendment goes it applies to both the government and large corporations and private property</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been over this. The courts have ruled on this. Courts in various states have ruled that The First Amendment will also apply to private property. And you might not agree with that. You might want corporations to have more power over to people. And if you do you can feel free to vote for politicians who will amend the Constitution to give corporations more power. But until then they don&#39;t have that power</p>

<p><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/326/501/case.html">https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/326/501/case.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://stlr.org/2016/11/21/4253/">http://stlr.org/2016/11/21/4253/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship/courtcases">http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/censorship/courtcases</a></p>

<p>Now you&#39;re right. There&#39;s no specific law Against Facebook censoring people who they want. That&#39;s the great thing about the United States. Facebook isn&#39;t the government. Therefore we can vote for a government that will pass a law about that.</p>

<p>Now you might feel differently. You might believe that corporations are more important than citizens. You might have taken King George&#39;s side in the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re free to vote for politicians who plays corporate interests above the interests of the people people</p>

<p>&quot;Sovereign citizen&quot;</p>

<p>You know people argue or what turn people off from the Republican party. In general most conservatives agree that corporations are a problem. But it&#39;s you libertarian types that think that corporations are above people that push people to vote for the Democrats</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strange you never responded to my question if you are a Sovereign citizen.   I will press on regardless, Yes the SCOTUS expanded or more appropriately clarified that you retain your rights even on corporate owned towns.  The points that matter is first that this only mattered as has been pointed out to you repeatedly that these protections are from the government.  It was saying that someone could not have been arrested detained or evicted by government employees however it did state the corporations retained the ability to restrict peoples access.  This is a good thing but does not in any way support your continued statements or continued misunderstanding of the first amendment.  If one day they expand this rights into social media this might be good or might be a disaster however as of now there is no such right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your response shows a deep lack of understanding of US law.  Free speech is alive and well but &#39;only&#39; and I repeat &#39;only&#39; counts in connection with our government.  The first amendment only states the government will make no law abridging the freedom of speech.  This in no way protects you from real world consequences of your speech, only that the government cannot stop you from speaking your mind.  A private company can refuse you a platform or even fire you if you work for them and that does not violate the first amendment.  The government provides no protection from other entities.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can’t tell if you’re trolling. </p>

<p>The 1st amendment literally states “Congress shall make no law...” because it’s an amendment that limits the governments power over an individual’s right to express themselves. </p>

<p>With very few exceptions does the 1st amendment control a private individual’s right to communicate with another private individual.</p>

<p>If you don’t like what another individual is saying and choose to assault them as a result, that actually is a violation of the law (and their rights), and you’ll face the consequences.</p>

<p>Corporations have no rights under the Constitution. Only citizens do. And even if you wanted to apply the Constitution to all people it still wouldn&#39;t apply to those that aren&#39;t people people</p>

<p>I didn’t say ‘unrestricted’. I’m not a lawyer, and I’m not going to analyse their weasel legalese. I’m sure it’s already been done before, anyway.</p>

<p>But they most certainly did promise ‘freedom of speech’ in the general sense. I already gave a quote from Daily Telegraph below.</p>

<p>The worst excuse possible. The free flow of information on the internet should be guaranteed by human rights provisions. ISPs shouldn&#39;t be able to throttle connections in violation of net neutrality, many people concede this principle. Why should social media companies be able to remove users on the basis of the kind of information they are sharing? If they were paying for their Facebook pages, they&#39;d be getting the shit sued out of them. The fact that the service is paid for with the information mined from users is the only thing keeping people from widely being outraged about this.</p>

<p>Yet the governments -- federal and states -- do just that.</p>

<p>Over half of all US States now have laws that prohibit state agencies from doing business or entering into contracts with persons or entities that <strong><em>support boycotting Israel</em></strong> (a foreign nation) in any way.</p>

<p>The Federal government is working to craft similar restrictions.</p>

<p>Would you care to take a WILD GUESS as to which groups have been pushing such draconian laws through? Did you know that it is these SAME GROUPS that are pushing <em>private companies</em> (Fakebook, Twatter, Weddit, etc) into shoving censorship -- in all forms -- on their users?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marsh v. Alabama,  ownership &quot;does not always mean absolute dominion.&quot; The court pointed  out that the more an owner opens his property up to the public in  general, the more his rights are circumscribed by the statutory and  constitutional rights of those who are invited in. </p>

<p>In its conclusion, the Court stated that it was essentially  weighing the rights of property owners against the rights of citizens to  enjoy freedom of press and religion. The Court noted that the rights of  citizens under the Bill of Rights occupy a preferred position.   Accordingly, the Court held that the property rights of a private entity  are not sufficient to justify the restriction of a community of  citizens&#39; fundamental rights and liberties. </p>

<p>This has yet to be applied to Facebook and others, but likely could be.</p>

<p>The answer my simple minded friend is YES they do, which is why the pic isn’t authentic. Q is trolling the opposition that used this technique to give away information. He also said: trolling is fun. Your larp chants have no basis and get more nonsensical by the day, which is why so many know you are SHILLS.</p>

<p>Just like its legal to fart in your own home.  But an amendment was deemed not needed by the founders.  </p>

<p>Basically rights that can not be infringed are outlined in law.  But you certainly cant put in writing every possible human act can you?  So laws could potentially be created so long as they do not violate what is actually laid out in the constitution.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I can try and break it down.  I am sure their are probably errors in there, but it seems like its understandable.</p>

<p>What I was saying was (excuse any grammar errors please,) I am a random redditor like you said.  I said that because what you said was funny so I was trying to go along with it.  Then I was commenting on the fact that my comment had 173 upvotes.  Well I said points, maybe thats not accurate.  A good comment in upvotes for me is like 10 or 15.  So in a month I may get 173 points from all of the comments I make combined.  It was the top comment which has never happened to me.   So for me this is unusual cause I maybe have unusual political views that can be  unlikable.  Or maybe its just been my grammar.  I can usually tell what people are saying even when their grammar is bad.  So I suppose mine was horrible if it didn&#39;t even make any sense.  But if it didnt make sense than this comment might be far worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an extremely analytical person.  I think it is interesting.  It doesnt have anything to with me as a person, or obviously whoever up or down votes.  But the number is there.  Its an available data point.  I cannot ignore it nor do I really want to ignore it.  I comment because I feel like I have something to say, and that talley regulates the visibility of that comment.</p>

<p>It wasnt my intention to label you as a person.  I was speaking about your behavior here.  As its a pattern that I have seen many times.  I sometimes enjoy a back and forth with a person so much that i ignore the number and thats great because I am more into the reaction of just one person. </p>

<p>I think you are right about the social media addiciton being a problem.  But you dont have enough information to say I have the problem.  </p>

<p>So do you at all see anything strange about what you just did here?  Randomly making a comment about what I said about upvote that was clearly antagonistic and unnecessary.  Then coming back and further judging me over this internet crap that I should not give a shit about?  When I dont give a shit about this internet crap am I going to start finding random comments that in not way are my business and are completely harmless and telling people how to feel about them?  And then not caring so much I came back and said another thing?  Then once again make fun of the person for caring about this internet  crap that I am also on and clearly care about?</p>

<p>Maybe someone here does have a problem with this social media.     </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t ignore numbers, whatever, that&#39;s your thing.  Just keep in mind the numbers mean nothing.  Each subreddit has it&#39;s hive-mind, and subscribers can be triggered fairly easily.  Comments to get upvotes/downvotes can be easily gamed, and the only people who should care are getting paid (well) to do so for profit seeking adventures.  Add in shadow-ghosting, mods with dictatorial powers, and time-zone differences, Reddit is entertainment (for free) that gives a general idea of life in 2018.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sorry.  I didnt mean to sound fair or open minded with you.   I would but there is no need.  You are a miserable little cunt that seems to want to shit on anything i say.  Cause once again you are claiming that the numbers affect happiness or self worth, they don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how concerned you are about this.  I thought you were going to end it with ur past comment and I had a small amount of respect for that.  </p>

<p>There is something weird with the numbers.  One time i sais something that wasnt special in any way and it shot up at an obviously unrealistic speed and put another guys down.  Was proramming i guess.</p>

<p>Does that make me have asbergers?  Or is it addiction?  Wait...you dont care right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dependable information tends to be fact, rather than opinion, based.  It comes from reliable, verifiable sources.  </p>

<p>Any information received from any source should be scrutinized for facts and have critical reasoning applied.  More evidence should be sought before accepting anything as true.</p>

<p>Sources should be a verified publisher known for accuracy, evidence-based reporting and verifying the facts with multiple sources.</p>

<p>The more evidence given through data, peer review and verifiable physical evidence, the more dependable the source.  For example, medical journals have extremely high standards for verifying evidence of a medical claims by enforcing peer reviewed evidence and repeatability of test results.</p>

<p>In general, it is better to hold off on making a judgement before knowing the facts or verifying the source.  Critical thinking is skepticism - question and doubt anyone who appeals to emotion, not sources or to blind faith without evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s a free speech issue! Free speech is a principle anyone can respect and value. Many believe it is or should be a human right (including myself). The argument that it&#39;s just a law (the first amendment) which applies to government organizations and not private companies is a legal argument, not a moral one. Facebook is used by 2 billion people worldwide. Millions of people rely on it to fulfill a variety of needs including self-expression. It should be classified as a public utility and regulated as such. One of those regulations should be the protection of free speech - anything which doesn&#39;t violate US law and yes that includes posting misinformation (knowingly or unknowingly) and non-threatening &quot;hate speech&quot;. That&#39;s my view. I&#39;m happy to debate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what if the government tried to censor a publication before or after anti-government whistleblowing was published?  this would still be a free speech issue, despite the fact that no-one is being thrown in jail, no?</p>

<p>additionally, facebook and youtube are so ubiquitous and used by so many people that making a facebook post is akin to saying something out loud in a public place.  to take away your platform is like forcing you out of the public square; it may not break the letter of the law, but it certainly breaks the spirit.</p>

<p>this is further reinforced by the fact that facebook&#39;s actions have been and certainly still are affected by the US government, and the fact that arrests have been made on people based on what they commented or posted on facebook when their communication did not entail or suggest any law-breaking.  </p>

<p>which is the exact question i responded to when i suggested that, since facebook is so ubiquitous that it is seen as a public service, it is perceived as breaking free speech laws.  since it is technically a company, it is not literally breaking the law (i.e. the letter of the law).  but, since it is censorship of a functionally public service and is likely assisted or controlled by the government, it has the same <em>effect</em> that the government would if it directly broke free speech rights, (i.e. the spirit of the law).</p>

<p>this is the same situation as superPACs and campaign contributions.  the purpose of relevant laws is to limit the amount of money that private citizens can give to a campaign.  someone maxing out their 2700 bucks and then giving millions to a superPAC doesn&#39;t technically break the law (the letter of the law), but it has the same effect as what the law was intended to prevent (the spirit of the law).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>again, i am not claiming that they are publically owned.  i am claiming that they are such de facto, not de jure.  facebook has such a monopoly insomuch that there is no comparable alternative.  to function in normal life, facebook is often required to communicate.</p>

<p>if you said something politically disadvantageous to verizon over a verizon phone line and they (or the government told them to) discontinued your service, would you still say &quot;well, it&#39;s not censorship because they&#39;re a private company&quot;?</p>

<p>the purpose of free speech is to allow all viewpoints and opinions to be heard, even when it threatens or opposes larger power structures.  when facebook removes things out of political motivation (especially if directed to by the government), it flies in the face of the <em>purpose</em> of free speech.  that is why i consider it de facto censorship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what if verizon was the only major service provider?  facebook is technically free, but it is required communication for many vocations, services and social circles.  as such i consider it a de facto public service.</p>

<p>and besides, my original point still stands regardless of whether or not facebook is a de facto public service or not.  the law is not always just.  let&#39;s say that when the US first came into being, all people in the state were legally considered &quot;public servants.&quot;  to outlaw murder, the law stated: &quot;public servants are not allowed to commit murder.&quot;  300 years later, the US decides to create a legal differentiation between public servants and private citizens.</p>

<p>if they changed nothing else, the murder law would no longer apply to people considered private citizens.  under the law as written, private citizens would be allowed to murder, and yet it&#39;s pretty obvious that such a thing would not only be morally wrong, but would also be a misunderstanding of the purpose of the original murder law.</p>

<p>when free speech laws were first created, states were the primary power structures of the day.  states were banned from censoring others not only because they were states, but because they represented the powerful against the weak; the <em>purpose</em> of free speech laws was to ensure that all viewpoints and arguments could be heard and discussed by the citizenry, even if they challenged the predominant power structure.</p>

<p>we now live in a world where the predominant power structures are corporations and big businesses, rather than the state itself.  though free speech laws cannot be applied to these structures in court, if we were following the spirit or purpose of the original law, we could and would.  i&#39;m essentially saying the laws are outdated in multiple ways, this being the primary one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what if facebook and the government were part of the same power structure, or one had meaningful control over the other?  it seems odd that facebook often censors things to favor US hegemony; do you think that&#39;s totally coincidental?  or, do you think they don&#39;t want such things on their platform for reasons that are entirely their own?  if this is true for the MSM, then i don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t be true for facebook.</p>

<p>the spirit of the law is, in fact, a thing.  have you not heard of the legal terms &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot;?  i&#39;m arguing that facebook censoring could be considered to have the same effect that government censorship would have, and for the same purpose.  because it is often in the best interests of large power structures, including the US state, it is de facto censorship.</p>

<p>as far as it not being the same as saying something publically, that&#39;s simply a difference of opinion.  again, facebook is not de jure a public communications service, i&#39;m arguing that it is de facto.</p>

The supreme court&#39;s track record when it comes to preserving the first amendment is pretty good but I&#39;m sure if congress had a significant amount of power over Facebook they would do some pretty nefarious shit. Perhaps the best solution is to migrate to principled social networks like Minds and Gab which care about free speech and privacy or create something even better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about on a macro-level when it comes to how social networks should be run. Of course they should also be honest and transparent with their users and not spread any sort of misinformation but protecting the free speech of their users is vital. It&#39;s a much higher priority because social networks have the power to silence us. On the micro-level, yes of course respecting another person&#39;s free speech is just as important as being honest and not spreading misinformation but it&#39;s not quite as important as it is for social networks because of the power they have - the power to censor and de-platform both individuals and groups at the click of a button.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if FB stood up to the federal gov surveillance state commands, and were punished with Russia data leaks congressional hearings?</p>

<p>Now they have to follow the rules. The ones Donna Brazile followed. </p>

<p>Or we go deeper than that and say it’s all a smoke and mirror show, a rouse. It’s all planned, and FB serves loyalty as the source of the deep state’s latest hard-on project (obsessed with documenting a person’s life and dissecting their soul). </p>

<p>One fact that is not a conspiracy: FB serves as the backbone of the American stock market and provides one of the few titanic pillars of digital (note: speculative) wealth which America can save itself from its near-suicidal destruction of its own manufacturing sector. FB is a vital national interest, and the failure of the company would be a fucking ridiculous detriment to the stock market, and therefore (maybe) the economy. </p>

I got into this industry 6 years ago because I was sickened by what I saw in the world around me and wanted to try to help create a better world. The world we both live in by the way. Fake news and misinformation was not allowed on my page. I don&#39;t care for ridiculous clickbait headlines but mild clickbait is not a big deal. Almost all media companies do it including mainstream outlets and for legitimate reasons - to get people to actually read the article or watch the video and to help sustain their business. There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with that. Mild clickbait creates a feeling of curiosity and suspense which many people appreciate. &quot;Engagement bait&quot; which is asking for likes or shares or for people to tag their friends who might be interested is also not a big deal. It&#39;s a vital strategy used by media companies and activist organizations to garner support from their followers for important issues.</p>

<p>If a company like facebook is deleting the pages the outrage is because people are not having enough alternatives with such a strong base( user base ), therefore they cannot be ok with the fact that their voices are repressed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s high time to move on to other social platform , where this sort of shit doesn&#39;t happen.

    <div class="md"><p>Some of them were my business partners/coworkers at one point or another but not all. What&#39;s your point?  </p>

<p>Cracking down on clickbait is another serious problem which is an incredibly slippery slope as it is very difficult to define and restricts free speech. There&#39;s a long list of words which are no longer allowed in titles or descriptions anymore on Facebook and this make it very difficult to properly report on the news. If any of those words are included in the title or description for a post, that post will get hardly any reach. Words like &quot;like&quot;, &quot;share&quot; and &quot;tag&quot; are no longer allowed either (since Facebook started cracking down on what they call &quot;engagement bait&quot;) and these words are used by activist organizations like PETA to garner support from their audience for important issues.  </p>

<p>&quot;A lot of those pages openly endorse refusing medication in favour of spiritualism, which is directly harmful.&quot; - I don&#39;t think you understand the meaning of the word &quot;directly&quot;. Simply sharing information (true or false) does not cause direct harm. It may indirectly cause harm if it&#39;s false/harmful and the reader follows the instructions but the choice is still up to the reader. It&#39;s called personal responsibility.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s called false salesmanship because the people spreading that information makes money by people believing it and sharing it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the personal responsibility of the pushers to accept that the world isn&#39;t obliged to respect their opinions and false facts.</p>

<p>I was on Facebook when it was invites-only and didn&#39;t have any of this crap, which is one of the reasons why the site is shit. It went from being about socialising to sharing information made by people who, like OP says, has it as their livelihood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;false salesmanship&quot;? I&#39;m pretty sure you just made that term up. People can make money by posting anything on the internet including misinformation. There are also actual fake news companies like the Onion who do it for entertainment and also sometimes to make a valid point about an issue. Should they not be allowed to make money doing this? Where should the line be drawn? I say it should be drawn where US law stands on free speech: no doxxing, no illegal porn, no credible threats, no calls for violence, no spam and no selling drugs or weapons. &quot;Fake news&quot; should be allowed, non-threatening &quot;hate speech&quot; should be allowed, &quot;clickbait&quot; should be allowed, &quot;engagement bait&quot; should be allowed. The fact that Facebook has started cracking down on each of these inherently harmless behaviors signals IMO the end of Facebook and the end of free speech for anyone who still uses this platform.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I’m not equating them at all. Most “natural” or alternative treatment options aren’t able to have a patent; therefore, no single person is usually making millions off of them. Because such methods aren’t cash cows, no one can afford to fund the studies the pharmaceutical industry loves to demand to “prove” a treatment works. It’s their favorite way to shut down alternative treatments. Are we not a free society? I value both allopathic and alternative treatment methods and I enjoy having a choice and information on all fronts. Shutting down informative Facebook pages is a form of censorship I cannot get behind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But who decides which is which? It’s a slippery slope with a LOT of money in the wings. A few years ago I distinctly remember people calling immunotherapy “quack” medicine (likely mostly by people receiving some funding by pharma) and now because a few independent researchers stuck it out and well known politicians and celebrities used it with success, it’s now becoming more mainstream. I’d rather live in a society where people are free to use whatever medical treatment option they choose than to be limited to whatever pharma decides is best, all I’m saying. If you think food as treatment is wacky that’s fine but if some people choose to go that route that’s fine with me too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re way off base with immunotherapy.  The term is way to too broad.  The research you&#39;re talking about is regarding <em>cellular</em> immunotherapy.  It&#39;s very promising and and already works with some cancers.  The guy credited with it&#39;s discovery used it on his dog a couple years back.  The  research was done at the university level and began as &quot;pure science&quot;. It&#39;s financed in the most part by taxpayers through national institutes of health grants.  The day to day grunt work is done by grad and doc students. Cellular immunotherapy is bleeding edge and all the patents are held by either scientists or universities.  I&#39;m not even going to try to explain how it works, you want to talk to my sister.  It&#39;s not in the hands of the pharmaceutical industry... yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you not care about free speech? Free speech is a fundamental human right and yes, I believe we should all be entitled to it. It&#39;s certainly like that for all Americans when it comes to any government institution. It is my conviction that social media companies should strive to adhere to the principle of free speech (not the law) in all situations. If the current social media giants won&#39;t do it then they will eventually be replaced by alternative social networks which do because people are sick and tired of the censorship and self-censorship.</p>

<p>&quot;The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 19: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&quot;</p>

<p>FaceBook could be charging you a fee!!! But they don&#39;t. 
And if they were, we&#39;d be having a different conversation.</p>

<p>Stop this insanity.
Twitter, FaceBook, YouTube, Snapchap and all those other FREE platforms can do whatever they want whenever they want to.
Just like when someone comes to YOUR house, YOU call the shots. Not them (even though they have &#39;free speech&#39;)</p>

Not only that, promotion is often done secretly in a fashion that tricks users into believing something is widely supported (via purchased &quot;likes&quot;). It&#39;s gas-lighting, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Your ability to filter information that offends you is a side issue. This doesn&#39;t bother me as much, but I also find it a problem - we insulate ourselves from all ideas and people that/who are not like us. This is why everyone on the left was so certain that HRC was going to win the election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a shortsighted view regarding Facebook.</p>

<p>In terms of reach Facebook is one of the world&#39;s biggest news providers, equivalent to something like CNN. Facebook started purging pages in the lead up to the 2016 election, removing right and leftwing pages without explanation and labelling certain stories &quot;fake&quot; without revealing their algorithm or sorting mechanism. It&#39;s well established that Facebook is comfortable sharing data with security agencies and that the site is a haven for atroturfing and other brain jobs like that. </p>

<p>Saying Facebook doesn&#39;t owe you anything is like saying &quot;who cares if CNN is covering up a story or is shilling for the Iraq war, it&#39;s a private company they can report on what they want!&quot;</p>

<p>On r/conspiracy no less, whewwww</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the real info! 
The first doctor to campaign for cleanliness in hospitals was not only shunned by other medical professionals, but ended up in an insane asylum.</p>

<p>Prior to the 19th century, handwashing primarily existed in the context of religious ceremonies and practices. It plays a role in Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism, and Buddhism in some form or another. But washing up to stop the spread of disease wasn&#39;t really a thing for most of history. People weren&#39;t aware of germs, so instead of microbes, they blamed illness on everything from demons to bad air.</p>

<p>Then, in 1846, a Hungarian doctor named Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthrough observation. He noticed that women giving birth with the help of midwives were less likely to die than those treated by doctors. He determined that because doctors were also performing autopsies on victims of puerperal fever (a bacterial infection also known as childbed fever), they were somehow spreading the disease to their other patients. Semmelweis started promoting handwashing and instrument sterilization in his clinic, and the spread of puerperal fever dropped as a result.</p>

<p>Despite the evidence to support his theory, his peers in the medical community weren&#39;t keen on the idea of blaming patient deaths on doctors. Partly due to his commitment to the controversial theory, Semmelweis was shunned from his field. He suffered a mental breakdown and ended up in a mental hospital, where he died a few weeks later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, fine.  I used an ad hominem attack.  How could I not when you compare apples to rabbits?  </p>

<p>Your argument is that the proponent of hand-washing has something in common with someone saying that sleeping with an onion under your pillow will &quot;pull&quot; toxins from your body.  </p>

<p>There was always evidence that hand-washing prevented illness.  There is only &quot;evidence&quot; that onions pull toxins in that they change color.  That is disproven.  The only things that detoxify you are your liver and kidneys.  So maintaining the health of those organs is the only way to improve detoxification in your body.  Those organs need proper nutrition and lots of water to function properly.  This is science.  &quot;Detoxing&quot; is bullshit.  </p>

<p>Hand-washing on the other hand is science and not bullshit.  There&#39;s no scientist out there saying onions can detox you.  Only mommy bloggers with more time than sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then why did you say what you did to the onion comment? You just supported the idea that advancements like hand washing wouldn&#39;t have happened if we all stayed with the status quo. You used sleeping with an onion to detox as the platform to make that point. The fact that you could even make that reply to my comment says enough. As I said, what is the mechanism at work? That&#39;s how medicine works. If you don&#39;t have an idea or if you can&#39;t demonstrate effects, no one busy into it. Obviously hand washing was demonstrably better. There were also people who would drain your blood with leeches at the time to rebalance their fluids. Should we give that side of medicine a try again because it&#39;s against the status quo? That&#39;s how all advances in medicine work, you make an educated guess first and then try it out. If you can&#39;t explain why an onion might help do the job if your organs (detoxification) then you shouldn&#39;t defend maintaining that bullshit as an option.</p>

<p>I understand the stupid sentiment: some good ideas get ignored when sticking to the status quo. You used the dumbest possible example to badly make your point. You just come off looking like you&#39;d be willing to try anything anyone claims because it&#39;s not mainstream. And since <em>all</em> doctors are <em>obviously</em> liars, so anything mainstream is fake news and anything not mainstream is medically beneficial.</p>

<p>Hey speaking of, I heard rubbing dog shit on your face is a great new exfoliant and does just as good of a job as store bought products. Makes you look 15 years younger, give it a shot! Don&#39;t waste your money with the mainstream methods!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol!! And leeches were used for a long time to balance fluids! Doesn&#39;t make it legitimate medically beneficial. Which is exactly why I asked about the mechanism at play. What part of an onion would absorb a virus that humans can get, and successfully hold on to them for disposal? Is it the skin? The flesh? Why? What&#39;s happening when an onion absorbs a virus? I&#39;m not doing the research for you. The burden of proof is on you. I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t buy it. Make a better point than &quot;people have been doing it for years&quot;.

Many consumers are unaware that “organic” does not mean “pesticide free”, and often times can be more risky, because organic pesticides are not regulated , while conventional ones are. Remember, it’s the dose not the poison. Apple seeds are full of arsenic. I can throw one in my blender for a smoothie and be fine. Buzzwords are great in this day and age. Working in this field has been crazy for me. I now cringe when I hear people talk about subjects like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the articles, and you&#39;re absolutely right, organic vegetables and fruits are exposed to natural pesticides which is claimed to be more safe than conventional, but as you&#39;ve said, they are not regulated. We don&#39;t really know their long-term effects, which is why cultivating our own foods would be the way to go. This doesn&#39;t apply to just vegetables or fruits, but meat too; chicken, for example, is bombarded with antibiotics which is also not a good thing long-term for our immune systems. Too bad we all can&#39;t all be farmers, eh? Damn, I wish I had a farm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for being open minded to information, I truly appreciate it! I wish we could all grow our own food. We have all lost touch with the process of food, but, there are some benefits of our current food system. I highly recommend the book “The Dorito Effect” to read more into this. It’s a man’s exploration into flavor and what changed food in America. It’s research and science based, but easy to read. PS- even “antibiotic” can be misleading in poultry labeling. Especially “hormone-free”- all poultry is hormone free :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen to yourself for a moment.  The job of government is to serve its people.  The role of government changes as circumstances and conditions change.  The policies for an agrarian society <em>will be different</em> than those for an industrialized one.  Adaptation happens on the fly and is <strong>never perfect</strong>.  That was true in 1783 and is true today.  The difficulty is over the last century the speed and impact of societal change has increased exponentially.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy is popular for two very different reasons.  It&#39;s sometimes easier to believe the results are the product of a secret cabal than random chance.  With all the moving, interlocking, and changing things in the world there&#39;s the chance  a subtle innocuous at first glance change could have dramatic long-term consequences. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy into the idea there&#39;s a single group pulling the strings.  I do believe however there people and groups exploiting the masses to increase their personal power and wealth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nah, alternative therapies/medicines are called alternative because they&#39;re not canonized under the umbrella of &quot;Western Medicine.&quot;  For instance, try reading up a little bit on the Gerson treatment for cancer, from the late Dr. Max Gerson.  Their clinic had to be opened in Mexico because it wasn&#39;t legal to treat cancer by anything but chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery.  Thus, it&#39;s alternative.  Had great success rates with cancer patients whose mainstream doctors had given weeks to months to live.
See, when an institution becomes so large and powerful like Western Medicine backed by big pharma, you end up with an effective monopoly on health care in most western countries.  That&#39;s a problem because they certainly don&#39;t know it all and 2nd there are legitimate conspiracies carried out by that institution.  Your comment makes it sound a little like a Catholic&#39;s perspective on other religions being &quot;alternate religions&quot; and not the &quot;one true faith.&quot;  Please continue your education.</p>

<p>I&#39;m really not upset that coordinated manipulation is being cracked down upon on Facebook, or even Reddit for that matter.

There are people amongst us that want to get rid of anything that is different from the opinion of the &#39;righteous&#39;.
That was once called book burning. You lot are dangerous to free thinking. A truly free society will give the chance to hear what someone else has to say and let them make up their own mind.</p>

<p>If it is all rubbish, people will soon know. If it isn&#39;t...then you&#39;ll s#it yourself only...because they might be right and others might find out!

    <div class="md"><p>what if verizon was the only major service provider?  facebook is technically free, but it is required communication for many vocations, services and social circles.  as such i consider it a de facto public service.</p>

<p>and besides, my original point still stands regardless of whether or not facebook is a de facto public service or not.  the law is not always just.  let&#39;s say that when the US first came into being, all people in the state were legally considered &quot;public servants.&quot;  to outlaw murder, the law stated: &quot;public servants are not allowed to commit murder.&quot;  300 years later, the US decides to create a legal differentiation between public servants and private citizens.</p>

<p>if they changed nothing else, the murder law would no longer apply to people considered private citizens.  under the law as written, private citizens would be allowed to murder, and yet it&#39;s pretty obvious that such a thing would not only be morally wrong, but would also be a misunderstanding of the purpose of the original murder law.</p>

<p>when free speech laws were first created, states were the primary power structures of the day.  states were banned from censoring others not only because they were states, but because they represented the powerful against the weak; the <em>purpose</em> of free speech laws was to ensure that all viewpoints and arguments could be heard and discussed by the citizenry, even if they challenged the predominant power structure.</p>

<p>we now live in a world where the predominant power structures are corporations and big businesses, rather than the state itself.  though free speech laws cannot be applied to these structures in court, if we were following the spirit or purpose of the original law, we could and would.  i&#39;m essentially saying the laws are outdated in multiple ways, this being the primary one.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall stating that there was a law that restricted uploading of &quot;porn and shit&quot; to the internet. Kind of a strange claim to make.</p>

<p>Caring about upvotes/downvotes in anymore than a casual manner shows signs of addiction to social media, which is possibly worse for people than smoking.  SNS know this, and have crafted their products to become even more addictive.</p>

<p>Labeling me this or that because it makes you feel better is part of the addiction.  So, perhaps you&#39;ll never wake up and stop giving a shit about this crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am an extremely analytical person.  I think it is interesting.  It doesnt have anything to with me as a person, or obviously whoever up or down votes.  But the number is there.  Its an available data point.  I cannot ignore it nor do I really want to ignore it.  I comment because I feel like I have something to say, and that talley regulates the visibility of that comment.</p>

<p>It wasnt my intention to label you as a person.  I was speaking about your behavior here.  As its a pattern that I have seen many times.  I sometimes enjoy a back and forth with a person so much that i ignore the number and thats great because I am more into the reaction of just one person. </p>

<p>I think you are right about the social media addiciton being a problem.  But you dont have enough information to say I have the problem.  </p>

<p>So do you at all see anything strange about what you just did here?  Randomly making a comment about what I said about upvote that was clearly antagonistic and unnecessary.  Then coming back and further judging me over this internet crap that I should not give a shit about?  When I dont give a shit about this internet crap am I going to start finding random comments that in not way are my business and are completely harmless and telling people how to feel about them?  And then not caring so much I came back and said another thing?  Then once again make fun of the person for caring about this internet  crap that I am also on and clearly care about?</p>

<p>Maybe someone here does have a problem with this social media.     </p>

<p>The government may make no law that infringes or restricts your right to express yourself. That&#39;s it. That does not extend to the private property of others.</p>

<p>Yet the governments -- federal and states -- do just that.</p>

<p>Over half of all US States now have laws that prohibit state agencies from doing business or entering into contracts with persons or entities that <strong><em>support boycotting Israel</em></strong> (a foreign nation) in any way.</p>

<p>The Federal government is working to craft similar restrictions.</p>

<p>Would you care to take a WILD GUESS as to which groups have been pushing such draconian laws through? Did you know that it is these SAME GROUPS that are pushing <em>private companies</em> (Fakebook, Twatter, Weddit, etc) into shoving censorship -- in all forms -- on their users?</p>
