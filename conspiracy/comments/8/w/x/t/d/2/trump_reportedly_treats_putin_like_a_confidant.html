<p>The continuing Russiagate conspiracy saga makes it way to the front page once again.</p>

<p>Trump today: <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1015723140364865536">The Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) &amp; now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillary’s illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta &amp; so much more. It’s a Democrat Con Job!</a></p>

<p>Whose conspiracy theories are correct? Are we being distracted from other things?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/gop-senator-open-to-revising-russia-sanctions-after-moscow-trip">According to GOP Senator Ron Johnson, the sanctions are not having any effects anyway. </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think you&#39;d be hard-pressed to say that sanctions against Russia are really working all that well&quot;</p>

<p>“My sense is that the targeted sanctions to the oligarchs, to the members of government, are the ones that really sting and probably [offer] the best chance of affecting their behavior,&quot; he said. &quot;The Russian people, they don&#39;t care if an oligarch can&#39;t buy a $10 million mansion in London.”</p>

<p>“When ruthless, strong people perceive weakness, they pounce,” said Johnson, who chairs the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. “Russia wants to reconstitute, basically, its sphere of influence that they had in the Soviet Union. So, you understand that, and if you don’t want to let that happen, you’ve got to push back with strength and resolve … but that doesn’t mean that we have to be enemies.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;m saying that according to Ron Johnson, a GOP senator, that the sanctions are not even having an effect in the first place. If Russia is not being affected by the sanctions then there is no fire. I also prefer my home country to push back against Russian influence in our elections and politics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... who should I trust in the interpretation of sanctions? Vladimir Putin, or a random Redditor?</p>

<p>Putin: “The introduction, for example, of restrictive tariffs on steel, on aluminum, not only for Europe but also for Canada and Mexico, in essence these are also sanctions… They are related to the pragmatic national interests of the United States.”</p>

<p>The sheer definition:  Economic <strong>sanctions</strong> may include various forms of trade barriers, <strong>tariffs</strong>, and restrictions on financial transactions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In essence they are sanctions&quot;, as in: they perform a similar function. The key difference is the different roles they play; tariffs are a regular feature of international economic policy that most, if not all countries use. Sanctions are a punitive measure taken against nations as an alternative, or lead up to a shooting war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they perform the same function, hence why it&#39;s hilarious that one would advocate or ignore sanctions/tariffs against Canada/China, while acting appalled at the notion of sanctions/tariffs on Russia.</p>

<p>Got any evidence, for this? I mean, other than John Oliver telling you so. </p>

<p>Russia wants to destroy us. Trump is the culmination of a century of trying to destabilize us. The right was screaming about Russia right up until Trump. Then all of a sudden not only are they our friends, we should just completely do their bidding.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin calls for the influence of the United States and Atlanticism to lose its influence in Eurasia and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.<br/>
The book declares that &quot;the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] Russians&quot; has not ended and Russia remains &quot;the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution&quot;. The Eurasian Empire will be constructed &quot;on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us.&quot;<br/>
Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook believes in a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia&#39;s gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries.<br/>
<strong>In Europe:</strong><br/>
Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow–Berlin axis&quot;.<br/>
France should be encouraged to form a &quot;Franco–German bloc&quot; with Germany. Both countries have a &quot;firm anti-Atlanticist tradition&quot;.<br/>
The United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe.<br/>
Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because &quot;Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics&quot;. Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.<br/>
<strong>In the Middle East and Central Asia:</strong><br/>
The book stresses the &quot;continental Russian–Islamic alliance&quot; which lies &quot;at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy&quot;. The alliance is based on the &quot;traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization&quot;.<br/>
Iran is a key ally. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow–Tehran axis&quot;.<br/>
The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: &quot;the main &#39;scapegoat&#39; will be precisely the U.S.&quot;<br/>
<strong>In the United States:</strong><br/>
Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After encouraging Brexit, fueling instability in the US that&#39;s about to lead to a civil war, pulling out of the Iran deal, okaying Russia&#39;s takeover of Ukraine, ruining the our partnership with Europe and turning the whole world against us, its time to help form that &quot;Franco–German bloc&quot;!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russian media is against any person of Russia that speaks ill of Putin, as Russian media is owned by Putin.</p>

<p>Ownership of Russian media is factual, not propaganda. It’s objectively true, without debate, that the Russian government directly owns most forms of immediately available media in Russia.</p>

<p>All but one national TV channels are fully or partially owned by the state. The last channel – NTV – is owned by Gazprom, in which the state has a controlling stake. The situation in the radio market is similar. Major information channels are somehow controlled by the state.</p>

<p>Top state television channels frequently apply self-censorship, avoiding any controversial topics that might impact the public image of the authorities. For example, massive truck drivers protests across the country were never even mentioned in the First Channel in spite of wide coverage in local and independent media and requests of the viewers.</p>

<p>All of Putin&#39;s opponents are being made to vanish from Russian TV. They are blacklisted and not allowed to appear in TV shows. In one example, a presentation critical of Putin&#39;s policies has been digitally erased. This is the case of Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gusinsky, two powerful Russian oligarchs in the ‘90’s . Berezovsky had invested in the former public broadcaster ORT’s first channel while Gusinsky, created Russia’s first independent TV station, NTV. After Putin’s power takeover, the media owned by Berezovsky and Gusinsky were the first victims of this &quot;purge.&quot; Tax controls, raids by armed men, searches and arrests forced their bosses to flee the country and to sell their media outlets.</p>

<p>The Russian military intervention in Ukraine and the occupation of Crimea, in 2014, led to a reinforcement of propaganda and disinformation from state-owned media outlets, including by altered or misidentified images, stories that were distorted.</p>

<p>Tell me more about how Russian media is for the people, and not daddy Putin.</p>

<p>I would hope you’re a Russian shill, since an American that suggests Russian media is for the people is so hilariously idiotic, considering that Americans actually have access to an uncensored Internet and the information that comes with it, unlike Russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>U.S. has press that&#39;s definitively on both sides of the aisle -- there are press outlets that worship Trump like a deity, and those who criticize everything he does - <a href="http://www.allgeneralizationsarefalse.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Media-Bias-Chart_Version-3.1_Watermark-min.jpg">http://www.allgeneralizationsarefalse.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Media-Bias-Chart_Version-3.1_Watermark-min.jpg</a></p>

<p>Both of these types of press outlets, as well as those more in the center, are abundant and easily accessible.</p>

<p>Your point would only make sense if U.S. media was yelling the same thing in unison. In reality, U.S. media is very divisive and the content/message varies wildly by network, meaning that any notions of a ruler-sponsored media - as it is in Russia - is not based in reality.</p>

<p>Russian media resembles all their media sources all huddled together on a graph that shows where their outlets skew toward.</p>

<p>Of course, it&#39;s convenient for Trump supporters to act like CNN is the only news source in the U.S., when Fox News has more viewers than any U.S. news network.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Fox is controlled opposition and would never identify the true problems. And the rest of the mainstream media all push the same cultural Marxist bullshit. It’s a joke to say that the message varies by network, I can’t imagine that you actually believe that. They’re all controlled to subvert the people and to manipulate them. If you can’t see that, it just means that you’re a victim and haven’t yet woken up.</p>
