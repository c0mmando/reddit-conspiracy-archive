       This is a little old, but as relevant as ever, given that
       <a href="https://amazon.com">
        amazon.com
       </a>
       is being discussed on here a lot. Amazon got so big by destroying small publishing companies ruthlessly. They're an Orwellian-CIA connected entity run by the greatest aristocrat of all time. Their labor practices are terrible and should be exposed. It's unacceptable that this goes on. Check out her article from months of working at Amazon, if you have some time:

       Yea sorry, I was in.  It wasn't Full Metal Jacket.  They yell at you the first few days so you know who is boss.  Then only yell when you're a fucking moron.  Which since it's kids, everyone is a moron.  But I never saw any attempt to break people.  Someone should go join and see how boring basic training is.  Or maybe I got off easy.  Still say no breaking, more like having your parents around you constantly (annoying right).

       In my infantry basic, both at 30th A.G. at Ft. Benning and in O.S.U.T., I saw all kinds if fucked up shit. I personally saw a suicide attempt where a dude tried to kill himself by jumping off of a third story concrete building backwards onto his head. Somehow the guy miraculously survived, I watched it happen, then watched the Staff Duty N.C.O. casually call it in like it was no big deal. When stuff like that happened, or even if there was a hint of someone wanting to either leave or hurt themselves, the drill sergeants would humiliate suicidal kids by putting them in pink roadguard vests (reflective vests), and taking away their shoelaces (everyone who did basic probably knows that, but it's different when you see a person actually try to kill themselves, then see the attitude of the staff not giving a fuck). There were other incidents where the staff would just do that to humiliate people, including one incident where there was a surprise inspection. The drill sergeants put transvestite porn in a kids locker and falsely blamed him for it, which ruined the guy in the eyes of the training platoon, that really fucked the guy up mentally, he was just some random dude and the drill sergeants played a joke that truly hurt this kid. I saw multiple people pissing themselves because we were all forced to drink water and sit in one place for hours, this was not an isolated incident, I saw multiple grown men piss themselves, there was no other choice, and usually they would have everyone uncomfortably close to each other, so it would happen right next to me. My first day at 30th A.G. a guy got slightly insulted, silently put on gloves, then removed a broom handle and beat this other kid so bad that the victim got the nickname "zipperhead" from all the stitches, the guy who did it was prior service and got out of any punishment, gaming the higher-ups by saying that the guy he beat down was making racist comments (he wasn't). I saw a kid get beat mercilessly by the staff one night I was there, mostly by drill sergeants. The guy had ordered a pizza, they chased him down after he picked it up. He crawled up into the ceiling to hide, six guys pulled him down and beat the fuck out of this kid, knocked out several teeth ... for ordering a pizza. One of my drill sergeants was an actual psychopath, he would tell us in detail how to torture people in the most painful ways, his favorite method was to hang a person upside down and slit their eyeballs and their feet to bleed them out, this guy would just openly talk about shit like that. I had another drill sergeant get fired while I was there (just OSUT, all this is within a relatively short 14 weeks) for smoking (workouts as punishment) trainees in the dark in pro-masks (gasmasks) to the point that even in that environment it was sadistic, anyone who has been there knows that being smoked is just part of the training, but that guy had invented all of these cruel games that when I.G. heard about it they fired the dude. The training also turned into a Lord of the Flies scenario among the trainees pretty quick, maybe three weeks in. The environment of mass punishment, where one person's mistake would lead to the whole group being punished, led to a lot of beatings in the shower or beatings at night by the trainee platoon against someone who fucked up during the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know when you went through, or where, but infantry basic was no joke during the first few years of the Iraq war, they were letting a lot of criminals and fucked up people in, so both the recruits and a lot of the N.C.O.s were dangerous people.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was just TRADOC. Once I started doing more advanced training it was worse, more like "the gloves are off," TRADOC actually has a lot of basic rules and guidelines. In the more advanced training, I saw people get beat to the point of unconsciousness, we had to low crawl through mud while instructors pissed on us, we had to do what they called "hydration P.T." where you had to drink water literally until you puked, canteen after canteen, and you had to hold it upside down over your head to prove you drank it all, then drink another until you vomit. We also did this fucked up drill called the "mind eraser," where in the middle of the night we would form two big circles jogging in opposite directions, each circle carried either a white or red chemlight (I don't know the name, those raver lights, glowsticks or something) in their hand,  so you would see this hypnotic pattern of lights passing by, and you had to chant a repetitive word like "boots, boots, boots" for literally hours, it was some cult level brainwashing shit.

       Ls2323, I believe you've misunderstood me and, if not, I respectfully disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       In capitalism voting with your dollars is
       <em>
        the greatest
       </em>
       power you have. It's the fundamental cornerstone of a free market. I very much support capitalism. Without it, the US wouldn't be the economic and political powerhouse that it's become. Not that Keynesian horsecockery but the Austrian school of economics has been proven time and time again to be the very best economic form ever devised. The Austrian school of capitalism, which is essentially pure capitalism, has only failed to work when the government intervenes in the market. That is the beginning of socialism which is nothing but the entryway to communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not speaking of regulation mind you because, unfortunately, you do sometimes have to establish some of that. But as far as regulation is concerned, in general, I feel the less there is the better a market performs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best and quickest way I can see to correct this labor issue is for consumers to take their business elsewhere while informing the company why they're doing it. Nothing changes a business model faster than affecting their bottom line. I would happily pay a little more and wait another day or two for my order if it means the people fulfilling that order have better working conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if it doesn't work, I know I'll feel better for not supporting a company that takes advantage of the people it employs. Studies have shown many times over that happy employees are infinitely more productive. I would suggest incentives to improve production instead of the constant threat of termination. That seems grotesque and, well, downright evil.

       It's very hard to trust that criticism of Amazon is coming from a pro-labor perspective. We know that the president has a grudge against their ownership so a lot of Amazon criticism lately is politically motivated.

       So if trump came out and said he had a grudge against cancer, does all cancer research suddenly become “politically motivated” to you?

       No, because Trump has never publically stated opposition to cancer research or any major players in that field. Trump has a known grudge with the head of Amazon and he has spoken publically about his love of petty revenge.

       It failed, we wanted pineapples and mangoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the mad red hatters eat guacamole, we have switched to fresh mango 
pineapple and jalapeno salsa to go with our nachos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recipe, chop one mango, add a cup of chopped pineapple, and 1/4 cup of chopped jalapeno peppers, and finely chopped onion, decorate with some fresh cilantro, chop if if you prefer then dip, crunch, gulp some tequila, repeat until the fire consumes you.

       if it's really as bad as it is being made out to be then theyll be able to unionize easily, and no, amazon wont be able to shut them down because there will be too many on the same page.
      </p>
      <p>
       if they want change they need to do something about it.  The fast food workers striked, without a union, and are getting 15/hr.  What's stopping these people from doing the same?  There are dozens of fast food chains in a single town alone, but only 1 amazon warehouse for hundreds of miles.  These people have all the power they need to make change.
