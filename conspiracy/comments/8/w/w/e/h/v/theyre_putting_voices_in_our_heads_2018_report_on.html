       The guy that shot people in the Florida airport about a year and a half ago, said he'd been brainwashed by the US Army. Maybe that wasn't his exact words, I'm trying to remember...but there was some fuckery going on.

       After that sabotage job on the flyers in Houston attempting to warn people I’m a believer, even if I don’t fully understand how it works.  It’s hard to come to terms with having someone close to me diagnosed schitzo effective.  Now I’m questioning if they were targeted, or if it is all psychological.  Assholes.

       Interesting compilation. The only issue is that for activism purposes we need credible sources and not just testimonies from varied television news. These crimes against humanity are getting exposed and sooner than later we will have an objective proof, as RF detection equipment is getting better and cheaper, plus more TIs are permanently recording the organized stalking.

       Also I find terrible PR that this video includes criminal cases as TIs without further following. These are just assumptions based on certain claims that not necessarily describes the electronic harassment and organized stalking TIs are exposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very big issue to label TIs as potential criminals as this worsen the victimization and stereotypes used against TIs. We need credibility and trust to get support to prove our claims.

       How is a kid playing with her phone, stalking anybody? He is in public. In public there you might see other people.
How to tell the difference between perp and normal citizen? Because none of the people he recorded, did ANYTHING
suspicious at all. Tell me, what did this child do, that proves to you, that she is a perp? She doesn't even know he is there.

       There also on camera. They aren't robots. Trust me. I was stalked for a few years on an off. They'll talk to you sometimes without even looking at you, but they use metaphors. Never say what they mean directly.

       The child did nothing. It was just there. The only mistake all the people he is acusing made, is to be anywhere near this guy. How come, that he always knows who is a perp, but never happens to record any unusual behaviour of anyone else besides himself? All I see in his videos are friendly innocent people who suddenly get attacked by him FOR NO GOOD REASON.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is fucking talking about ATTACKING A CHILD that didn't do ANYTHING besides being in his  general area. And you support him. All those people did nothing, but being in his general area. When those people harras him, how come I don't see any of the harrasment in any of those videos?

       I haven't watched his more recent videos but Ive seen him interview a demon on that channel. 100% truth. She called herself a Mason (not free ) and admitted to being a gang stalker and explained that it was more supernatural. Like judgment etc... But alot of people who are stalked aren't bad people.

       Ok, I only watched few of his newest videos and realy man, it's clear as day, that he is accusing really anybody who just happens to walk by or to be somewhere in his general area.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, maybe he was/ is targeted, but then they got him to the point where he really went nuts and now he isn't in the shape anymore to distinguish between innocent children and perps.

       He is just like this one guy in OP's video. The one in the mall, who would just call everybody who walked by demon. I think most of the people in OP's video are really targeted, but that guy in the mall...
He even said "EVERYONE in this mall is a demon" Either the ones attacking him made him like this or he never was attacked in the first place, but is just mentally ill. I think both does exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Mindcontrol, microwave weapons, gangstalking)
And natural mental illnesses that make one hear voices and seeing things that aren't there at all.
And there are probably also people who suffer from both.

       How to walk in a mall and immediately know everyone is a demon? Don't they have to do something first before one can know?
      </p>
      <p>
       There were people far in front of him who didn't even have any chance to interact with him. He could only see their backs from a distance, but only needed a second to figure "demons"
      </p>
      <p>
       A cook in a fastfood shop he passed.... demon. Child looking for toys in a display window.... demon.
Kid coming towards him.... demon. All those people acted perfectly normal and most of them didn't even notice this guy, but he had all enough information to know they ALL were demons.

       Its something they do with your brain or something. I can tell when a person is in that mode. Stalker mode. Its something about them. I haven't been stalked for awhile but I know they are still around me. Its like something turns on in them and/or your brain and you can just sense their presence. No joke.

       So they are actually victims as well, sporadically used to stalk others and then left alone again?

       I think some are demons and some are possessed. You could be right with the aforementioned being victims too. Some of them you can just feel the evil oozing from them. You can tell by their mannerisms too. Watch Post Malone's Bob Dylan cover on Youtube. I can guarantee hes possessed in some form.

       I just can't figure out how aliens could be so human. I think its mostly demonic (possession is nothing new. Trade some old books about witch trials and black masses etc...) but it is definitely alien to humans, or human society, whether it be from space or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard of a star child? I had someone tell me a story about their soul being held light years away to avoid judgment. Then I read an account in a book on witches that the Devil stores their souls to escape judgement. That's a stalker type and a witch trial cooberating the same story. Hard to refute.

       Hmm, ok, makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I whitnessed A LOT "paranormal"/ unexplainable stuff and thus were of course trying to find out "who/ what is it" and after suspecting aliens for the most time, I became more and more convinced in the last couple of years, that it where "normal" human beings all along, who fooled me. Rich pricks and their toys. I found more and more evidence. Good evidence- proof even. And they ARE doing it. They use high tech to manipulate us and make us believe it's something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand though, sometimes it's really hard to maintain that confidence... Some things really seem too abstract to be the work of humans. You said, you can sense when people get into "stalker mode". I know that feeling. Also
       <em>
        They'll talk to you sometimes without even looking at you, but they use metaphors. Never say what they mean directly.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I had few situations when I sensed evil coming from my friends, just like you said and then they would talk with each other, but everything would sound like they are talking about me in a subtle way. Making fun of me. Some things they said didn't even make sense to me in the normal way, but only to insult me. It was scary.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one time it happened when I was together with two friends. We were talking, but at some point I stopped participating in the discussion and shortly afterwards, I couldn't quite follow them anymore. What they said stopped to make sense, but they were understanding each other. Then again, everything they said, seemed to be aimed at me. It went to the point that I got certain they are indeed posessed atm. I was scared to death, but I also got angry. I was like:
      </p>
      <p>
       "No! What the fuck do you think who you are!? NOT WITH ME!!!" In that moment the door in that room slammed shut with enormous power... I could immediately sense that "they" are gone now... My friends became normal again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told one of them few years later and he told me I might be right. He thinks that might have happened few times to him already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I really have to live in a world, where techology is used to torture people while making them believe in aliens, while also demons haunt you?
