       In all honesty it's beginning to look more likely that the most common conclusions from researchers seems to be the most accurate and verifiable. Not sure if we are allowed to do this here, but is anyone willing to discuss what you really think happened?

       Honestly as far as conspiracies go, many of them I've been extremely skeptical of. Especially if they include supernatural elements or a over-the-top sinister elite. 
9/11 being an inside job to some degree seemed the most reasonable. Maybe the government knew about the whole thing and decided to do nothing, or simply knew there was going to be an attack to some extent and let it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush and the MIC definitely seemed to benefit out of it. His approval ratings shot through the roof and the call to go to war hasn't been higher since Pearl Harbor. It also gave birth to the Patriot Act, something I don't believe would have been able to get through unnoticed if people weren't as scared from 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard so many convincing theories for the last eight years that I  figured that it must have been obvious that something wasn't right. It wasn't until the last few weeks that I've decided on a whim to try to find people who actually opposed the theories directly. Videos on YouTube dedicated to challenging the conspiracy theories are generally in the minority and often heavily disliked. However many of them did bring up some interesting points that I admit have changed my mind on a few things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So where I'm at right now, I've begun to doubt that any explosives were involved; or anything besides the two 767's. Whether the intelligence agencies knew about it is harder to prove or disprove.

       I respond with: They found unused nano thermite in the dust left over from the collapses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you say....
      </p>
      <p>
       Nah, that's not real and I have seen Stephen E Jones and his videos, I've seen the great debate on if thermite can be used to cut steel and I'm not convinced.  Don't bother me with that, anything else?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say that, then I'll say adios.  To me the physical evidence and video evidence as well as things like the dancing Israeli's all cannot be ignored entirely.  It would take some special mind to totally disregard those details and events.

       Nah, I've heard some other sources talking about the alleged use of "nano thermite." Most of the arguments that challenge that theory have a few points. Those include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The study that claimed that nano thermite was used collected the samples years after 9/11
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The people who conducted the study refused to share the samples with any reputable institution.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dr. James Millete sondicated four samples of dust from 9/11. To Jones's credit, Dr. Millete's spectral analysis did match the ones in Jones paper. The main difference however was that Millete actually did more analysis on the spherules and found out that they didn't contain any Aluminium.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Open Chemical Physics Journal that published and claimed to have peer reviewed the study is an unaccredited journal that was caught
         <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17288-crap-paper-accepted-by-journal/">
          approving science papers that were randomly generated.
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -Thermite is made up of

        mostly Aluminum and Iron Oxide

       It's a good thing people reported odd construction workers at odd times. As well as major power downs that shut down security video and alarms. All within the 7 weeks leading up to 9/11.

       I'm not taking a stance on the thermite, but at least do some basic fact checking of what you spew. The buildings were claimed to lose power by two guys and lasted since Sept 8th(after revised to 36 hours long and than rerevised to 26).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet no one else working there seems to know of a power loss over one day. Somehow no one in Manhattan saw a tower with lights out. Somehow people took trips up to the top of the towers as tourists during that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a sneaking suspicion you are a bad actor purposely spreading misinformation and trying to state it as fact to muddy the waters.

      <p>
       From his email - 
"Scott Forbes, who was a senior database administrator for Fiduciary Trust, located on the 97th floor of the South Tower received a remarkable notice three weeks before the 9/11 attacks. The Port Authority of New York informed his company that there would be a “power down” on the weekend of Sept. 8 and 9, 2001. This would mean that all power would be off in the top half of the south tower for most of the weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forbes has called this unprecedented, because to have a data centre lose power for two days requires major preparations and disruption. He reports that as part of the power down, all security cameras and security door locks were non-operational for about 36 hours."

       Goodjob, you found one of the two guys I mentioned. Meanwhile everyone in New York did not see the lights on the top half disappear. You forgot to mention he twice revised how long it was. His latest was only 26 hours. Yet people blinely believe a guy who can't keep his story straight.

       Odd construction workers at odd times would be a odd thing to report. Construction workers in NYC always come at odd times. So if the WTC security staff were able to authorize construction workers to work indiscriminately in the building, why would they need to shut down security and video alarms? Were the conspirators working with the building security or not?

       Bomb sniffing dogs was removed from building the week before the event happened. Security was lowered, maintenance people that was never seen before was allowed in teh building and had access to area they werent suposed to have access. power outage all long the week before teh event happened. bush brother was in charge of the security in the WTCs. you say there arent anything anormal but there was a lot of anormal events before the day of the event 911. dont talk about a subject you dont know anything aobut.

       Note that it is extra security in response to the phone threats that was removed. The standard level of bomb-sniffing dogs was still present, even one of the dogs was killed when the first tower collapsed. Even if all bomb dogs had still been present, their presence would have been ineffective (i.e. they would have been unable to detect explosives being planted in the pillar), or they wouldn't have been able to stop a rushed-job where sufficient explosives were somehow added overnight without being detected.

       Interestingly there were no less than 80 ACE elevator mechanics on site on the morning of 9/11 who infamously abandoned their duty to assist first responders with elevator rescues when they evacuated the building after the second the plane hit.

       However I hope you can understand that having repair crews doesn't necessarily prove there were any explosives. I've heard the narrative was supposed to be that they were tiny thermite explosives rooted deep inside the steel pillars. Otherwise how could have nobody heard the explosions strong enough to bring down a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Repair crews work in my building about every couple of months, especially on the elevators. The elevators in WTC had 8-foot-by-5-foot motors and could carry 3x more people than the average elevator, they were the first in North America and the biggest in the world. The only place they had ever been used before was in South African diamond mines and they were installed in 1969.

        At the moment, we were in B Tower. Not all personnel were there, naturally, because this was within a 15- 20-minute period after A Tower was impacted. We had at least maybe two-thirds of the total personnel that were there – close to 70 to 80 people that work for Ace at that time. We had repair, maintenance and monitorization people there. So there was a big crew of personnel.

       There is no explanation for Building 7 collapsing at the rate of acceleration of gravity (freefall speed) other than there was no resistance from anything below the falling roof line. Zero resistance. That is only possible if all structural support is artificially removed. Otherwise, even in a catastrophic failure, there would be resistance sufficient to appreciably slow the collapse. The physics has been calculated, if you want to look it up. Nist was forced to admit, after being challenged on this, that Building 7 did indeed collapse at freefall speed for the first number of seconds. They offered no explanation for this phenomenon.

       Thats where you are wrong. There was no explanation for the Building 7 collapse in the 9/11 commission report because Building 7 was a not a target. The report on building 7 was handled by NIST.  They were the ones who did a full

        88 page report on WTC 7
       </a>
       as well. Along with multiple other reputable science and engineering institutions. WTC 7 fell over 7 hours after WTC 1 &amp; 2. The building was slammed by burning debris from both towers and on fire for most of the same time. The damage from the fires and other two WTC's damaged the main source of water for the fire suppression systems. It was too risky and too much was going on for firefighters to risk putting it out.

The untamed heat from the fires expanded the long support beams which caused the connections and floors to fail. The interior columns already were collapsing when the outshell of the building collapsed with it. Nothing about what caused the collapse of WTC 7 changed in the NIST report.

The NIST report already stated that it did accelerate and go into a free fall speed between 1.75 and 4 seconds of the collapse, it was at the last second and a half it slowed it's acceleration again. Buildings that are demolitioned generally either speed up or fall consistently from the point the explosives are detonated. (They also have loud ground shifting explosions)

       There is literally an 88 page explanation of the collapse. Plus multiple other studies that support it. Simply not wanting something to exist doesn't magically make it dissapear.

       False, that is not how gravity works. Watch the penthouse at the top of WTC 7 during the initial collapse. The WTC buildings are tube framed steel-columned buildings. As you can see

       , most of the supports are within the center frame while the perimeter is much more open for office space. It serves more as an exoskeleton of the central structure. The central structure was already collapsing due to the fire, the outer shell simply fell with it because they were supported by the central structure.

       The only comprehensive studies done of the WTC7 collapse are those of NIST, Arup, and Weidlinger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each one, by the way, came up with a different collapse sequence. While I don't know much about the Arup and Weidlinger studies, I can tell you that the authors of the NIST study:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         examined no physical evidence,
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         omitted numerous key structural components of the first failed connection (shear bolts, welded end plates, partial height web stiffeners and more),
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         initially underestimated the width the bearing seat and increased their thermal expansion estimate by almost 15% without explanation when the mistake was revealed,
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         released only the first two seconds of their collapse animations,
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         ignored the most basic NFPA standards of investigation (NFPA calls for testing of debris for explosives or incendiaries in
         <em>
          all
         </em>
         cases of high order damage)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         explained that the reason they didn't check for explosives is because they had no credible reports of explosions being witnessed or heard (a claim that could only be true if they'd never heard of Barry Jennings or Micheal Hess--two people trapped for hours in WTC7 when an explosion in the stairwell trapped them on the eighth floor).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         and explained that they didn't test for thermite because they couldn't imagine how 100lbs of thermite could have been infiltrated into the building and placed without anyone seeing
         <em>
          even though the building stood completely empty for hours on 9/11
         </em>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The NIST study is plainly fraudulent, and the Arup and Weidlinger studies are based on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, no serious organization has done a comprehensive, good faith study of the collapse.

       The expert in structural fire design working for ARUP, Dr. Barbara Lane actually agreed that the fire caused the collapse. She only argued that the loss of fireproofing from the impact of the lane would not have stopped the fire from destroying both WTC 1&amp;2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Weidlinger were a private firm that conducted the study in 2015 revolved primarily around a claim of negligence, with Aegis and others seeking to recover losses against 7 WTC Co. and others for what they alleged was negligent design and maintenance of WTC 7 that contributed to the collapse of that tower. The NIST report is consistently referenced in defense that they were not liable.

       They didn't check for bullet holes in the walls either. They would have been equally as apart of taking the building down if there were after the planes hit. So which narrative are you going with, that NIST is incompetent for not doing more thorough testing for bullets, or they are trying to cover it up? Otherwise, why didn't they just say they found no evidence of explosives?

       Good thing about physics, and most fields in science and mathematics, you already have the solution once you have solved the variables. The Laws of Physics don't change because of your personal beliefs or anyone elses. Consensus among every reputable science journal and institution is that the NIST report is that the inward bowing caused by the hyper fueled fire brought down the towers.

       <p>
        examined no physical evidence
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From the NIST WTC7 FAQ:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         NIST's entire investigation included no physical evidence. How can the investigators be so sure they know what happened?
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        In general, much less evidence existed for WTC 7 than for the two WTC towers. The steel for WTC 1 and WTC 2 contained distinguishing characteristics that enabled it to be identified once removed from the site during recovery efforts. However, the same was not true for the WTC 7 steel. Certainly, there is a lot less visual and audio evidence of the WTC 7 collapse compared to the collapses of the WTC 1 and WTC 2 towers, which were much more widely photographed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonetheless, the NIST investigation of WTC 7 is based on a huge amount of data. These data come from extensive research, interviews, and studies of the building, including audio and video recordings of the collapse. Rigorous, state-of-the-art computer methods were designed to study and model the building's collapse. These validated computer models produced a collapse sequence that was confirmed by observations of what actually occurred. In addition to using its in-house expertise, NIST relied upon private-sector technical experts; accumulated copious documents, photographs and videos of this disaster; conducted first-person interviews of building occupants and emergency responders; analyzed the evacuation and emergency response operations in and around WTC 7; performed computer simulations of the behavior of WTC 7 on Sept. 11, 2001; and combined the knowledge gained into a probable collapse sequence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is a bit funny insofar as there is one bit of steel that was preserved and studied from WTC7 by FEMA. You can read out it in this
       <a href="https://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_apc.pdf">
        Limited Metallurgical Examination
       </a>
       . What's more there were plenty of dust samples collected and preserved by the USGS that could have been tested for explosive or incendiary residues--while it would have been impossible to attribute any dust sample exclusively to WTC7, any suspect residues in the dust would have warranted a more thorough investigation into how explosive or incendiaries might have been used.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Can you explain the significance of how those effected the collapse in your own words?

      <p>
       Sure. You won't like it though.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of the welded side plate allowed the girder A2001 to walk off the bearing seat. Had it been included in the model, a thermally expanded A2001 would have been trapped by the overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of the shear bolts allowed K3004 (IIRC) and the other beam framing into A2001 to expand enough to displace the girder 5.5" (later revised to 6.25") and push it to the very edge of its 11 inch (later changed to 12) bearing seat. Had the the bolts been included, the displacement would have been greatly reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absence of the partial height web stiffeners allowed the lower flange of the A2001 to buckle at the edge of the bearing seat, and the girder to subsequently slide off. Had the web stiffeners been included the lower flange would not have buckled and the girder would have remained perched precariously on the edge of the bearing seat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the width of the bearing seat NIST had this to say in 2012:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=901225">
         The bearing seat at Column 79 was
         <del>
          11
         </del>
         12
in. wide. Thus, when the girder end at Column 79 had been pushed laterally 
at least
         <del>
          5.5
         </del>
         6.25
in., it was no longer supported by the bearing seat.
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Regarding the simulations:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       The same way NASA scientist figured how to get machines on other planets and people on the Moon.

They had all the information they needed about the tube framed steel column infrastructure of WTC 7.

       Copying from Szamboti and Hulsey I see. Anyway, it was the axial expansion that generated large force for the bolts to fail. The assumption that columns 44 and 79 can't move in relation to each other is ridiculous. A2001 beams were not the only ones that heated. It wasn't the first thing that actually failed either. There was actually a number of collapses happening at the same time. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but you've only been tricked by more pointless psuedo scientific fodder. Even Szamboti in his own argument with Mick West got exposed for misreading the A2001 to C79 connection in the NIST model.

       That you might be way over your head for debates like these m8. You rely too much on the reverse scientific method. You listen to half baked theories, ignore any data that doesn't fit your conclusion, and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion. You've never even explained how they would have snuck nearly a ton of thermite without being detected into one of the most secure buildings in NYC. 
Even if they somehow did, the real question is why not just settle with planes?

       No, most of the connections and girders were already significantly weakened at that point because of the fires. Had only 79, 80, and 81 failed, the building would have been fine, just like WTC 1&amp;2 were after they initially got hit by the planes. They all used a similiar tube framed steel column design.

       Again, you're using the reverse scientific method and trying to throw away the evidence there was even a fire. You would have needed hundreds of pounds of thermite to cut through all of the necessary sheer connections and girders. It's not a Jenga tower, the core structure isn't supported by one column. It's extremely unlikely for thermate to have gone unnoticed, multiples hydraulic jacks wouldn't have survived for 7 hours on fire. So a bunch of guys with cutting torches just waited in a burning building that was about to collapse to make it collapse?

       WTC 7 is AGAIN a Tube framed steel column building. The core structure fell (hence the penthouse that most truther videos edit out) then the exterior frame fell with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're argument is making even less sense now. You're just paraphrasing the definition of a freefall, you're not even arguing what it proves or disproves. The ole truther argument was that the explosives brought down WTC 7, which would have led to a fall with no resistance. The freefall was debunked, Stage 1&amp;3 help proved it was progressive collapse and not cd.
      </p>
      <p>
       You fell back into claiming Thermite caused the columns to fail, you never even explained how the burning debris from the WTC 1. Did it magically disappear?

       No 767's were involved except as decoys in the sky, probably. No Boeings hit any buildings. Just watch an original video of 175 hitting the south tower and see how fake it is. Looks like a primitive under-budget Pixar production complete with a shitty CGI plane sprite.

       Thing is that argument works both ways. There are numerous academic publications that have called out the alleged evidence as well. NASA research scientist
       <a href="http://www.jod911.com/drg_nist_review_2_1.pdf">
        Ryan Mackey
       </a>
       is one example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenging the evidence is less popular. You would be hard pressed to find a YouTube video that challenges the conspiracy theories that doesn't have at least 30% dislikes.

       Labeling science as disinformation has not worked well for the Church and isn't going to work that well on any rational person. I'm sure if we labeled round-earthers as being apart of a disinformation campaign with sinister agenda's, the effect would be the same.

       say otherwise. A lot of passengers personal effects (and bodyparts) were found scattered around the area surrounding 9/11. That includes other passports, pagers, and even boarding passes. Explosions are not like what we see on TV. They are unpredictable and sometimes objects can be ejected by concussive force faster than they can be blown apart.

Probably hundreds of millions, maybe billions.  Do you know what the odds are of finding a readable passport of a terrorist in all that rubble In just days after the attack?

       It wasn't like it was the only personal effect found around WTC. They found passengers credit cards, mail, and even boarding passes. You like act 9/11 happened in the middle of nowhere instead of in the middle of a heavily populated city.

       I never said that it would take months. You don't actually think people were actively seeking the terrorist passport, were you? Again, it's Vesey St., the place is pretty busy. Anything interesting lying on the street would be found. Most of the people in the area could pick up whatever fell less than an hour after each plane hit. The passport was picked up before the towers even collapsed.

       Of course finding a passport of a suspect is like finding a needle in a haystack. However when you have half a million people in that haystack looking, the expression sort of loses its meaning.

       People used to think that it was obvious that flies came from raw meat. Fortunately we live in an age where science tells us different. There are literally thousands of pages from hundreds of independent researchers and physicist from accredited institutions, including NASA, with studies and experiments that explain in detail

       The truth is we don't know. From planes that were a third filled compared to the average amount of passengers that day, to incomplete passenger lists that omitted the terrorists, to Daniel Levin being the 1st victim of the day, to Jon O'Neill quitting his fbi job as the world's expert on Bin Laden to start working at the wtc that week. To the power  downs, to the "large white elephant in the room" to the flying command center over Washington. To lucky Larry. To harley shit guy, to abandoning a billion dollar command center, to giant fucking holes from roof to basement in several buildings, to "nose in/nose out", .......... this list can go on for days. The truth is probably far more unbelievable than we can fathom. Bush claimed he saw the first impact on his tv in the limousine,  then went in to the school to read a book, only to be told of the 2nd plane. How did he see it if there was 0 footage of the first crash until the next day? To all the local fbi agents on retreat in Florida. And they got stranded there for several days. To Fema already preparing for a chemical emergency at the wtc. To able danger, Ptech, I mean, the fucking list is huge.

       That's always been one of the main issues with the truther community. There is hardly any real narrative other than "try to create as much suspicion as possible". As if the narrative is to try to bombard the disaster with doubt instead of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure your list can go on for days, which Is kind of a problem. There have been hundreds of confirmed conspiracies, none of them are this over complicated and all had a central focus that led to one conclusion. A clue that led to other clues that would verify each other, not conflict or inflate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact the narrative seems artificial not by a government or sinister shadow organizations. It seems more likely that a French author got rich perpetuating misinformation shortly after the disaster. A handful of others saw the effect it was having and decided to cash in on it was well without the burden of reputation or an agreement with peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if you remember, but people around the world were scared and anxious at the time. They wanted answers faster than anyone could logically give them. So they turned to whoever would provide them, this led to a get-rich-quick scheme that has been in fact getting a lot of people rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wholeheartedly believe that the vast majority of the people that believe it, probably even most helping propagate it, are not aware they are being played.

Which part of the Pentagon was hit, what were people in this area investigating? Israeli students, dancing Israelis, which company was in charge of security prior who were the shareholders?

       So out of the tens of thousands of people and organizations negatively effected, there would have undoubtedly been some who may have potentially benefited in some way. However again, this only stokes paranoia, not any real grounds for suspicion. If a coworker of mine dies from a heart attack, the fact that I would be more likely to get a promotion doesn't make me responsible.

       If my supervisor died, then that means I would be more likely to get the next promotion. If the CEO of my company's main competitor died, it would raise our stock price and likely improve business. If my wife died, I would get a ton of money from the insurance company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is, my supervisor is actually a pretty cool guy with a family, the rival CEO is a philanthropist, and I love my wife. Being able to gain some benefit from a tragedy doesn't mean make you apart of it. The contractors who had to rebuild the WTC probably had a big pay check, are they apart of the conspiracy too?

       Well if they went through the trouble of miraculously hijacking four planes and planting multiple tons of extremely expensive nano-thermite without being detected, why wouldn't they go through the trouble of making sure they got the contract.

       In case you haven't heard, when skeptics say "why couldn't we hear 
 thundering explosions from the towers" the narrative is to say that they embedded tiny amounts of nano-thermite in enough concrete to fill two football fields, or it was an alien laser, either one works. Why? Who knows anymore, it's more about trying to convince people it happened then trying to convince people its true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The area was sectioned off and they merely tested what they had available. Keep in mind they didn't even finish after 4 years despite having hundreds of investigators, along with hundreds more private organizations, working on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They already had on record the design plan for the building and video evidence of exactly where and when the planes hit. All they had to do was reconstruct the event and break it down scientifically. They had the resources to recreate whatever they need to.

       And how long was it before wreckage was removed from the site, was it weeks? How long would it take for forensics to fully analyse the area of wreckage? I'm talking about this - why are you talking about years in talking forensics which happen immediately

       Fully analyze the area for what? What do you think they would be looking for? Videos and photos are forensic evidence.

      <p>
       They weren't looking for evidence that a plane rammed the building, I think they already established that.

       Sorry m8, but you're being quite vague. What exactly are you trying to infer? The disaster site was labeled a

       My reasoning behind believing this is a dud at this point is that it has now become more like arguing religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are those that believe and those that don't believe. Anyone in the middle will be grouped to one side or the other based on the bias of the observer from one of the two groups. It can no longer be discussed rationally, IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you question evidence, you will be dismissed. And I say that generically, because it applies to both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most cases, both sides of the argument have propaganda at this point. By propaganda, I mean that the videos and articles presented are intended to sway an opinion. Both sides will leave out counter-facts or ignore facts to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many different theories out there and so many of them contradict other theories. They each present evidence to support their theories, but only one can actually be true. If the very same evidence can be used to prove multiple contradicting theories, then logically, the evidence needs to be scrutinized a little more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of this is that as others are reading my very generically written comment are already forming in their heads which 'side' I am on as they are reading it. The responses will be framed in a way to determine which 'side' I am on, so that they can decide whether to dismiss what I say or not. Some will accuse of it being bothsideism (a propagandist term in it's own right meant to push out objective thought.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll save those the trouble. I am not truly convinced either way. Even at this point. I have researched a lot and still do not have a conclusion. But I will continue to listen to arguments from both sides as objectively as possible. My bias wants to lead towards an inside job, but I recognize my bias, and that makes me work harder to be objective and open-minded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what I think: honestly, the 'no planes' theories pretty much destroyed the truth movement. It is not a coincidence that the movement just died when these theories took precedence. For me, it was at that point that I recognized my bias and began questioning the objectivity of the sources of information I had trusted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remain with an open-mind, but the entire avenue of 'no planes' theory is completely closed to me now.

       I agree with your first point. However it's not as equal as you make it seem. The researchers that argue with their evidence generally are not accredited or peer reviewed by any reputable journal. NASA and NIST scientist have debunked it. The self proclaimed scientist and researchers that argue their points generally have a habit of getting rich off a career of trutherism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been on both sides. I've heard so many theories that I've figured that it must have been true. When you actually begin to listen to those theories you begin to notice how many of them conflict with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been open minded as well to both sides, however to a certain extent you have to be wise enough to understand that one side is significantly more flawed then the other.

       My advice to you is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about this big picture... Think about EVERYTHING that happened that day, both towers, pentagon, WHERE the Pentagon was hit and what documents were destroyed, BUILDING 7, intact passports, of WHO supposedly did all this, supposedly reading the flight manual on the way to the airport, the 99 year lease of the towers by Larry Silverstein months before the collapse, tons of investments against before the collapse, so many allusions to a twin towers collapse in cartoons, tv programs, media, etc before it happened, a collapse that countless engineers and PhD's say was impossible, a seiemic impact a tiny fraction of what it should've been... I could go on forever. Just think about the big picture here. Even if not all of the arguments are valid.

       Absolutely agreed.

       And not to mention that flying a “plane” into the Pentagon meant an invasion of one of the (if the THE most) heavily guarded air spaces on the planet. You don’t just somehow manage to circumvent this on one fateful occasion by pure luck

       Yes, it's the totality of circumstances that convinces me the entire event the "official account" describes is highly improbable. Unfortunately it's quite challenging to lay out the entire case because of this; the sheer amount of "small pieces" that build the greater puzzle are astronomical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gone back and forth for years, but the evidence overwhelmingly points to a cover up, of at least
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       . Building 7 is by far the most powerful evidence- it's never been satisfactorily explained by ANY authority why all existing footage appears to show a controlled demolition. From this, a framework of sorts can be built- if you question that one event, all others somewhat fall in line.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, upon realizing the building 7 collapse was suspicious, the natural progression was to next review videos of the twin towers collapsing. It is quite evident there are some type of forces causing powerful lateral ejections (one might say,
       <em>
        explosive
       </em>
       ) from points on the tower not yet collapsed. And so forth...the point is, just from carefully viewing primary source information, the narrative begins to shift. And you begin to wonder, if those parts aren't correct, what else isn't. This is before even reading one sentence of
       <em>
        theory
       </em>
       regarding the events.
      </p>
      <p>
       But back to the post above. I'd like to add Norman Mineta's testimony and the resulting shift/muddying of the timeline; additionally the shift in the official account when the previous claims of cell phone usage from the plane(s) were questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any implausibility that was credibly rebuked resulted in an alteration in the "official account." This would not happen if, in fact, the official account portrayed the events honestly.

       That's always been one of the main issues with the truther community. There is hardly any real narrative other than "try to create as much suspicion as possible". As if the narrative is to try to bombard the disaster with doubt instead of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure your list can go on for days, which Is kind of a problem. There have been hundreds of confirmed conspiracies, none of them are this over complicated and all had a central focus that led to one conclusion. A clue that led to other clues that would verify each other, not conflict or inflate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were allusions to the twin towers collapse in my living room. My curtains kind of look like the twin towers, and my kid used to like pulling them down. I guess he might have been in on it too, despite not being born yet.

       There were no planes.  Hard to accept but it was a massive hoax.  They just demolished those buildings and the media added in the plains as aftereffects.  Lots of shills will say they saw planes with their own eyes but there were none.  All other theories are red herrings.  Just like the Las Vegas shooting.  It was a hoax that they create tons of false conspiracy theories around to distract people for years.

       Can you provide proof of how NIST were single handedly able to change the laws of physics?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some 200 technical experts—including about 85 career NIST experts and 125 leading experts from the private sector and academia—reviewed tens of thousands of documents, interviewed more than 1,000 people, reviewed 7,000 segments of video footage and 7,000 photographs, analyzed 236 pieces of steel from the wreckage, performed laboratory tests, and created sophisticated computer simulations of the sequence of events that occurred from the moment the aircraft struck the towers until they began to collapse.
The general consensus among all of the worlds top reputable physicist and civil engineers, including NASA, agree with the report and often reference it for consultation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you might misunderstand what the point of the report is. It's main purpose is to identify, as specifically as possible, areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision. In Layman's terms, explain what happened so people can learn how to improve buildings to prevent the same catastrophe from happening again to the same extent.

       No major scientific journal or institution has refuted the detailed calculations or NIST report. The main consensus among all award winning reputable physicist and civil engineers is that the NIST report is accurate. Let me guess, all these scientist are all apart of the grand conspiracy as well.

       Israel took control over America when they had the CIA killed JFK. Since then America has been enacting the Israeli Likud party plan on The Greater Israel Project which is a plan to overthrow all Muslim goverments in the middle east so that Israel can obtain "full spectrum dominance" of the area.
      </p>
      <p>
       911 was created by the same zionists. Bibi Netenyahu's father was one of the original Likud party members.  911 was a Zionist plot to trick Americans into supporting war in the middle east. All made possible by our Jew media and jew deep state intelligence agencies
      </p>
      <p>
       No planes were hijacked on 911. Not by Muslims. Not by anyone.  Saudis Arabia had nothing to do with 911.  The official story says SA funded some of the hijackers, but as I just stated, there were no hijackers.  The intelligence agencies that make up the deep state fabricate evidence and frame muslims as they did on 911 and as they did in the newly released 28 pages.
      </p>

       I think this has the potential to be a great discussion point especially if people give you access to the prices of information or evidence they felt most compelled to accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally for me - I find the official story an absolute work of fiction. I’d like to believe that ANYONE with some sense and understanding (or at least willingness to learn in areas they are less knowledgeable in) would be able to see this.
We go into hundreds of instances of this but some of this is already covered by others above - if you’d like I’d be happy to list them.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a bare minimum- what was published as the official explanation for what happened doesn’t give justice or closure to those who lost their lives on that day. Somebody will always search for answers when you know what you’re being told isn’t true.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a possible side point- when the finger ends up being pointed, hastily in this case I might add, to a group or individual you can easily label like “terrorists” it really sets off alarm bells. It’s a very old tactic within politics to segregate yourself and an enemy and use the enmity created from propaganda to sway decisions. Having a “boogie man” that you can “save the people from” has lead to some of the biggest atrocities in history - limited only by how sick the people in charge are. Very dangerous but also very obvious to spot.

       I think the first thing you have to do is try to remove the bias and approach the issue more objectively. That's something I did and started to see things more clearly. The first thing to do is abandon the "official story" rhetoric. The "official story" was a result of almost a half a decade investigation by the NIST in collaboration with hundreds of other research, physics, and engineering institutions from around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already been accused of just glossing over truther arguments and simply not getting convinced. That couldn't be further from the truth, in fact it was the opposite. Many of these presentations and research from truthers often do have some grain of truth. Such as Stephen Jones research into dust samples that he claims contained traces of red chips that looked similar to thermite. His spectral readings were correct, which shows that he probably did do some actual experiments on them. However, he made the conclusion that it was nano-thermite by visual distinction alone. Other researchers examined dust particles as well and find similar traces of iron spherules that looked similar, but further study shown the dust samples did not contain enough Aluminium to match thermite.

       So how is somebody that is not a professional suppose to know what isn't true? That is practically just an admission that they may simply not want it to be true no matter what they hear.

       I absolutely agree. One has to approach these types of discussions objectively and set aside bias - not always easy but 100% agree with what you are saying there and personally I also try to approach everything I research with that in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having looked at a lot of content put together on the subject I think in some ways I have reached a similar point in terms of your overall questioning: who was involved? why would this be allowed (assuming there was foreknowledge of it)?
Those kinds of questions can open a whole other Pandora’s box that ends up in the realms of “who controls the world”. But in the context on 911 I’m nowhere near having a satisfactory answer to what the motive(s) were.
      </p>
      <p>
       To pick up on your example of Stephen Jones and his methodology- again we agree here in what is covered above. A lot of people have done research on particular questions are 911 that are all in themselves valid questions given the official narrative (e.g. controlled demolition, media interference with the coverage, pentagon, building 7, etc). I don’t know if any one person has it all the answers or ever will - only because the government would have to confront it properly if that were the case. Even then, it’s more likely to end up being labelled conspiracy rabble like we’ve seen with other topics like JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t think you need to be a professional to know truth at all. What I meant in the context of what I’m saying is - for example - I am not a structural engineer but do find it highly unlikely that 3 buildings would collapse at free fall speed into their own footprint as a result of fire wearing those internal structures (the official narrative). Just using simple logic - a lot of demolition companies would be out of business if that were the case. I mean if building 7 collapsed so neatly into its footprint because of catastrophic fire damage - then why do we bother rigging up buildings with explosives now? Just light the thing on fire for a fraction of the price? 
However a lot of structural engineers and designers who understand structures way better than I ever will find what happened to be impossible or at the very least incredibly unusual. Lots of skyscrapers have been engulfed in flames for a lot longer and didn’t fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       I studied economics so personally my interests have lead me down the path of following the money trail. There are many many things that are very unusual that I’d call statistically significant. There is some interesting work that was done into this - eg put options against airlines far above average daily amounts - that means a lot more money than normal being bet against certain airliners share prices rising. There’s a mine of stuff there but what I mean is there seems to be a lot more behind the story than “terrorist extremists”.
      </p>
      <p>
       To some extent maybe you are right that if people don’t want to believe something, they probably won’t. No matter how compelling the evidence is. Keep it up and don’t become one of them

       I think that is one of the vital things that make this so debatable. I'm not a structural engineer either, I have to rely on simplified explanations from professionals to have some understanding of what happened. I couldn't begin to understand how the hell NASA was able to get a satellite close enough to pass by and photograph Pluto. A dwarf planet 4.6 billion miles away while it's moving 10,500 mph from a surface moving 67,000 mph. However what I do know is that it's possible, but requires a lot of explanation in matters that don't pertain to our everyday lives, so common sense typically gets thrown out the window since it's not that common.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 is extremely similar in one way. What caused the main source of damage wasn't as simple or common as any standard explosion or fire. Majority of physicist and engineers agree that if it was simply just a plane ramming into the twin towers, the damage would would be severe, but mostly isolated to a few floors. Had it been only just a fire, first respondents and the buildings fire suppression systems could have handled it easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       However it's not that simple, and all of the factors of the 767's ramming into the Twin Towers all complimented each other. The heat from the Jet fuel made the fire too hot to control. The impact from the plane severely damaged the fire suppression and damaged support columns. The rubble from the building engulfed the plane insulating the fire and creating a powerful furnace. This basically melted down parts of the aluminum in the plane spreading liquid molten metal down multiple floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       This all built up to the real mindfuck. Something that people were not inherently used to seeing. A discovery so overlooked that even the structural engineers who did in fact design the WTC to survive an impact with a 707 didn't even think of.
      </p>

       The inward bowing of the floor trusses had the tensile members lengthen due to creep under load and ceiling temperatures, causing the floors to sag (become bowl shaped), snap their fixings, and drop away. This basically turned almost the entire building above the fire to topple down and bring the rest of the building with it. You can see it

        happening here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Imo, I would see the destruction of the WTC in particular being probably one of the least profitable for companies. I've heard hundreds of conspiracies as to why, yet those can't be pinpointed as scientifically so I don't tend to focus on them. One of my personal underlying theories as to why these theories regarding what brought down WTC are so prevalent is because NIST didn't finish their investigation until 4 years after 9/11. In the meantime, people took advantage of the global fear and got rich selling theories to validate peoples fears and anger. Some just found it as a perfect attack to use against Bush (who was a scumbag for what he did in Iraq)

       Not sure what you mean it's common knowledge that the gold storage was cleaned out in the hours before the buildings came down. A quick Google should pull this up right away. The gold was never recovered even to date nothing has ever been done about it. As for the steel again this was common knowledge it was fast track and sold as bulk scrap before the dust even settled. Fast tracked to ships and carted across the globe to be buried on China. All sorts of this sort of nonsense was going on it just cements in the facts that this was a plot carried out by nwo  or who ever is pulling the strings. If you dont find anything let me know I will get some links but like I said I doubt you will have issues if you just google the key words. All the best.

       All good I did in fact go Google it after I said for you to, just to make sure it would come up and both terms had pages of info on the first search. Sorry you are so negative it really is not so good for the you to be like that. And I think if you asked 100 people that had reseached 9/11 like you said at least 75 of them would know about the gold and steel. So to me that fits the common knowledge but for me. I will leave it to you as you seem to be more interested in attacking than taking 10 secs to type into google. As for woke I am happy in life and try to focus on the positives. My life is fine. All the very best to you and lots of love and good feelings from the internet.

       I am amazed by this guys total recall of a topic he researched for a week. Oddly he relies heavily on trust in the NIST report, which he personally doesn't understand, but it must be accurate because the guys who wrote it are professional scientists in a world of truth tellers who have no fear of destroying their careers by coming to a conclusion that leaves doubt about three buildings falling down (and just forget WTC7, we just can't come up with enough convoluted beam sagging physics to paper over that one).

       I find it hard to believe that anyone who has even taken a cursory look at the evidence would conclude two planes brought down three buildings. Go take a look at a moderate sized skyscraper. Imagine a plane hitting it. Now imagine the building falling into its own footprint. It's laughable.

       Ryan Mackey was a NASA scientist who worked on that paper independently on his free time debunking most of the mainstream truther arguments.

      <p>
       The government also states that the Earth is not round and that they landed on the moon. I could understand the skepticism if blind faith was involved, but not 797 pages of published Fire Safety research detailing the calculations and analytics.

       So by conjuring up their so called status in the establishment owned scientific community, NIST is entitled to come up with a collapse theory that runs counter to the reality of physics?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you actually saying that the laws of physics that AE states proves the NIST fantasy to be wrong did not exist on 9/11/01? There is no way around the laws of physics and that is what NIST tried to do during their entire "investigation."
      </p>
      <p>
       NASA didn't investigate the nature of the collapse of the 3 WTCs. So your comparing oranges to apples. Because NASA does not mean Therefor NIST.

       So what you're saying is that the scientific proof that Flat Earth scientist used that proved NASA are wrong about round Earth is made up?
      </p>
      <p>
       That and your argument are basically the same. You're asking to prove a negative. NASA scientist supported the NIST report which was an objective science based analysis of what happened. It wasn't a rebuttal to any other theories and it wasn't desperately trying to discredit other investigations with arbitrary accusations. It stuck plainly to facts and conducted research from scratch. They had access to most of the same tools as everyone else did, which made disproving the theories extremely harder than making them up. 
You rarely see 3d visualizations of how thermite would have destroyed the WTC towers because there is no logical basis to accurately depict it.

       Flat earth? Not only are you absurd, but you have once again totally skipped over the fact that NISTs  theories are ignoring basic laws of physics...and your lame excuse is that everyone must believe it because NIST is somehow the only qualified entity to theorize what happened and that's just not the case at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thermite destroyed the WTC's the exact same way it destroys any other steel framed building in a controlled demo...they weren't somehow a Magical Exception to the rules like NISTs theories were laws of physics don't exist.

       That is the absurd logic you are using. NIST is using advanced physics to breakdown the collapse, as corroborated by expert physicist.

      </p>
      <p>
       Here you go:
      </p>
      <p>
       Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity

       Nope, the pancake model was one of the old conspiracies based off visual observation. It's been widely debunked by NIST multiple times, it was the combined weight of the building that crushed the lower floors and caused it to collapse. Why didn't they show what in seconds, videos of the collapse?

       Hi I'm back, so let's put WTC and B7 aside. Please explain how a plane that has two very large titanium engines, left a 10ft hole in the Pentagon, with how much wreckage compared to other plane crashed (bodies, suitcases etc) And how one of the most secure areas in the world, has 1 crappy video of impact that shows nothing (I'll provide the other video later)

       Okay sure.

      <p>
       When Flight 77 hit the Pentagon's exterior wall, it actually created a hole approximately 75 ft. wide. Unlike the WTC 1&amp;2, the Pentagon exterior wall was significantly made up of much more reinforced concrete and would leave an outline. The wings never made it through the first ring.

      <p>
       No other plane crashed into a building designed to be as fortified as possible. The plane barely got past the second ring and many of the windows were even still intact.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "It was absolutely a plane, and I'll tell you why. I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I found the black box. I held parts of uniforms from crew members in my hands, including body parts. Okay?

       Read my first comment. Anything hitting a 3 foop thick concrete wall reinforced with multiple layers of Limestone and rebar, especially something filled with sensitive moving parts, at 550 miles an hour is not going to be recognizable.

       From his email - 
"Scott Forbes, who was a senior database administrator for Fiduciary Trust, located on the 97th floor of the South Tower received a remarkable notice three weeks before the 9/11 attacks. The Port Authority of New York informed his company that there would be a “power down” on the weekend of Sept. 8 and 9, 2001. This would mean that all power would be off in the top half of the south tower for most of the weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forbes has called this unprecedented, because to have a data centre lose power for two days requires major preparations and disruption. He reports that as part of the power down, all security cameras and security door locks were non-operational for about 36 hours."
