Why do we need to waste money on a military branch that is located somewhere where there is no current restrictions and most likely won’t be for a little while. Is it because of technology advancing and the possibility of frequent space travel and materials on different planets? Is this why we need power up there? Because we believe that soon it will be fought over? I can’t really imagine space being a frequent territory. STAR TREK IS FINALLY HERE!!</p>

<p>The prevalence of the flat earth movement and people waking up to this deception are the reasons why space propaganda - i.e., Space Force - is being introduced now.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence of space - there&#39;s no way a vacuum system can exist right next to a pressurized system - there&#39;s no proof the Sun is 93 million miles away - the moon landing was hoaxed, the Sun Moon and stars are not physical places.</p>

<p>The burden of proof is on the people that claim space exists or that the Sun Moon and stars are physical places.  There is no proof of this - at all.  How can a pressurized system exist next to a vacuum?  It can&#39;t.  And there&#39;s no proof it can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>we can create near-vacuums when we create isolated chambers with immense negative pressure to suck out most of the matter - this actually proves me point.  It&#39;s a vacuum system existing next to a pressurized system.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t seem to understand what science is. If you are testing falsifiable hypotheses using a replicable procedure, you are doing science. ALL valid observations support heliocentric models. All valid observations support the existence of gravity. Any uncertainties being ironed out have to do with the precise mechanics at operation within these paradigms.</p>

<p>&quot;Speculation&quot; and &quot;interpretation&quot; aren&#39;t dirty words. They are essential components of hypothesis and theory.</p>

<p>You&#39;re deliberately making it sound far-fetched, but in reality it&#39;s quite straight-forward. Knowing the value of G allows an approximation of the Earth&#39;s mass due to the Earth-Moon orbital system.</p>

<p>There are no valid &quot;scientific&quot; experiments that support a flat a motionless Earth. Unless you mean something like: &quot;I put a piece of lint on a ball and when I threw the ball the lint fell off, therefore we cannot be on a moving ball because, like the lint, we would fall off.&quot;</p>

<p>Measure atmospheric pressure at sea level. Then go to a mountain, or any elevation really, and measure it again. It&#39;s noticeably lower, so much that if the mountain is high enough you&#39;ll have trouble breathing, with no boundaries. According to you, there should be a rushing wind coming from the sea to the mountains, but there isn&#39;t. Unless you think mountains are a hoax.</p>

<p>Keep going higher, and the air becomes thinner until it&#39;s a virtual vaccum.</p>

<p>&quot;If you&#39;ve never seen it then how do you know it&#39;s real?&quot; is a child&#39;s epistemology. All experience, even that which you might call &quot;direct&quot; is filtered through theories, concepts, assumptions, and the imperfect brain itself. </p>

<p>How would &quot;being in space&quot; satisfy someone resolutely committed to an errant worldview? If I deny the existence of Africa, I won&#39;t believe that anyone has ever been there. If you kidnap me and take me to Kenya, I can insist that everything is staged. Radical skepticism boils down to special pleading since you get to chose which facts about the world are self-evident, while denying those which you find inconvenient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are already several space related programs that are part of other programs.  The navy has a space program, the air force has a space program.  There is a ton of nebulous space programs that are quasi governmental-private groups that are outside of proper governmental oversight and regulation, where money is siphoned off the taxpayers into black projects that serve the few and not the masses.  By creating a space force officially, it allows for Trump to start defunding these secret projects and putting our investments into ones that have government oversight.  I think it&#39;s a misnomer to think that we&#39;re going to be spending more money by having an extra branch.  The money is already being massively spent, it&#39;s just a restructuring to ensure it is being managed by people we can trust (aka not the deep state)</p>
