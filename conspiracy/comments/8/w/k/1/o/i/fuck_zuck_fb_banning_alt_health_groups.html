       There's currently no real alternative to a social networking site similar to FB. And in a free market, there's not likely going to be any competitor to FB due to an economic phenomena that economists call "The network effect".  That's the problem. They have a monopoly. They should be regulated like a monopoly.

       That’s a great explanation of the current events. 
Although it does seem near impossible due to the amount of money and influence FB has, I think the more people/groups they alienate and piss off by censoring them, the more people are motivated and willing to boycott FB and use an alternative, if there was an alternative to use. 
I think it’s possible but would require a lot of determination and cooperation of a massive amount of people to work.

       most pharmaceuticals are derivatives that come from natural phytochemicals from plants. pharma makes you believe their version works better because it’s developed to have a constant dose instead of natural variations in composition found in the wild. both work, one just has has measurable and predictable doses.

       Many are yes. But there are tons of natural remedies that work better than their pharma counter part. There needs to be more unbiased research to seperate truth from fiction.

       just because its natural doesn't mean its inherently better. most prescription medication and modern medicines are completely synthetic or are hybrids of organic compounds. just because you think marijuana has some useful medicinal properties doesn't mean there "are tons of natural remedies that work better than modern medicines". no, they don't. the absolute vast majority of any natural remedies have little to no therapeutic effects. i would know, i studied biochemistry in college.

       thats not evidence and its not a good source. its well known that a small portion of physicians have taken payments from pharma companies in order to push their medication onto patients, but to suggest that pharma companies have any significant influence on medical school curriculum is a joke. first of all medical schools are WELL funded by exorbitant tuition fees - each medical student will contribute roughly 200k in tuition fees by graduation to the school.    so there isn't any financial desperation for corruption. this isn't even taking into account the ethical and moral implications. lastly, the legal ramifications of obtaining fees from pharma companies to alter the curriculum to push certain medications and treatments are immense.
      </p>
      <p>
       medical schools are mostly nationalized and follow a standard curriculum that's developed by federal and state agencies. medical students more or less learn the same things across the vast majority of schools. there would have to be corruption on a vast scale. the curriculums are heavily regulated and constantly monitored for quality control.
      </p>
      <p>
       so try again.

        “Industry is responsible for the vast majority of medicines research an
d development (R&amp;D) in the UK...” This may be true for the UK, but in the USA more than half of new compounds were discovered by Universities and/ or biotechnology companies, and later transferred to pharmaceutical companies

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The pharmaceutical industry knows that if they give large grants to these universities they have a double benefit. First of all they have the appearance of being philanthropists. You know they’re doing good things and that’s always—that’s good for public relations. I’m not saying that they’re not doing good things. They probably think they are. But anyway that’s one advantage to giving tax exempt or tax free deductible donations to universities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other advantage is far more important, because once you have financed a research project you now have sort of a “first right” to whatever comes out of that research and consequently you can determine in what areas the research will go. I can assure that if I’m a big pharmaceutical company and I give a twenty million dollar grant to a research group I’m not going to be very happy if they start to research whether or not dandelions can be used in the control of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to make sure they’re going to research a drug that I am working on in the laboratories right now. That’s where I want the research to go. So they realize that they can take their own research budget and transfer it to a university or some research laboratory and get a tax deduction for it, knowing full well that if that’s what they’re researching, that’s what the data is going to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don’t need to go any further. You can understand when the money is coming from a source which has a vested interest in the outcome, what’s going to happen is the outcome is going to be what the donor wants it to be generally.

       I use colloidal silver, nascent iodine, and make liposomal vitman C lecithin mix with intermittent fasting and various nootropics and single handedly reversed all my health problems after going to 20 doctors to figure out what the fuck was wrong with me and none of them could cure me or help other than give me poisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 doc put my on cymbalta for my nerve pain and it was the fucking worse thing I ever took in my life, its harder to come of heroin than it is to come of cymbalta, that's how stupid as fuck most doctors are.

      <p>
       So when someone says, "thats not evidence and its not a good source," that's such bullshit. Academia is shilled by big pharma and biased AF with kickbacks for number of prescriptions given and most of it is crooked AF.

       Ive spent the last several years testing various natural treatments that so many dismiss because they cant accept that they don't know everything. I cured my nephews epilepsy and autism with natural treatments. CURED. As in the doctors say he no longer has either. And even though his illnesses came immediately after a vaccine, theres no way it caused his problems, right Dr?

       LOL, please tell me exactly which compounds you used to "cure" your nephew's epilepsy and autism. i'm sure your bullshit natural remedies cured an incredibly complex neurological disease that has eluded science for decades. theres evidence to suggest that some forms of autism naturally go away (or at least the symptoms aren't as problematic to put them on the spectrum) as an individual goes through adolescence, although its rare. 2nd of all, autism is a genetic disorder, meaning their DNA across the entirety of the trillions of cells in the human body is abnormal. curing genetic disorders after an individual is born is borderline impossible. so no your bullshit "natural remedies" did not cure extremely complicated physiological disorders.
      </p>
      <p>
       go take your findings to a university or lab and get your nobel prize in medicine if you think you can cure autism with natural remedies.

       So you are not aware that dna AKA genes can heal? You should probably do some research before spewing ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although im positive you cannot accept something that our corrupt medical/education system hasnt brainwashed into you, it was cannabis. There is research to show that this is possible. I could care less if you choose ignorance. I refused to and now my nephew who was basically a mute vegetable in a wheelchair is now indistinguishable from his peers in school.

       Whistleblower on Medical Research Fraud 'Positive Results Are Better for Your Career'
      </h1>
      <p>
       In an interview, whistleblower  Peter Wilmshurst discusses how pressure from Big Pharma corrupts  research into new medicines and leads companies to cover up fraudulent  data. He says he has no regrets about taking on an entire industry
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        SPIEGEL:
       </strong>
       How exactly do the strategy managers of big  pharmaceutical companies go about bringing a drug to the market? You  know the tricks ...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wilmshurst:
       </strong>
       Indeed. I could probably advise aspiring managers in the pharmaceutical industry (laughs).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        SPIEGEL:
       </strong>
       Okay, let's play a little game. Let's pretend to be these managers. What would you advise us to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wilmshurst:
       </strong>
       Well, I think the way you should do it is to get  eminent doctors on your side by paying them a lot of money. Officially  they are still independent consultants or university professors, but the  truth is, they lose their independence the moment they are on your  payroll. What these opinion-leaders say has a lot of weight among other  doctors.

       That’s a great explanation of the current events. 
Although it does seem near impossible due to the amount of money and influence FB has, I think the more people/groups they alienate and piss off by censoring them, the more people are motivated and willing to boycott FB and use an alternative, if there was an alternative to use. 
I think it’s possible but would require a lot of determination and cooperation of a massive amount of people to work.
