    <div class="md"><p>you probably have an addictive personality in general.  not saying that to downplay what you&#39;re saying at all, but I might be the exact opposite of you as far as that goes.  I don&#39;t drink or smoke anything and never had the desire to.  On that same token I can forget my phone at home or work and not notice till I&#39;m about to go to sleep and set my alarms.  I can absolutely see how someone can have trouble with that though.  I see it everyday actually, so the risk is def out there.</p>

I was the only one who actually started down that path from a car crash that destroyed my back and was actually prescribed these pills. I truly believe HAARP is screwing with peoples brain waves.. Everyone I know who stayed back home after hs turned to an addict. I was finally able to break the curse when I moved to AZ.. There is a power plant outside my front door now.. I feel it&#39;s energy constantly and haven&#39;t slept right in months. I finally cut out the bs and sugar and tons of meat from my diet and started eating healthy and taking care of my body and I feel better than I ever have in my adult life..

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I&#39;ve noticed my attention span drastically decrease when I downloaded social media onto my smartphone.  Deleted it two weeks ago and I&#39;m still struggling with the constant need to  look at a screen every 5 minutes.  Flip phones are few and far between but they are available and I&#39;m thinking of getting one.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget that when kids are raised with these they are significantly under-socialized and it encourages an instant gratification mindset.  Colorado is the first one to implement a <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/colorado-cellphone-ban-children/2017/06/19/id/796907/">minimum age for smartphones</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that ban actually went into effect in CO.. that article you posted is discussing a proposed ban, and a quick search only brings up similar articles (about the proposal). Seems kind of a weird idea to me.. they&#39;re talking about fines for companies who sell phones that parents intend to give to children under 13 (wtf).. how about parents just do their damn jobs? Money would be well spent educating the public on what too much screen time does to young brains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As much as I want to agree with you too many people think that they&#39;re the exception or just plain ignore the data to settle with a standard PSA outreach program.  These kids not only have access to them 24/7 but are encouraged to use them by schools as an education tool (in place of real conversation) and by parents as a babysitter/placating device.  Instead of it being used as a tool, it has replaced all aspects of our lives.  And now we have a swath of maladjusted, smartphone-dependent zombies walking around who can&#39;t comprehend self-sufficiency.  Imo, if something is such an objective harm to society, it should be regulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve tried ecigs that are like cigs ehookahs and expensive vapes. I dislike vaping a great deal. The only time I&#39;ve liked it was when vaping CBD and I have had many disposable vapes for herb and wax for bud or a mix of bud or dabs and CBD dabs. With any type of substance I prefer to just smoke it. Even with dabs I found myself just putting the wax in $1 foil pipes and firing it constantly. I prefer smoking plant material in cig or rolled form. I just can&#39;t do the vapes. I have an herb vape that didn&#39;t arrive in time for my trip to Denver so I&#39;ll probably just sell it. Many folks have recommended juul but it seems like there&#39;s more nicotine in them and I already smoke a ton. I can see myself juuling and smoking and upping my intake. Back when I smoked a lot of pot I mixed tobacco in and was smoking more than I am now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my jobs is Teaching (18-24 year olds, not in America, also im not american but i guess this is a universal problem)</p>

<p>The problem we have with smart devices is that they are not used smartly. My Current phone has a 2.4(?)ghz Multicore Processor, 4GB ram, 128GB of Flash memory and a freaking 1080p display. This is freaking Future Magic!</p>

<p>But in terms of use what do i do with it? I order food and other things, Order a taxi or book flights and hotels, i talk with my friends and workers, i pay my bills and i go shopping on it. It makes my life much easier and better in many ways.</p>

<p>However, that didnt translate well to the younger generations. What my colleagues (also from other Institutes) and i see is that we are having to babysit a &quot;failed&quot; generation in many cases. We have the Mantra of responsibility to yourself. You or your parents paid to be in this class, we will give our darndest to teach you and if you request it we even give you additional classes free of charge! However, if you choose not to learn, or if you choose to play with your phone during the entire classtime...then that is your personal Choice, the consequences of which you are carrying.</p>

<p>That usually worked well, however the last 4 years or so it got gradually worse. Especially the Boys (Man they are not) in our classes just play PUBG and dota like games for the Entire duration, if they show up at all. Obviously they failed the final Exams (that where actually today). But this is a real problem. At first we tried to collect the phones. But this procedure took nearly 10 minutes out of every day. Many students claiming they dont have one, or bringing a second (sometimes even a Third!) &quot;Burner&quot; phone so they can have their bliss. Some Students started crying and there where violent incidents when trying to collect phones (with another teacher). We gave up on collecting the phones in the end, we had for a short time Jammers in place but some <del>students</del> Addicts threatened to Sue (we call it paradise week!) so they are now only used during major Exams. </p>

<p>The games that they play are for the most part Predatory Freemium Crap. Dont get me wrong im a gamer myself (since 1988) but this is different, this aint normal gaming. The students are jeopardizing their future. In recent years girls have been affected aswell, marketing geniuses have figured out how to &quot;hook&quot; even them.</p>

<p>So instead of a slow process of learning something over the course of 3-4 years they have the option to have instant gratification and success every few minutes (and whenever they want if they pay for Ingame BS currency).</p>

<p>Its hard to fight this, as a teacher you cant compete with that. Students usually feel gratified when they get something right, that makes them into good students. They like to learn more, we give pretty decent rewards for good students. But if there is a mediocre students (who has the potential of becoming a great student!)  they will seldomly have those positive experiences. So they get those from Gaming. Slowly but surely they are being trained that Gaming=Happy, learning=Unhappy.</p>

<p>I try to include phones in my classes but that doesnt often work well (since they just choose as usual to game). If its the Usual suspects i would not care, there where always students who sucked or where not interested in learning even before smartphones. But now &quot;thanks&quot; to Games that are Designed to make you Addicted the number of &quot;failed&quot; students has gone up dramatically. When they are released into the wild they are obviously ill prepared and i get the occasional text from a student years later saying &quot;Sorry teacher, i now regret not having learned more&quot;. There are less and less &quot;success stories&quot;.</p>

<p>Smartphones are a great thing. But if i had a kid, i would NEVER let them have one. The Games market is way too predatory, peoples futures are being ruined because of it. Children and young adults dont have the life experience to realize when they are being Exploited. The problem is that before you had to go home to game, now you can play at any time. Games have also changed massively, they are free. Teasing you with things you dont have. Putting artificial barriers up in forms of Grinds, Failures or waiting times. They make the Process of giving money to them into a reward in itself. Thats some high level Manipulation, and it needs to be regulated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to know I&#39;m not the only one noticing this change. I have noticed the number of really good students getting smaller and smaller every semester to the point that I&#39;m lucky if the top 1 or 2 students in a class of ~40 are at least pretty good. Five to six years ago, I could always rely on the top 4-8 students being excellent. The average student is now riding the line between passing and failing all the time if graded on an honest scale. Most instructors/professors end up just lowering their standards to keep their grade distribution from sucking, and this just makes the problem progressively worse and worse.  </p>

<p>I see a lot more students just completely give up and not even try to explain why. Something is wrong.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced it&#39;s all just gaming, although I definitely see how that is one of the negative effects. I think people have relied on this technology so much at fundamental stages in their mental development that many never learned how to think and come up with ideas for themselves. Even worse, they stopped learning information entirely since they can just look up whatever they need at any given moment. Never mind the fact that your brain can work more efficiently when the information it needs is already firmly rooted in memory. People are starving and destroying the power of their unconscious mind by not feeding it enough information to process and organize and discover connections. This is the foundation of common sense. Fewer and fewer people have the common sense to use technology constructively because they don&#39;t even know where to begin reading up on anything outside of their limited scope of stunted understanding, nor would they even want to try if they could. Their attention span for critical thinking is approaching zero. Social media, gaming ,sports, entertainment, and news are always at your fingertips. Why actually think about anything? They just look up a YouTube video later explaining how to answer tge homework questions. They might retain only 10% of the needed skills the next day. If they can&#39;t find an online tutorial, they don&#39;t know how to read their textbooks so they just skip it.  </p>

<p>You are completely right in everything you said. Games are currently the most destructive influence. But you are right, whenever they do work with me in class they look it up on their phones. Their memory is Awful. Which leads to less and less positive experience in class. So i didnt mention it before because (and i realize how silly it is) that if they at least look something up on their phones...they are participating. </p>

<p>This is a dangerous thing. People are made to believe that they dont need to know things anymore, they can look up the answers themselves. Personally i want my students to be creative minds. I want them to excel me. That simply doesnt happen anymore.</p>

<p>And you are right, we had to massively decrease our Standards over the years. Half of my class failed today, an exam that is about 2 semesters below what they should know, and they failed....on monday i will get into deep shit for this by the Administration. Their job is to give me shit for it, i dont blame them. They know whats what, but they have to do their job aswell. So the solution will be to further decrease the standards. Happend every year so far since a couple of years.</p>

<p>I think the problem is that the general trend isnt reversible and is just what future humans will be like. Few Coorperations, the ones who control the entertainment and information will have unprecedented power over vast amounts of People. Not via an Iron Fist. No simply because people believe everything they say, because there wont be other ways to know things anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have genuine conflicts with my device. First, I&#39;ll say that I would be so terribly ignorant without the years of gleaned information through the portal of a smartphone. Before I even hit online, a read stories and imagined in awe what it would be like to &#39;surf the net&#39;. I found myself looking for breaking science, choosing Microbes as the overall favorite, following the catalog of the soil food web pioneered by Elaine Ingham.
I found use with the built in blogging tool on MySpace, a feature brandished along the top right of your profile. It was here I began writing..well, these sort of news articles. I mocked the formats and prose I was used to reading, but pulled a bunch of content together that interrelated.</p>

<p>I took a sniff at Facebook, maybe 2010 I guess - and hated it. It seemed like that platform was trying to minimize the input parameters of what I&#39;m trying to say. Doesn&#39;t matter what,  by then I was used to some elbow room, as Twitter failed the smell test with 140 characters. I mean, I&#39;m running full speed on blogs by now, and platforms like Twitter and Facebook we&#39;re cramping my style.</p>

<p>But, of course I had a Facebook account and some of my friends had crossed over, so I ghost-friended them and stuck ardently to MS. Then MS bugged out, and I&#39;m woke enough to draw parallels with 9/11, stinks to hell.
Where do I do? You got it, FB for 3 or 4  years, bitching about it to high heaven at least once a week, fuming at the limitations, the 30 soft-ban, and in the end, straight up manipulation of my friends news feeds by not showing any posts from me. That made me rage.</p>

<p>Now, FB is US military, it&#39;s messenger app listens, and still the only way for me to contact some of my favorite friends is through FB.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I study science and academic papers, sourced discoveries and the like, and think of ways to work them into my novel WIP, all the while learning. 
I say this, because I wish more people were inclined to read a little bit about some stuff and get something for it. If I could tell your students the power of utilizing the power of information at your fingertips...</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m just a geek or eccentric, but I am beginning a project that I&#39;m calling my &#39;thesis&#39;, which is Restoration of a Derelict Property Through Microbial Arrest. It&#39;s a self-appointed achievement that capstones my eight years of self-study. The internet is so valuable as a mobile tool, it&#39;s unfathomable to limit it.</p>

<p>The flip side is health. My life is in an upheaval, and right now I only have the phone. It&#39;s hard enough to keep a full charge on it, my less the laptop I charge up once a week.</p>

<p>Constant use. And I mean constant. I am also a guitarist and singer, and I&#39;m always looking up new songs - when I&#39;m not watching Rick and Morty to death.
But my left hand can&#39;t hold cell phone anymore. It hurts, pretty bad. I know why, yet I can&#39;t stop. </p>

<p>I&#39;m addicted to my handset, and it&#39;s killing me for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cars were fine until towns and cities (in the USA especially) started being built around the assumption that every individual would have one. Now walking simply isn&#39;t feasible in most parts of the country, which greatly limits the freedom of those too poor to afford a car, and amounts to an enormous taxation on everyone else. Cars should be a nice addition, not a <em>requirement</em> for survival. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a very complicated problem to solve. The whole economy more and more relies on the Internet. The Internet is here to stay. So are the devices that enable convenient services 24/7. Can we blame a gaming company for finding tricks to have you play more often their games ? Their business model translates to : you play more = we make more money. Can we blame social media, or any website for implementing tricks for the same reason ? Probably not.</p>

<p>I think the answer comes from regulations, education, and self-control/discipline. </p>

<p>Regulations from authorities, such as ban smartphones in public schools for anyone below the age of 15. If we can successfully ban smoking and drugs at school for most, we surely can ban smartphones. That may take another 15 years before these guys wake up though. </p>

<p>Education by authorities, parents at home, teachers. Teach kids how to use their smartphones the right way, parents who limit their use at home. Have authorities educate parents on the potential dangers of smartphones for the kids. IDK how effective that would be. It&#39;s still a step forward.</p>

<p>Self control. If I couldn&#39;t apply any self control, I would be spending my whole day playing movies on the TV, playing video games, eating chips and drinking cola. I would also drink alcohol and experiment new drugs all the time. I did all this (except for the drugs) for some time in the past, not very long, and I stopped with enough self control, and self discipline. It&#39;s also self discipline that allows me to fast for a month each year, cook at home with fresh ingredients VS buy pre-made meals at the supermarket or eat a big mac. IDK if self discipline/self control are things that can be taught. Something to look into maybe.</p>

<p>Sadly, given the addiction power of the smartphones, and its widespread, i&#39;m afraid they are going to do lots of damage on people before anything is done.</p>

<p>I know of parents who sit their (not even 1 yo) child in front of the TV at night, or hand over a smartphone to look at, while they are busy doing something else. They may not be aware of the damage, however, they have the same Internet that I have, so they have no excuse not to know.</p>

<p>They have changed the way with think, the way our memories work, and the way we process information. This goes beyond the individual level, affecting how society  functions as a whole - government, industry, academia, etc... all are bound up in the web.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think one of the biggest effects of smart phones on society is going to be manifested on The children of this first generation of smart technology. as parent myself, I&#39;ve caught myself on numerous occasions telling my children &quot;Hold On a second while I finish writing this email&quot;, when they come to me for something.  I&#39;ve caught myself getting annoyed at my own kids when they &quot;interrupt&quot; me while I&#39;m immersed in my phone.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen this happen with my wife, and saw the absolute look of dejection on their faces.  We are essentially inferring to them that our phones are more important to us then they are.</p>

<p>This not only has negative effects physcologically on them, it&#39;s also driving them into the same addictive loop that we are in. If the phone is more important to Mommy and Daddy then I am, I must have one myself.</p>

<p>By emotionally neglecting our kids, and not giving them are undivided attention, they will surely try and find that attention in other things, including drugs, alcohol, and other destructive behaviors in search of devotion.</p>

<p>Even after I became aware of how my addiction to smart phones was negatively impacting them, I still would still catch myself ignoring them, or even worse isolating myself in a separate room, so I could use my smart phone unmolested.</p>

<p>In order to be completely and totally present around our kids now, my wife and I purchased a landline, and now forward all incoming calls from our cell phones to the home phone, and we leave our phones in the car. Well we at least leave them in the car until the kids are asleep, at which point we usually go and get them to catch up on all the things we missed for several hours, completely ignoring each other.</p>

<p>I feel the effects on children are going to very detrimental in the long term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at the beginning I loved it, I loved the thought of a smarter phone. Something being more useful to me. Then, I realized that everything I&#39;m doing is being documented somehow and that this is the realization of the book 1984. Every phone has a camera. Then when Snowden shared his stories on how guys in the NSA exchange pictures taken illegally from webcams on women, wow I really understood. This is no BS. They intend to control EVERYTHING. And record every fucking fart you make.</p>

<p>So I quit Facebook, although I have to use Google for work and such. But all through VPN, it is seriously a grim future. It makes me sad, and to some extent a bit depressed. We have allowed a few to control the many, and even though we outnumber them - they probably have a plan for a social revolution. This isn&#39;t going to end well in my opinion, sadly. </p>

<p>Smart &quot;tech&quot; and AI are enslavement tools, we love the easiness of it, but we sacrifice everything else. The generations growing up now are documenting willingly each moment of their lives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People are all increasingly glued to their smart phones and consumed by social media, but why? Panorama reporter Hilary Andersson tracks down tech insiders who reveal how social-media companies have deliberately developed habit-forming technology to get people hooked. A former Facebook manager tells the programme: &#39;Their goal is to addict you and then sell your time&#39; and the creator of the &#39;like&#39; button warns of the dangers of social-media addiction. Panorama investigates the science behind the lure of technology, and shows how behavioural science has been used to keep people endlessly checking their phones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In addition to all of these great points, I would like to point out the increasing level of “troll” like behaviors in real life interactions. Behind a keyboard, it is easy to lash out with a snarky reply, hop right into a ridiculous argument, or just flat out be mean to another human being. This is translating into real life behaviors. No longer are the days of respectful dialogues, common courtesies and basic human interactions. People have lost basic human connections and it’s showing more and more each day. Gone are the days of being respectful to your neighbors, now you are met with a fuck you attitudes. Gone are the days of striking up a casual conversation while waiting in line. Gone are the days of playing a board game with the family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that’s exactly what I’m talking about. When you stop interacting, you start believing all the bad things you see and hear on social media and the news. You start thinking that people really are bad/scary/hateful because that’s what you’re fed. But when you actually <strong>talk</strong> to people, you realize you have more in common than you don’t. There are far more good ones than bad. That human connection is what keeps us all grounded in reality. Otherwise, as we see today, everyone becomes the enemy. It’s isolating us, whether that’s by design or just a byproduct. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy those simple connections with strangers.  You made mention of genuine compliments...I feel the same ways that you do.  The rampant disconnection taking place is troubling and saddening.  I can&#39;t have one conversation with one of my very best friends now because he will absolutely be preoccupied with his smart phone, and he has a friend who really needs him now like never before.  It really hit me when I was talking about my late mother with whom I was very close; One of his responses after looking up from his phone proved that he didn&#39;t realize that I&#39;d been talking about my mother (what was said absolutely didn&#39;t apply to my mother at all...that was the dead giveaway).  Man, it hurts when you get second billing to a smart phone, especially with an old (and supposedly close) friend.  </p>

<p>The roll out  of 5G wireless service is &#39;a massive health experiment,&#39; public health  expert warns as cell companies install 800,000 towers across the US</p>

<pre><code>The latest generation of wireless service - 5G - is being rolled out across select cities in the US  Networks will transmit data 100 times faster using shorter radiation waves  The new network will require 800,000 new &#39;small cell&#39; towers  Some research has suggested that cell phone radiation may be carcinogenic  The new millimeter waves used in 5G have hardly been studied and introducing them constitutes an &#39;experiment,&#39; warns a public health professor  
</code></pre>

<p>Natalie Rahhal, Daily Mail, May 29, 2018</p>

<p>Wireless  carriers are constructing cell towers a stronger, faster 5G network,  but some experts warn that the updated service&#39;s health effects are  unknown and potentially dangerous.</p>

<p>Today,  there are 154,000 cell towers in the US, according to wireless  communication association, CTIA. By 2026, it estimates another 800,000  will be needed to support 5G.</p>

<p>The network update will bring more Americans into closer proximity with milimeter waves, very short-wave radiation.</p>

<p>Research  on cell phone radiation has yielded mixed findings, but some studies  have linked older wireless service generations to cancers of the heart  and reproductive organs, and 5G&#39;s health effects have hardly been  studied.</p>

<p>Wireless providers have begun  installing 800,000 &#39;small cell&#39; towers to support the roll out of the  new 5G cellular network, but some public health experts warn they may  endanger humans.</p>

<p>The new network is  slated to support 100 billion devices, connecting to the internet at  anywhere between 10 and 100 times the speeds that information travels  through the 4G network.</p>

<p>In order to  facilitate these speeds, the new network communicates through millimeter  waves (MMWs) rather than microwaves, as previous generations have.</p>

<p>The microwave networks are nearly saturated, hence the switch to the virtually untouched, lower frequency MMWs for 5G.</p>

<p>But smaller waves cannot travel as far, or through as many types of materials.</p>

<p>This  means that there will need to be far more individual &#39;small cell  towers&#39; closer together - some have suggested they will be on every  street corner in the US.</p>

<p>The 5G technology is too new to have been thoroughly tested and studied by many parties outside of cell service providers.</p>

<p>According  to Dr Joel Moskowitz, a public health professor at the University of  California, Berkeley, MMWs could pose a very real danger.</p>

<p>&#39;The  deployment of 5G, or fifth generation cellular technology, constitutes a  massive experiment on the health of all species,&#39; he told Daily Mail  Online.</p>

<p>Because MMWs are weaker than  microwaves, they are predominantly absorbed by the skin, meaning their  distribution is quite focused there,</p>

<p>&#39;Since  skin contains capillaries and nerve endings, MMW bio-effects may be  transmitted through molecular mechanisms by the skin or through the  nervous system,&#39; Dr Moskowitz writes on his blog.</p>

<p>He  also told Daily Mail Online that he&#39;s concerned that &#39;5G will use  high-band frequencies, or millimeter waves, that may affect the eyes,  the testes, the skin, the peripheral nervous system, and sweat glands.&#39;</p>

<p>&#39;Millimeter waves can also make some pathogens resistant to antibiotics,&#39; he added.</p>

<p>Dr Moskowitz is not alone in apprehensions.</p>

<p>The  International Society of Doctors for the Environment, its subsidiaries  in 27 countries, and more than 200 doctors and scientists are all  calling for a stop to be put to the roll out of 5G, &#39;due to concern that  5G radio frequency radiation will have adverse health effects,&#39; Dr  Moskowitz says.</p>

<p>So far, their warnings have gone unheeded.</p>

<p>Verizon  began rolling out their 5G small cell towers in 11 cities 2017, and  AT&amp;T started installing the new generation of service in Waco and  Dallas, Texas, as well as in Atlanta, Georgia this year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory that technology was given to us by aliens in order to eventually enslave us kind of like The Matrix. The idea is to separate us from everything that we&#39;re suppose to be connected to. Nature, spirituality, each other and the cosmos. Then we become so unhappy, we get addicted to all sorts of things. Technology being the easiest and safest thing, we think. It makes our lives better and more convenient. And look how easy it is to communicate with all my friends. Except it&#39;s not real communication. It&#39;s words on a screen. We need human interaction. We need be to out in nature. We need to be able to look up at the sky at night and see the incredible amount of stars in the milky way to be reminded of what we are instead of barely seeing anything because of light pollution. And through those 3 things, we will be able to connect to the spirituality of life itself. The divine spark inside of all life. It is any wonder our country has all the problems it does with drugs, suicide and anti-depressants? Our bodies are trying to tell us something. This isn&#39;t the way humans are suppose to live. Our natural reward systems have been hijacked and rewired.</p>

<p>This all started with the Neolithic Revolution. 7 (I think?) different spots all around the world over the course of thousands of years, all moved from hunter/gatherers to agricultural societies, independent of one another and then spread all over the globe. These groups say they got this knowledge and technology from beings from the sky, usually referred to as dragons. A model for this can even be seen in the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible. Adam and Eve get kicked out of the Garden of Eden (nature) and cursed to work the ground while Eve is told to be subservient to Adam which creates the patriarchy. That was the first step to separate us from nature and put us at odds with it, not caring if we destroy it. This also took us from abundance thinking being hunter/gatherers where everything was out in nature, you just had to go get it and you only take what you need since there was always more. To famine thinking with agriculture because you only had so many animals and crops each harvest. That induces a sort of paranoia and guardianship over what is yours because you need it to survive. In nature, everything belongs to everyone and there will always be more somewhere. This shift in thinking and lifestyle lead us all onto the path to where we are now. When farming is how you depend on your survival, you&#39;re going to try and create things that make that survival more likely and make it easier. There was no need for new technology in hunter/gatherers aside from, you could argue, weapons to hunt with and to possibly fight off another tribe but they got along just fine with what they had and there was no major competition to drive more creation of technology.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects, mostly diseases and warfare.  </p>

<p>The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increment in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth. Average height went down from 5&#39;10&quot; (178 cm) for men and 5&#39;6&quot; (168 cm) for women to 5&#39;5&quot; (165 cm) and 5&#39;1&quot; (155 cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.  </p>

<p>The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. Jared Diamond (in The World Until Yesterday) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged inequality between the sexes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So with agriculture, you bring about the need for large scale governments, leaders, social elites, slaves. The people now fight over resources, especially because of population increases. With those increases, comes the need for more control. Today, there&#39;s only a handful of companies who control the vast majority of our food that comes from agriculture. Looking at this Wikipedia entry, you can see the various problems and devastating effects that large scale agriculture is having on our planet. It&#39;s helping drive climate change and climate change will undoubtedly cause famines due to droughts and other extreme weather patterns around the world. There&#39;s no way this will be sustainable unless some sort of major shift happens in at least the way we get our energy. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_agriculture">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_agriculture</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>environmental impact of agriculture</strong> is the effect that different farming practices have on the ecosystems around them, and how those effects can be traced back to those practices. The environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world. Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.  </p>

<p>There are two types of indicators of environmental impact: &quot;means-based&quot;, which is based on the farmer&#39;s production methods, and &quot;effect-based&quot;, which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater, that is effected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil. An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based. The means-based evaluation looks at farmers&#39; practices of agriculture, and the effect-based evaluation considers the actual effects of the agricultural system. For example, means-based analysis might look at pesticides and fertilization methods that farmers are using, and effect-based analysis would consider how much CO2 is being emitted or what the Nitrogen content of the soil is.  </p>

<p>The environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil variety, people, plants, and the food itself. Some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are climate change, deforestation, genetic engineering, irrigation problems, pollutants, soil degradation, and waste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting to think that this one shift in our way of living has lead us down a very specific road and the knowledge from which this shift is accredited to, has basically the same story across the world, that it&#39;s from other worldly beings. Only through this shift has the control and enslavement of the entire human race been possible. The driving need to constantly improve technology, dig up oil, deforest the planet, emit greenhouse gases, use up a large portion of our water supply, etc </p>

<p>You&#39;re not very good at reading are you? Maybe you shouldn&#39;t have stopped. Hunter/gatherer societies were much more egalitarian, that&#39;s just a fact. I would have just say, get the fuck over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. We are doing our own will instead of God&#39;s. We think we each are our own God and we can do as we wish and nothing bad will happen. We think we can manipulate human genetics and create the &quot;perfect&quot; human, Designer babies are supposedly the future. Then we want to explore the cosmos and possibly seed other planets and create and manipulate other lifeforms. We think we&#39;re responsible enough to cause direct changes in the DNA of our race and change other planets when we can&#39;t even take care of ourselves?</p>

<p>In my opinion, we are ALL God together, as one. I hurt you, I hurt myself. We are just pieces of the whole, experiencing other pieces of the whole but it is all just an illusion, we are the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my own limited experience: Wi-Fi in very close proximity is very disruptive to cognitive functions. </p>

<p>I did an unvoluntary test with a 1 watt wireless antenna once, to connect to another router in the house. The antenna was about 1 m from my desk and I was exposed to the wifi waves for a couple of hours a day. After a while I couldn&#39;t concentrate or even think straight. The most obvious symptoms were brain fog, headaches, dizzyness and sleepiness. There also appeared a high pitch ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>Needless to say that I turn off Wi-Fi always on the router and phone and only use cable to connect them and recommend everyone to do the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally destroying social society at the very least.  </p>

<p>I am pretty bad with the constant messing with/checking/looking and all that comes with it.  Every pause in conversation every awkward moment I see myself doing it.  I catch myself and put it back and do it again less than 5 minutes later.  So many triggers cause me to do it.</p>

<p>I am conscious of it and actively trying to do something about it.  I am 35 and for a big part of my life this wasn&#39;t a thing, neither was social media.  I am very aware of all the problem.  I am very aware of technology as a whole and what it is doing to society, and I STILL do it.</p>

<p>I cant imagine what its like for 20 somethings.  They dont know life without it.  They most likely will not be convinced there is a problem.  Even worse we got babies with tablets in front of their faces hypnotized by the digital wonder.  Dopamine  addicts being produced all over.  How do they even stand a chance?</p>

<p>Its bad.  I dont know what can be done.</p>

We grew up mostly without cell phones, playing outside, interacting with eachother, but that all changed right as we were leaving high school. We&#39;ve been smack in the middle of both sides of this and if a revolution ever happens, we will be the ones leading the charge.. For all the shit we get I think we&#39;ll be the ones to finally do something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I graduated 2010 like I said my age puts me in direct conflict. 26-29 ur Olds right now are struggling. It&#39;s so hard to date.. I meet a girl even 2 years younger than me and I can&#39;t get them off their phones/social media. I don&#39;t want to date a wannabe Instagram model that needs constant attention. I keep having so many failed relationships just because these young woman have a constant, incessant need for attention and to be entertained.. And I&#39;m OK with doing nothing and just enjoying time together.. But than they get bored and want to be on their phones, running around being a hoe.. It&#39;s rough being on the precipice of this divide and very few people understand this plight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are not going backwards to begin with, only forwards, faster and more than what we deal with now. so these people become addicted to it, so these people become dumbed down by it, incapable of saying no for some reason like sugar and bacon, so this so that... so what?   </p>

<p>people who cant adapt will fade in history, but people who can will just come forward and take their place and flourish as always. where is the problem?</p>
