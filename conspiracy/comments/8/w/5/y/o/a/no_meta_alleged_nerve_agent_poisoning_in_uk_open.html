<hr/>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44719639">BBC</a>, UK defense research facility has confirmed that the Wiltshire couple was poisoned by the so-called Novichok nerve agent which was also blamed for the Skripal incident several months ago. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to use this post to gather evidence and sources about the alleged poisoning. I&#39;ll update this post to include links gathered in the thread. </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s at the top of all the Usual Suspect Websites.</p>

<p>Pretty intense coverage for a 40-something year old couple who (apparently) were initially suspected of opioid/ cocaine use.</p>

<p>Also pretty amazing that they found and detected the &quot;Russian Nerve Agent&quot; so quickly.</p>

<p>So basically after the first Novichok incident got so much coverage, the guys who do chemical analysis were prepared to look for it in future poisoning cases.

<p>There is a difference between a <strong><em>LIE</em></strong> and misconceptions based on fragmented information in an unfolding story.</p>

<p>Lies are intentional attempts to deceive, misconceptions/ misunderstandings are unintentional.</p>

<p>That said, thanks for the link. It demonstrates how little is known about both the present case and that of the Skripal incident, and that the &#39;conclusions&#39; assigning blame in the Skripal case were based more on speculation and conjecture than on any firm, substantial evidence.</p>

<p>QUOTE:</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said they could not confirm whether the nerve agent came from the same batch but the possibility was &quot;clearly a line of inquiry&quot;.</p>

<p>His officers are examining the couple&#39;s movements to determine where they were poisoned.</p>

<p><strong><em>So far no contaminated items have been found and the police say they have no idea what the nerve agent was contained in.</em></strong></p>

<p>Security minister Ben Wallace said: &quot;The working <strong><em>assumption</em></strong> would be these are victims of the consequences of the previous attack or something else but not that they were directly targeted. That could change.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>END QUOTE</p>

<p>With no container and no traces of the (alleged) substance having been found, one must presume that the determination that the substance in question was indeed Novichok must have been reached by one of two other methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>By examination of blood/ urine/ tissue samples taken from the victims, or;</p></li>
<li><p>That the SYMPTOMS presented were consistent with Novichok poisoning</p></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>If it be the former, do lab tests exists that can conclusively identify Novichok, while excluding other potential chemicals? If so, I have been unable to find evidence of such tests. A link would be appreciated.  </p></li>
<li><p>If it be the latter, are there no other drugs/ chemicals or combinations thereof that might produce similar symptoms? If so, what specific symptoms would be specific to Novichok?</p></li>

<p>This is complete speculation from an Australian scientist, whose credentials I have no reason to doubt, but clearly has no firsthand knowledge of the investigation. </p>

<p>I also came across this from May which states</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands — 4 May 2018 — In response to questions from the media, the OPCW Spokesperson stated that the OPCW would not be able to estimate or determine the amount of the nerve agent that was used in Salisbury on 4 March 2018. The quantity should probably be characterised in milligrams. However, the analysis of samples collected by the OPCW Technical Assistance Visit team concluded that the chemical substance found was of high purity, <strong>persistent and resistant to weather conditions.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is interesting to me in that it seems to contradict what we were told earlier. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/novichok-nerve-agents-russias-dangerous-new-poison/a-42957812">DW interviewed Dr. Michelle Carlin</a>, a toxicologist at the Northumbria University in Newcastle, Great Britain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When Novichok agents get into the environment, they pose a danger only for a limited time period. &quot;<strong>When the nerve agents interact with the moisture in the atmosphere, they actually degrade.</strong>&quot; Also, one can wash the compounds off with water.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this contradiction can be explained in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dr Carlin is incorrect in her assessment of Novichok agents&#39; resistance to moisture</li>
<li>The substance was not a Novichok agent</li>
<li>or the sample collected by OPCW on or after March 21 was a Novichok, but was not placed there on or before the March 4 poisoning of the Skripals</li>

<p>Under what possible pretense?

<p>Could it be because the &quot;classified&quot; information does NOT supply the evidence that it claims to supply?</p>

<p>How is Novichok differentiated from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/tradesecrets/problem/popup_group_05.html"><strong>OTHER organophosphate chemicals</strong></a> when biological samples are taken?</p>

<p>More lies. The BZ analysis came from an accredited lab in Spiez (Switzerland), not Russia. </p>

<p>The fact remains that the Skripals&#39; symptoms and their &quot;miraculous&quot; recovery fit BZ poisoning far more closely than Novichok.</p>

<p>at a meeting of the OPCW executive in The Hague, the Russian claim was refuted by OPCW officials, who said explained that BZ had been used in the control sample, not the sample itself. It is also a breach of OPCW procedures to identify a laboratory involved in a test.</p>

<p>there was no reason for russia to try and kill him, if they wanted to they had him in their own fucking prison they could have done it long ago. hes got no new info to share and had been traded for people who did.</p>

<p>there are the rumors seirgei was actually talking to putin and trying to be allowed to return to russia and he was concerned about the british inteligence and his safety.</p>

<p>IF they wanted to kill him, why would they use a substance that would immediately make them a prime suspect? why not Vx or sarin? why not just hit him with a car or shoot him in the head.</p>

<p>now assuming they had a reason, and wanted to use novichok to make a point, why use it so fucking ineffectively that an incredibly lethal substance with a leathal dose measured in mirco grams would you not use enough to actually kill a weakened old man or a young woman?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanna preface I’m not trying to come off like a jerk. I just have a few issues regarding your statement. </p>

<p>The term novichok is used for a number of nerve agents produced by usssr and now Russia.  If you truly did the research you’d know that they all have some similar properties as well as some differences. </p>

<p>Remember when Kim’s cousin or stepbrother was killed with vx. Remember how they needed both women. That’s because it’s a binary agent. Meaning you need to combine 2 relatively harmless chemicals to create these nerve agents. The LD50 for these compounds vary in a number of ways. Some are more effective through inhalation while others are more effective through contact with the skin. So in order to pull this off you need the right mix, with the right chemicals in which you want it to be delivered. Other factors play a role in the effectiveness as well such as climate conditions, proximity to the agents, etc. furthermore there have been numerous cases of scientists working with these agents who have been exposed to them and survived although it fucked them up for life. 
As for nerve agents they don’t stop the lungs from functioning. They block the chemicals in the brain to relax the muscles. So it’s the diaphragm that stops functioning causing asphyxiation. Cardiac arrest can also occur as you said. 
As to your comment about the guy not having a clue, if you look at the 2 most recent incidents regarding the polonium and the first novichok poisoning it was very obvious the people running the op were amateurs. The left their finger prints everything (finger prints as a figure of speech)</p>

<p>Regarding Isis being capable of making it I guess is possible but your comment about it being easy to make is untrue.  This isn’t like cooking up meth. All those compounds are pretty complex and need specific precautions. But if they are they would need help and resources from Russia as they’re the only ones producing these novel nerve agents. To me this seems highly unlikely and doesn’t fit their M.O.  </p>

<p>With regards to the people who were “contaminated”. There have been some conflicting reports so I’m gonna wait till more evidence turns up before I come to a 100% conclusion. But if they were poisoned by a nerve agent, weather it was from earlier contamination or if they were targeted, the most likely explanation would be Russian activity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so I’ll be as clear as I can. The US, the UK and the rest of the world signed a treaty that prevents countries from buying precursors to make nerve agents. It’s very strict and international observers make sure that all countries are following the guidelines. The US and its allies still have stockpiles of VX and other assorted chem/bio weapons. These are stored and scheduled to be destroyed. </p>

<p>The term novichok is a Russian word used to describe novel nerve agents that can use chemicals not on the banned list. Currently Russia has a number of novichok agents. You know how we know?  Russian scientists told the world a while ago.  I don’t mean to be crass but for someone who claims they did all the research into novichok, I think that research wasn’t all that rigorous. </p>

<p>So let’s say someone wants to make a nerve agent, let’s say Isis. 1. They can get it on the black market which is a lot harder than making a phone call. 2. They can purchase the chemicals to make the nerve agent.  All of these precursor are strictly regulated world wide so it would be extremely difficult to purchase them on the open market and like I said this isn’t cooking up meth. You can’t just whip up some VX in your kitchen. 
And 3. What the fuck am I blatantly lying about?  It looks to me I laid out some decent discussion points while you laid out nothing but ad hominems and other logic fallacies. </p>

<p>Add to the conversation man. It’s a lot more fun and interesting. </p>

If you use lower level people like those polonium schmucks it’s a lot easier to control the narrative in their end. Also take into consideration how bold russia has become in the last decade or so. It seems like they stopped giving a fuck because there were never any consequences for any of the shit they pulled. They’re relishing this.

    <div class="md"><p>oh im well aware of russia and its poking. the problem i see is that this doesnt fit that MO, russia used to vlad will poke but he is precise when he does. this imho is far too sloppy (maybe hes suddenly gotten brain cancer who knows) </p>

<p>Vlad is consistent, and frankly if you ignore these rather suspect (imo frame jobs), he has otherwise maintained his traditional actions. i mean the US has been trying to start shit with russia for a long time with little to no retaliation for decades so i guess its possible hes all of a sudden ready for a fight (imo that is a lot more terrifying if its true because it means hes got an &quot;i win&quot; button ready)</p>

<p>from the big scale geopolitical side of things the US is about to see a serious decline in influence/power. the new silk road project and the developing beast that is china are about to make ocean control a lot less important and quite possibly shifting the need for trans oceanic trade in general if the land route gets the investment it needs.</p>

<p>russia sees this and is less and less concerned with the US and its threats when it has already solidified a great relationship with china. (in some sense it looks like russia is set to become chinas canada, its in a similar position with raw natural resources)</p>

<p>given that reality there really isnt a reason to pick a fight with the US or assassinate old spies in the UK when they are about to head in to a golden age for their empire.</p>

<p>on the flip side the old king of the hill has every reason and desire to try and meddle with russia/china to maintain their own position.</p>

<p>Not true at all. Can you name these &quot;credible experts&quot; who aren&#39;t in some way employed by the UK government or MoD?</p>

<p>On top of this, why on earth would Russia poison an ex spy they literally handed over as part of an exchange years ago? Why would they use such an old and highly ineffective nerve agent? Have you seen what real nerve agents do to people? The Skripals have made a full recovery! It&#39;s laughable. Now we&#39;re supposed to believe that some heroin addict picked up a used needle to shoot up and that needle contained the nerve agent?! Oh my god, is this a joke or do people believe this?! Heroin addicts can get needles from pretty much every pharmacy. Believe me, I have had many friends who were addicted to H and they always got clean needles and if they re-used, it was their own needles, not some shit from the trash on the street.</p>

<p>It all seems too easy for the UK gov to point the finger at Russia to benefit their own narrative and theatre. Theresa May is using this as a distraction. <em>Keep the public in fear, point the finger at Russia, don&#39;t question the government, don&#39;t examine or criticise domestic issues. We need WAR.</em> Red Scare 2.0</p>

<p>Boris Johnson was apparently misremembering his conversation or misrepresenting it in that interview in order to convince the public that there were experts backing the government&#39;s accusations. But you were misinformed by a lying politician and a completely uncritical press. Unless there are other experts that investigated? Which you could cite?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So to be clear, the conversation has shifted from &quot;all reliable experts agree it was Russia&quot; to &quot;could have been Russia because of motive&quot;.</p>

<p>Okay. Let&#39;s talk motive.</p>

<p>It really makes no sense for Russia to do this:</p>

<p>Sergei was discovered to be a spy and arrested in 2004 and convicted of espionage and high treason. 
<a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/696505">relevant article</a></p>

<p>Seems to me, that would have been a decent time to kill him without pissing off any other countries.</p>

<p>He was imprisoned in Russia until 2010 when he was released as part of a prisoner exchange.
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/09/russian-spies-swap-us">relevant article</a></p>

<p>They had him in captivity for 6 years, plenty of time to kill him however publicly or secretly they&#39;d like. He&#39;s been doing nothing particularly interesting for 7 years and suddenly he&#39;s poisoned.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what Russia has to gain by poisoning a 66 year old ex-double-agent 14 years after they originally arrested him. Seems like they had loads of opportunities to secretly disappear him without causing an international incident.</p>

<p>So what motive are you referring too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all subterfuge. Too many anti-Russian stories from the last day or two suggests to me it&#39;s no coincidence and this is more likely a stage-managed intelligence black op. <a href="https://imgur.com/ClNESiR">My news feed yesterday</a>, before this poisoning became big news, was chock-full of the Anti-Russian narrative organised by the controlled mainstream media. It&#39;s very clear what&#39;s going on, even if they are just taking advantage of an &#39;accidental&#39; poisoning to push this narrative, I&#39;m just not sure where it will all lead. Will something else happen before the end of the World Cup in mid-July? Are they psychologically preparing the public for a false flag chemical attack, now that the precedent has been set of two random members of the public being poisoned and not just Russian state spies? I don&#39;t believe Novichok is the culprit because you should be dead within ten minutes of contact without an antidote, perhaps it&#39;s another chemical weapon let loose by British intelligence agents from Porton Down?</p>

<p>This operation was given the royal seal when Prince Charles and Camilla <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-5873693/Prince-Charles-Camilla-visit-Salisbury-city-boost-following-nerve-agent-attack.html">visited the site</a> on June 22nd, Salisbury is very near to the ancient solar worshipping site of Stonehenge, June 22nd was the day after the Summer Solstice so perhaps there is a ritual element to this as well. The Skripals were allegedly poisoned on March 4th, exactly four months later July 4th as the World Cup in Russia is in full swing, we have this poisoning apparently caused by haphazardly dumped leftover Novichok from the comically bad bungling &quot;Russian assassins&quot;. I don&#39;t buy that, I think this is a deep deep state operation from the top, executed by their lackeys in British intelligence and the media to perpetuate Russia narrative. It more likely came from Porton Down up the road, British intelligence will have spies working there with the means to smuggle out poisons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s up in the air. I don&#39;t think FSB assassins directed by Putin with a specific target in mind (Skripal) would be so unprofessional to just leave a syringe of Novichok lying around. That does not fit with the establishment&#39;s narrative of wanting to &quot;send a message to traitors&quot; as accidentally killing random members of the public is clearly not in Putin&#39;s interests. This to me suggests perhaps it was either an anti-Putin Russian group who are not as experienced in assassination and handling chemical weapons (hence the lack of effectiveness on the Skripals) and wanted to frame Putin, or British intelligence agents specifically picked two easy targets in a couple of drug addicts. One is already dead and the other may not make it, this suggests they have come into more invasive contact with the poison than the Skripals who made remarkable recoveries. Novichok cannot survive for months on end exposed to the elements on a fifty pound note or something like that. It had to be contained in something like a container or syringe; do heroin addicts make a habit of picking up any old syringe from the street with unknown substances in and going, &quot;Oh YEAH! Let&#39;s inject that shit right now! Or maybe we could just empty it and fill it with our own shit, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Are they that stupid? Maybe. Or maybe a British spy who is part of the operation in Salisbury and was instructed to escalate the ongoing operation by finding some poor saps to poison, they find the two drug addicts passed out in a park and just shove a needle filled with the stuff in their arm or whatever. Who knows, I&#39;m not buying the narrative the establishment and its lackeys in the media are forcing down our throats though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep i concur with your thinking....but i&#39;m also thinking the chemical didn&#39;t need to last, as it might have been two separate attacks by the same actor. the fact it is two couples that have been attacked smacks to me of someone with a grudge/hatred. they might have not even known the others were russian. the fact two chemical research/weapon facilities are so near to both incidents is surely the biggest clue of all. we shall see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you mean, I suppose it&#39;s possible it&#39;s just one random psycho from Porton Down staging two separate attacks on couples who irked him somehow. I do think the coincidence is too great that an ex-Russian spy was targeted for it to have not been some kind of intelligence tradecraft, especially with how it aligns with the Russian boogieman narrative of recent years. Maybe it&#39;s a mixture of both, the bad actor from Porton Down may not be aware of why he&#39;s doing it, some kind of MKULTRA going on? </p>

<p>We shall see for sure, the lack of a strong response from British government on two of their people being poisoned tells me there is more to come with this.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t decide whether to go down to the Trump protest in London on Friday to watch the drones march against the &quot;Russian puppet&quot;... should be interesting, maybe there&#39;ll be some fuckery.</p>

Intentional targeting also explains why he didn&#39;t get sick for so many hours after she did and refutes the theory they both got into a container holding the poison.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-44719639"><strong>Quoting the BBC:</strong></a></p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Chemical weapons expert Richard Guthrie said <em>it was possible</em> that the couple came across the Novichok which poisoned the Skripals after it had been disposed of &quot;in a haphazard way&quot;.</p>

<p><strong><em>However, Vil Mirzayanov, the Russian scientist who first exposed the Novichok programme, cast doubt on the theory, saying Novichok would have decomposed in the four months since the Skripal attack.</em></strong></p>

<p>He told the BBC this must have been a separate incident because <strong><em>Novichok was unstable, especially in damp conditions.</em></strong></p>

<p>So yes, it would seem that <strong><em>&quot;If&quot;</em></strong> is definitely the operative word here.</p>

<p>If Porton Down identified a specific compound, such as A-234, to be present, why have they not said so explicitly? Why are they inaccurately describing Novichok as a nerve agent (singular) rather than as a class of related organophosphates?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I can tell, the name &quot;Novichok&quot; itself first came from Mirzayanov, the Russian (at the time, Soviet) scientist who currently resides in the US. That the name we in the West now know the chemicals by is inaccurate does not in itself invalidate the possibility that the Soviets actually developed incredibly toxic nerve agents. </p>

<p>Is psychological warfare being undertaken? Almost certainly. Does that mean that the Russian government or agents thereof have not used nerve agents against a former spy, and now apparently UK citizens? No, in itself, it does not. Western media spinning a convenient media narrative and Russian agents actually using a real nerve agent are not mutually exclusive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect that Mirzayanov is the only source that designates that angent as novichok.  Despite being regarded as a developer of this agent, from what I know, he wasnt even part of that program which ended in 1988. May be novichok is a casual name or a jargon term. </p>

<p>Being Russian,  I can tell that here in Russia the Skripals case is viewed differently. Given that Scripal did spend a few years in Russian prison, there was no point killing him in Britain as a traitor. If it was done in order to send a message to would be Russian  defectors (very far fetched), that would was a wrong time (risk of world cup boycott and new sanctions)  and a wrong place.  And the properties of novichok are not quite certain. I heard some say (prob Mirzoyanov himself) that the reason Skripals survived was damp weather that is novichok degrades in himidity fast. Others claim that novichok is very long lasting. </p>

<p>If there is a strong chance that novichok isnt detected in bodies, the message with a dead Russian spy is still clear with all fingers pointed at Russia and the British intelligence and the police working doing their best to identify the course of death. Worth the risk? I doubt it. </p>

<p>The second incident is beyond comprehension. </p>

<p>I see all these poisoning as filled with horror, medieaval mystisism and supernatural. Like in the Name of the Rose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The diplomatic expulsions of Russians by multiple countries show otherwise. If Russian agents are behind these attacks the expulsions seem an appropriate response. But until we know more about this new couple or how and where they were poisoned these two cases hardly prove the Russia can do whatever they want. As a casual observer looking in on these poisoning cases it reminds me of the Anthrax scare of 2001.  When anthrax was sent to various US media members and Senators in sept 2001 it was initially thought to have been terrorism related - that is Al Qaeda or Iraq. It wasn&#39;t until years later that we found out it was likely an insider who commited the poisoning.  It could very well be a similar situation today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. But this may simply show that no one is certain of the culprit though leaders like Trump or May have to act or be seen as weak. Considering there has been no evidence provided it was in fact Russian actors there is little that really can be done beyond souring diplomatic relations and tough talk. It&#39;s not much but it&#39;s not nothing and considering all we are going off of is a hunch that it is Russia behind the poisoning Im not sure what else should be done. By the way I&#39;m not saying Russia is completely innocent but there should be some evidence provided before assigning guilt and taking action. Similarly Iraq could have been behind the Anthrax attacks in 2001 but IMO evidence should be given before further actions are taken.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it&#39;s always useful to learn what MSM says isn&#39;t true.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/novichock-poisoning-amesbury-wiltshire-conspiracy-theories-salisbury-truth-facts-russia-a8432541.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/novichock-poisoning-amesbury-wiltshire-conspiracy-theories-salisbury-truth-facts-russia-a8432541.html</a></p>

<p>So from this, we learn that</p>

<p>an unrelated couple miles away with no connections to the original incident had exactly  the same symptoms, probably because they visited the same area where the original agent was &quot;used&quot; but where that are was deemed &quot;safe&quot; <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/amesbury-poisoning-latest-novichok-skripal-salisbury-wiltshire-victims-russia-a8431711.html">link</a></p>

<p>This is ripe for conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>No connections.  They just happened upon the area?  They just happened to find the same container?  With no evidence of visiting the original contaminated site?  With no known political motivations against them or from them?</p>

<p>According to Al Jazeera, Russians believe that the novichick agent was a setup by the West to blame Russia <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/conspiracy-theories-rife-russia-sergei-skripal-poisoning-180313080229802.html">link</a></p>

<p>There are some suggestions that this was actually polonium, which has very different implications.  <a href="http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2018/03/08/a-poisoning-in-england-but-which-poison">link</a></p>

<p>As recently as 2016 Dr Robin Black, Head of the Detection Laboratory at the UK’s only chemical weapons facility at Porton Down, a former colleague of Dr David Kelly, published in an extremely prestigious scientific journal that the evidence for the existence of Novichoks was scant and their composition unknown.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, there has been much speculation that a fourth generation of nerve agents, ‘Novichoks’ (newcomer), was developed in Russia, beginning in the 1970s as part of the ‘Foliant’ programme, with the aim of finding agents that would compromise defensive countermeasures. Information on these compounds has been sparse in the public domain, mostly originating from a dissident Russian military chemist, Vil Mirzayanov. No independent confirmation of the structures or the properties of such compounds has been published. <em>- Source: Robin Black, 2016, <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/chapter/9781782622413-00001/978-1-84973-969-6/unauth">Development, Historical Use and Properties of Chemical Warfare Agents</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Further, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The Scientific Advisory Board] emphasised that the definition of toxic chemicals in the Convention would cover all potential candidate chemicals that might be utilised as chemical weapons. Regarding new toxic chemicals not listed in the Annex on Chemicals but which may nevertheless pose a risk to the Convention, the SAB makes reference to “Novichoks”. The name “Novichok” is used in a publication of a former Soviet scientist who reported investigating a new class of nerve agents suitable for use as binary chemical weapons. The SAB states that it has insufficient information to comment on the existence or properties of “Novichoks”. <em>- Source: The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, <a href="https://www.opcw.org/documents-reports/conference-states-parties/third-review-conference/">OPCW: Report of the Scientific Advisory Board on developments in science and technology for the Third Review Conference 27 March 2013</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The OPCW was so sceptical of the viability of novichoks that it decided – with US and UK agreement – not to add them nor their alleged precursors to its banned list. In short, the scientific community broadly accepts Mirzayanov was working on novichoks but doubts he succeeded.</p>

<p>If they exist at all, Novichoks were allegedly designed to be able to be made at bench level in any commercial chemical facility – that was a major point of them. The only real evidence for the existence of Novichoks was the testimony of the ex-Soviet scientist Mizayanov.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One should be mindful that the chemical components or precursors of A-232 or its binary version novichok-5 are ordinary organophosphates that can be made at commercial chemical companies that manufacture such products as fertilizers and pesticides. <em>- Source: “Dismantling the Soviet/Russian Chemical Weapons Complex: An Insider’s View,” Dr. Vil S. Mirzayanov 1995 - <a href="https://amazon.com/State-Secrets-Insiders-Chronicle-Chemical-ebook/dp/B001U3YUU2">Available for $8 on Amazon</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a scientific impossibility for Porton Down to have been able to test for Russian novichoks if they have never possessed a Russian sample to compare them to. They can analyse a sample as conforming to a Mirzayanov formula, but as he published those to the world twenty years ago, that is no proof of Russian origin. If Porton Down can synthesize it, so can many others, not just the Russians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And finally, Mirzayanov is an Uzbek name and the novichok programme, assuming it existed, was in the Soviet Union but far away from modern Russia, at Nukus in modern Uzbekistan. I have visited the Nukus chemical weapons site myself. It was dismantled and made safe and all the stocks destroyed and the equipment removed by the American government, as I recall finishing while I was Ambassador there. There has in fact never been any evidence that any “novichok” ever existed in Russia itself. - <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/03/the-novichok-story-is-indeed-another-iraqi-wmd-scam/"><em>Source: Craig Murray, British Ambassador, Uzbekistan, 2002-2004</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re seeing the 5 Eyes work together to make sure the war machine keeps lining pockets and granting power. For fuck&#39;s sake reddit, aren&#39;t ANY of you tired of 50+ years of war?</p>

<p>Edit: Even better, According to the government line in March:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Professor Robert Stockman, of the University of Nottingham, said traces of nerve agents did not linger. He added: These agents react with water to degrade, including moisture in the air, and so in the UK they would have a very limited lifetime. This is presumably why the street in Salisbury was being hosed down as a precaution – it would effectively destroy the agent.&#39; <em>-<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5492781/Scientist-reveals-horror-lethal-nerve-agent-Novichok.html">Source</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6053960/ex-russian-spy-sergei-skripal-saved-by-rain/">rain affecting the “novichok” on the door handle was given as the reason that the Skripals were not killed</a>. </p>

<p>But now, magically, <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1014627105022197760">these agents can linger in high humidity and rainy environments for months</a> - something that would be quite unique, at least in my 6 years of training in the USAF as a NBC Instructor, to learn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Novichok is an nerve agent and is a different recipe of an organophosphate.  They all have a persistency and can be detected.  They are not hanging around in a gas form, they are similar to an liquid/oily form.  That period you just passed...  if it was physical VX it would be lethal to about 20 people in an average sized room.<br/>
They are all deadly and will kill you, if you are unprotected.  If you are properly trained, wearing minimum Level B protection (Splash and respiratory) have effective detection monitors, you can enter a hot zone, identify the agent, locate it, and render it null.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There we go, the resident novichok expert. As far as I know they haven&#39;t located any of it in the wild, and russian chemical weapons experts have stated that there were a number of variants developed which could be deployed in a number of ways, but you&#39;re right that it&#39;s probably not in a gas form. What they seem to be saying is that it is possible that this organophosphate could be in the form of a powder which would collect in low-lying areas like a heavier-than-air gas but more persistent. It could then get into your body, through breathing, through ingestion, or through the skin. Not every chemical agent only comes in certain specific forms, like Novichok which apparently was engineered specifically to be more hard to detect and protect against. Not everything is cookie cutter simple like they taught us in ABC training.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve read is that it was designed to be handled safely more toxic as VX, as resistant to treatment as soman, and more difficult to detect and easier to manufacture than VX capable of being delivered as a liquid, aerosol or gas via a variety of systems it is stable with very low evaporation rate.
It was designed in the 1970s to be undetectable using standard 1970s and 1980s NATO chemical detection equipment.  The ICAMS and new JCAD have been developed within the last 10 years with knowledge of Novichok, thanks to the Germans acquiring a sample in the 90s.
I am not an expert, I was just an ICS certified Hazardous Materials Specialist, Decon Unit Leader, Safety Officer, Incident Commander, Instructor with DHS training for Rail, Radiological, Chemical, and Terrorist Bombing response.  I was on a dedicated Hazmat Team in S.California for 8 years, during an 18 year career in the Fire Service.

    <div class="md"><p>After 9/11 and WMD threat that was manufactured about Iraq or the &#39;white powder/anthrax&#39; scare that occurred, there was a sudden influx of money for training for first responders with the treat of Nerve Agents.  Remember the movie &quot;The Rock&quot; with the threat of S.Francisco being bombed with nerve agents?  Well when you look at the big picture, the use of WMDs by terrorists just seem so improbable.  The cost to develop and then to disperse it effectively?  The Japanese Doomsday cult came closest to making it happen, they killed a couple of dozen people and injured about a thousand other.  Even then it was a hokey affect.
Terrorists, if they even exist, would be a lot more effective just standing in a Mall with a semi automatic weapon during Christmas shopping.  Or lighting all the forests on fire in California.  WMDs are just too expensive and have to be a government entity to make/use them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have concluded days ago that the couple was targeted. The agent was applied to the door handle of his apartment, probably two times. Neither of them showed symptoms until entering the apartment. First, the girlfriend arrived, let herself in, and then they went for a stroll. She was stricken shortly afterward and sent to hospital.  Boyfriend goes out for several hours with a friend, comes back to the apartment, gets the second dose by opening the door. Shortly after arrival, he is stricken, but nothing happens to the friend. Report in the Daily Mail July 9 says nerve agent was detected on only one hand of each victim. This would conform to the door handle theory.  No one is asking the question of whether both victims became ill in the same period of time once entering the apartment. If those times match, that would go a long way to proving contamination happened at the apartment. As to WHY anyone would target this couple, the most logical reason would be to take focus off of Russia as the culprit for the first attack.  The next reason is a little further afield: Somebody is extorting the government and demanding a huge payoff to stop the attacks. And the final reason is the scariest of all: A lunatic is on the loose.</p>

<p>Wnen it&#39;s the first time that you encounter a sample and want to figure out its composition it takes a lot of time and effort to fully characterize the sample.</p>

<p>So basically after the first Novichok incident got so much coverage, the guys who do chemical analysis were prepared to look for it in future poisoning cases.

    <div class="md"><p>The diplomatic expulsions of Russians by multiple countries show otherwise. If Russian agents are behind these attacks the expulsions seem an appropriate response. But until we know more about this new couple or how and where they were poisoned these two cases hardly prove the Russia can do whatever they want. As a casual observer looking in on these poisoning cases it reminds me of the Anthrax scare of 2001.  When anthrax was sent to various US media members and Senators in sept 2001 it was initially thought to have been terrorism related - that is Al Qaeda or Iraq. It wasn&#39;t until years later that we found out it was likely an insider who commited the poisoning.  It could very well be a similar situation today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think what was more amazing was how they instantly detected novichok when skripal got poisoned and had everything on hand ready to deal with the poisoning of this exotic nowhere used poison that apparently only russia has LUL and its so deadly that they were both fine with no damages whatsoever sometime later.. k cool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Novichok is an nerve agent and is a different recipe of an organophosphate.  They all have a persistency and can be detected.  They are not hanging around in a gas form, they are similar to an liquid/oily form.  That period you just passed...  if it was physical VX it would be lethal to about 20 people in an average sized room.<br/>
They are all deadly and will kill you, if you are unprotected.  If you are properly trained, wearing minimum Level B protection (Splash and respiratory) have effective detection monitors, you can enter a hot zone, identify the agent, locate it, and render it null.  </p>
