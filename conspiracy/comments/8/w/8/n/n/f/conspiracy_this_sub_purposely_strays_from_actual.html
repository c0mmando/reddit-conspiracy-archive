<p>It&#39;s more than just one thing. Emotion is a big factor. So is karma/upvotes. People post marginal content all the time looking for upvotes. What gets upvotes?</p>

<p>Anything that provokes a strong emotional reaction. Stuff that makes you afraid or angry is really great.</p>

<p>So if you don&#39;t believe me, go to the front page and look to see how many of the top posts are about something that&#39;s scary or pisses you off. Then look to see which posts have the most upvotes. The pattern should be easy to see.</p>

<p>Well thought out posts about stuff that makes you curious (but not very emotional) tend to get very few upvotes. Posts that don&#39;t use emotional language in the title usually don&#39;t do as well as the ones that do.</p>

<p>If it was me, I&#39;d experiment with eliminating the karma system completely and replacing it with something else. Perhaps a composite score based on how many posts and comments you&#39;ve made, word totals for each, the age of your user account etc.</p>

<p>Do this and watch what happens to the front page and watch how fast &quot;popular group opinions&quot; evaporate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It also destroys conversations in my opinion, and it has been used for that purpose in the past.  It is fine if there are only like 4 chains of comments, but when you get 20+ of them it makes it difficult to come back after a while to see how people are responding.  Everything is randomized and it makes it more difficult to determine where the new comments are.  It has its uses, but in large threads it makes for difficult discussions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been obvious since the 1960&#39;s.</p>

<p>The entire term has been dedicated to debunking conspiracies at least since the JFK assassination - possibly much longer:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#Etymology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory#Etymology</a></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to John Ayto, the phrase conspiracy theory was originally a neutral term and acquired a pejorative connotation only in the 1960s, with an implication that the theorist is paranoid.[13] Lance deHaven-Smith has suggested that the term was deployed in the 1960s by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to discredit John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories.[14] Robert Blaskiewicz rejects such claims, asserting instead that the term has always been derogatory and pointing to examples demonstrating that this has been so since the nineteenth century.[15][16]</p>

<p>Regardless of how you feel about the truth of any of these things, it&#39;s clear that the establishment and CIA&#39;s talking points are getting a major boost. The left leaning bias of the attacks indicates many of the manipulators are probably associated with Soros money, although that is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1dz470/most_reddit_addicted_city_over_100k_visits_total/">far from the only form of shilling going on here</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence of that at all. Surveillance tape indicates two people were with Rich when he was shot, but that doesn&#39;t mean they conspired to kill him. They may have conspired to rob him but we don&#39;t even know that – one of them may have just spotted Rich and gone to rob him and the other guy tagged along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">shill handbook</a>. It explains, in great detail, the methods of the shills. Once you become familiar with them, you will understand not only the tactics used (how to spot the shills) but come to appreciate the strategic aims of shilling operations at a higher level (how to see an agenda being pushed on society).</p>

<p>Once you understand those concepts, you can start working on formulating <a href="https://reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vm2g1/effective_tactics_to_combat_organized/?st=jj4qbhqg&amp;amp;sh=46b6feab">tactics</a> to combat the shills. These should center around a firm understanding of the goals and limitations of the enemy (i.e. most of the shills are bots or stupid humans).</p>

<p>But the most important thing to understand is the importance of crafting such a compelling message that the shills can&#39;t touch you. This begins with having a good idea, but also requires a thorough understanding of meme magic (how to package the message so that it catches fire).</p>

<p>This is so hilarious. I&#39;ve never been paid or told to post anything anywhere but I regualrly get accused of being a shill simply because I require credible evidence for a conspiracy. The notion that this sub is considered important enough by &quot;the powers that be&quot; to actually try to influence the threads is just more conspiracy creation by people with delusions of grandeur. The vast majority of the planet, including politicians, intelligence agencies, and billionaires, couldn&#39;t care less about what conspiracy theorists are getting excited about.</p>
