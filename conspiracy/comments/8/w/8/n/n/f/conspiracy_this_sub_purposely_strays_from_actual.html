       isnt it obvious? 
what with fake users, bots, incendiary trolls mudslinging for both sides in the comments, it becomes blatantly apparent that the agenda here is to discredit actual conspiracy theories, defame their proponents, and reframe them as crackpot incel redpillers.

       Conspiracy theories have been politically weaponized.

       ever notice how obama was attacked WITH conspiracies, and trump used them against his enemies?
      </p>
      <p>
       and now many of what we would call 'conspiracy theories' are attacking trumps enemies?

      <p>
       is this a coincidence or is this some roger stone/realpolitik/win-at-all-costs style smearing of opponents with the conspiracy community used as a tool?

       They will use the term "fake news" to censor all information that coflics with any official narrative.  Eventually no one can post a conflicting thought on any major social media without a disclaimer saying it's for entertainment purposes only and a work of fiction.

       It's more than just one thing. Emotion is a big factor. So is karma/upvotes. People post marginal content all the time looking for upvotes. What gets upvotes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that provokes a strong emotional reaction. Stuff that makes you afraid or angry is really great.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you don't believe me, go to the front page and look to see how many of the top posts are about something that's scary or pisses you off. Then look to see which posts have the most upvotes. The pattern should be easy to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well thought out posts about stuff that makes you curious (but not very emotional) tend to get very few upvotes. Posts that don't use emotional language in the title usually don't do as well as the ones that do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was me, I'd experiment with eliminating the karma system completely and replacing it with something else. Perhaps a composite score based on how many posts and comments you've made, word totals for each, the age of your user account etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do this and watch what happens to the front page and watch how fast "popular group opinions" evaporate.

       If we did that,  we wouldn't be able to use the upvote patterns to spot outside brigades.  I like it when they pile in here unnaturally like 27 clowns in a Volkswagon and make themselves and their agenda fabulously obvious.

       It also destroys conversations in my opinion, and it has been used for that purpose in the past.  It is fine if there are only like 4 chains of comments, but when you get 20+ of them it makes it difficult to come back after a while to see how people are responding.  Everything is randomized and it makes it more difficult to determine where the new comments are.  It has its uses, but in large threads it makes for difficult discussions.

       It's been obvious since the 1960's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire term has been dedicated to debunking conspiracies at least since the JFK assassination - possibly much longer:

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         According to John Ayto, the phrase conspiracy theory was originally a neutral term and acquired a pejorative connotation only in the 1960s, with an implication that the theorist is paranoid.[13] Lance deHaven-Smith has suggested that the term was deployed in the 1960s by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to discredit John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories.[14] Robert Blaskiewicz rejects such claims, asserting instead that the term has always been derogatory and pointing to examples demonstrating that this has been so since the nineteenth century.[15][16]

       ConspiracyII is more about conspiracies. Here people are anti conspiracy for some reason. But there is also a ton of dumb shit on here like the is prince harry and his wife a robot, many posts about it, and literally a 5 second google shows they were wearing wax masks but a ton of people bought it.

       It wasn't always this bad. It wasn't even this bad during the election. Best I can gather is something that was showing up here more regularly started to scare them so they felt they had to drown it out.

       Q is the biggest conspiracy that has happened in a long time and this place HATES it....well, the downvotes show that it's hated.  The funny thing is, if you click on the users that are the most vocal detractors, they're from r/politics, r/worldnews, etc.

       You can't prove to me that the Bible is fake, but it says every other religion is fake but it.. Somebody has to be lying here but we don't know who. Q is much easier to dissect, take your blinders off for 2 fucking seconds and you'll become self aware enough to realize you are being played.. Again. Probably happens to you alot though.

       No, I'm trying to conserve the genuine discussion that used to take place here, not turn this in to another echo-chamber like those other subs are. That's why the upvote/downvote count matters. Especially when someone makes a comment that receives dozens of downs and no replies whatsoever.

       There are a lot of people who view conspiracy theory boards as a place to purposely push right-wing smears with not a shred of truth. I think it's healthy to try to root those out by exposing the lies, so real conspiracies can be discussed.

       There is definitely not a shred of evidence pointing to one. But there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       plenty of lies from the far-right trying to make it look that way, like the lying Fox News story or the lies from Kim Dotcom or the lies from 4chan claiming he was taken to a secret hospital or whatever. I would think most people on a conspiracy theory message board should get very angry being blatantly lied to like that. This is supposed to be a place where people cut down to the truth, not one where they get to spread lies to suit their political agenda.

       Well, they did say it was a robbery, with no robbing. They did say he was DOA, but then it was reported he was alive in the hospital. But I'm not going to do your work for you, because I don't work for you and you see what you want to see.

       They said it was a
       <em>
        botched
       </em>
       robbery, where the robber fled before taking anything. Which is incredibly common especially in high crime areas, and which all the available evidence points to.

      <p>
       Also no one
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       said he was DOA, not sure how you came across that one. The DNC said in its statement that he was taken to a hospital, where he died. The police said the same thing. I've seen a lot of misinformation regarding Seth Rich, but this is the first time I've seen this particular one.
      </p>

       I definitely notice "I'm not going to do your work for you" is the last refuge of a person who knows there is absolutely no substance to their argument and doesn't want to get exposed any further.

       I agree that the conspiracy related to Seth Rich's death is more about how right-wing echo chambers have crafted the story into a political weapon despite no evidence of it. But I don't think that contradicts my original point that there's a lot of right-wing nonsense people try to post and it's not a bad thing to expose it.

       It could have been a politically motivated killing, I guess. Or he could have been killed by the New York Yankees because he knew
       <em>
        too much

       about plans for their farm system. Or he could have been killed by Somali pirates, probably a paid hit.

       There's no evidence of that at all. Surveillance tape indicates two people were with Rich when he was shot, but that doesn't mean they conspired to kill him. They may have conspired to rob him but we don't even know that – one of them may have just spotted Rich and gone to rob him and the other guy tagged along.

       Read the
       <a href="http://stopsprayingus-sf.com/shill-handbook/">
        shill handbook
       </a>
       . It explains, in great detail, the methods of the shills. Once you become familiar with them, you will understand not only the tactics used (how to spot the shills) but come to appreciate the strategic aims of shilling operations at a higher level (how to see an agenda being pushed on society).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you understand those concepts, you can start working on formulating
       <a href="https://reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vm2g1/effective_tactics_to_combat_organized/?st=jj4qbhqg&amp;amp;sh=46b6feab">
        tactics
       </a>
       to combat the shills. These should center around a firm understanding of the goals and limitations of the enemy (i.e. most of the shills are bots or stupid humans).
      </p>
      <p>
       But the most important thing to understand is the importance of crafting such a compelling message that the shills can't touch you. This begins with having a good idea, but also requires a thorough understanding of meme magic (how to package the message so that it catches fire).

       This is so hilarious. I've never been paid or told to post anything anywhere but I regualrly get accused of being a shill simply because I require credible evidence for a conspiracy. The notion that this sub is considered important enough by "the powers that be" to actually try to influence the threads is just more conspiracy creation by people with delusions of grandeur. The vast majority of the planet, including politicians, intelligence agencies, and billionaires, couldn't care less about what conspiracy theorists are getting excited about.

       Thread has archive and sources that seem legit. It’s not just this sub but many other subs and websites.

       They don’t care for what people get excited about but throw some much disinfo and bs it becomes unusable in anyway for people being serious about a subject.

       Kudos for sticking around with disappoinment that long, if kudos can be alotted. I was intrigued when I first got here, it's not a sub to encourage anymore, it's a sub that comments get deleted and censored over if it doesn't fit the "running, group approved flavor of topic".

       I'm under the belief that social media is the real cause behind the widening rift behind left and right.  People wouldn't be so cemented into their political identities if they still talked face to face.  Now all that remains of the discourse is the need to stand up for your chosen team no matter what.  What's happening here is just a symptom of that, and it gets worse every year.

       I think opinion molders and purveyors were just figuring how much of a hub Reddit and this sub in particular  were for an  alternative source of info and influential it was becoming for destroying narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It definately played a part in destroying Hillary Clinton's narratives and helped in the opposition against her to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, they are doing their best to stop any opposition to mainstream political thought. There is just too much money and power to lose if people continue to lose faith in government and its institutions that are clearly failing. So, any belief they deem to far right or left needs to be discredited

       The very term conspiracy theory was invented by the CIA in order to discredit anyone who questions the status quo.

       Right wing stuff is fine, it's the totally fake stuff like Seth Rich and Pizzagate that gets to me. What's the "pro communist" stuff you're talking about? Can you give me a couple examples?

       You can't prove to me that the Bible is fake, but it says every other religion is fake but it.. Somebody has to be lying here but we don't know who. Q is much easier to dissect, take your blinders off for 2 fucking seconds and you'll become self aware enough to realize you are being played.. Again. Probably happens to you alot though.
