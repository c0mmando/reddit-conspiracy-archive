       Pretty interesting and is not unimaginable considering the other things government health agencies have done in the past. 
I have to say tho, that my first inclination was that anyone taking part in a clinical trial is likely being tested more often than anyone else.  So if they were first to be diagnostic, is something should expect to see.

       Don't you think after showing you the extent of evident deceit and unethical behaviour displayed by the filmmakers it is a rather weak comeback to claim, without credible evidence, that every scientist who criticizes the film must have been bribed?

       I can understand if his occasional use of ridicule isn't your thing. I too think sometimes it's detracting from the essential message he's trying to convey (like when he's making fun of someone's last name).
       <br/>
       However, it's simply false to say he never cites any facts. On the contrary.
       <br/>
       Just one of
       <em>
        many

        <em>
         mid sentence
        </em>
       </a>
       to fit their bullshit narrative.
That's not just "his opinion", that's fact, and it's disgustingly dishonest.
       <br/>
       All-in-all he quite effectively rips this *cough*acclaimed documentary*cough* apart. (and yes

       Because "initial images" implies other images (of which there are many), which obviously doesn't fit their narrative so they cut out the word.

       Ad hominem is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

       I should preface this by saying that I for one subscribe to the HEP B vaccine mishap idea. Whether it was an intentional attempt to destroy the gay population that backfired, or was simply a mistake that caused the virus to jump species, that's up for debate.

       "Does HIV exist?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the biggest crock of shit I've ever seen on this subreddit. I myself have HIV (medicated, undetectable viral load for 8 years now). My personal doctor, Brian Conway [Order of Canada], is a veteran and pioneer in the field of HIV/AIDS research and treatment, and he and I have had innumerable lengthy discussions about the virus, the history of treatment, and the future of treatment. It's a very well understood virus, and the methods for treatment are very sound and well-established/tested.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is this: if HIV doesn't exist, as the first "rabbit hole" post suggests, then what is wrong with me? Do I just have "the gay"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further...
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was my immune system failing me?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why, when I went on drugs solely designed to inhibit the reproduction of the virus inside me, did my immune system spring back slowly, to a point now where I feel no adverse affects from the infection?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do doctors find copies of HIV RNA, part of the method of how HIV replicates itself, in my bloodstream? So many that they use this detection to measure one's infection-state? They must just be lying about them being there, because HIV doesn't exist!
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically enough, research is showing that, myself people a part of the studies, people who were infected young and started treatment very quickly tend to rebound, and their immune system is actually somewhat stronger than it was pre-infection. More on that if you're curious later.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is there to be gained if people "pretend" HIV exists? Millions of people keep dying because of "something". And that "something" "somehow" gets treated by specific medicines very effectively. Hmm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked my doctor about this "researcher". The researcher in these interviews is part of very small group of angsty twats who just want to cause a fuss, but not actually do anything to help people with HIV. Nobody in the field actually acknowledges or respects them or their work, they're absolute rejects. All they have is "we've never seen a picture of it!!!" Yeah, and nobody saw a picture of an actual atom until last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       When there's overwhelming evidence for something existing, and we have ways to measure its presence, treat it, and literally save lives, but we can't actually see a photo of it, it must be a farce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck off.

       You, of all people, should know the difference between aids and hiv.  Aids happens all over the world, affecting primarily starving people and chronic drug users.
      </p>
      <p>
       HIV is the fabricated cause of aids, created so that they could sell their viral cancer treatments, which fell through when no cancer virus was found.  So instead of going the straight and narrow route and abandoning the investment, they fabricated an aids-causing virus to treat with their very expensive and poisonous drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you've been getting treated more recently, you have the benefit that they've refined the dosages so that it kills you more slowly, instead of quickly and dramatically, like it did in the 80's and 90's.

       There's nothing funny about it.  You, thousands of doctors, and billions of people, Africans especially, have been swindled by one of the largest marketing shows ever put on by the CDC.
      </p>
      <p>
       When a doctor, or random Joe Blow on the street claims to have sequenced or observed big hiv rna, and you question them a bit further, the conversation breaks down into lies, hypotheticals, guesses, and other tricks to dance around the fact that they don't even know what the hell they're looking at, or what it actually does.  And often, they'll break down with something like "well, I didn't see it myself, but someone showed me a picture of what he said was such and such."

       But I'm not here to stop you.  If you want to believe in santa clause too, just because some authority told you about him, go for it.

       No, as somebody who has to deal with this the rest of his life, and has in turn spent countless hours doing research and being a PART of research, your idiocy is amusing to me. How you are so assured that you're "in the know" about something you know nothing about is amusing. I've come to terms with my diagnosis. Shit like this is just comedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I genuinely feel sorry for you that your entire worldview, your reason for being, is to "expose" shit that isn't even a thing. You've made up your mind that the whole world is out to get you when maybe, sometimes, things do just happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was an inside job, yes. JFK was an inside job, yes. There's a global child-sex-ring being run by the elites, yes. HIV may have been an inside job, it may have just been a mistake. But it actually exists regardless of how you interpret it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, you're clearly here to stop me. Difference is, if I stop taking the meds, I die. You know that, right? Oh, you don't know anything about the virus or treatment, I forgot. You just believe everything you read on the internet because it helps you feel more like a victim.

       I'm not going to unwind decades of an ongoing lie in a few Reddit comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have spent their entire lives studying lies before.  There are people who study the bible for a living even, and are just
       <em>
        so convinced
       </em>
       that it's true.  But it's not.

       I don't have aids, fortunately, so I don't say it from some "they're out to get me" mentality.  It's what I've concluded after weighing evidence from both sides of the argument.  I'm also fortunate to not be so emotionally invested in the topic that I

       hear the other side of it.

       According to your "source:" postulate #1 was fulfilled by PCR.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Regarding postulate one, PCR testing allows researchers to document cell-associated proviral HIV in persons with AIDS who have been tested (proviral DNA detection is a research test, not one of the common FDA-approved viral load tests)."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem here: the guy who created the PCR technique, Dr. Katy Mullis, says it cannot be used to determine if HIV exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       "PCR technology evolved quickly since it was introduced in 1983 (25). Although being employed, mostly, for assessing viral load (less for screening and diagnosis), it should give us pause to learn, however, that Dr. Kary Mullis – the scientist who won the 1993 Nobel Prize for inventing the PCR test and whose quote introduced this article (Table ​(Table1)1) – has strongly opposed using the technique for determining the amount of virus circulating in plasma. Lauritsen explains:
      </p>
      <p>
       Kary Mullis … is thoroughly convinced that HIV is not the cause of AIDS. With regard to the viral-load tests, which attempt to use PCR for counting viruses, Mullis has stated: “Quantitative PCR is an oxymoron.” PCR is intended to identify substances qualitatively, but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers. Although there is a common misimpression that the viral-load tests actually count the number of viruses in the blood, these tests cannot detect free, infectious viruses at all; they can only detect proteins that are believed, in some cases wrongly, to be unique to HIV. The tests can detect genetic sequences of viruses, but not viruses themselves [(29), p. 3].
      </p>
      <p>
       If to this picture we add human endogenous retroviruses (or HERVs) (30) as potential confounders, the genetic sequences detected in a PCR test may not be those from an exogenous virus, at all, and may explain the test’s substantial false-positive rates (18, 27)."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172096/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172096/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If PCR cannot detect virus, then postulate #1 has not been completed. If #1 is not completed, #2-4 are not as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In other words, the first step in the effort of isolation of a retrovirus is the demonstration that:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The particles seen in the cultures band at 1.16 gm/ml;
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In the 1.16 gm/ml band there is little present but the particles;"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "No apparent differences in physical appearances" between particles are seen.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This has not been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The evidence for the existence of HTLV-III was "viral isolation" and ELISA antibody tests. Even if one assumes that the data presented represents "true isolation", the virus was isolated from less that half (10/21) of AIDS patients with opportunistic infections, and in less than one third (13/43) with Kaposi's sarcoma, then and now the two most characteristic AIDS diseases. Even if the virus could have been isolated from all patients, given the nature of retroviruses and the method used for HTLV-III isolation (cultures, mitogenic stimulation, co- cultivation) the possibility cannot be excluded that the virus did not exist in vivo (in AIDS patients), and that it was a provirus whose expression was facilitated by the culture conditions. The only method used to prove HIV infection in vivo was the antibody tests. Such a test can only be used only after its specificity has been proven by use of the only possible gold standard, the virus itself. This has not been done."

       In other words, the "virus" was not isolated or found in all AIDS patients (in fact less than half) thus it once again fails Koch's #1 postulate.

       Which link are you referring to? The first is a page dedicated to stories by those who have never taken the toxic HIV drugs and have led healthy lives or those who have stopped taking them and have gone on to lead healthy lives. The second link is to multiple sources with verifiable proof to the HIV/AIDS deception.

       If you are going to criticize what I shared, how about being more specific. What was slanted? Who is the moron with a YouTube degree (whatever that is) in Virology? What evidence do you have backing your claims or are these your own opinions you are attempting to pass off as facts? Your debunk attemot was weak. Try harder bud.

       Ahahaha the Perth Group is at it again. Oxidization of semen... That’s the flimsiest argument I’ve heard yet.  Most of this was just them denying that HIV exists, and their “science” was just guesses. No actual work was done at all. If you’re really willing to believe that a handful of cumshots in your butt are enough to give someone AIDS because a few bigots from Australia said so, you need some serious help. It’s just homophobia dipped in shoddy pseudoscience.

       Care to show how they are wrong or do you just normally laugh off information you don't agree with? Cry foul on the source? Here is a source that agrees semen is immunosuppressive:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The immunosuppressive effects of human seminal plasma are mediated by several factors. The prostaglandins (PG) of the E series (PGE and 19-hydroxy PGE) predominate and raise intracellular cAMP in leukocytes. By this mechanism they suppress lymphocyte proliferation, natural killer (NK) cell activity and are likely to modify cytokine release from antigen presenting cells (APC)."
      </p>
      <p>

        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/8582962/

      <p>
       "If you’re really willing to believe that a handful of cumshots in your butt are enough to give someone AIDS because a few bigots from Australia said so, you need some serious help."
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked why gay men "get" HIV outside of drugs. Semen through anal or oral sex would be another cause besides amyl nitrates. Both are oxidizing agents which weaken immune response. That is why HIV never took off and spread outside certain risk groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       "What about straight people? Drug users? Children born with HIV from their parent?"
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous factors all linked to lifestyle. HIV among straight people who are not drug users is not common. Drug users is obviously due to the immunosuppressive effects of the drugs being used. The same can be said of kids "born with HIV" who have been dosed with toxic antiretrovirals while in the womb and then immediately put on the toxins upon birth even though they show no signs of ill health.
      </p>
      <p>
       "That, and the “Perth Group” is a group of known denialists who have been entirely rejected by the scientific community for their poor work and clearly malicious intent."
      </p>
      <p>
       Care to back this up with any proof? Sounds more like your opinion than fact. It wouldn't be surprising, however, to find that groups like the Perth Group who think outside the established medical orthodoxy to be ridiculed by the Big Pharma/CDC backed "science" institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Koch's postulates are considered the gold standard a disease causing agent must pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       "For two centuries, Koch’s postulates have set the gold standard for establishing the microbiological etiology of infection and disease."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775492/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3775492/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you believe that these postulates which have stood for centuries are not sufficient, please explain why there is no standardized HIV test and what must occur before a test can be standardized.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The primary tests for the diagnosis of HIV infection are two antibody tests, the ELISA and Western blot, and a genetic test, the PCR or “Viral Load” test. However, the ELISA and Western blot tests only detect antibodies against what are erroneously accepted to be HIV proteins or antigens. Similarly, the PCR or Viral Load test for HIV only detects copies of fragments of RNA that have arbitrarily been regarded as the nucleic acid of HIV. None of these tests detect the HIV virus itself, nor do they detect HIV particles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pharmaceutical corporations that manufacture and commercialize these test kits acknowledge the inaccuracy of the tests. This explains the seemingly surprising statement included in the kit inserts: "Elisa testing alone cannot be used to diagnose AIDS, even if the recommended investigation of reactive specimens suggests a high probability that the antibody to HIV-1 is present" (Abbott 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       The insert for one of the kits for administering the Western blot warns: "Do not use this kit as the sole basis of diagnosis of HIV-1 infection" (Epitope Organon Teknika).
      </p>
      <p>
       In like manner, the insert that accompanies a very frequently used test for PCR Viral Load warns: "the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test is not intended to be used as a screening test for HIV or as a diagnostic test to confirm the presence of HIV infection" (Roche 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the pharmaceutical drug manufacturers acknowledge the fact that neither the ELISA, nor the Western blot, nor the Viral Load tests for HIV are specific to diagnosis HIV infection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, the only valid method of establishing the sensitivity and the specificity of a diagnostic test in clinical medicine is to compare the test in question with its gold standard. The only possible gold standard for the HIV tests is the human immunodeficiency virus itself, HIV. Since HIV has never been isolated as an independent, free and purified viral particle, it is not possible to properly define either the sensitivity or the specificity of any of these tests. Currently, the sensitivity and the specificity of the tests for HIV are arbitrarily defined, not by comparison to purified HIV itself, but by comparison of the tests in question with the clinical manifestations of AIDS, or with T4 cell counts. This explains why Abbott clearly states: "At present there is no recognized standard for establishing the presence and absence of HIV-1 antibody in human blood. Therefore sensitivity was computed based on the clinical diagnosis of AIDS and specificity based on random donors" (Abbott 1997). Since there is no gold standard for defining the specificity of the tests used for the diagnosis of HIV infection, all HIV-positive results for HIV infection must be considered false positives. Therefore no individual can validly be identified as either HIV-positive or HIV-negative.

       Your article is from 1987. Here is one from 2003 by Professor Emeritus Etienne De Harven showing why HIV has never been isolated in a scientifically acceptable manner:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, HIV has never been properly isolated, nor purified, and, consequently, the HIV/AIDS hypothesis has to be fundamentally reappraised (23, 24, 25, 30, 32).
      </p>
      <p>
       More precisely, without HIV purification HIV specific antigens could never have been rigorously identified (15). Still, so-called HIV antigens are instrumental in all the serological tests allegedly identifying specific HIV antibodies, ELISA, Western blot, and more recent rapid tests such as « Capillus », « Determine », and « Vironostika ». Recombinant DNA technology for « viral » antigens gives certainly purer products, but fails to confer the missing specificity. No surprise, therefore, that dozens of different medical conditions, including tuberculosis, malaria, leprosy, multiple blood transfusions, many vaccines, multiparity, etc. all give false-positive « HIV » tests (26).
      </p>
      <p>
       Retroviral particles have unquestionably been observed, not directly in AIDS patients, but in mixed, hyper-stimulated cell cultures (7). They most likely represent forced expression, in cell cultures, of human endogenous retroviruses (17), the hypothetical role of which, in the etiology of AIDS, has never been proved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The HIV particles, missing from the patients, were conveniently substituted by molecular « markers », because the HIV=AIDS hypothesis had to be saved at all cost ( see the Durban Declaration, 27), even at the price of scientific integrity (28).
      </p>
      <p>
       If AIDS were indeed caused by a retrovirus, how can we explain that 20 years of considerable research efforts, based exclusively on that single hypothesis, have failed to isolate the responsible exogenous retrovirus? Twenty years to end up with no curative treatment, no vaccine, and no verifiable epidemiological predictions…
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, time is pressing us to ask courageously the essential question i.e. is the HIV=AIDS hypothesis correct? Because it is possible to view AIDS differently, outside the field of infectious diseases, and outside the field of retrovirology (29). And in this perspective, that is loaded with optimistic predictions, all the difficulties encountered in attempted isolation and purification of the hypothetical HIV may find an extremely rational explanation. Indeed, doubts concerning the very existence of HIV are nothing new, and were expressed by several dissident scientists several years ago (30, 31). I completely share these doubts. Let us not forget the title of Peter Duesberg’s book (33) published in 1996 : “Inventing the AIDS Virus”…"

      <p>
       "Etienne de Harven M.D. is Emeritus Professor of Pathology, University of Toronto. He worked in electron microscopy primarily on the ultrastructure of retroviruses throughout his professional career of 25 years at the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York, and 13 years at the University of Toronto."

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, according to your source, HIV could not be isolated in all cases, thus failing Koch's first postulate once again:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been isolated from plasma in 6 of 7 patients showing clinical symptoms of a primary HIV infection."
      </p>
      <p>
       "In one case, virus could only be isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid but not from peripheral blood. Detectable viremia was transient and preceded the appearance of HIV specific antibodies. After cessation of acute symptoms, the frequency of HIV isolations was similar to that of asymptomatic carriers (23 and 26%, respectively). The role of the immune response in terminating detectable viremia remains to be established."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Koch's postulates need refinement and aren't entirely relevant in the age of science we're in. Bro"
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet they are still considered the gold standard Bro. You also ignored my question to you: if you don't accept Koch's postulates, then please explain why HIV tests are not standardized and what must be done in order for this to happen (hint: it involves isolating the virus which, gasp!, has yet to be done).
      </p>
      <p>
       "-And what of the kids who were born in the midst of the crisis?"
      </p>
      <p>
       What data do you have about these kids in your hypothetical? Do you know whether or not they were born to parents abusing drugs? Any sources on this?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Also, all of your information on HIV is at least 15 years old, things have changed. Science has changed. Your latest note is from 2003,"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well this is an outright lie. The info from Roberto Giraldo was from 2006. Instead of crying about the year (especially when you use a paper from 1987 for your argument) how about you attempt to debunk the information presented? It's obvious you can't otherwise you wouldn't cry about the source.

       If you want to believe you have a yet unproven in nearly 40 years of research virus, be my guest. This information is for those far more open minded than you. Continue taking poison and living in fear as that is what the medical cartel want so that they can keep squeezing every penny and ounce of life out of you that they can. The choice is yours.

Yeah okay sure, that's totally why millions of people died during the first wave of the AIDS crisis, yeah. They didn't take meds are were miraculou- wait, they all died. My uncle, for one. No meds, couldn't afford em.

       I love how you think there's an argument to be had. HIV is an well-known, well-treatable, and disappearing issue. Because of science and medicine, not crackpots refusing drugs because they just KNOW big pharma is out to get everyone this time too. I'm just humouring you to hear what shit you have to spew

       Alas, you dodged my proposal again, despite the repercussions it could have for you and the medical world. So humble~ You don't believe enough in your own "cause" to put your reputation and life on the line? Didn't think so, because you know it's got more holes than a bathhouse on Davie St

       You need to really brush up on your history bud. Early AIDS victims were gay men who died from Karposi Sarcoma and PCP Pneumonia brought about by rampant drug use including amyl nitrates and STD's from unprotected sex with multiple partners. Hence the reason it was called the "gay disease" early on. It wasn't until later that nearly 30 other conditions were lumped into AIDS and the introduction of poisons such as AZT and antiretrovirals that most people died.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They may have a point. Ninety-four percent of all AIDS-related deaths in the US occurred after the introduction of AZT, according to CDC statistics through the year 2000. And according to the University of Pittsburgh, the No. 1 cause of death in US AIDS patients today is liver failure, a side-effect of the new protease inhibitors."
      </p>

       <a href="http://aidswiki.net/index.php?title=Document:AIDS_Debate">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the report of the first 5 cases of AIDS to the CDC by Michael Gottlieb in June, 1981, he informed the CDC that "four had serologic evidence of past hepatitis B infection", "two of the five reported having frequent homosexual contacts with various partners", "all 5 patients had laboratory-confirmed CMV disease or virus shedding within 5 months of the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia", and "all five reported using inhalant drugs, and one reported parental drug abuse" (Gottlieb et al MMWR 1981; 30:250-252).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing in this report that could suggest a sexually transmissible germ as the cause for the new condition. Homosexuality has existed forever! The new circumstances around the people who were experiencing the collapse of their immune systems was the use of drugs by some members of the gay community in the USA and Europe, use that began in the late sixties and early seventies. The toxic nature of AIDS has been evident since the very first report of the new syndrome. There was no need to posit a microbe as the cause of this new toxic condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) decided, in an editorial note commenting upon Gottlieb’s report, that "the fact that these patients were all homosexuals suggests an association between some aspect of homosexual lifestyle or disease acquired through sexual contact and Pneumocystis pneumonia in this population" (MMWR 1981; 30:250-252).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even long before HIV was discovered and proposed as the cause of AIDS, the US Public Health Service decided upon the contagious nature of the new syndrome. On November 5, 1982 the CDC published "AIDS: Precautions for Clinical and Laboratory Staffs" (MMWR 1982; 31:577-580). Four months later the CDC, together with the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, recommended the prevention of AIDS as if it were an infectious and transmissible disease (MMWR 1983; 32:101-104). They decided that AIDS was infectious and sexually transmitted without having any scientific proof for it.

       That would be because HIV is still a hypothesis as it has never been proven to exist using scientifically accepted standards:
      </p>
      <p>
       "To analyse their constituents and to prove they are truly viruses, retroviral-like particles must first be purified. This is done by a process called density gradient ultracentrifugation, something that may sound complicated but which isn't. A test tube containing a solution of sucrose, ordinary table sugar, is prepared light at the top, but gradually becoming heavier towards the bottom. A drop of fluid from a cell culture is gently placed on top and the test-tube is centrifuged for several hours at extremely high speeds. This generates forces many thousands of times that of gravity and any tiny particles present are gradually forced through the sugar solution until they reach a point where their buoyancy prevents them penetrating further. For retroviral particles, this occurs where the density reaches 1.16 gm/ml, the point where the particles concentrate or, to use virological jargon, band. The 1.16 band can then be selectively extracted and photographed with an electron microscope. So, to prove the existence of a retrovirus one is obliged to:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Culture putatively infected cells.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Purify a sample in a sucrose density gradient.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Photograph the 1.16 band proving there are particles of the right size and form, and there is no other material.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Extract and analyse the constituents of the particles and prove they contain reverse transcriptase by showing they can make DNA from RNA.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Culture purified particles with virgin cells demonstrating that a new set of particles appears with the same morphology and constituents as the originals."
        </p>

      </ol>

       That's because your challenge is absolutely idiotic. I don't need you to do anything to prove HIV doesn't exist. I personally know people "living with HIV" who are living long, healthy lives without taking toxic drugs. There is so much evidence online of others doing the same. On top of that, there is the fact that HIV has never been proven to exist which is why it is still a hypothesis. You do whatever you want with your life. The proof for the non-existance of HIV is already out there whether you quit taking the meds or not. Your challenge is not needed bud.

       So if HIV isn't real, what compromised my immune system, and why did drugs designed to inhibit HIV replication specifically make it rebound? Answer that, please. I'm not a "typical HIV carrier", so I didn't contract it the ways these phonies think I had to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike any of you posting, I actively research (and am a part of studies about) HIV, and have an intimate knowledge of the field itself. Your "proof" is absolute nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these are spin-videos or articles designed to confuse and scatter. Literally none of them offer any real science, just conjecture and baited questions to make people jump to the conclusions that they want them to. These are the kinds of "sources" that lead people, like me a couple times today, to call people crackpots. "Well proven farce", okay, so why hasn't anyone caught on? At least a great number of well-proven conspiracies have a large following/knowledge base. All the "HIV doesn't exist" people have is "well I haven't seen a picture of it!" or "this doesn't fit one person's idea of what a disease is, so it doesn't exist!". The dude begging for Koch's Postulates is literally just saying "this one guy's general formula to determine a cause/root of a disease is the UNDISPUTED TRUTH" is absolutely clueless on his own.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are so certain that HIV is a myth, we can exchange information and sign the necessary binding documents, whereby I will stop taking my medicine and you will be held responsible for my death if such event occurs. By signing, and by your being correct, you could shake the world and save millions. Are you willing to do this?

       Did you read or watch anything posted above? Millions of people have "caught on" winning international praise. The doc who won the nobel prize for it is interviewed extensively, and Nicolson has testified on presidential and congressional committees about a dozen times.

       Ad hominem is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

       Ad hominem is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

       Must be the hardest disease in the history of man to catch. Either that or the theory is simply wrong and HIV is not the cause. This wouldn't surprise me personally because AIDS never spread from the original risk groups, ie it didn't spread like an infectious disease.

        We see a population of women who come to regular family planning clinics in Harare. About 30 to 40 percent are infected. The rate is much higher, of course, for women in the sex industry. In the one study, we try to help uninfected women to get their male partners to use condoms. We've been able to persuade people to use condoms far more than we originally thought we could. In fact, we've been able to get more than half the women in this category to do this.

       I never said she was a Denialist. Her study, however, proved the HIV = AIDS hypothesis is a lie.

       Why are you so concerned with downvotes bud? If you actually provide something valid to the conversation, maybe you won't receive one.

       I don't care about downvotes however downvoting someone you are talking to does hint at a lack of maturity.  If you can't be trusted with a mouse click how can anyone trust you with anything else?

       How did I imply it? I was referring to a 10 year study that proved the fallacy of the HIV=AIDS theory. Nowhere did I imply Padian is a denialist. It doesn't matter one way or the other as the results of the study speaks for itself.

       "Science doesn't prove things and you know it."

       So we are in agreement then that there is no proof that HIV causes AIDS, let alone that HIV even exists at all. Perfect! What was the point of your comment again?

       LOL, is there some rule regarding downvotes? You really believe my giving you a downvote in any way implies I am untrustworthy? Wonderful logic there bud! Or maybe I didn't agree with your comment and felt it added nothing to the conversation other than spreading false assumptions. You know what they say about assuming, correct?

       I was exposed to Hep C in 1976 and then contracted HIV in October of 1981 from a bartender at the Washington DC Eagle.  The tinnitus started in the late 70s and has just steadily gotten louder over the years to point now I can barely hear anything else.

       Pretty interesting and is not unimaginable considering the other things government health agencies have done in the past. 
I have to say tho, that my first inclination was that anyone taking part in a clinical trial is likely being tested more often than anyone else.  So if they were first to be diagnostic, is something should expect to see.

       Ad hominem is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.

       Ahahaha the Perth Group is at it again. Oxidization of semen... That’s the flimsiest argument I’ve heard yet.  Most of this was just them denying that HIV exists, and their “science” was just guesses. No actual work was done at all. If you’re really willing to believe that a handful of cumshots in your butt are enough to give someone AIDS because a few bigots from Australia said so, you need some serious help. It’s just homophobia dipped in shoddy pseudoscience.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about straight people? Drug users? Children born with HIV from their parent?
      </p>
      <p>
       That, and the “Perth Group” is a group of known denialists who have been entirely rejected by the scientific community for their poor work and clearly malicious intent. They’re the literal definition of crackpots, nobody cares about them, nobody takes them seriously.
