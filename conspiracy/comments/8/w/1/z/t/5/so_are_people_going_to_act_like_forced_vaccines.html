       Yes, anti-vax people are stupid liberals.  It's a sjw conspiracy.  Even if the lies were true and it somehow caused autism in 1 in 100 kids, that is still much better than the diseases they eradicated.  Let it die, bro.  This is a dangerous conspiracy to try and get people to stop using vaccines.

       When a disease stops circulating

       n, it’s considered
       <em>

       Polio was on track to be completely eradicated this year.  We're now seeing it crop back up in places it had been eliminated before.  This is a travesty because it's one of the easiest and cheapest vaccines to distribute and a truly insidious disease.

       Not all vaccines are bad but we should truly be wary of whats in them because it bypasses a lot of the bodies natural defences when you inject something straight into the blood stream
      </p>

       you are aware that a lot of polio vaccines were tainted with carcinogens? A lot of people got cancer off polio vaccines

       I'm not against formulating better vaccines or quality controls, but the planet is a giant petrie dish and vaccines are a necessary component to preserve the safety of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines in many cases expose you to small amounts of the disease to jumpstart your bodies natural defences in order to build an immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am empathetic to the argument we don't fully know what these things do to ourselves and the potential threat of abuse that comes with the centralization of entities who manufacture these vaccines, but these problems are addressable and the threat to public safety these diseases pose is high.  We didn't experience life on the frontier before vaccination, losing our children to what are now treatable diseases.  We havent lived through an outbreak of cholera or polio or the Spanish flu or the bubonic plague.  Vaccination has been a net benefit for society as a whole.

       That's a rather cynical view of the matter.  The government performed the research and licenses those patents at an incredibly low rate.  Getting vaccinations for a child costs $40 for an MMR.  It's not like they are price gouging the public.  Those fees offset the taxpayer liability to keep CDC running.

       We need the MMR's for sure.  We've seen outbreaks of mumps from anti-vax families hit public schools.

       The CDC isnt motivated by profit.  If they were vaccines would cost 100x more than they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Private corporations are motivated by profit, and that has caused a deleterious effect on your healthcare system on the whole.  It's unaffordable for nearly everyone in America but the exceedingly rich.  The fact we need a third party to provide insurance in order to afford treatment is a testament to that fact.  This is why a nationalized healthcare system is preferable as it takes away the motivation to profit on care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Implying the CDC is motivated by profits is a stretch, but the underlying issue of a for-profit healthcare system is simply an unfortunate reality in America.

       why do vaccines cost money. I see the arguments youre making but my point still stands, healthcare should not be profit driven, wether a private hospital or a government hospital, profits should not be sought after. Look into the cancer industry scam. Chemo earns billions. I can go on and on. You know what I am saying.

       I agree, I dont think healthcare should run by private, for profit corporations.  There is no profit in cures and vaccines, which is why governments are the only ones who hold patents on them as a matter of public safety.  That is an unfortunate reality of the world we live in, that is dominated by private, for profit corporations dictating the prices and the entire philosophy behind healthcare in this country.  This is why there is so much emphasis on palliative care instead of cures.  The CDC isnt a private, for profit corporations.  They get $11.1B in taxpayer dollars every year to operate.

       Not carcinogens.  Polio was created by breeding cultures in monkeys.  Unfortunately, a virus from the monkeys ended up in the vaccine.  Quite a few early formulations of Polio vaccine also contained SV40, which appears to cause cancer much in the same way HPV can.

       That's the danger of the anti-vax movement too.  If we allow diseases to mutate and our vaccines may become useless as we face the possibility of a new outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case though, an older vaccine allowed a strain to get through.

       If you don't vaccinate yourself and your children your a hazard to society and should be treated as such.

       While I agree with some vaccinations myself, a person's right to not vaccinate their child is exactly that: their right. If a parent chooses not to vaccinate their child for hepatitis B and their child ends up getting hepatitis B, then it's no one's fault but those parents. There's no one else to blame. However, if a child MUST be vaccinated and then develops a problem related to that vaccine, then there's a humongous lawsuit. Sure, vaccines eliminate some problems, but they create others, as with literally any other law/requirement of a government over its people.

       The problem is by not vaccinating you put other children and people at risk. There are people who cant get vaccinations for one reason or another and without herd immunity they're at a much greater risk.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're already seeing examples of this like the outbreak in Disney land a couple of years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just that your child might get hep B and it's your responsibility but someone else's child might. You have a responsibility to society and if you can't live up to that responsibility you should be punished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not vaccinating your perfectly healthy child who can get vaccinations is either evil or idiotic.
      </p>

       May as well just kill a child via lottery every now and then. The effect is the same.

       There are plenty of people not holding up responsibilities to their societies, be it vaccinations or anything else, and none of them are punished. One could say having a job is a responsibility, but yet I know a lot of people who refuse to work or they fake a disablement to get out of it. I have no opinion really, but if we should punish people for not upholding one responsibility, then we should punish all. Correct? I'm not saying you're right or wrong. This whole discussion is interesting.

       For sure. And for the record, yeah, they shouldnt be allowed to get away with that shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have rule of law for a reason. Not that I'm saying every law is just. But the concept of just law is real. Its definition just changes depending who you're talking to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like punish was a rather harsh word for me to use. Its not like I think we should imprison people en masse. Quite the contrary, prison should be avoided at all costs if there are other viable solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to advocate for some totalitarian regime is what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "punishment" in itself, perhaps a better word would be deterrent? But I guess that's just a perspective issue. Nah, punishment. Let's not mince our words. The punishment, I feel, should have the added effect of benefitting those harmed by whatever actions or inactions that someone is doing or failing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the vaccination issue. Don't vaccinate your child? Well then your child doesn't gain access to areas with lots of children. But then you have to be careful not to create a class of people. Total ostracism creates it own pile of other problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I think it should be mandatory. We should avoid at all costs letting our children die from these horrific diseases. My grandad lost 3 siblings before the age of ten. Do we want to go back to that? Hell no. But by that same token, we should avoid creating culture bubbles and promoting the creation of classes. Children shouldn't be removed from society. But if they pose a risk to others, in the form of death, well, what else can we do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry. But sure, we don't know the full range of risks from vaccinations. But after three generations they've had a net positive on human longevity. More people are alive than ever because of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads me, since this is the place for it, to a conspiracy. The vaccines are bad narrative could be a number of things.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Of racist dogma: "I just hate foreigners and vaccines are the reason a lot of them are alive today. We need a culling"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Of cold economic dogma "we simply cannot sustain the level of population. The quickest way to kill millions or billions of people would to bring back those big killer diseases of the past"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I had more but this stoned rant is getting out of hand and I've forgotten.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I mean. Is it that far fetched that there are forces in this world conspiring to kill 90% of the global population and ensure a longer lasting but smaller sized group of people survive? I mean. Its not an uncommon theory i don't think.

       I agree with you about vaccines, but it should be the goal of society to be productive... not to be employed.  Automation will cause more hardship than happiness if we have this outlook and yet it (automation and unenployment) will continuously become more prevelant.  Instead of automation profits going to those that just happen to own a business, it should be distributed to those that it replaces.

       Right.... I was talking specifically about people who find loopholes to get out of having a job so they can do nothing and still get paid by the taxes of working people. Please don't confuse that with someone who is forced out of a job involuntarily. I have all the sympathy in the world for someone who has a job and is a productive member of society, and then is replaced automation or just let go because the CEO made some bad financial decisions. You'll never see anyone in management take a cut in pay to prevent that from happening though.

       why do vaccines cost money. I see the arguments youre making but my point still stands, healthcare should not be profit driven, wether a private hospital or a government hospital, profits should not be sought after. Look into the cancer industry scam. Chemo earns billions. I can go on and on. You know what I am saying.
