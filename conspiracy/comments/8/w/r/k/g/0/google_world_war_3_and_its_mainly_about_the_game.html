       I'm speculating pretty hard here so take this with a grain of salt. But does anybody find it a little weird? I feel like it's something they're using to dilute the tension of World War 3 concerns. A few months ago World War 3 searches had spiked due to Donald Trump's air strike in Syria. Before the game was being released, you could find information about World War 3 being a real possiblity, albeit most of it seemed like it was fear mongering. Now, half of the results are about the game put out by the company The Farm 51. I know this probably sounds really dumb but I wouldn't put it past TPTB to do something like this to diffuse tension. Idk, what do you guys think? Am I just being paranoid? Probably.

       To me it's rather like the other way around. Since I can think i hear about this ww3 thing that doesn't even exist. In the whole of my life, I heard the term ww3 probably 100 times as often as I heared the term ww2!
Isn't THAT weird? Predictive programing at it's finest, so why would they suddenly want to change directions?

       I've heard about World War 2 a lot more then World War 3 to be honest. But I have seen World War 3 being talked about in many tv shows, movies and games. Predictive programming is real af and I believe Fortnite is part of that agenda. Getting all the youngsters to parachute down into a battle royale type of setting is only conditioning them for when the real thing happens. I'm tired and probably sound dumb but I can't help but theorize about this.

       I don't think Fortnite is about conditioning kids for war. There are so many other games that are way, way better suited for that task.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call of duty, medal of honor and all those rather realistic war games. They serve exactly the purpose you described, I think. BUT there is something going on in fortnite for sure as well. I played it for some time...
I played through silent hill 1, as a kid, alone in my room, in the dark. It's one of the most creepiest games ever imo. I played shooters and horror/ survival games of all sorts. Killing floor 2... Like the most intense ego shooter ever, you can't stay calm while playing it, but none of these games scared me as much as fortnite, which is a game aimed at children. There is no blood in the game, and nobody even gets hurt. If you get "killed" you just fall on your knees and some drone appears and beams you away, indicating it's just some sort of virtual reality for the charackters you control. And anyway, for some reason, it scares the hell out of me. I think it's partially caused by the sound design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ghost steps, some atmo noise sounding like somebody reloading a gun behind you and stuff like that, which always let your heart skip a beat, but that can't be all. Something going on, but I can't put my finger on it.

       I feel like when I play Fortnite I'm definitely more on edge then in other games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, etc. My hands get far more sweaty than usual, my heart pounds sometimes, and the footsteps and reloading, I know exactly how you feel. It's not like horror scary but more of an on edge type of scary to me. It really is something of a different breed and it's scary to think that this is one of the most played games out right now. When I play Battlefield or Call of Duty, I'm hardly ever on edge. Maybe it has something to do with only having one life in Fortnite compared to being able to respawn right away in the same instance of the game you're playing. Also, everyone is trying to be #1 in Fortnite so that could be a possibility as to why it puts me so on edge compared to other games.

       Yeah, probably playing into it as well, thought so too, but I suspect their is some additional psychological fuckery build in on top of that. (on purpose)
Did you ever notice any of those crazy visual bugs as well? Like the huge man in the heaven, when there is some random player displayed in real time instead of the skybox texture?
Or those stretched playermodels that sometimes seem to be zooming through the map at incredible speeds? Sometimes, when they zoom straight towards you they make a huge face apear, covering the whole of your screen for 2-3 frames so that it's almost impossible to see? There are some screenshots and videos of those bugs in case you never whitnessed... For some reason this shit scares me as well. maybe I'm just getting old, I don't know.

       I had a game YEARS back called atv off-road fury 2.  There was a glitch that terrified me. The game had a mechanic that launches you to the center of the map if you stray too far out of bounds of the free play world. But sometimes it would stretch you or your coop friend across the sky and that was terrifying

       That's exactly the kind of stuff I'm talking about. Didn't know other people feel the same about such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, falling of the edge of a map and seeing the map getting smaller very fast untill you can't see it anymore and there is only the infinite black vacuum left. That especially happens a lot when you create maps yourself. shudder
It's not even about the falling, it's about losing all connection to all "existence" and seeing the blackness growing so quickly around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or in 3d modeling software, when you accidentally scale up an object like 10000% and watch it grow in size real quick and you can't even stop it, because that rescaling needs all that cpu. You will only see one single polygon covering the whole of your screen, but just knowing that this means, the whole object would now be as big as your whole house can seriously make you think about, if maybe, you should pull the plug before the object explodes into real world and destroys your whole solarsystem. haha

       Only once I felt something like this without using a computer. When I was swiming in the ocean. Pretty wide outside. Just floating on the water surface and relaxing, when I suddenly became aware of the huuuge space below me. Just visualizing me being in the middle of this huge space made me panic and I swam for my life.
didn't even care for all stuff down their that could kill me, just the space.. :D

       Hahaha yeah man! I remember at one time, I just made it out of this hell'ish paralel world and was so happy that it's behind me now and I can ENJOY the "normal world" for a while now and then, no 10 minutes later, the fucking siren going of again. I was just like "nononononono, I CAN'T STAND THIS ANOTHER TIME AGAIN" jumped up and smashed that ps1 standby button hard. Just hearing that siren in this moment frightened me so fucking much, I really couldn't take it anymore. Otherwise I was a brave kid. lol

       Try infected mode on call of duty multiplayer. It's sort of similar to a mini battle royale, but instead of leaving the game after dying, a player joins the infected team, and is tasked with killing and infecting the remaining survivors. Short and extremely intense matches.

       The loomies have an 'in your face' approach, in that if they tell you what they're going to do to you first, then it's cool when they go ahead and do it.

       This WW3 psy-op theory of yours cakes up pretty well with that shit. Here, have an upvote.

       It's quite scary how powerful filter bubbles have become.

       Wow this was an enlightening video, thank you for this! I'm most certainly living in my own filter bubble. I never even thought about this before until now. From an ethics standpoint, I think personalizing my search results without my control, is screwed. I hope we can all get out of the "web of one" this guy talks about.

       WW3 is just a thing to keep everyone on tenterhooks. Too many people with too much to lose on all sides. If anything did happen it would probably be contrived now.

       I've heard about World War 2 a lot more then World War 3 to be honest. But I have seen World War 3 being talked about in many tv shows, movies and games. Predictive programming is real af and I believe Fortnite is part of that agenda. Getting all the youngsters to parachute down into a battle royale type of setting is only conditioning them for when the real thing happens. I'm tired and probably sound dumb but I can't help but theorize about this.
