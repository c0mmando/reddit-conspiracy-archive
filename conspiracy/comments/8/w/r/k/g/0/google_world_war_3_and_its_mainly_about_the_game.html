I feel like it&#39;s something they&#39;re using to dilute the tension of World War 3 concerns. A few months ago World War 3 searches had spiked due to Donald Trump&#39;s air strike in Syria. Before the game was being released, you could find information about World War 3 being a real possiblity, albeit most of it seemed like it was fear mongering. Now, half of the results are about the game put out by the company The Farm 51. I know this probably sounds really dumb but I wouldn&#39;t put it past TPTB to do something like this to diffuse tension. Idk, what do you guys think? Am I just being paranoid? Probably. </p>

Isn&#39;t THAT weird? Predictive programing at it&#39;s finest, so why would they suddenly want to change directions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>I&#39;ve heard about World War 2 a lot more then World War 3 to be honest. But I have seen World War 3 being talked about in many tv shows, movies and games.</em></p>

<p>Yeah I guess I consumed more <em>tv shows, movies and games</em> than books. :/</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Fortnite is about conditioning kids for war. There are so many other games that are way, way better suited for that task.</p>

<p>Call of duty, medal of honor and all those rather realistic war games. They serve exactly the purpose you described, I think. BUT there is something going on in fortnite for sure as well. I played it for some time...
I played through silent hill 1, as a kid, alone in my room, in the dark. It&#39;s one of the most creepiest games ever imo. I played shooters and horror/ survival games of all sorts. Killing floor 2... Like the most intense ego shooter ever, you can&#39;t stay calm while playing it, but none of these games scared me as much as fortnite, which is a game aimed at children. There is no blood in the game, and nobody even gets hurt. If you get &quot;killed&quot; you just fall on your knees and some drone appears and beams you away, indicating it&#39;s just some sort of virtual reality for the charackters you control. And anyway, for some reason, it scares the hell out of me. I think it&#39;s partially caused by the sound design.</p>

<p>Ghost steps, some atmo noise sounding like somebody reloading a gun behind you and stuff like that, which always let your heart skip a beat, but that can&#39;t be all. Something going on, but I can&#39;t put my finger on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like when I play Fortnite I&#39;m definitely more on edge then in other games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, etc. My hands get far more sweaty than usual, my heart pounds sometimes, and the footsteps and reloading, I know exactly how you feel. It&#39;s not like horror scary but more of an on edge type of scary to me. It really is something of a different breed and it&#39;s scary to think that this is one of the most played games out right now. When I play Battlefield or Call of Duty, I&#39;m hardly ever on edge. Maybe it has something to do with only having one life in Fortnite compared to being able to respawn right away in the same instance of the game you&#39;re playing. Also, everyone is trying to be #1 in Fortnite so that could be a possibility as to why it puts me so on edge compared to other games. </p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p><em>Maybe it has something to do with only having one life in Fortnite compared to being able to respawn right away in the same instance of the game you&#39;re playing.

<p>Yeah, probably playing into it as well, thought so too, but I suspect their is some additional psychological fuckery build in on top of that. (on purpose)
Did you ever notice any of those crazy visual bugs as well? Like the huge man in the heaven, when there is some random player displayed in real time instead of the skybox texture?
Or those stretched playermodels that sometimes seem to be zooming through the map at incredible speeds? Sometimes, when they zoom straight towards you they make a huge face apear, covering the whole of your screen for 2-3 frames so that it&#39;s almost impossible to see? There are some screenshots and videos of those bugs in case you never whitnessed... For some reason this shit scares me as well. maybe I&#39;m just getting old, I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a game YEARS back called atv off-road fury 2.  There was a glitch that terrified me. The game had a mechanic that launches you to the center of the map if you stray too far out of bounds of the free play world.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly the kind of stuff I&#39;m talking about. Didn&#39;t know other people feel the same about such things. </p>

<p>Also, falling of the edge of a map and seeing the map getting smaller very fast untill you can&#39;t see it anymore and there is only the infinite black vacuum left. That especially happens a lot when you create maps yourself. shudder
It&#39;s not even about the falling, it&#39;s about losing all connection to all &quot;existence&quot; and seeing the blackness growing so quickly around you.</p>

<p>Or in 3d modeling software, when you accidentally scale up an object like 10000% and watch it grow in size real quick and you can&#39;t even stop it, because that rescaling needs all that cpu. You will only see one single polygon covering the whole of your screen, but just knowing that this means, the whole object would now be as big as your whole house can seriously make you think about, if maybe, you should pull the plug before the object explodes into real world and destroys your whole solarsystem. haha</p>

<p>Only once I felt something like this without using a computer. When I was swiming in the ocean. Pretty wide outside. Just floating on the water surface and relaxing, when I suddenly became aware of the huuuge space below me. Just visualizing me being in the middle of this huge space made me panic and I swam for my life.
didn&#39;t even care for all stuff down their that could kill me, just the space.. :D</p>

I remember at one time, I just made it out of this hell&#39;ish paralel world and was so happy that it&#39;s behind me now and I can ENJOY the &quot;normal world&quot; for a while now and then, no 10 minutes later, the fucking siren going of again. I was just like &quot;nononononono, I CAN&#39;T STAND THIS ANOTHER TIME AGAIN&quot; jumped up and smashed that ps1 standby button hard.
