       The carrington event.

       There is little written about what happened in Siberia, and the rest of the world during this time, we weren't as widely connected, etc.

      <p>
       The carrington event caused it. How, who knows, but likely the original theory of massive amounts of electricity/plasma flowing onto the surface of the earth liquefying the ground/or some shit.

       I think the M/E fits in with shift of 2012 (ie. the end of the Mayan Calendar - Great Awakening/Unveiling). A shift happened in 2012. Some of us remember.

       I remember 2012 being a huge dissapointment, because nothing seemed to have happened. Anyway, how has any of this to do with cultural layer or the earth gathering mass or the carrington event in 1859?

       So you say, that 2012 was only the begining of the shift? The first people ever shifted in 2012 and the rest might follow sometime later? Couold live with that? :)

       Oh dude, don't be like that. You Come in and claim ME and 2012 mix perfectly with the  the carrington event 1859, cultural layers and the expanding earth theory, but you just won't tell how. There is nothing to reread (I did anyway, 3 times). You just said 
"Yeah this + 2012 shift and ME!" Nothing more. And now I'm supposed to understand, how the shift of human minds and ME have to do with mud building up. Please dude.

       Quoting the WP article here, for people who don't realize the expading earth hypothesis wasn't always as fringe as it is today.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1834, during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, Charles Darwin investigated stepped plains featuring raised beaches in Patagonia which indicated to him that a huge area of South America had been "uplifted to its present height by a succession of elevations which acted over the whole of this space with nearly an equal force." While his mentor Charles Lyell had suggested forces acting near the crust on smaller areas, Darwin hypothesized that uplift at this continental scale required "the gradual expansion of some central mass" [of the earth] "acting by intervals on the outer crust" with the "elevations being concentric with form of globe (or certainly nearly so)"

       That's what I don't get. Flat earth? all day long. hollow earth? Sure for in between. Expanding earth? What is this shit!? And that even though it's not even that much of a fringe cospiracy theory. It's just a geophysical hypothesis. I mean sure, in this sub, it's bad if it's not even a conspiracy theory, but most people are more like "Now you are going to far" if you are talking about it. It's a while back that I researched HE a little, but I always thought the evidence is pretty strong and it makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since this sub loves Tesla so much:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1888 Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky suggested that some sort of aether is absorbed within Earth and &gt;transformed into new chemical elements, forcing the celestial bodies to expand. This was &gt;connected with his mechanical explanation of gravitation.[6] Also the theses of Ott Christoph &gt;Hilgenberg (1933, 1974)[7][8] and Nikola Tesla (1935)[9] were based on absorption and &gt;transformation of aether-energy into normal matter.

       This is the first time I've looked into Carrington Event, and I gotta say, the more I think about it the more I like it. It's certainly a great primer for tampering things like Calendar switching.

       The other thing is the electrical nature of many of these buildings skeletons (iron rods/faraday cages, etc), they always have sometype of iron work/etc, it may have been added onto the houses after the event to stop electrical shock/buildup in random objects, etc.

       Feel free to make this a topic over in r/culturallayer I don't think this angle has been discussed there yet. Thanks!

       How would a CME cause a massive layer of mud to be deposited across such a vast area? What would it have triggered that would be able to be covered up?

       I... just explained my theory, on how the electrical connection caused the earths core to bubble out/expand in that area, making the ground "seemingly" grow, the liquification of the land let all the aquifers, etc to liquify and turn everything into a mud.

       This question is confusing me, the Carrington event triggered the mudflood, in regards to the second part of this question, I don't get what you mean? The mud covered things up?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not get this theory, that is fine, don't overthink it.

       My bad if I was unclear. I'm under the impression that this mud layer is more widespread than just Siberia but you can correct me if I'm wrong or mistaken about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the second part of my question... I guess what I was saying was that if it had been triggered by a CME in 1859 I personally would find it difficult to not have documentation of it in some manner. That's also with the understanding that it was more of a widespread event.

       Not shitting on the idea at all...just trying to logically think it out.

       Here’s a theory. We live in a giant garden. And, every eon they put down new soil over the old, to help things grow.

       I've thought of this. Like spreading compost. Maybe every couple hundred years they come to dump their biolitter, and snatch up the most ingenius peoples Earth has to offer (the Tartars being the last one).

       Or was the "Carrington event" nothing more than an official narrative?

       sexual assault story of young girl created &amp;amp; shared to stir anger, hate &amp;amp; fear among social media audience en masse, only to be debunked as a Kangaroo attack. Social conditioning of FAKE rape culture is watering down the REAL cases of sexual assault, harassment &amp;amp; rape. Where is the outrage?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script async src="
