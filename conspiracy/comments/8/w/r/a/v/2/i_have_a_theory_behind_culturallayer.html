<p>The carrington event caused it. How, who knows, but likely the original theory of massive amounts of electricity/plasma flowing onto the surface of the earth liquefying the ground/or some shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quoting the WP article here, for people who don&#39;t realize the expading earth hypothesis wasn&#39;t always as fringe as it is today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1834, during the second voyage of HMS Beagle, Charles Darwin investigated stepped plains featuring raised beaches in Patagonia which indicated to him that a huge area of South America had been &quot;uplifted to its present height by a succession of elevations which acted over the whole of this space with nearly an equal force.&quot; While his mentor Charles Lyell had suggested forces acting near the crust on smaller areas, Darwin hypothesized that uplift at this continental scale required &quot;the gradual expansion of some central mass&quot; [of the earth] &quot;acting by intervals on the outer crust&quot; with the &quot;elevations being concentric with form of globe (or certainly nearly so)&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I don&#39;t get. Flat earth? all day long. hollow earth? Sure for in between. Expanding earth? What is this shit!? And that even though it&#39;s not even that much of a fringe cospiracy theory. It&#39;s just a geophysical hypothesis. I mean sure, in this sub, it&#39;s bad if it&#39;s not even a conspiracy theory, but most people are more like &quot;Now you are going to far&quot; if you are talking about it. It&#39;s a while back that I researched HE a little, but I always thought the evidence is pretty strong and it makes sense.</p>

<p>Also, since this sub loves Tesla so much:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1888 Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky suggested that some sort of aether is absorbed within Earth and &gt;transformed into new chemical elements, forcing the celestial bodies to expand. This was &gt;connected with his mechanical explanation of gravitation.[6] Also the theses of Ott Christoph &gt;Hilgenberg (1933, 1974)[7][8] and Nikola Tesla (1935)[9] were based on absorption and &gt;transformation of aether-energy into normal matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I... just explained my theory, on how the electrical connection caused the earths core to bubble out/expand in that area, making the ground &quot;seemingly&quot; grow, the liquification of the land let all the aquifers, etc to liquify and turn everything into a mud. </p>

<p>This question is confusing me, the Carrington event triggered the mudflood, in regards to the second part of this question, I don&#39;t get what you mean? The mud covered things up? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bad if I was unclear. I&#39;m under the impression that this mud layer is more widespread than just Siberia but you can correct me if I&#39;m wrong or mistaken about that.</p>

<p>As for the second part of my question... I guess what I was saying was that if it had been triggered by a CME in 1859 I personally would find it difficult to not have documentation of it in some manner. That&#39;s also with the understanding that it was more of a widespread event.</p>
