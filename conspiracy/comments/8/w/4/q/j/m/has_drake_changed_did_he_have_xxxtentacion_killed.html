        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-07-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/legalxz32.html">legalxz32</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many of you may be aware, rapper XXXTentacion (X) was murdered a few weeks ago. He was known to have major beef with Drake, after accusing Drake&#39;s label of wanting to sign him and then stealing from his song &quot;Look at Me&quot; and using it for Drake&#39;s song &quot;KMT.&quot; Drake&#39;s label is known for stealing from artists, including Pharrell Williams (the root of the Birdman/Drake and Pusha T beef). X continued to beef with Drake for months making comments about Drake&#39;s mom, accusing Drake of wanting him dead, and potentially telling Pusha T about Drake&#39;s hidden child.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Drake 100&amp;#37; killed XXXTentacion, but there is too much evidence to ignore. It is strange that Drake is blatantly bragging about sending killers after someone in his songs. Drake&#39;s label owner Birdman was even accused of ordering a hit in 2015.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>#### XXXTentacions Warnings</p>

<p>- One of X&#39;s [last live videos](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB3eW2F30XM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB3eW2F30XM</a>) is him anticipating his death and basically saying goodbye to his fans.</p>

<p>- X also posted online that if anyone kills him [it is because of Drake](<a href="https://pics.me.me/xxxtentacion-8m-if-anyone-tries-to-kill-me-it-was-34208569.png">https://pics.me.me/xxxtentacion-8m-if-anyone-tries-to-kill-me-it-was-34208569.png</a>).</p>

<p>- X [made the music video](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAeYPfrXwk4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAeYPfrXwk4</a>) _SAD_ where he attends his own funeral, released after his own death.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>#### Supporting quotes from Drakes new album &quot;Survival&quot;</p>

<p>##### Im upset</p>

<p>This song was released just before XXXTentacion was murdered. It goes into detail about ordering a hit on &quot;Triple X&quot;.</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;m upset</p>

<p>&gt; Fifty thousand on my head, it&#39;s disrespect.</p>

<p>&gt; So offended that I had to double check.</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;ma always take the money over sex.</p>

<p>&gt; That&#39;s why they need me out the way.</p>

<p>&gt; What you expect?</p>

<p>This quote signifies that Drake is worried about having a hit on his head. Who could have put this hit on him? Why is Drake rapping about hits?</p>

<p>&gt; Got a lot of blood and it&#39;s cold.</p>

<p>&gt; They keep tryna get me for my soul.</p>

<p>This signifies that Drake is colder now than he used to be. He wants us to know he is ruthless and willing to lose pieces of his soul for revenge.</p>

<p>&gt; Niggas askin&#39; if I&#39;m cool...</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;m upset.</p>

<p>Drake is really driving home that he is upset and ready to do something about it.</p>

<p>&gt; You tryna check?</p>

<p>This is about someone trying to &quot;check&quot; Drake, which is a double entendre for challenging him as the king and also for accusing him of something (X said Drake stole his song _Look at Me_, X made accusations about Drake&#39;s mom, X may have told Pusha T about Drake&#39;s confirmed hidden child).</p>

<p>&gt; This is real life, niggas think we playin&#39; chess.</p>

<p>The is a threat about how this is real life and there are real repercussions (getting killed?) for trying to check Drake.</p>

<p>&gt; So what&#39;s next?</p>

<p>&gt; Jump up out the bed like I’m possessed.</p>

<p>Drake is acting like something evil took over him and made him do something in response to getting checked.</p>

<p>&gt; I go out on tour and I say I&#39;m drinkin&#39; less.</p>

<p>&gt; End up gettin&#39; loose and gettin&#39; pictures from my ex.</p>

<p>This is to add some plausible deniability to this verse by making it a double entendre. Yes, this verse can mean sending nudes to his ex. It also is about ordering a hit and having someone killed in a specific way.</p>

<p>&gt; x...x...x...</p>

<p>XXX is whispered in the background of the song (XXXTentacion?).</p>

<p>&gt; SMS, triple X</p>

<p>Double entendre. This is talking about sending sexual texts to his ex. &quot;SMS&quot; also can mean &quot;send my shooters&quot;. This is consistent with his other songs about sending shooters to kill people.</p>

<p>&gt; ...triple X</p>

<p>XXX. Yes, it means pornographic material... but it is also short for &quot;XXXTentacion&quot; who was murdered shortly after this song was released. Drake had major beef with XXXTentacion.</p>

<p>&gt; That&#39;s the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)</p>

<p>XXXTentacion was not just robbed, but was intentionally killed. The shooters that were hired to kill XXXTentacion pulled up to him, came up to his vehicle, and shot him multiple times below the neck. You can see in the aftermath video that there are no visible shots above the neck.</p>

<p>&gt; Why you keep on shootin&#39; if you know that nigga dead? (skrr).</p>

<p>&gt; That&#39;s the only kind of shit that gets you some respect.</p>

<p>Clearly not about sending nude texts. XXXTentacion was shot in the heart, that is why he did not bleed out significantly and instantly slumped after being shot. There was no major bleeding in the video of his deceased body slumped in the car. Witnesses saw him get shot below the neck/on the chest. Witnesses heard multiple gunshots. Lack of bleeding signifies that he was likely already fatally shot in the heart before the rest of the shots. At the very least the shooters knew he was sure to be dead due to the extent of the shooting. When you get shot multiple times in your center of mass it is typically because someone wants you dead, not just to rob you.</p>

<p>&gt; ...Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)</p>

<p>The only other parts of the song that use &quot;(Skrr)&quot; are in the verse about ordering the hit. A TEC is a TEC-9... an illegal semi-automatic pistol. Why does Drake want and have access to this? The gun was banned in 1994 for its association with organized crime and shootings. Immediately following the gun makes it clear that &quot;(Skrr)&quot; represents a car pulling up/shooting. &quot;(Skrr)&quot; is gang slang for a car pulling up/shooting. Strange that it is only at these two parts of the song... and that a car pulled up and shot X. Also strange that in his (strangely unrelated) music video for this song Drake has gunshot sounds for when the speakers blow... (represents musician being shot?).</p>

<p>##### Survival</p>

<p>This song was released after XXXTentacion was murdered. It talks about Drake becoming ruthless and having access to his own shooters.</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;ve had real Philly niggas try to write my endin&#39;.</p>

<p>&gt; Takin&#39; shots with the goat and talked about shots that we sendin&#39;.</p>

<p>Again, Drake is talking about hits. He is worried about hits that were written to end his life. Again, Drake mentions &quot;shots that we sendin&#39;&quot; (SMS?). This makes it more clear that Drake has access to send shooters.</p>

<p>&gt; Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it&#39;s headed.</p>

<p>&gt; Realize someone gotta die.</p>

<p>Drake is saying that he knew that someone had to die that messed with him.</p>

<p>&gt; Niggas gamblin&#39; with they life for some content.</p>

<p>&gt; That&#39;s the type of lottery that could get your top picked.</p>

<p>This is a clear threat. Drake is threatening anyone that is trying to get attention/content by checking him, such as XXXTentacion. He then says its a risk for them to do that, as he will make sure they get picked off / killed.</p>

<p>&gt; You niggas pop mollies, my Mali&#39;s pop niggas</p>

<p>XXXTentacion and similar genre artists were known for taking drugs such as molly and xanax. Drake then explicitly admits that he has Somalis on hand that shoot people on his demand.   </p>

<p>&gt; I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks.</p>

<p>Drake is saying he pretends to be nice with other celebrities, but is close with real gangsters and killers. [Drake has spent the years befriending known gang members and shot callers and human traffickers](<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/5wvub7/police_arent_happy_about_pressas_tour_with_drake/">https://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/5wvub7/police_arent_happy_about_pressas_tour_with_drake/</a>).</p>

<p>He also compares himself to a shark. Sharks are known for waiting to unexpectedly strike. Sharks can see even in dark or murky water.</p>

<p>&gt; And I see in the dark, wasn&#39;t this cold at the start.</p>

<p>He is saying that he has embraced the dark path he is heading down. He has become cold and willing to do ruthless things, such as ordering hits to kill people in his way. He claims to not feel remorse.</p>

<p>&gt; Think my soul has been marked, there&#39;s a hole in my heart</p>

<p>He has done something that marked his soul and left a hole in his heart. This lines up with _Im Upset_ where he said &quot;Got a lot of blood and it&#39;s cold. They keep tryna get me for my soul.&quot; Was this him resorting to ordering the hit on XXXTentacion?</p>

<p>&gt; R.I.P. my niggas that they caught without it</p>

<p>Drake is talking about people he knows that were killed that could not defend themselves. His friend was killed late last year, and XXXTentacion was just killed.</p>

<p>&gt; This is God&#39;s plan, young man, you said it yourself</p>

<p>&gt; Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt</p>

<p>Again Drake is comparing himself to God (God&#39;s Plan), but this time about him having the power to end someone&#39;s life. He is saying this is the ace up his sleeve for whatever he is dealt.</p>

<p>##### Nonstop</p>

<p>This song is about how powerful Drake is and how his shooters have his enemies &quot;shook&quot; from setting an example on someone (XXXTentacion?).</p>

<p>&gt; Fuck these niggas up!</p>

<p>Starts with an immediate threat.</p>

<p>&gt; Look, I just flipped a switch (flipped, flipped)</p>

<p>Again, Drake is saying he changed. He really wants to set the image that he is harder/colder now.</p>

<p>&gt; Bodies start to drop, ayy (hit the floor)</p>

<p>&gt; Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy</p>

<p>He is talking about people dropping / dying and how powerful he is at the top.</p>

<p>&gt; Give me my respect (give me my respect)</p>

<p>He really wants his respect...</p>

<p>&gt; Niggas pullin&#39; gimmicks &#39;cause they scared to rap, ayy</p>

<p>&gt; Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook</p>

<p>He is talking shit about other rappers like XXXTentacion, who are doing their own thing outside of normal hip-hop/rap. Drake is now saying that he got them too scared to continue (by setting an example with X?).</p>

<p>&gt; Pullin&#39; back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy</p>

<p>He is talking about unveiling some hidden meaning or truth and calls himself a hard hitter.</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;m a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta.</p>

<p>&gt; Yeah I’m light-skinned, but I&#39;m still a dark nigga.</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;m a wig splitta, I&#39;m a tall figure.</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;m a unforgivin&#39; wild-ass dog nigga.</p>

<p>Drake wants to say he is as hard as anyone on the street. He then says he is a &quot;wig splitta&quot; which is a killer who&#39;s victims typically die to gunshots. He is a &quot;tall&quot; and powerful figure that has deep connections. He then makes it clear that he does not forgive, as he has said before in other songs. He has not forgiven XXXTentacion.</p>

<p>&gt; Somethin&#39; wrong with &#39;em, got &#39;em all bitter.</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;m a bill printer, I&#39;m a grave digger.</p>

<p>&gt; Yeah I am what I am.</p>

<p>&gt; I don&#39;t have no time for no misunderstandings again.</p>

<p>He is a grave digger, he is responsible for putting someone into the grave  (XXXTentacion?). He wants to make this clear to us to brag about how hard he is now (and get his enemies &quot;shook&quot;) without outright admitting he ordered the hit.</p>

<p>&gt; You don’t wanna play with him (nah, nah, nah).</p>

<p>&gt; They’ll be mournin&#39; you like 8AM (R.I.P).</p>

<p>If you mess with Drake you will be killed and your fans will be mourning you, like many have been for XXXTentacion. Three rappers were murdered in June, including _Smoke Dawg_ [a close collaborator with Drake!](<a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/01/third-rapper-killed-smoke-dawgs-slaying-saturday-follows-xxxtentacions-death-other-violence-in-june/">https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/07/01/third-rapper-killed-smoke-dawgs-slaying-saturday-follows-xxxtentacions-death-other-violence-in-june/</a>).</p>

<p>&gt; They been tryin&#39; me but I&#39;m resilient for real.</p>

<p>&gt; I can’t go in public like civilian for real.</p>

<p>He is reinforcing that anyone that beefs with him will lose, one way or another (XXXTentacion may have been killed for his beef). Drake is not only saying he is famous by saying he cannot &quot;go in public like [a] civilian&quot;, but must also avoid public to be safe from hits.</p>

<p>&gt; ...I can’t go in public like civilian for real.</p>

<p>&gt; And I hardly take offense.</p>

<p>&gt; Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense.</p>

<p>He does not take offense that he has hits on him, as he can understand. He is saying that paying money for revenge is worth it, he knows from his experience paying for hits (XXXTentacion?).</p>

<p>##### Mob Ties</p>

<p>This song was released after XXXTentacion was killed. It is about Drake&#39;s close connection with the mob and him sending shooters to get rid of people he is sick of.</p>

<p>&gt; Ayy, sick of these niggas (sick)</p>

<p>&gt; Sick of these niggas (sick, sick)</p>

<p>&gt; Hire some help (help), get rid of these niggas (skrr)</p>

<p>The song starts with Drake blatantly admitting to sending shooters to get rid of someone that annoyed him...</p>

<p>It uses &quot;(skrr)&quot; again to represent pulling up/shooting like how XXXTentacion was killed and the hit was described in &quot;I&#39;m Upset.&quot;</p>

<p>&gt; Louis bags in exchange for body bags, yeah.</p>

<p>Wow... XXXTentacion had his Louis bag stolen from him when he was killed. Another direct reference to the XXXTentacion hit.</p>

<p>&gt; I fuck with the mob and I got ties (lotta ties, lotta ties).</p>

<p>&gt; Knock you off to pay their tithes (oh).</p>

<p>&gt; They want me gone but don&#39;t know why.</p>

<p>Drake admits to having a lot of ties with gangs. He even said he would order you knocked off to pay their tithes. Then again mentions having hits on his own head.</p>

<p>&gt; It&#39;s too late for all that lovey-dovey shit</p>

<p>&gt; I&#39;m your brother shit, all that other shit</p>

<p>&gt; It&#39;s too late for all that</p>

<p>&gt; It&#39;s too late for all that, ayy</p>

<p>Drake said its too late for forgiveness, maybe because they are dead? (XXXTentacion?)</p>

<p>&gt; Yeah, and they shook.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t let them fool ya, I don&#39;t care how they look (nah).</p>

<p>Now his enemies are afraid of him even if they don&#39;t show it. He uses &quot;shook&quot; again, just as he did before when talking about setting someone as an example (XXXTentacion).</p>

<p>&gt; Heard all of the talkin&#39;, now it&#39;s quiet, now it&#39;s shush (shh)</p>

<p>He heard all the &quot;checks&quot; from XXXTentacio, but now will never hear any more since he is dead.</p>

<p>&gt; Yes I be with Future but I like to reminisce (yeah)</p>

<p>&gt; I do not forget a thing, I&#39;m patient, it&#39;s a gift (yeah)</p>

<p>Drake does not forget anything, instead he is patient before he unexpectedly gets his revenge (getting a hit?).</p>

<p>&gt; Try to tell &#39;em they ain&#39;t got to do it, they insist (they insist)</p>

<p>Maybe he was joking about wanting him dead, but they insisted to carry it out?</p>

<p>&gt; Standin&#39; over coffin with a hammer and a nail (two).</p>

<p>&gt; Heard you hit up so and so, that name don&#39;t ring a bell, nah.</p>

<p>Drake says he is sealing the coffin on someone (XXXTentacion?). Then says he will pretend he does not know who this someone is when people ask if he ordered the hit. </p>

<p>##### Talk Up</p>

<p>Drake made this song alongside Jay-Z and they explicitly mention XXXTentacion&#39;s death. During one of his concerts Kanye said that Jay-Z and probably other big names have shooters.</p>

<p>&gt; Niggas provoke, this shit ain&#39;t a joke, man, nobody playin.&#39;</p>

<p>Drake repeats how serious he is and warns not to provoke him (or else).</p>

<p>&gt; I got your President tweetin&#39;, I won&#39;t even meet with him.</p>

<p>&gt; Y&#39;all killed X and let Zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is done.</p>

<p>At the ending, Jay-Z name drops XXXTentacion and that &quot;Y&#39;all killed X&quot;.</p>

<p>&gt; You know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?</p>

<p>&gt; Ayy, ayy, yeah</p>

<p>&gt; You know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?</p>

<p>Drake finishes the song with repeating the above quote asking if we &quot;know what I&#39;m saying?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enough of this nonsense.</p>

<p>Draje is an ACTOR. He us playing Drake. He was discovered on a TV series. He was raised in a nice home, had $$$, education, and a normal privileged life. He is not a hard gangster.</p>

<p>XXX was a very small success. His influence was minimal. Comparing him to Pac or BIG is just insane.</p>

<p>XXX was a fake thug, used social media to start trouble, and eventually had his card pulled.</p>

<p>Drake has so much $$$, power, and influence. If he didn&#39;t have Pusha killed, XXX wasn&#39;t even on his mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple of your points are kind of wrong,<br/>
1.Drake may have started as an actor but you can’t really deny he has ties or he himself is involved with gangs in Toronto,just last week another one of his friends was shot dead,smoke dawg, this is the third in a year and the second within a month the other shooting taking place right outside of drakes restaurant.<br/>
2. X was not a fake thug he may have moved away from that life but he was definitely with it when he was younger, when he met ski mask one of his best friends in jail he was 14-16 locked up for gun and armed robbery charges you can just search on YouTube for old videos of him and you can see him putting himself in the middle of large gang brawls telling people to try and shoot him he was not a “fake thug” like say 6ix9ine or nahmir is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe he was a spoiled kid back in his degrassi days but it&#39;s well known in Toronto circles that Drake is HEAVILY involved in the pimping scene, and his head security guy, known as Chubbs, is related by blood to many Jamaican pimps and gangsters.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, Drake is not some innocent rich celebrity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>X was no Pac or Biggie but damn sure was influential. Younger kids (16-19 year olds) loved him and his music. Soundcloud rappers like him hold great influence and some are changing the rap game. </p>

<p>Drake might have felt threatened by that. Hes not as popular with the younger crowd as he used to be. Hes old. The kids connected with X because he was their age. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Drake did it but those lyrics and his message now is way different than it was years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  Drake is connected to Jamaican pimps and gangs in Toronto/Mississauga/Brampton.  It&#39;s kept quiet in the media but pretty well known, especially in the human trafficking scene.</p>

<p>His head security guy, Chubbs, is connected by blood to several Jamaican pimps/gangsters in Toronto.</p>

<p>He may have been a plant/innocent in the beginning, but he has definitely put himself into the criminal world here. </p>

<p>The sad thing is no one can concretely say anything without being targeted and killed for it.  So direct sources of info will stay silent and not say details. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question.  Maybe someone should ask him.  However, if you look at Tupac, even though he came from a broken home, he was no gangster and had no reason to go that route(he was already becoming successful), but he still put himself into the criminal world and played gangster.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a symbol of power and ego in the rap world.  Yeah they can be the hottest rapper in the game, but they still chase the street cred.</p>
