        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every celebrity banking on the #metoo movement has the same empty platitudes to offer up, while rarely every singling out their harassers. </p>

<p>Jessica Alba recently did an interview with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/06/29/cnn-talk-asia-07-04-18.cnn-creative-marketing">CNN&#39;s Talk Asia</a>, whatever the fuck that is, answering &quot;Oh yeah, of course I have,&quot; when asked point blank whether or not she&#39;d ever experienced sexual harassment. </p>

<p>A prospect not too farfetched for anyone whose seen Sin City, I suppose. </p>

<p>Daily Mail: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And Jessica Alba has opened up about her experiences of sexual harassment as well as whether the #MeToo movement is leading to change in the entertainment industry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah. No, Harvery Weinstein put it best himself, &quot;I didn&#39;t invent the casting couch.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 37-year-old Sin City star told host Anna Coren, that she faced sexual harassment throughout her career, which started when she was aged just 13. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently this is a big revelation for Alba, or has she tweeted about it before? No idea. Never too late to jump on the #metoo train, regardless. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She said: &#39;Oh, yeah. Of course, I have. Yeah. All the time along the way. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>All the time</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know. I guess you shouldn&#39;t have accepted it, but as a young actress growing up in the business, you just accepted that that&#39;s the way you were going to be treated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t you think she&#39;d feel inclined to, I dunno, name and shame, so that other up and comming actresses might be able to avoid harrassment from the same Predators who victimized her? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;And you could either go this way or that way with it, and do I think I could&#39;ve gotten some opportunities if I would&#39;ve done this versus that?&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turn my tangent phones up</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Sure, but for me, that&#39;s just not something I was comfortable with, franklyâ€¦ I mean, I&#39;ve been doing this since I was 12. Imagine, imagine what that&#39;s like.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No need to imagine, Jess. Plenty of 12 year olds working in the entertainment industry as we speak, presumably with the same kid fuckers who lusted after your prepubescent cunt so many years ago. </p>

<p>These creeps are still on the prowl, victimizing 12 year olds, yet Alba feels no inclination to call them out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alba on how she responded to harassment and growing up in the entertainment industry, she said: &#39;I had to learn quickly how to get myself out of them, so it never got to a place, but sure, I&#39;ve been in lots of different situations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implying that she grew up under the constant threat of pedophilia. Imagine years later having the power, the following, to take down every sick fuck who tried to get in your 12 year old pants, and opting instead only to virtue signal towards a hashtag movement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mother of three said her experiences of sexual harassment had prompted chats with her own daughters to protect themselves.</p>

<p>She said: &#39;And that&#39;s why it&#39;s important for me to talk to my girls about them knowing you have control over your body and over situations you want to put yourself in. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Easy for your daughters Jess, what about all the 12 year olds who aren&#39;t the children of superstars? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;&#39;I think things have been imbalanced for way too long and I think it&#39;s about time. I have always thought differently about it because I&#39;ve always been in a position where I&#39;ve had to pave my own way, create my own path, push through the barriers, knock down the walls. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be hot, get molested repeatedly </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;No one gave me a handout. No one gave me an opportunity. I had to fight for it, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>fuck for it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but it would be nice if I had some people who helped me along the way and I didn&#39;t have to fall on my face so much,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Into erect penises.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and it would&#39;ve been also nice to have more women mentor me and help me along the way.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And who are you mentoring now, Jess? Your daughters? </p>

<p>Typical. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asked whether she had witnessed a female-led change in the industry, she said: &#39;Have I seen more women headlining movies, directing movies, writing movies, producing movies than before? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or less women being coerced into performing lewd sex acts as a prerequisite to audition for bit parts that will never air.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s been that big of a shift yet, but I think people are at least trying and there&#39;s an awareness around it and how imbalanced it really is. </p>

<p>&#39;I hope over the next 10 years we see more people, more diversity, certainly, behind the camera and in front of the camera.&#39;</p>

<p>You are just a goldmine of projection though.  Let&#39;s see, I&#39;m (not you) the white knight, everyone who disagrees with you does so because some girl rejected them, and I know there were more, but those sufficiently illustrate my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Question: Why dont you name the girl who rejected you leaving you pathetically trying to attack all women for whatever injustices they are burdened with instead of trying to take out all your passive aggressive bullshit on Jessica Alba, because you&#39;re too afraid to even admit that you&#39;re anger just comes from your own insecurity and belief that women owe you something?
I guess for you pointing out who made you feel like you were unjustly treated makes you feel like you might receive backlash - which might or might not be rightly deserved, but a person who had even the most fundamental grasp of the situation might then understand why women in that position feared backlash as well.</p>

<p>That is, unless of course that person just wanted to use some famous actress as a justification for calling women c***s on the internet, which seems to be your primary motivation.</p>

<p>Grow up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah. The whole message was bullshit and completely hypocritical.  Easy to see for anyone who can do as such.  If it makes you feel insecure to have such hypocrisies pointed out, dont post them in the internet. </p>

<p>Nothing you&#39;ve said has made anyone feel insecure.  You&#39;ve been good for a laugh; that&#39;s all there is to it.</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t pointed out any hypocrisy.  All you&#39;ve done is rage, comically.  Rose, is that you?</p>

<p>Says the person who believes that everyone who laughs at you does so because they were rejected by a girl in grade school.  As previously pointed out to you, your lack of self awareness is utterly astounding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think what he is saying is correct. Its just how he says it comes off mean and vindictive. The problem with hollywood is that for every actress that is upset with the casting couch their are a hundred more than willing for their shot at fame. This leads to a predatory nature for those in power. Alba would do a lot more good if she named names, but this would come at a cost. And, it might be a high cost. Not just professionally but personally as well. Friends of friends, sort of thing. And, lets remember that Weinstein was outed because the woman had recorded him aggressively trying to force her into his hotel room. If not for that would she have been believed? Or would she have been ignored. It took years for the allegations against Bill Cosby to have fruition. And Bill Clinton has never really faced any real backlash over the allegations against him. Its not so easy to say, just name names.</p>
