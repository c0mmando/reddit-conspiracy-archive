<p>What do you think really happened. The couple said they saw orbs swarming them and green lazers. They said the aliens were tracking there every move and they had goo on their skin that was burning them.</p>

<p>I think they really saw that stuff and Ive. Had digital goop on my skin before (they use the brain.) That made me feel like I just jumped out of a moist trash can into 100 degree heat.</p>

<p>Wow  man I have NEVER HEARD A GOOD EXPERIENCE WHILST ON BATH SALTS! Why would anyone ever willingly put that stuff in their system? I mean it isnt like other substances wherein you take a chance at having a good time and possibly dont its pretty much a guarantee that its going south every single time! Have we become so self loathing as a species that we will do things like this anyway as some sort of sadomasochistic punishment for being alive? </p>

<p>But what&#39;s up with you? Do you use hallucinogenic drugs as well? If not, you are either bat shit crazy or victim of some mind controll tech. If aliens were visiting us I doubt they would have nothing better to do than torturing people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And you never wondered why? It&#39;s not because the topics you are talking about. Many people here believe in aliens and most of them don&#39;t get called schizophrenic every day. It is because HOW you are presenting it.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia is a real thing and there are many examples of texts written by schizophrenic people and those texts always show strong similaritys. And again, it&#39;s not about the things discussed in those texts, but the way they are formulated. After reading just two- three texts written by schizophrenic people, you too, would be able to spot a schizophrenic only by looking at his written texts. There are even studys that prove, that machine learning algorythms (AI) is capable of &quot;distinguishing schizophrenia   writing   with   83.3%   accuracy.&quot;
In other words, even a computer algorythm can spot a schizophrenic person just by looking at texts...</p>

<p><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/70e4/00b35a9be5674d4ee5a7ce95da196fbca7a8.pdf">https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/70e4/00b35a9be5674d4ee5a7ce95da196fbca7a8.pdf</a> (pdf)</p>

<p>You display signs of that, in my opinion. </p>

<p>And btw. you know how sane people would react when they experience something like the stuff you are talking about? They would think they are going crazy and go to a doctor. If somebody starts &quot;hearing voices&quot; or &quot;seeing things&quot;
and doesn&#39;t even consider he has a psychological/ neurological condition, THAT is a clear sign he HAS one of those...
Just saying.</p>

<p>But still, you might also really be victim of some kind of attack. I know this stuff exists, since I experienced it myself and found proof the technology to do such things exists and I didn&#39;t get diagnosed with any other psychological conditions than depressions. And I can tell you for sure, if it is an attack, it&#39;s coming from human beings, not aliens.
They tried to convince me of aliens as well, but I figured it out... </p>

<p>So my tip, find a way to rule out that you have some condition. That will need other people since if you really suffer from schizophrenia a selfdiagnosis will be hard- impossible. If you really can rule out a medical condition, you must stop believing &quot;them&quot;. Everything they let you know is a lie and they only want to confuse you even more. The moment you realise they are just ugly nerds pushing buttons, they will lose much of their power about you. The technology works even if you are aware, but it won&#39;t send you in a feedback loop of pure panic anymore that weakens you more and more, because you now know they aren&#39;t the impossible to fight, allmighty aliens you thought they were.</p>
