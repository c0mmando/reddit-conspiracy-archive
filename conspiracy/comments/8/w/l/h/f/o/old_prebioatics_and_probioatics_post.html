<p>Probiotics, prebiotics, sunlight, plenty of water, less sugar, routine sleeping pattern will cure any depression you have. But they can&#39;t sell you these things and you wouldn&#39;t become a lifelong customer of big pharma.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not all the doctors fault either. They need customers because a decade of overpriced med school puts them in massive debt. It&#39;s the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad you asked! Your gut is controls so many things in your body. Everything from mood, to immune system, to energy levels, you name it. </p>

<p>Prebiotics: tablespoon of vinegar mixed in a glass of water (although I usually dilute the tablespoon to half and half, basically a shot glass full of 50/50 vinegar and water, then drink some water afterwards.)</p>

<p>Braggs vinegar is the best I&#39;ve found. Doesn&#39;t much matter the brand as long as you&#39;re sure to get </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unpasteurized</p></li>
<li><p>Organic</p></li>
<li><p>Raw</p></li>
<li><p>Unfiltered</p></li>
<li><p>With the &#39;mother&#39;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Or just Braggs. They&#39;ve been selling it for about 100 years now. It would blow your mind to learn all the benefits of a daily &#39;Apple cider vinegar tonic&#39;. Changed my life around. I&#39;m high energy, high spirits and I swear it was the vinegar. </p>

<p>I take it for coughs, upset stomach, all sorts of things. I take other things as well, like natural honey and cayenne pepper but that&#39;s a different subject. </p>

<p>Probiotics, I&#39;d suggest just look up a list. There&#39;s not many to choose from. Some that come to mind are pickles, sauerkraut, dark chocolate, yogurt, ....</p>

<p>Think of it this way: probiotics are good bacteria in your gut. Absolutely essential. Prebiotics feed the good bacteria and kill the bad bacteria. They work hand in hand. </p>

<p>Food is medicine. Learn more about natural cures <a href="https://www.earthclinic.com/ailments.html">Here</a>. You can cure damn near anything naturally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well think of your gut. It&#39;s home to 2/3rds of your immune system. </p>

<p>As you eat, some foods get trapped and can begin to rot. Especially common with things like red meat. </p>

<p>As that rot occurs, it can make you feel bloated and run down without ever really understanding why, or without you even noticing. This new state becomes the new normal, and you adjust in blind ignorance to your new circumstances. </p>

<p>Prebiotics are fibers. Fibers go through the system and grab on to all the trapped foods, pulling it out with them. This reduces bloating and inflammation and can leave you feeling overall quite a bit more comfortable than you were previously. I would recommend Psyllium Husk as it&#39;s very mild, inexpensive, and I have personally had remarkable results. It&#39;s the principal ingredient in Metamucil, only without all the sugars and vitamin C they pump into Metamucil. </p>

<p>Probiotics are living bacteria that are meant to replace bad bacteria in the gut and promote homeostasis. They outnumber the cells in your body by a lot! Happy bacteria = happy gut = happy person!</p>

<p>It&#39;s not so much about them chemically altering you to make you not depressed, but about putting your body in a position where it can better care for itself, and where it is not as taxed. Feeling great physically is a great starting point towards feeling great mentally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psyllium husk as a prebiotic (fiber) because it&#39;s just the best (price and effect). </p>

<p>For probiotics, it depends on whether you are male or female. You can PM me for further info if you&#39;d rather not disclose on here. Women benefit from some bacteria that are different than those that are ok for men due to differences in certain pH levels in certain places. </p>

<p>There are likewise, different probiotic blends designed to accomplish certain goals, like reducing UTIs or helping gut health. Knowing your goal is helpful in identifying a probiotic best for you. Otherwise, Greek yogurt is a wonderful source of probiotics, as are pickled foods like kim chi and sauerkraut.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a good brand called Florastor that I&#39;ve taken. It seemed to be fine as an all around probiotic. The Wal-mart brand is likely ok, maybe just do a quick googling to double check. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the type of thing where you may not notice a difference for a month or so, and even then I&#39;d recommend tightening up your meal/exercise routine to ensure you&#39;re maximizing the effect. Putting a little love and effort in to yourself goes a long way. Better diet and exercise also play an enormous role in reducing depression. </p>
