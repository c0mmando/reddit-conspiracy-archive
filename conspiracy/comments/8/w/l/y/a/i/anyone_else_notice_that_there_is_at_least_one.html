        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is pharmaceutical propaganda at the top of reddit every single day. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s not an obvious vaccine-related post, it will be a top comment in an unrelated r/all post. Example:</p>

<p>Totally normal TIL top post that becomes an pro-vax circlejerk. No room for discussion. You&#39;re either on board with the CDC or you&#39;re an anti-science baby killer!</p>

<p>Then you have vaccine related top posts scattered throughout the main subreddits:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/8v8z9y/ulpt_if_youre_a_doctor_faced_with_an_antivaxxer">https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/8v8z9y/ulpt_if_youre_a_doctor_faced_with_an_antivaxxer</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8w020u/australian_parents_who_refuse_to_vaccinate_their">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8w020u/australian_parents_who_refuse_to_vaccinate_their</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/8wikol/antivaxxer_gets_called_out">https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/8wikol/antivaxxer_gets_called_out</a></p>

<p>All comments pro-vax. Any dissenting discussion is squashed. Not only that but the overwhelming opinion is parents should be jailed, CPS called, and government should enforce this at all costs. </p>

<p>(These four examples span just five days. I&#39;m sure you would have another one I had been on Reddit that day.)</p>

<p>But WHY? </p>

<p>The main demographic of reddit is young childless males. I have a hard time believing that this is organic. Dog and cat pics? Yes. Politics? Yes. But a random subject like vaccines, every single day at the top of reddit? </p>

<p>I see redditors having civil discussions on everything from gun control to vegan diets, but nothing is quite like vaccines. They freak tf out. You could say your kid died after a round of vaccines and they would tell you you&#39;re crazy and no way a vaccine would do that. It&#39;s victim-blaming at its worst. </p>

<p>I guarantee you 99% of these commentators don&#39;t know the CDC schedule, how many shots a baby gets at once, which adjuvants are in which shots, which vaccines contain human cells, the lack of placebos in their safety studies, the lack of studies on long term health, the problems with the current epidemiological studies, I could go on and on. They don&#39;t even know the basics yet they&#39;re so passionate. It&#39;s mind-boggling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s almost like the constant PR is covering for some deficiencies in their products.   Most of the manufacturers are granted monopolies by the FDA, so differentiation isn&#39;t necessary (Merck is your only choice for MMR, eg).  Most people recognize the value that vaccines have added to society.  So why all the PR?   Is it designed to preemptively distract from some skeletons hiding in the closet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because of the ridiculous &quot;anti-vax&quot; name that has tainted the legitimate concerns we all should have about vaccines. Anti-vaxxers are not actually anti vaccines, they just want better more stringent safety standards applied, especially if society is demanding we inject every single person alive. Is that too much to ask for?  </p>

<p>Even if vaccines are safe for 99% of the population, is that acceptable? 1% of 7 billion people is 70 million people. 70 million people that would just be doomed to suffer or die. We currently have absolutely no way of knowing who those 70 million people would be, what exactly causes them to be damaged in the first place, or how we could prevent it. Instead of demanding that everyone just vaccinate with what we have today, why not demand for better medical knowledge and vaccine safety to try and figure out how to save the 1% too? Then we could confidently vaccinate the entire world knowing everyone would be safe. Why do vaccine manufacturers and the government refuse to do this?  </p>

<p>New medical drugs for cancer, AIDS and other deadly diseases currently undergo many different multi-year trials for their efficacy and safety before being released to the market, if ever. They are scientifically trialled in double-blind placebo controlled studies to ensure their efficacy and assess any potential side effects. New vaccines don&#39;t undergo any of the same stringent protocols. Does that make sense to you? Why do vaccine manufacturers and the government refuse to do this? Shouldn&#39;t we make sure that vaccines are legitimately 100% safe for everyone before demanding such a major societal push?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you would think so, but where are the studies that show this supposed safety? The same studies and trials that are carried out on new medical drugs for cancer, AIDS, etc. to determine their efficacy and safety are not carried out on vaccines. We don&#39;t even have studies done to determine if vaccininated provides any benefit at all compared to unvaccinated. Not even one study. If safety was an important factor, they would be doing the necessary studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually a little bit more complicated than that. About 40% have the gene but only like 5% are homozygous. That 5% is at greatest risk.</p>

<p>There are also other genes other than MTHFR that affect methylation and detox.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also always the possibility of getting a bad batch of vaccines. You could be totally genetically healthy, but if your polio vaccine has sv40 in it, you&#39;re getting sv40.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s incredible, they love using terms like &quot;herd immunity&quot; and &quot;immuno-compromised individuals&quot; that absolutely nobody uses in day to day life. So shill it&#39;s sickening. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never in my life bothered to research or think about vaccines, why would I, we get them before we can even form memories. How is seemingly everyone (key word, seemingly) on reddit a vaccine expert, knows all about their safety and thinks everyone should get them? I&#39;m supposed to believe all these young childless males on reddit have huge boners for vaccines? Like it&#39;s a huge, important issue in day-to-day life? </p>

<p>It literally makes me think they&#39;re being used to implant nanomachines, gps, maybe nanoparticles that can hang around in your brain for life... who knows what the real agenda is, or what&#39;s even possible now. It&#39;s almost like they had a breakthrough in technology and want to make absolute sure now that everyone gets it shot directly into their blood stream at birth. Make the argument so one-sided that you literally can&#39;t voice a dissenting opinion. One guy in those threads was at -200 points for saying he got the flu all 3 times he got the flu shot, but he&#39;s never gotten it since. Literally just an anecdote about his experience... -200 points because he&#39;s apparently an idiot and his experience was wrong. One thing I&#39;m certain of now, vaccines are not innocent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason this is most troubling is because reddit, just like all other forms of social media, operates under the guise of being peer created. Even if a person takes into account that there are bots and operatives specifically here to push an agenda, most people assume that these platforms  are a fair representation of how the public majority thinks. </p>

<p>So when one encounters a post that is overwhelmingly against anyone questioning the vaccine schedule, to the point of insulting the intelligence of the person asking the questions, most will assume that this is how the majority of people around them think. </p>

<p>It is a form of mind control that shuts down even the idea of questioning something. This works especially well on people who come here casually for entertainment and memes, because they don’t look at such posts from a critical mind perspective. The impression is made in their minds without them even realizing it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my idea: have a ruling class that is essentially a religious order, minus the religion. It is centered around a constitution, and demands a modest and purpose-focused lifestyle from all who belong to it. Any person may apply to join this order, and the most qualified will be accepted (think military style recruiting). They will be held to higher standards legally and socially, and even if they retire/resign will always be under greater scrutiny. Perhaps they should even be forced to maintain wealth below a certain maximum. </p>

<p>People in this ruling class will provide the public with representation by taking responsibility for a geographical area and familiarizing themselves with the interests of that area, then taking part in relvant discussions when laws or policies are made or enforced.</p>

<p>Essentially, make becoming a politician a sacrifice one makes for the greater good, not a path to personal wealth and power. Make a government that is beholden to the people but not driven by short-sighted popularity contests, one capable of sustained, level-headed, rational, constitutionally-driven decision making. There&#39;s my radical political fantasy that will never come to pass.</p>

<p>no ones saying not to vaccinate YOUR kids. people want to be free to do their own research and make decisions for their idea of what’s in the best interest of the child without threat from the government to potentially make the wrong choice without having a say in the matter. if people are being severely injured and maimed and there is a court for settling disputes, it’s safe to assume some people have a predisposition to vaccine injury based on certain genetic or biological factors  and that further studies are needed as to what actually causes the injury instead of just secretly paying them off in court and gagging them with NDAs </p>

<p>TL;DR  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite what antivaccine parents claim, their choice not to vaccinate does impact more than just their children and themselves. It impacts the entire community in which they live negatively, even the vaccinated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for the record, I agree with you that parents should be able to make their own informed decision.<br/>
Fact of the matter is though that, in the large majority of cases, available scientific studies and data show that the advantages of vaccination far outweigh the risks. </p>

<p>Bullshit.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most vaccines are not live and don&#39;t shed, including DTaP, Tdap, flu shots, Hib, hepatitis A and B, Prevnar, IPV, and the HPV and meningococcal vaccines.  </p></li>
<li><p>the MMR vaccine doesn’t cause shedding, except that the rubella part of the vaccine may rarely shed into breastmilk (since rubella is typically a mild infection in children, this isn’t a reason to not be vaccinated if you are breastfeeding though)  </p></li>
<li><p>The chicken pox vaccine doesn&#39;t cause shedding unless your child develops the rare vesicular rash after getting vaccinated. The risk, however, is thought to be minimal  </p></li>
<li><p>The rotavirus vaccine only causes shedding in the stool and can be avoided with routine hygiene techniques  </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People shed viruses and are truly contagious if they aren&#39;t vaccinated and develop any of these vaccine-preventable diseases.</strong></p>

<p>Getting measles as a child causes LIFELONG immunity. </p>

<p>The vaccine gives you about 15 years immunity. </p>

<p>So they&#39;re setting women up to catch measles when they&#39;re child-bearing age. </p>

<p>Back in the day, you&#39;d get measles as a kid, give placental immunities to your baby, and even more if you breastfeed. When kid is weaned, they&#39;re now old enough to catch measles safely (if they&#39;re well-nourished). </p>

<p>See how the vaccine screws that up? </p>

<p>there is no harm in calling for more research into the subject to make vaccines safe for everyone</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think no one is disputing that.  </p>

<p>It is however a common misconception that measles is a &quot;minimal childhood ailment&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1980, before measles vaccination was widely available, 2.6 million deaths were caused by measles globally each year [1]. In 2012, still 122 000 people, mostly children, died from measles worldwide. </p>

<p>It is a common misperception that measles is a harmless disease. Some people further believe that the existing healthcare system in developed countries provides enough resources for good care when someone is infected with measles. This misperception probably occurs due to the vaccination’s success: many people have never seen someone with measles infection and do not know how severe a measles infection can be.</p>

<p>In fact, measles can be a severe infection, which cannot be directly treated with antivirals. Thus, once infected, only the symptoms such as high fever can be treated. Complications occur with about 30% of measles infections and can occur in almost every organ system [2]. They range from ear infections, diarrhoea and related dehydration, to severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia and involve sequelae such as blindness or encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling) [1,2].</p>

<p>​In 1980, before measles vaccination was widely available, 2.6 million deaths were caused by measles globally each year [1]. In 2012, still 122 000 people, mostly children, died from measles worldwide.  </p>

<p>how?? the fact that the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System even exists should inform you that there can be adverse reactions. &quot;informed consent&quot; requires &quot;information&quot; and &quot;consent&quot;, not &quot;100% safety&quot;. </p>

<p>or are painkillers, cancer drugs and airbags &quot;a violation of informed consent as well&quot;?</p>

<p>how? I&#39;m not from the US, I&#39;m genuinely curious where your constitution requires 100% safely of vaccines?</p>

<p>governmental threats. </p>

<p>what, not being able to go to school?? don&#39;t you live in the land of the free? why wouldn&#39;t schools be free to deny entrance to people deemed a statistical threat to student safety? if you don&#39;t want to vaccinate? homeschool. nobody is being &quot;threatened&quot;.</p>

<p>Further, <em>Zucht v. King</em> and <em>Maricopa County Health Department v. Harmon</em> seem to implicitly prove the constitutionality of organizations restricting access to vaccinated individuals.</p>

<p>Again, nobodies threatening you, you just don&#39;t get the benefits of the social contract if you don&#39;t abide by the social contract. You&#39;re free to make that choice.</p>

<p>the very definition of a mandate disallows for the choice of consent. i. don’t.  know.  how.  to.  be.  ANY.  more.  clear. </p>

<p>the reason why some people choose not to vaccinate is because there is mountains of conflicting evidence, studies and papers saying it’s not harmful and mountains saying it is harmful.  people can not prove within a reasonable doubt how safe it would be for them or their offspring because everything vaccine injury related is gagged and NDA’d into oblivion. </p>

<p>and how long before the homeschooled children have to have mandatory vax? or how long before you step out on your front porch and the vaccine police ask to see your immunization records or they force you back inside. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just pulled in the pro-vax lobby into this conversation. You can&#39;t discuss these things on Reddit in an objective manner, ever, anywhere. It&#39;s just a fact. I bailed on the front page years ago because it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s all a complete astroturfing mind-control circus fest. The pro-vax lobby have bots that autolink to antivax discussions, and they always pull in a bunch of &quot;fact checkers&quot; into all these conversations, just like this one right now too. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very obvious it&#39;s like this, because if you discuss vaccines on other forums not monitored by these corporate hookers, you get a completely different outcome. Reddit is unique in the way vaccine discussions are carefully &quot;managed&quot; here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true! I think the hygiene thing is a legit problem. People really keep their kids in a bubble these days. </p>

<p>Okay honestly, if the CDC schedule only important shots like polio, I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with it. I think a lot of the issues are from the combination of shots. </p>

<p>That said, here&#39;s a couple things about polio:</p>

<p>The polio vaccine contained a contaminant for decades. The SV40 virus...and it causes brain tumors. I shit you not. They found and removed it, but what other contaminants could be in our vaccines?</p>

<p>Okay so polio usually is just like a cold, you don&#39;t know you have it. 99% of the time it&#39;s not a problem. But according to Dr. Humphries (check out her YouTube!), polio was made worse when the patient was exposed to DDT. Guess what they sprayed all over the place in the 1950&#39;s? DDT! </p>

<p>There are a lot of people who believe polio is still around, it was just renamed. The diagnostic criteria was changed for polio shortly after the vaccine came out. Rates of &quot;polio&quot; went down, but rates of &quot;acute flaccid paralysis&quot; went up. When people these days come in with paralysis issues (myesthenia gravis, gullian barre), the hospital will get a spinal tap and check a viral panel...But they never test for polio because that&#39;s gone, right? </p>

<p>Idk. That&#39;s the idea anyway. If I could get rid of some mandatory shots it would be chickenpox, rotavirus, diphtheria, measles, and hep A. 
The polio vaccine can stay in my opinion lol. Sorry for the wall of text. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that vaccines are in all likelihood mostly safe for most people, and in fact vaccinated my children.  But this attitude of &quot;no respect&quot;, &quot;no quiet dinners&quot;, &quot;punch a fascist&quot; etc is the actual stupid one.  It&#39;s stupid on multiple levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you an expert on vaccines?  Most probably not.  The main reason you believe they are effective is because of herd mentality.  You&#39;ve had it drilled into you over and over that they are safe and absolutely necessary for society&#39;s health.  That is probably correct if you read the peer-reviewed studies on vaccination, but did you? If not, shut the fuck up and don&#39;t call other people idiots.</li>
<li>People form teams, typically two teams, and everyone on the other side is an &quot;idiot&quot;.  They are fascists and deserve what they get.  But.  The problem with this attitude is that people aren&#39;t really divided into two groups, and many if not most people actually have a grab bag of opinions and ideas from various camps.  You might incorrectly identify someone as a &lt;fill in the blank&gt;-winger and decide they get no respect, even though you were wrong.</li>
<li>Even if everyone was split down the middle in two camps, to believe that the other side is Orcs and Mordor and the Dark Side is childish and stupid in itself.  50&amp;#37; of the public isn&#39;t stupid - they just have different premises and axioms on how they derive their belief system. Well the small percentage of intelligent ones on each side do.  Actually  95&amp;#37; of people on both sides are just parroting what they hear from others without thought.</li>
<li>Most people aren&#39;t actually interested in harming others or creating a worse world.  They just might have a less effective idea about how to go about making the world better.</li>
<li>If you want to convince anyone of anything, disrespecting them is a sure-fire way not to do it.  You are making everything worse by acting immature in how you approach people.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines individually can be safe. The real issue is the amount of vaccines given in such a short period of time. The United States gives 26+ vaccines between 1 and 15 months old and has higher rates of Autism, vaccine related injuries and SIDS. Countries that have 12 vaccines for 1 to 15 month olds have &quot;healthier&quot; babies and significantly lower rates of Autism, SIDS etc.. The other issue is the CDC refuses and I do mean refuses (even with folks offering funding) to do any study on Vaccinated vs Unvaccinated children. If there is nothing to hide and you want everyone vaccinated why wouldn&#39;t you just do this study when you do thousands of others and it would put many minds at ease. The testing for vaccines that we give our infants is under less regulation and has minimal testing compared to the medicine we take which is completely insane that we have stricter guidelines and testing for dick pills for adults men but will inject infants with chemical cocktails that&#39;s testing is sketchy at best. Also, if vaccines were so safe they would not have a special designated court to handle vaccinated related injuries where their proceedings are classified. Come on that&#39;s a little fishy at least. Again its not the vaccines by themselves it is the ridiculous quantity, in a short span of time and the age they are given that can be an issue along with little to sketchy testing </p>

<p>A 2013 CDC study [PDF – 204 KB] added to the research showing that vaccines do not cause ASD. The study looked at the number of antigens (substances in vaccines that cause the body’s immune system to produce disease-fighting antibodies) from vaccines during the first two years of life.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an excellent documentary, great to see it available here. Below I&#39;m going to provide a quick red pill of information on the vaccine situation for anyone would like it.</p>

<p>Once one learns what is really going on, we discover that unfortunately the science is not settled as the industry refuses to fund the necessary studies to find out if vaccines are bringing a net benefit overall, the industry doesn&#39;t want to find the harm their products cause as it can mean loss of confidence, sales and also huge compensation payouts. So what they do is whitewash their products, data is played with, statistics are used to lie.</p>

<p>For example the honest experts are so sick of Big Pharma for not funding any proper studies into the safety of injecting Aluminum, that now they are crowdfunding for over $600,000 to perform the trials.</p>

<p>Here are some sources to get people started</p>

<p>For those from a scientific background I&#39;d strongly recommend the presentations given at the Vaccine Safety Conference</p>

<p>The rest is a general starter pack for people who want to learn more:-</p>

<p>&quot;This new study demonstrates that vaccines can affect brain development via immune activation. Hence, the immune activation experiments are relevant to vaccines…The hep B vaccine increased IL-6 in the hippocampus (the only brain region analyzed for cytokines).&quot;</p>

<p>The authors noted that the HBV mice showed “significantly increased” IL-6, which we know is a biomarker for autism.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated.&quot;</p>

<p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

<p>Under Freedom of Information we see that CDC experts privately admit the dangers of vaccines, they admit that vaccines are causing neurological problems, speech delays and they warn the information must be embargoed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.aapsonline.org/vaccines/cdcfdaexperts.htm">http://www.aapsonline.org/vaccines/cdcfdaexperts.htm</a></p>

<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s nothing wrong per se with being pro vaccine so long as you earnestly believe that vaccines are net positive, and have made efforts to hear both sides of the issue and scrutinize your opinions. That is not the case for pretty much everyone who is pro-vaccine, even many doctors. Anti-vaccine or vaccine skeptic people to a much higher degree have heard both sides of the argument and decided based on the evidence, despite extreme social pressure to take the other side. There&#39;s an asymmetry here that leads to strong implications about the motivations and level of knowledge of the people on either side.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>&#39;Propaganda&#39; is wrong because it assumes that one side is right. We never know we are right. We can ensure the best process for coming to the best collective judgment possible though-- free speech, open inquiry, logic, argumentation. Propaganda undercuts all of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am showing no bias as far as i can tell. I was reading a discussion in which you suddenly started to accuse people of killing their kids and i ironicly showed my thought there might be a bias in the media.</p>

<p>Your reply is just as the extreme pro/ con as both groups are portreted in the MSM. This stance makes any discussion hard or impossible. There are creditable docters that have one or more problems with vaccines, but the MSM is always showing the &quot;extermemist&quot; and most non-believeble carrecters to make a point.</p>

<p>This point happens to be promoted over and over again, while people asking for more research to prevent some people from having a bad reaction to the vaccins are being ridiculed. The &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach is clearly not working for everybody, but asking for improvement suddenly makes you an &quot;anti-vaxer&quot; or &quot;kid killer&quot; as you so elegantly wrote.</p>

<p>The absolute insanety about this makes me believe there is a real reason people sound the alarm and some are indeed actively trying to hide something. The media bias and the push-back on social media are almost the same as in some other &quot;controversial&quot; topics and it is starting to show.</p>

<p>Be anti vax if you want, but if you hold people to your belief that vaccines cause death or autism, then you should be held accountable if (because you didnt vaccinate yourself or your children) a deadly disease infects them or you, and through them or you someone else, resulting in death.</p>

<p>May I start by saying, I know that not one of these studies proves anything in itself. It&#39;s the big picture I&#39;m pointing to. </p>

<p>Also, remember that the overwhelming consensus that vaccines are safe is based on epidemiological studies that are easily skewed. They don&#39;t study vaxxed vs unvaxxed kids for overall health. They only study vaxxed vs less vaxxed, which creates something called &quot;healthy user bias&quot; but that&#39;s a whole different tangent I could go on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the thing is there is no vaccine that can achieve herd immunity. With any vaccine you have adverse reactions and up to 12% of people just don&#39;t respond to them- at all. Herd immunity is only possible through our bodies secondary immune response which provides immunity for life-- look up A.W. Hedrich the creator of the term that even the Wikipedia page fails to mention. </p>

<p>So in many cases where these outbreaks are occurring it is not due to the not-vaccinated but actually the recently vaccinated or those who vaccines became no longer effective who can and do spread it.</p>

<p>I agree and if I ever was responsible for someones death I would definitely expect to be held accountable. However, I in my thirties and have only gotten 4 vaccines my entire life. I ha the last one being a tetanus when I was 13 due to an injury. I have worked as a CNA, child care specialist, volunteer for the elderly, special children and the immuno-compromised. I have never gotten any of them sick since I myself rarely get sick. </p>

<p>But don&#39;t take my word for it!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that can never happen because vaccine manufacturers are literally immune from being prosecuted for damages or death caused by vaccines. The government is the one footing the bill and has set up a fund that has already paid out billions of dollars for damages caused by vaccines, while the vaccine manufacturers face absolutely no repercussions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Likewise with anti vaxxers though. I feel like someone questioning chem trails has a better base then trying to be anti vaccine, again arguing the point brings me to this:</p>

<p>We should be talking about why people have mistrust with the health system rather than the vaccines them selves . Are they outside malignant forces that want to lower our status? and what other historical moral panics are similar to this ? We can throw opposing studies at each other to no avail or we can look at the issue from another perspective. </p>

<p>After the vaccine the child gets a fever and a rash on the entire body, scream and have seizures. The next day the child wakes up and is gone. Personality gone, lost language, no eye contact, not aware of the surroundings. </p>

<p>The doctors tell them this is a coincidence. The vaccine is not to blame. Doctors tell them the child has autism and was aborn that way they just did not notice.</p>

<p>The child never recovers and spends the rest of the life in diapers unable to communicate with people.</p>

<p>The parents want to sue and find out it is not possible because the vaccine companies are legally shielded and autism is not a recognized vaccine injury.</p>

<p>There are tens of thousands perhaps soon hundreds of thousands of cases like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mistrust of the medical system is pretty clear if you remove rose colored glasses that it is there for the health and welling being of society.
 It has turned into a profit fueled industry of &quot;managing&quot; illness and disease with big pharma the principal benefactor. Doctors aren&#39;t concerned with your lifestyle and personal wellbeing, they prescribe drugs, before legislation was implemented to protect vaccine producers from litigation people would get 5 or 6, after the legislation the scedule shot up to 90! Is the world so full of rampant diseases that children and people &quot;need&quot; so many vaccines to &quot;protect&quot; themselves and others?
 It is clear if you look at it objectively that the agenda is to make profit and the fall out should be hidden and vilified by the machinations of a profit brainwashing driven industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By research do you mean YouTube videos? Or books, papers and proven science. Because I&#39;ve done the latter. Just saying if you&#39;re responsible for a deadly disease killing someone due to you choosing not to vaccinate you should be held accountable. Just as if someone gets vaccinated and dies the people who released the vaccination should be held accountable. </p>

<p>If you have any legitimate sites or books that you feel will provide adequate proof against vaccines I&#39;d love to have a look, as I obviously don&#39;t know everything and will love to look at your research </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;ll give you a few papers. </p>

<p>May I start by saying, I know that not one of these studies proves anything in itself. It&#39;s the big picture I&#39;m pointing to. </p>

<p>Also, remember that the overwhelming consensus that vaccines are safe is based on epidemiological studies that are easily skewed. They don&#39;t study vaxxed vs unvaxxed kids for overall health. They only study vaxxed vs less vaxxed, which creates something called &quot;healthy user bias&quot; but that&#39;s a whole different tangent I could go on. </p>

<p>Okay let me post this, then I&#39;ll come back and edit with links. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So does American football, rugby, dehydration, poor diet, also some peoples attitude can be interpreted as a form of brain disease that alters how the brain works. Like the attitude of most anti vaxxers I&#39;ve talked to. Some are helpful and want to share their knowledge. Others are just pushing against the tide for the sake of it.</p>

<p>Btw the way I understand the word encephalopathy, it is a broad term for possible brain diseases. Pretty sure non specific isn&#39;t required in front of it. But could be wrong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you admit that vaccines aren&#39;t perfect for everyone? Then why demand that everyone just vaccinate anyway instead of demanding for better vaccines? That&#39;s all &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; really want, the same stringent safety standards applied to vaccines that are applied to all other medications, which currently does NOT happen. Is that too much to ask for?</p>
