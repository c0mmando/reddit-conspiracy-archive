    <div class="md"><p>No. They work for a lot of people. Most (SSRIs) block the reuptake of serotonin, leaving it in the synaptic cleft a little longer. It’s been life changing for a few of my friends, but they don’t work for everyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is because the idea that serotonin is the sole chemical imbalanced and fixing that should fix depression was not a scientifically backed hypothesis but rather an idea pushed by big pharma to sell their new SSRI class of drugs when they originally were formulated. In 2018, we know that is blatantly false through other study, but also directly through the lack of efficacy shown by various different SSRIs. </p>

<p>For some, whose depression may be caused by serotonergic pathways they can help (although, even then the efficacy is average at best and may come at the cost of various unwanted side effects, some serious) but the problem is the way we both diagnosis mental health (via the rigid DSM) and then how we prescribe these drugs, or should I say the over prescription of these drugs.</p>

<p>Depression and mood disorders are extremely complicated diseases and relegating it down to one neurotransmitter and marketing drugs as such is a horrible and deliberately carried out agenda by big pharma.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>A lot of my depression seems to have been exacerbated by misuse of MDMA and I tried microdosing LSD for about two months, however I didn&#39;t care for the results after about a month; I felt more emotionally volatile and distracted despite the energy increase I experienced.</li>
<li>Antidepressants do work for some, but my experience was that they made things worse regardless of what I tried and I think pharmaceutical companies are more concerned with perpetuating treatment rather than curing or identifying the roots of specific problems. The impact of side effects on the patient is sometimes greater than that of the drug&#39;s benefit and may require more medication to combat. </li>
</ol>

<p>Psychoactive recreational drugs are good for allowing yourself the occasional life lesson, and weed has helped with my depression but is easy to abuse and is just another way to drain your income as much as I support it.</p>

<p>TLDR: Try to find other things besides drugs that will help you, I&#39;ve regretted both my drug habits and my prescriptions almost every step of the way. </p>

<p>Just a possible suggestion. Try looking into things that are expected to do the opposite (depress you). You may be reacting opposite. Actually MJ is a depressant and you mentioned it improving your feeling, so there is that. You might be actually suffering from some sort of stimulation fatigue like adrenal fatigue which stimulants would make worse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always leery regarding giving medical advice to someone over the internet - we literally don&#39;t know their lifestyle, family history, diet, etc. I think it is better to give general advice so they can decide for themselves.</p>

<p>To <a href="/u/_Dingus_Khan">/u/_Dingus_Khan</a>: make sure your diet and exercise regimen is in place before experimenting with different substances. If you are reluctant to try antidepressants, which is understandable, try  your hand at some nootropics. Ashwagandha is a touted example (though it didn&#39;t work for me; it exacerbated my anxiety after a while, possibly due to its effects on thyroid hormone). Racetams are another. Fasoracetam has personally been a silver bullet for me personally (take this with a HUGE grain of salt - people respond differently).</p>

<p>Oh, and MJ isn&#39;t a depressant in the classical sense. It can be both a stimulant and a depressant, depending on the ratio of cannabinoids and terpenes present in the herb. Hence the distinction between Sativa and Indica (although, most strains are a hybrid; you&#39;d request a &quot;sativa dominant&quot; hybrid or &quot;indica dominant&quot; hybrid in many cases).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a doctor. Why would I be giving medical advice to anyone? I wasn&#39;t. I was merely suggesting something to research. I didn&#39;t give any specific advice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why you are so defensive, I was just being cautionary, not being super critical of you. I suggested nootropics, which are by in large safe (like most racetams and adaptogens like ashwagandha). It&#39;s like suggesting a sativa strain for someone struggling with depression and fatigue - do I need to be a doctor to do that?</p>

<p>Because you scolded me for giving medical advice which I didn&#39;t and then went on to give specific medical advice yourself.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you what: If you want to talk to the OP, talk to them directly, not through others. Don&#39;t respond to me basically telling OP not to listen to me while talking about me in the third person.</p>

<p>Why would you even think to do something like that? Who taught you how to interact with others?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you both for the thought and advice. I&#39;ve tried a handful of SSRIs from two different providers and had no luck with any of them. I&#39;ve received one prescription for anxiety medication that made things worse. I&#39;ve found that I have the most luck with sativa-dominant hybrids, as I am a low-energy person and prefer the stimulating effects of most drugs to the depressing. I think I&#39;m finished with experimentation where pharmaceuticals are concerned, though, as my skepticism and paranoia have lead me to think that the pursuit will prove unfruitful or too time-consuming, and ultimately I&#39;d rather remain creative than become numb. If I do decide to revisit medication, though, I&#39;ll consider what both of you have mentioned as an alternative to SSRIs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no factual way to properly diagnose mental illness or no factual way to tell with certainty the medicine is effective. Its all trial and error. </p>

<p>The bigger conspiracy is the pharma companies, they make billions and billions of dollars each year just off the military saying anyone and everyone with a 90% rate has ptsd. Which was coined to basically blanket diagnose our military. You could say , “sarge im having a tough day”. Then he tells you to go see the doc, doc asks you a few questions then hits you with the ptsd card and bam you now taking meds and usually more then one. </p>

<p>Its really fucking depressing what they are doing but its a huge system that is too big to fail. Its funny back in the day psychiatrists used to be the laughing stock of the medical field until the conned the military. You wouldn’t believe the experiments they used to try and diagnose mental illness.</p>

<p>Now its about money and nothing less, these military doctors jobs are to get you hooked on medicine and to waste our dollars on some diagnosis that is impossible to tell if its really effective. </p>

<p>The good is hopefully with advancement of technology they’ll be able to scan our brainwaves and actually be able to diagnose people with accurate results. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to bet that given the criteria for diagnosing depression, you could pretty much diagnose anyone with depression. There needs to be actual medical tests performed instead of treating it like a psychological issue that can&#39;t be tested.</p>

Antidepressants might be better than lobotomy, but just like lobotomy they come at a cost, I think. You need to decide if it&#39;s worth it though. The better/ lighter antidepressants won&#39;t leave you as a complete vegatable...
I don&#39;t think &quot;they&quot; will have you under controll when you take AD&#39;s, but they might have you where they want you.
(In a state where you don&#39;t think too much about abstract things anymore and don&#39;t ask too many undesired questions anymore.)</p>

<p>But still, if you feel like you might be/ get suicidal, AD&#39;s can help for sure and you can live your life without constant emotional pain. Still better being only 95% you instead of being 0% you (dead). But I would suggest you trying to find other cures.

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response. I think, mostly, my consistent sadness (what I&#39;m thinking is depression) stems from social anxiety. I avoid social situations because I constantly feel pressures that are probably imagined. But I am lonely, and the only worthwhile ways to attract a mate are social ways. So that being said, what about anti anxiety medications? I feel like those would put me where &quot;they&quot; want me as well. I&#39;m not really trying to be &quot;one with the masses,&quot; but like it feels like that&#39;s what anti anxiety meds would do to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commented with my experience earlier in the thread but this really brings up one of my &quot;theories&quot; about depression.  It&#39;s not really mine exactly, but look up social defeat in humans, there is a wikipedia article.  Basically I think that due to the structure of modern society, as well as the breakdown of the family, all but the most successful people are constantly perceiving social defeat.  Instead of only a few at the very bottom of the hierarchy being stressed in this manner, we are all constantly inundated with the message that we are the loser in the social exchange taking place.  This is done for marketing, politics, manipulation by employers, and many other reasons.  The results are relationship breakdowns, depression, drug addiction, high suicide rates, low savings rates and high credit card debt (keep up with the jones to avoid social defeat), and more.  </p>

<p>I have what is known as Dysthymia, a chronic, persistent form of depression with bouts of severe double depression. </p>

<p>SSRIs helped me. They are not intended to be a &quot;cure&quot; for depression, as others have suggested. They are intended to alleviate the symptoms while you work through the causes of your depression.  For some, they work, and for others, they don&#39;t. Many people have to go through many different combinations of meds before they find one that helps them, because depression isn&#39;t always caused by the same chemical reactions in the brain. For some, they do have a decreased amount of Serotonin, but that is not always the case. But I know that the average doctor wants to help people. Talk to your doc. </p>

<p>Also, ignore the idiot saying &quot;all mass shooters were on some form or another of SSRIs.&quot; It&#39;s patently false and misleading. </p>

Or how about the other side effects they can have like, that they can actually cause long term treatment resistant depression if you&#39;re on them long enough -</p>

<p>There are people who have permanent sexual dysfunction from antidepressants, even after they come off the drug - </p>

<p>a forum dedicated to people with permanent sexual dysfunction after antidepressant use - <a href="http://www.pssdforum.com/viewforum.php?f=5">http://www.pssdforum.com/viewforum.php?f=5</a></p>

<p>And despite more people being diagnosed and treated with antidepressants than ever, disability continues to rise from mental illness, and things are actually a lot worse.</p>

<p>There is definitely a stigma towards treatment for mental health, and I think that is shitty. But an unfortunate truth we&#39;re going to face up to is a lot of our treatments aren&#39;t amazing. We need mental health reform big time. I have first hand experience with this. There&#39;s a narrative going on that you see a psychiatrist and you just get better, but it&#39;s not the case. 
These drugs barely out perform placebos in clinical studies. It&#39;s fucked up what&#39;s going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree and I&#39;m very glad to see someone else who shares this perspective. I took antidepressants for about four years on/off throughout high school and early college. I&#39;ve never felt the same. I feel constantly dull and empty. And sex feels like nothing. I really don&#39;t know what happened to me. There was a lot of other shit going on in my life at that time so I&#39;m not certain precisely what caused the change; but honestly, antidepressants are my best guess.</p>

<p>I really sucks because, not only are the symptoms horrible, but people couldn&#39;t be more dismissive. If you even mention in passing that you think antidepressants have harmed you, you&#39;ll be written off as crazy before you even finish explaining what happened. People are stuck in this mindset that there is this disease called &quot;depression&quot; which can pretty much cause any conceivable symptom, yet cannot be measured   by any empirical test. If you claim that an antidepressant harmed you, your symptoms are immediately attributed to your &quot;underlying depression&quot;.</p>

<p>IME, exercise, a healthy diet (ruling out food allergies is absolutely huge), meditation, and simply facing the anxiety are the best ways to overcome it. &quot;Follow the anxiety&quot; is the advice I remember reading, and I had great results with it. Therapy is also invaluable; often times, we simply need an outside party to pick apart our often skewed inner thoughts.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like most conspiracies I think it ultimately has to do with money. Antidepressants won&#39;t make you any more of a sheep than you already are. By which I mean if you believe official MSM narratives you will probably continue to do so and alternately if you believe the illuminati are making frogs gay then you&#39;re still going to.</p>

<p>What is going on is that deaths that may have resulted from SSRIs being prescribed (a lot the school shootings) are ignored or straight up covered upped. All medications have side effects but when you have a reaction to penicillin the only one at risk is usually just the patient. When you have side effects to something that messes with your brain chemistry you put the public at possible risk. It gets even more gross when pharmaceuticals companies and law enforcement agencies then work to ban medications (drugs like MDMA, LSD, ect) that may be just as or more effective as conventional antidepressants with less side effects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have depression and anxiety, I used to take xanax but stopped. I was starting to become impossible to deal with. I would go into angry mode every time someone tried to have a conversation with me.</p>

<p>I went to the doctor and he prescribed me antidepressants. 
It changes me less than a weed joint would, but overall makes my moods more stable. </p>

<p>For the first weeks I noticed the effects, I would have very light sleep and wake up multiples times during the night and would wake up super early. When I stop taking them because I forget (two to three days) I get these electric shocks and dizziness.</p>

<p>But overall I rarely get anxiety and I am in my normal mood again. I have days where I&#39;m angry because I get pissed off like any other person would, I  have my lazy stay at home days and I have active days where I go outside with my friends. Without the medication I would have anxiety, be angry all the time and would oversleep trying to avoid life. </p>

<p>So from my experience until now they haven&#39;t changed my personality, just made me more stable like I was before being depressed.</p>

Check out this paper: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172306/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172306/</a></p>

I do think that a lot of people with mental health issues actually have real biological problems (particularly in regards to schizophrenia - if someone is hallucinating, clearly they are suffering from a biological abnormality), however, modern medicine really has no meaningful understanding of   what those problems are. Imagine going to a doctor with a sore throat and him concluding, &quot;well, it looks like you have Throat Soreness Disorder&quot; and declining to perform any empirical tests.

    <div class="md"><p>The profitability is driving the diagnoses. It&#39;s highly unlikely that the industry will ever acknowledge any of what you&#39;ve said (all of which I completely concur). It&#39;s particularly troubling that children are being prescribed medications for &quot;mood disorders&quot; at such young ages. The long term effects are not known; yet we allow  children with still-developing bodies &amp; brains to ingest chemicals in order to emotionally &quot;stabilize&quot; them. As if normal adolescent angst and hormonally-driven mood changes are a flaw, something to correct, rather than allowing children the opportunity to learn self-regulation and strengthening their internal locus of control as they&#39;ve done for millenia.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken medications for depression and anxiety myself, and (not that an anecdotal case means much of anything) in my opinion they were not worth it. I developed an emotional dependency on the drugs in my early-mid 20&#39;s. I tried several types and while some did apparently &quot;help&quot; me (in that my mood/positivity improved and I had increased energy) the effect was NEVER lasting and would decline with ongoing use over time. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t taken medications in years; I have discovered a sugar-free (keto) diet and regular exercise has had a much greater impact on my mood and overall well-being. I actually was a bit shocked <em>how</em> much of an impact those simple changes had. 
I feel pretty strongly that the standard high-carb/high-fat diet and sedentary lifestyles are the root cause of many of the physical ailments but also the &quot;emotional&quot; issues many believe they experience. </p>

<p>Adrenal fatigue can cause depression.</p>

<p>High cortisol levels an can also cause anxiety/depression</p>

<p>So little seems to go into research of hormonal levels. Most doctors will not diagnose depression by taking samples and instead just prescribe treatment.</p>

<p>All of the above are things that could actually be tested. But they are usually just assumed instead and pills are prescribed. It is treated as a psychological issue instead of a medical issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t think they are a conspiracy to control you. They can work for some people, for others, they&#39;ll lead to suicidal or homicidal behavior. The problem with them is that we don&#39;t really understand depression, and we don&#39;t know why a lot of these medications work. With some more complicated illnesses (such as bipolar), everyone is a guinea pig, and the process of getting you on the right meds can be hell, and may not work at all. We still have a lot to learn about medicine, especially when it comes to mental health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antidepressants seem to be more of a band-aid. They tell you your neurotransmitters are too low/high and give you drugs without testing your levels or even trying to address any cause. The new thinking is that depression could be a reaction to chronic inflammation. Not every depressed person may have inflammation but there is definitely a need to study this angle more. Doing a keto diet and taking anti-inflammatory supplements helped me more than Wellbutrin and Clonazepam for 10 years ever did. Turmeric and CBD oil, good stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At times in my life, antidepressants (mainly SSRIs) have helped me, but it is my opinion that the prescribed dosages are usually too high.  I now take half of the dose for the SSRI that I am prescribed, and I have found that it is actually more effective for me and causes me less drowsiness.  Of course, it depends on the person.  Regarding whether antidepressants are part of a conspiracy, I am honestly not sure.  I did try to fight my last depressive episode without a pharmaceutical antidepressant, but I was losing the fight and became extremely suicidal, so I started taking an SSRI again.  I&#39;m less depressed now and I&#39;m far less suicidal than I was.  I did what I felt I needed to do to survive....  </p>

<p>Antidepressants are supposed to work by fixing a chemical imbalance, specifically, a lack of serotonin in the brain. Indeed, their supposed effectiveness is the primary evidence for the chemical imbalance theory. But <strong>analyses of the published data and the unpublished data that were hidden by drug companies reveals that most (if not all) of the benefits are due to the placebo effect.</strong> Some antidepressants increase serotonin levels, some decrease it, and some have no effect at all on serotonin. Nevertheless, they all show the same therapeutic benefit. Even the small statistical difference between antidepressants and placebos may be an enhanced placebo effect, due to the fact that most patients and doctors in clinical trials successfully break blind. <strong>The serotonin theory is as close as any theory in the history of science to having been proved wrong. Instead of curing depression, popular antidepressants may induce a biological vulnerability making people more likely to become depressed in the future.</strong>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personality and the sense of self is fluid. We tend to ignore and gloss over the fact that we act.are different in different situations. We have an internal narrative that gives us a felling that we are consistent through time. </p>

<p>That being said, anti-depressants can lead to noticeable changes in personality and feelings. It&#39;s a trade off for not being depressed. A common experience is feeling &quot;better&quot; after taking medication and then deciding you don&#39;t need it. Often people discover being off anti-depressants how truly sad and incapacitated they have been. </p>

<p>Your entire upbringing and most of your everyday experiences (advertising, entertainment, interaction with others, media, etc) put you under &quot;their&quot; control.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the only conspiracy there is drug companies overstating results and understating side effects. I took some SSRIs years ago, and at first it was effective (I think).  I felt like things were brighter colors got better, literally.  Then came the side effects.  The sexual dysfunction is bizarre, it&#39;s not a decrease in libido, or even ED, more like some kind of extreme delayed ejaculation problem.  The vivid dreams sound fun when you are just talking about it but it&#39;s not if it persists.  It&#39;s not so much that you have nightmares, it&#39;s that the memories don&#39;t fade normally.  I would find myself 2 or three days later thinking I had definitely done something, told somebody something, and then find out I hadn&#39;t. Worse sometimes I would feel distinct and real guilt about something that hadn&#39;t happened, and not be sure if it had.  You start to doubt yourself and you can&#39;t really ask, because it would make you seem crazy. I stopped taking them, had more problems with depression about a year later. I briefly started again, and had even more problems.  All the same but then additionally my suicidal ideations just turned into constant anger and homicidal ideations.  I got scared of that and just stopped and didn&#39;t go back to that doctor.  It took a long time but the thing that really pulled me out was an long and difficult struggle to improve my life situation.  I now have a lot of theories about depression, but none of them involve this crazy random happenstance where you just need drugs to make your brain balance right.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty much just the blog of one guy, but most of it is quality content on how fucked the pharma game is.</p>

<p>Regarding the topic of anti-depressants specifically; <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17">Oxford scientists published a meta-study in The Lancet of 522 anti-depressant trials comprising 116 477 participants</a>32802-7/abstract0. That&#39;s a fucking lot. They found: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>46 (9%) of 522 trials were rated as high risk of bias, 380 (73%) trials as moderate, and 96 (18%) as low; and the certainty of evidence was moderate to very low.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that bias/uncertain evidence was demonstrated in studies that <em>didn&#39;t</em> examine treatment-resistant depression. If the lower-hanging-fruit is that hard for them to hit, what does that say about their efficacy against treatment-resistant depression?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no conspiracy as such, except Big Pharma&#39;s need to sell anti-depressants. Depression is real, don&#39;t get me wrong. But what&#39;s happened is that some uncomfortable emotions <em>that can cause depression</em> -- grief, isolation, disillusionment -- have become pathologised in themselves.</p>

<p>We now go to the doctor to get our emotions &quot;fixed.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a real dilemma for the vast majority of deeply unhappy people. They cannot withdraw from the world entirely, so they need something to keep them functioning. A &quot;damper&quot; on those painful feelings serves that purpose fairly well and can keep you ticking along.</p>

<p>The alternative is to just quit the thing that is making you so unhappy, if you possibly can. But most people are tied so tightly to their miserable jobs, doomed marriages, toxic friendships, and what-have-you, that this isn&#39;t an option.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a problem of modernity, and it&#39;s far older than anti-depressants. Ever wondered where the complimentary saying &quot;well-adjusted&quot; originated? Look it up, you&#39;ll be surprised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>A lot of my depression seems to have been exacerbated by misuse of MDMA and I tried microdosing LSD for about two months, however I didn&#39;t care for the results after about a month; I felt more emotionally volatile and distracted despite the energy increase I experienced.</li>
<li>Antidepressants do work for some, but my experience was that they made things worse regardless of what I tried and I think pharmaceutical companies are more concerned with perpetuating treatment rather than curing or identifying the roots of specific problems. The impact of side effects on the patient is sometimes greater than that of the drug&#39;s benefit and may require more medication to combat. </li>
</ol>

<p>Psychoactive recreational drugs are good for allowing yourself the occasional life lesson, and weed has helped with my depression but is easy to abuse and is just another way to drain your income as much as I support it.</p>

<p>TLDR: Try to find other things besides drugs that will help you, I&#39;ve regretted both my drug habits and my prescriptions almost every step of the way. </p>

<p>There have been little to no long term studies on these drugs. Any study that says they work only measured that for 8 weeks after ingesting the drug. If you&#39;re on more than one psychiatric drug, the combined use of them has never been studied properly.
