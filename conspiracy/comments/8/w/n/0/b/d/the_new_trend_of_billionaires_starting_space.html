       Elon Musk has Space X, Jeff Bezos has Blue Origin, Richard Branson has Virgin Galactic. They've been very keen to construct a narrative in the media that they're just having fun and living out childhood dreams, but these businesses require huge investments and the super rich don't like to part with their money lightly, it seems reasonable to assume there is an alterior motive (I believe this desire to cover his true intentions is why Musk is so keen to be seen doing large scale public good projects eg restoring power to Puerto Rico). 
Now Trump has announced the new space wing of the armed forces who, like all other aspects of US defence, will require huge industrial spending to run, could it be that these billionaires are simply trying to establish well known space technology companies that can then supply the demands of this new space defence force? Advancements in nuclear technology lead to a nuclear arms race, the same is almost certainly true of space technology. It seems to me as if they're not merely looking to supply a pre existing demand for space technology, but to create technological innovations which will inevitably create a demand for space technology from the military which they will then be able to supply, at an immense cost, of course.

       its a race to colonize the moon then mars because earth is going to become a living shithole considering we are in a population explosion and need to doublt food production to feed all the people on Earth by 2070. Not gonna happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       MF's are going to fight water and food wars, China is already in war with U.S. over tariffs, and economic one, and are slowly buying out london, NZ, Aus and African resources, companies, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile Israel's wars in the M.E. using U.S. Military, then we have russia vs U.S. with nukes pointed at each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit going to get fucking nuts on earth by 2070 and people will start hunting CEO's

       One solitary country has gone to the Moon many decades ago, and then hasn't gone back since. In 1969 one country went, but no other country has gone since. Do you call that a race? Now they talk about nonsensically skipping the Moon altogether and going straight to Mars to "colonize." Like you said, not gonna happen.

       I don't know too much about underground bunkers or cities other than mostly rumors. I would recommend starting with this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ3i_cf_Wyo">
        video
       </a>
       which is a talk given by Richard Dolan back in 2011. It hits on some high points and gives a nice overview of a few different interesting topics. I'd advise skipping to about the 10 minute mark. That's where it really starts to get interesting (to me anyway).

       Not so. There's plenty of government documentation confirming the existence of UFOs and the government's interest in the phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also plenty of whistleblowers who have seen actual vehicles built by Lockheed and others that are capable of fantastic things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly don't mean to offend, but IMO, you have it exactly backwards. Everything else is an illusion to deflect from knowledge of these things precisely. I believe this is the greatest secret in the (known) history of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you this. Do you really believe the government would allow private industry to own cutting edge tech that could then be used to either leverage vast amounts of money from government or, worse yet, subvert or replace government's power?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ask me, what we're seeing with Space X, VG, and the like is outsourced distraction to take away from the really interesting and exotic devices the government has been using longer than most of us have been alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out the work of historian and UFO researcher Richard Dolan. It's fascinating
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       he has government documentation to back up his claims.

       I believe in UFOs but in the sense that it is advanced technology the military or whatever already have and they use them sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically anything “alien related” I believe is going to be and always has been manufactured by the government to trick people into believing in “outer space”
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in the theory that the stars are in the firmament of Earth and is nothing more than a beautiful background created by the creator of this “simulation” we live in called Earth.

       You are, of course entitled to your opinion, although I respectfully disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the government has gone out of it's way to deny the existence of any such thing or, until very recently, to deny any interest in the phenomenon, it seems to me that government has tried very hard to distance itself from anything concerning UFOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in the creator too and I think to say that this is it, given the complexity and subtlety and utter genius of the form, sells said creator far short of demonstrated potential and ability. I would never assume to know the mind of God, the creator, or whatever you wish to call such an entity. I believe the wonder we can see and hardly grasp is only the very tip of something so immense and beautiful we couldn't possibly begin to fathom the breadth and scope of all the possibilities.  I believe to say this is it is actually an insult to such an entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also am forced to believe (at least somewhat) in simulation theory because the facts and chance actually favor the hypothesis. No proof of course. That seems to be a recurring theme.

       As above, I would recommend familiarizing yourself with the work of Richard Dolan. There's a substantial government paper trail indicating that, as was stated to the head of the CIA in the 1950s "they are here and they are real."

       I read it but in simulation theory, the stars being just an advanced background for our simulation created by God makes and resonates 100% more than the outer space lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outer space is a lie so NASA can fund Black Ops while keeping the public dreaming of stupid shit like “we need to get off this planet before it’s too late” or “I want to be an astronaut when I grow up!”

       I would be happy to read anything you could link on the subject. I never discount anything out of hand. I'm a prove it and I'll believe it type of person. I've seen absolutely nothing to discount the existence of space. I'm sure the mechanics of how things operate in space is suspect because the former head of Lockheed Skunkworks, Ben Rich, said as much on several different occasions before his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe in God but that doesn't mean I discount science out of hand. I believe it would be incredibly foolish to do so given all the current benefits from scientific innovation which we use every day (the computers we're using to have this conversation as a prime example).

       You should look into possibilities of this being a positive thing for humanity.  Even the space force.  If the US were to build a

       , how would we defend that infrastructure without a military force.  People are so focused on the negative, that they cant see how these things would be positive for humanity.  Whats stopping anyone from this reddit from becoming a billionaire and doing this?  Only yourselves

       Its the inevitable progression of a civilization capable of space flight. First military and industrial infrastructure followed by commercial ventures and limited living environments. Eventually you will have colonies on the moon and other bodies. It is only natural that the most publicly wealthy people will be the first to build out major public ventures. Keep in mind that space has been being built out for decades by the military industrial complex in secret.

       All these rich guys might have programs and what not but you're forgetting that they will never have the true military force of that of say a super power country wothva so program. NASA may be a public company, but do you think that means the U.S. Air Force is not the ones running it from inside?

       After a certain age and accumulation of wealth it's not uncommon for people to look to do something besides making more money. To do something beyond the mundane and something bigger than themselves.

       which is a talk given by Richard Dolan back in 2011. It hits on some high points and gives a nice overview of a few different interesting topics. I'd advise skipping to about the 10 minute mark. That's where it really starts to get interesting (to me anyway).
