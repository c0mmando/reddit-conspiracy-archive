        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I listen to a lot of youtube videos on my phone while I&#39;m just doing stuff around the house, like washing dishes or cleaning or whatever. I started noticing that it would start serving me ads related to things I&#39;ve talked about while having it open. The first time I noticed it was when I talked to my husband about how he could track his expenses and miles while working. Immediately after it started suggesting stuff like QuickBooks and apps that track that stuff. I thought it was weird, but I brushed it off. I figured I probably searched for business related stuff and picked up some third party cookies or something. Then another time not too long later my husband and I were talking about him getting a motorcycle - it was a joke conversation, he was mostly trolling me, but shortly after I started getting Harley ads. I knew for a fact I&#39;ve literally never searched for or researched motorcycles before anywhere. Since then it has happened multiple times with things I am absolutely positive I have never bought or searched for online, and they are all way to specific to be coincidence: we had a conversation about possibly buying a treadmill and then there were constant ads for it after. We talked about switching shampoo and there were constant adds for it. So, I decided to try and test it. I spent a decent chunk of time opening and closing youtube and loading videos and stuff repeating &quot;I need to buy a house&quot; &quot;I want to buy a house&quot; &quot;I need a realator.&quot; And within 15 minutes it was showing me ads for relators, real-estate lawyers, and house related stuff.</p>

<p>I know this sounds kind of nuts, but I&#39;m a pretty down to earth person. I really thought it was third party tracking, or stuff like that at first, but it is definitely YouTube. Also, so you know this isn&#39;t like me cherry picking videos, it isn&#39;t like I said something about treadmills and then a week later there&#39;s one video for treadmills. Shortly after having a conversation with YouTube open where the topic is something new, novel, and possibly commerce related ads for that thing start dominating the ads it targets me with. Like, I got ads for QuickBooks and workout stuff for weeks after that happened. It isn&#39;t cherry picking - it is consistent.</p>

<p>I wanted to raise awareness, but I also want to find out how I could confirm or deny this. I&#39;m a pretty technical person - I write web apps for a living - but I&#39;m not really a network diagnostics person. I thought about running wireshark or something, and having my phone use the wifi sharing on my PC, but I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;d be looking for. I&#39;m crap at networking. If I could find some kind of proof maybe I could send it to a media outlet or something and get some attention on it. People thought FB was using the mic for a while to target ads and they denied it - I don&#39;t believe they were FWIW - but I do think YouTube, and probably other places in Google, are but no one has asked them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe if anyone here knows about mobile development, or lower level Android stuff, they could suggest a way to do this on-phone. My wireshark plan is pretty baroque, and would inhibit other people from attempting it. I think it would need to be something lots of people could try.</p>

<p>But, the other problem is that YouTube rolls out featues to subsets of their user base for testing. So, just because it does this to me doesn&#39;t mean it does it to everyone. I purposely skip all ads, and refuse to fill out all surveys and stuff, so audio could be an ad serving mechanism of last resort for difficult people like me. I guess what I&#39;m saying is, even if I could produce some kind of evidence there are too many variables at play to say whether or not other people could even reproduce it if they wanted to. There&#39;s no reason to assume that a feature active for one YT user is active for all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no developer or scriptkid, but someone mentioned LinageOS with MicroG above here. I&#39;ve been reading about it and from what I can tell, MicroG spoofs the signature of google so that the Google apps that require GPS installed, &quot;think&quot; they are installed, when in fact it is not. Maybe you could use this the other way around, to test if Youtube still customizes ads based on your phrases, when not connected to Google. At least you would know if it was client-sided or not, right? </p>

<p>Thank you for making this thread by the way, it&#39;s been an interesting read and I&#39;ve learned a lot, both from you and other commenters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I think about it, the more I don&#39;t think I can prove it - if by &quot;prove it&quot; I mean generate evidence via a methodology other people could repeat. I updated the past with some problems I realized after talking to people on here, but I&#39;ll paste here for you:</p>

<p>&quot;Additional difficulties that basically mean I can&#39;t ever prove it: YouTube rolls features out to subsets of users for testing. There&#39;s no reason to assume just because I have this feature, everyone does. It means that if I created some procedure people could follow they might find nothing and then I look like a loon or a liar. Also, I&#39;m a difficult customer. I don&#39;t use Google&#39;s other products so they have no ad data on me, I purposefully skip every ad as soon as I can, and I refuse to answer any of their surveys - for all I know the mic mining could be an ad targeting system of last resort - so, again, just because I&#39;m seeing it means not everyone would. Thus, like one of the commenters said, making it my word against &quot;Don&#39;t Be Evil&quot; Google. &quot;</p>

<p>So, yeah - even IF I could produce &quot;evidence&quot; I&#39;d just be someone on the internet with a claim and some WAV files. Whoop dee doo. I wouldn&#39;t believe me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have mic disabled for YouTube. If they are doing this they might not be doing it above the board. And seeing as though Google develops both the OS and the app, who&#39;s to say they can&#39;t get past the security restrictions. &quot;But Android is open source!&quot; Yes, but the Google apps aren&#39;t, and more importantly the &quot;Google Services for Android&quot; aren&#39;t and those are required to be installed and operating for Google apps to run.

<p>That&#39;s where I kind of think you&#39;re going off the rails. If they are tracking using voice to text (which could be done on the phone, without uploading audio to YouTube, which would make it much harder to use wireShark) that&#39;s one thing. But if they&#39;re circumventing security limits of the device, that&#39;s a recipe for bad press and I doubt Google would stoop that low. (Fb on the other hand would do it and then say oops).</p>

<p>A third possibility is that they don&#39;t use the Mic <em>directly</em>, but if there is a speech to text service on the phone, maybe they circumvent it that way. I&#39;d be surprised,  but it&#39;s possible. </p>

<p>Another thing to try is test it again with really unlikely things. Like &quot;fishing poles, ice fishing, ocean fishing&quot; presuming you never do those things. Try three total and if you see ads for all 3, that&#39;s not a coincidence. I&#39;d make a video of it too if you can. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, small recordings of low sample rate audio are tiny, especially if compressed. 1 second of 16Kbps MP# audio is 2KB - smaller than a lot of Javascript libraries. If the phone is doing the work of isolating the audio and compressing it then it would be small.</p>

<p>That said, you can take the audio out of the equation all together. I realized this a couple minutes ago. If the phone was doing the feature selection and encoding then it would only need to send an observation vector for the suggestion algorithm to work off. That could be super small and would just look like binary noise. AFAICT this only happens when the app has focus and the screen is on - it would be easy enough for it to be looking for wake words (probably stuff related to commerce, like &quot;buy&quot;), record a second of audio, and then do the feature selection and encoding right there on the phone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A semi competent network engineer would also know that it would never be about audio data. It will not send audio anywhere. People are &quot;sceptical&quot; because they are ignorant and naive as hell.<br/>
What your phone will send is data based on audio not the audio file itself. It will only look for certain keywords such as car, bike, door, school, storm, bedsheets, anything that has a market.  The sent data will only have the size of bytes (most likely it contains keywords and date stamp) encrypted. The upload date of these small data can be badically anything. It might send it right after the analyzed audio, or even few hours later or at phone startup etc. No one really knows how does it work exactly but it does work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an S8, and I don&#39;t get ads served to me in the way everyone talks about, now that I think about it. I know it is a real thing, but I imagine it is because I deny all permissions that I can as apps are installed. If an app has undesirable behavior, I can always review the permissions as needed.</p>

<p>In particular, I have FB messenger restricted to text only. I don&#39;t use fb myself, but need to use my wife&#39;s account to keep in contact with her friends and family. I was extremely reticent to installing this app, because of this exact issue. But I denied it access to media. I can&#39;t do voice calls or upload directly from my camera. If I try, it requests media access.</p>

<p>Might look at that if you are bothered by them always listening in.</p>

<p>While I know apps are accessing mics and cameras, I also think in 95% of the cases when people think they are, they are actually using metadata and consumer predictive algorithms. People that are afraid of voice being recorded should be terrified of all the analytics done on metadata of everything they do and what companies share with eachother. Metadata is CHEAP and gives sooo much information people don&#39;t even realize. Decoding voice and especially video is EXPENSIVE. Most of the time there is not even a reason to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are other possibilities too. Google knows things like who you are in proximity to, so they can do things like show you ads for products that people you were near searched for.</p>

<p>So, for example, if your husband saw a motorcycle ad go by in a feed he was scrolling, and then paused or scrolled back up, then continued scrolling, the ad trackers would notice that there is some level of interest in that topic at that moment and note that in his ad profile. Since you hang out with him a lot and Google can see that (your phones frequently connect from the same source networks, or maybe you have geolocation turned on) they&#39;ll guess that maybe you might also be interested in motorcycles at the same time, and start showing you similar ads.</p>

<p>They have lots of other ways to guess about what you might be interested it too. That can make it very difficult to do tests because most of the things you can think of to test with, like real estate, tend to be things that you would think of, and ad systems are very good at guessing what sort of things you think about.</p>

<p>So to do a test, you probably need to do several tests using a strong random source to generate several topics from an off-line source. For example, grab a dead-tree dictionary and some dice. Roll many times to generate a list of page numbers, then go to those pages in the dictionary and toss something onto the page to select a random word. After generating a list (on paper) of about 30 random items (maybe skew it toward things you&#39;d expect there to be advertisers for, you&#39;ll get null results if you are testing with stuff nobody sells), do your audio test over a few days, saying several phrases with the names of your test items. Maybe use phrases that include &#39;I wonder&#39;, &#39;I want&#39;, &#39;I need&#39;, &#39;What is a&#39; and such that one might expect to be triggers.</p>

<p>Then keep track of the ads you see for the next few days. Any time stuff for the things in your test list show up, indicate that on your test list.</p>

<p>You could also divide the list in half and have someone you are often near do several searches over a couple of days for half the items, then see if you start seeing those items more often than the other half.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good possibility, especially on phones that include hardware designed for listening for wake-words. I&#39;m not a phone expert of any sort, but in the past some phones had hardware features that allowed them to listen for certain keywords using dedicated hardware. This prevents the wake-word feature consuming too much power. Misbehaved apps could probably use that feature for themselves (I kind of doubt that base Android has anything like that built in, but few phones actually run that, and I&#39;m sure there are numerous unknown root vulnerabilities in various vendor distributions that apps could exploit to set up such monitoring).</p>

<p>It may also be processing the audio on the phone itself rather than sending the recording of what you&#39;re saying up to the cloud.

<p>No. Not entirely true. The recordings I found on my activity were conversations I was having at work, home, in the car, etc.. and had nothing at all to do with the OK google activity. I barely use the OK google activity and don&#39;t have the microphone icon on my front screen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure if anyone is suggesting here that it is uploading conversations constantly. Obviously people would see that in their data plans. Are people suggesting that?</p>

<p>I think what most are suggesting is that there are a list of &#39;wake words&#39; for advertising. These wake words would be recorded locally and processed locally, only sending metadata out to be used for advertising.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to record constantly.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that I program it remotely to set a wake word for &#39;bomb&#39;. Every time it hears the word &#39;bomb&#39;, it begins recording a snippet just like it would have if I said &#39;Ok, Google&#39;. Except in the former case, it passes that info quietly to a different server.</p>

<p>Al it would require is a small download to update the list of words to listen for.</p>

<p>I personally believe that it is only being used for advertising. I could see it being used by the government (now or in the future) in just the way I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Storage is trivial limitation for big companies especially if they&#39;re in bed with the military. I recorded one Skype conversation with a client and an hour of MP3 audio turned out around 60 MB. Last year I bought a 2 TB external hard disk for $150. Do the math. </p>

<p>The way it works is that they anonymize information but still keep it under an alias that isn&#39;t the person&#39;s name. For example, instead of tracking Reddit user monkeyfear I assign you ID 17885 and collate all your data with that ID. Voila, it&#39;s not a surveillance!</p>

<p>I had a session last year in which my client mentioned an obscure programming language. This is not something I had ever heard of or researched, and it was brought up by name only once or twice.</p>

<p>I freaked when the next day, Amazon sent me an email with recommended books for said programming language.</p>

<p>Since then, I have a no phone policy in my office and ask clients to put their phones in a Faraday bag at the front office. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As u/arnkk mentioned, try tuning your radio to a different language and let your phone sit with Youtube open next to it. I heard other people testing it out and resulting in ads in matching language.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try this experiment.  Works every time.  </p>

<p>Assuming you don’t have a pet, just start talking; couple times a day about said pet saying key words like BUY, NEED, WANT etc.  Do this for a couple days and I guarantee you will get your answer. </p>

<p>Ex:  I need to go get some cat food
Ex: I want to get the cat a better bed
Ex: the cat needs to stop scratching my furniture </p>

<p>They do indeed monitor your actions and this is a foolproof way to see it in action first hand </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The more I think about it, the more I don&#39;t think I can prove it - if by &quot;prove it&quot; I mean generate evidence via a methodology other people could repeat. I updated the past with some problems I realized after talking to people on here, but I&#39;ll paste here for you:</p>

<p>&quot;Additional difficulties that basically mean I can&#39;t ever prove it: YouTube rolls features out to subsets of users for testing. There&#39;s no reason to assume just because I have this feature, everyone does. It means that if I created some procedure people could follow they might find nothing and then I look like a loon or a liar. Also, I&#39;m a difficult customer. I don&#39;t use Google&#39;s other products so they have no ad data on me, I purposefully skip every ad as soon as I can, and I refuse to answer any of their surveys - for all I know the mic mining could be an ad targeting system of last resort - so, again, just because I&#39;m seeing it means not everyone would. Thus, like one of the commenters said, making it my word against &quot;Don&#39;t Be Evil&quot; Google. &quot;</p>

<p>So, yeah - even IF I could produce &quot;evidence&quot; I&#39;d just be someone on the internet with a claim and some WAV files. Whoop dee doo. I wouldn&#39;t believe me.</p>
