       I listen to a lot of youtube videos on my phone while I'm just doing stuff around the house, like washing dishes or cleaning or whatever. I started noticing that it would start serving me ads related to things I've talked about while having it open. The first time I noticed it was when I talked to my husband about how he could track his expenses and miles while working. Immediately after it started suggesting stuff like QuickBooks and apps that track that stuff. I thought it was weird, but I brushed it off. I figured I probably searched for business related stuff and picked up some third party cookies or something. Then another time not too long later my husband and I were talking about him getting a motorcycle - it was a joke conversation, he was mostly trolling me, but shortly after I started getting Harley ads. I knew for a fact I've literally never searched for or researched motorcycles before anywhere. Since then it has happened multiple times with things I am absolutely positive I have never bought or searched for online, and they are all way to specific to be coincidence: we had a conversation about possibly buying a treadmill and then there were constant ads for it after. We talked about switching shampoo and there were constant adds for it. So, I decided to try and test it. I spent a decent chunk of time opening and closing youtube and loading videos and stuff repeating "I need to buy a house" "I want to buy a house" "I need a realator." And within 15 minutes it was showing me ads for relators, real-estate lawyers, and house related stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this sounds kind of nuts, but I'm a pretty down to earth person. I really thought it was third party tracking, or stuff like that at first, but it is definitely YouTube. Also, so you know this isn't like me cherry picking videos, it isn't like I said something about treadmills and then a week later there's one video for treadmills. Shortly after having a conversation with YouTube open where the topic is something new, novel, and possibly commerce related ads for that thing start dominating the ads it targets me with. Like, I got ads for QuickBooks and workout stuff for weeks after that happened. It isn't cherry picking - it is consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to raise awareness, but I also want to find out how I could confirm or deny this. I'm a pretty technical person - I write web apps for a living - but I'm not really a network diagnostics person. I thought about running wireshark or something, and having my phone use the wifi sharing on my PC, but I don't even know what I'd be looking for. I'm crap at networking. If I could find some kind of proof maybe I could send it to a media outlet or something and get some attention on it. People thought FB was using the mic for a while to target ads and they denied it - I don't believe they were FWIW - but I do think YouTube, and probably other places in Google, are but no one has asked them.

       It is really tough to prove as its basically your word against google's. (As in how do you prove you didn't previously search for motorcycles)...

       But, if enough people treat it as a scientific study with controls and perhaps university oversight, it could potentially proven or at least brought to many user's attention

       Maybe if anyone here knows about mobile development, or lower level Android stuff, they could suggest a way to do this on-phone. My wireshark plan is pretty baroque, and would inhibit other people from attempting it. I think it would need to be something lots of people could try.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, the other problem is that YouTube rolls out featues to subsets of their user base for testing. So, just because it does this to me doesn't mean it does it to everyone. I purposely skip all ads, and refuse to fill out all surveys and stuff, so audio could be an ad serving mechanism of last resort for difficult people like me. I guess what I'm saying is, even if I could produce some kind of evidence there are too many variables at play to say whether or not other people could even reproduce it if they wanted to. There's no reason to assume that a feature active for one YT user is active for all.

       Every Google app requires that Google Play Services be installed. GPS is closed source and unauditable. Google is the OS vendor. I think it is possible that they could have something in GPS that disables some OS checks for their apps.

       I'm no developer or scriptkid, but someone mentioned LinageOS with MicroG above here. I've been reading about it and from what I can tell, MicroG spoofs the signature of google so that the Google apps that require GPS installed, "think" they are installed, when in fact it is not. Maybe you could use this the other way around, to test if Youtube still customizes ads based on your phrases, when not connected to Google. At least you would know if it was client-sided or not, right?

       The more I think about it, the more I don't think I can prove it - if by "prove it" I mean generate evidence via a methodology other people could repeat. I updated the past with some problems I realized after talking to people on here, but I'll paste here for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Additional difficulties that basically mean I can't ever prove it: YouTube rolls features out to subsets of users for testing. There's no reason to assume just because I have this feature, everyone does. It means that if I created some procedure people could follow they might find nothing and then I look like a loon or a liar. Also, I'm a difficult customer. I don't use Google's other products so they have no ad data on me, I purposefully skip every ad as soon as I can, and I refuse to answer any of their surveys - for all I know the mic mining could be an ad targeting system of last resort - so, again, just because I'm seeing it means not everyone would. Thus, like one of the commenters said, making it my word against "Don't Be Evil" Google. "
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah - even IF I could produce "evidence" I'd just be someone on the internet with a claim and some WAV files. Whoop dee doo. I wouldn't believe me.

       That's creepy - but could it be geolocation? Like, your employer might pay to have ads served to people near their locations. Not that is any less creepy than voice, but just throwing it out there.

       set it next to a radio or the tv or any audio source playing in a different language. If adds start appearing in that language its not 100% proof but it would be close enough.  Or just block the apps accs to the mic.

       I have mic disabled for YouTube. If they are doing this they might not be doing it above the board. And seeing as though Google develops both the OS and the app, who's to say they can't get past the security restrictions. "But Android is open source!" Yes, but the Google apps aren't, and more importantly the "Google Services for Android" aren't and those are required to be installed and operating for Google apps to run. For all we know these contain a backdoor for Google's apps to use capabilities without permission. But, no way to prove any of that.

       That's where I kind of think you're going off the rails. If they are tracking using voice to text (which could be done on the phone, without uploading audio to YouTube, which would make it much harder to use wireShark) that's one thing. But if they're circumventing security limits of the device, that's a recipe for bad press and I doubt Google would stoop that low. (Fb on the other hand would do it and then say oops).
      </p>
      <p>
       A third possibility is that they don't use the Mic
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       , but if there is a speech to text service on the phone, maybe they circumvent it that way. I'd be surprised,  but it's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to try is test it again with really unlikely things. Like "fishing poles, ice fishing, ocean fishing" presuming you never do those things. Try three total and if you see ads for all 3, that's not a coincidence. I'd make a video of it too if you can.

       A semi competent network engineer would have no problem tracing traffic from an app to prove this theory.  Audio data isn't insignificant. That's why people are skeptical of these kind of claims.

       So, small recordings of low sample rate audio are tiny, especially if compressed. 1 second of 16Kbps MP# audio is 2KB - smaller than a lot of Javascript libraries. If the phone is doing the work of isolating the audio and compressing it then it would be small.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, you can take the audio out of the equation all together. I realized this a couple minutes ago. If the phone was doing the feature selection and encoding then it would only need to send an observation vector for the suggestion algorithm to work off. That could be super small and would just look like binary noise. AFAICT this only happens when the app has focus and the screen is on - it would be easy enough for it to be looking for wake words (probably stuff related to commerce, like "buy"), record a second of audio, and then do the feature selection and encoding right there on the phone.

       A semi competent network engineer would also know that it would never be about audio data. It will not send audio anywhere. People are "sceptical" because they are ignorant and naive as hell.
       <br/>
       What your phone will send is data based on audio not the audio file itself. It will only look for certain keywords such as car, bike, door, school, storm, bedsheets, anything that has a market.  The sent data will only have the size of bytes (most likely it contains keywords and date stamp) encrypted. The upload date of these small data can be badically anything. It might send it right after the analyzed audio, or even few hours later or at phone startup etc. No one really knows how does it work exactly but it does work.

       I have an S8, and I don't get ads served to me in the way everyone talks about, now that I think about it. I know it is a real thing, but I imagine it is because I deny all permissions that I can as apps are installed. If an app has undesirable behavior, I can always review the permissions as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular, I have FB messenger restricted to text only. I don't use fb myself, but need to use my wife's account to keep in contact with her friends and family. I was extremely reticent to installing this app, because of this exact issue. But I denied it access to media. I can't do voice calls or upload directly from my camera. If I try, it requests media access.

       If you root android, you can tell in the software when apps are accessing hardware. I don't know why this hasn't been done more to prove this.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I know apps are accessing mics and cameras, I also think in 95% of the cases when people think they are, they are actually using metadata and consumer predictive algorithms. People that are afraid of voice being recorded should be terrified of all the analytics done on metadata of everything they do and what companies share with eachother. Metadata is CHEAP and gives sooo much information people don't even realize. Decoding voice and especially video is EXPENSIVE. Most of the time there is not even a reason to do it.

       With stuff like wake words for personal assistant apps could you even tell? Phoned with google assistant ship with a chip that can do passive listening, and it can be programmed. Would an app registering a wakeword and then recording audio even show up the same was that, like, a voice recorder app or something does?

       You wouldn't be able to tell the difference if that app had a wake word but usually the wake words are the android system accessing the mic. You can tell by app so you'd still other apps accessing it. If you are worried about the android system you'd have to disable the wake words though.

       There are other possibilities too. Google knows things like who you are in proximity to, so they can do things like show you ads for products that people you were near searched for.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, for example, if your husband saw a motorcycle ad go by in a feed he was scrolling, and then paused or scrolled back up, then continued scrolling, the ad trackers would notice that there is some level of interest in that topic at that moment and note that in his ad profile. Since you hang out with him a lot and Google can see that (your phones frequently connect from the same source networks, or maybe you have geolocation turned on) they'll guess that maybe you might also be interested in motorcycles at the same time, and start showing you similar ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have lots of other ways to guess about what you might be interested it too. That can make it very difficult to do tests because most of the things you can think of to test with, like real estate, tend to be things that you would think of, and ad systems are very good at guessing what sort of things you think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to do a test, you probably need to do several tests using a strong random source to generate several topics from an off-line source. For example, grab a dead-tree dictionary and some dice. Roll many times to generate a list of page numbers, then go to those pages in the dictionary and toss something onto the page to select a random word. After generating a list (on paper) of about 30 random items (maybe skew it toward things you'd expect there to be advertisers for, you'll get null results if you are testing with stuff nobody sells), do your audio test over a few days, saying several phrases with the names of your test items. Maybe use phrases that include 'I wonder', 'I want', 'I need', 'What is a' and such that one might expect to be triggers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then keep track of the ads you see for the next few days. Any time stuff for the things in your test list show up, indicate that on your test list.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could also divide the list in half and have someone you are often near do several searches over a couple of days for half the items, then see if you start seeing those items more often than the other half.

       That's a good possibility, especially on phones that include hardware designed for listening for wake-words. I'm not a phone expert of any sort, but in the past some phones had hardware features that allowed them to listen for certain keywords using dedicated hardware. This prevents the wake-word feature consuming too much power. Misbehaved apps could probably use that feature for themselves (I kind of doubt that base Android has anything like that built in, but few phones actually run that, and I'm sure there are numerous unknown root vulnerabilities in various vendor distributions that apps could exploit to set up such monitoring).

       I would also use a brand new phone to do this with no apps installed or your phone completely reset to factory defaults and wiped. That will rule out any other 3rd party app transmitting it back to a google ads system or something like that too. Also don't sign in using any accounts to any apps so it can't pull down any ad profiles on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may also be processing the audio on the phone itself rather than sending the recording of what you're saying up to the cloud. Then once it has picked out key words from the conversation reporting back to the advertising service and requesting videos/ads that meet the keywords of what you said.

       Try going here and see if you can find any recordings with the terms you mentioned above. When I went there, there was a bunch of times that my seemed to have just recorded randomly. There were pieces of conversations I was having. Difficult to know what triggered those recordings, though.

       That will only display the voice recordings that were sent to their servers after the user manually activated a voice recognition event (by saying "ok google", or by accident which happens often when pressing for ex. the microphone icon on the keyboard) . If they do what is claimed they will probably keep it hidden.

       No. Not entirely true. The recordings I found on my activity were conversations I was having at work, home, in the car, etc.. and had nothing at all to do with the OK google activity. I barely use the OK google activity and don't have the microphone icon on my front screen.
      </p>

       I thought maybe I had google now set to always listen mode, but I cannot bring up google assistant by saying OK, google. I just tried it again.

       Yet, there are recordings from as recently as 3 days ago and they are snippets of me talking while at work.

       If they record your voice without your consent I think it is weird that they do not keep it hidden. A sniffer will probably not help as well as the traffic will be encrypted and it cannot easily analyze the traffic. I use a IDS/IPS and will check if my Android did anything weird as well. If you want to have more control over your device I can advice you to look at:

       I am not especially concerned myself, if they are only using the information to provide me ads through an automated system. I know there is a tradeoff if I want to use certain features/technologies. I have an Amazon Alexa in every room in the house.

       I agree, good that you are at least aware. It is always about seeking a balance between ease and security. Making things too inaccessible will sooner or later cause security issues (ex. password too difficult to remember? lets write it down on a paper).

       If you have google assistant on your phone (you most likely do) it will be listening all the time for the hotword, "ok, google". But in order to catch you saying those words, it must always be listening. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume that google could somehow use that feature to serve you with ads using other google apps like youtube.

       From what I understand Google Home is "always listening" locally for the wake word. It listens in 5 second chunks or so that are constantly being overwritten, but once you say the wake word it records your whole request and uploads it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of data it would take to constantly be uploading your conversations to the cloud would be enourmous.

       I am not sure if anyone is suggesting here that it is uploading conversations constantly. Obviously people would see that in their data plans. Are people suggesting that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what most are suggesting is that there are a list of 'wake words' for advertising. These wake words would be recorded locally and processed locally, only sending metadata out to be used for advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't have to record constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that I program it remotely to set a wake word for 'bomb'. Every time it hears the word 'bomb', it begins recording a snippet just like it would have if I said 'Ok, Google'. Except in the former case, it passes that info quietly to a different server.
      </p>
      <p>
       Al it would require is a small download to update the list of words to listen for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that it is only being used for advertising. I could see it being used by the government (now or in the future) in just the way I mentioned above.

       The problem with that is that if you have too many wake words there can be more false positives. Wake words need to be complex and unique so they know that they're being said.

       Storage is trivial limitation for big companies especially if they're in bed with the military. I recorded one Skype conversation with a client and an hour of MP3 audio turned out around 60 MB. Last year I bought a 2 TB external hard disk for $150. Do the math.

       yeah! the voice command feature is not a boon, it's actually you signing away your privacy totally, think! how will a computer know that your voice is commanding it to search something online? it HAS to convert everything you say from voice to text, so it has keywords, just like it would have had you typed everything you said. Oh man, gotta disable Siri, Google, Alexa

       You don't have to do this.  If someone hasn't already admitted it does this, someone will very soon and since we have already been living the lie.....people will graciously accept another layer of the surveilence state and all will be good again.  They won't even try to fight the encroachment because really.....no one has been hurt......yet, right?

       Once while my phone was open on instagram, my dad and I were discussing how my dog should eat better food. Then later I saw an ad for healthy dog food, without ever looking up dog food on my phone. Only discussing it while it was on an application

       This is a thing for sure. Today I recieved an ad for weighted blankets. I subject I had talked about during a phone conversation but never searched. Also in the past (when I had a google home speaker) I spoke about selling our house and a local realter added me on instagram less than an hour later. This is the beginning.. and more than likely they have been analyzing data like this for years now.

       its google, you are on Android ... they know everything you are doing. Your contacts, text messages, email (if gmail), your search, everything is being catalogued by the Big G. You are on their platform after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "Don't be Evil" that was never official policy, and has been dead for a few years already.
      </p>

       And proof ... no way, unless you reverse engineer Android. No one can pinpoint Facebook's mic hack, though its open knowledge they do. Now imagine the owners of the platform, who have direct access to the metal.

       The way it works is that they anonymize information but still keep it under an alias that isn't the person's name. For example, instead of tracking Reddit user monkeyfear I assign you ID 17885 and collate all your data with that ID. Voila, it's not a surveillance!

       Craziest one for me (which may have been a coincidence, or maybe not): I was sick at home and had the shits, couldn't get off the toilet. My ass literally hurt to wipe. So I'm sitting on the toilet for the 10th time that day scrolling through Instagram, dreading having to get up and clean myself, and what do I get an ad for? A motherfucking bidet. I wasn't Googling it, I wasn't even talking about it or anything like a bidet.
      </p>

       At the time I laughed pretty hard about it, looking back though maybe something more sinister was at play.

       One of the mods on the Mandela Effect sub did an experiment on this. They
       <em>
        only talked
       </em>
       about Portugal and going there for vacation and what not. Making sure not to search or type anything out in regards to it. And they reported getting ads for Portugal shortly after. They said it was something they hadn't ever explored or researched, which is why they chose it for the experiment, but I'm not sure if it was specifically on YT that they encountered the ads. Wouldn't hurt to try it out to see if anything comes up.

       Instagram app on the iPhone definitely does that. For example I was cooking with cream cheese and mentioned that word a buncha times while directing someone else in the kitchen. Pretty soon I had Philadelphia cream cheese ads on Instagram. Insta is one of the very few apps I have on my phone. For example I don't have Facebook, snapchat, etc.

       Ok..... I'm sorry to be the first one to tell you this if no one else has quite yet, but there are much more terrifying purposes for the microphone and other transmitters on your everyday smart phone.  Google is not a functional government with a military force so I'd say they are kinda low on the list of things to worry about.

       I know that google uses my phone's location services to serve me ads.  Because I don't have pets or anything but my son got a gold fish from a carnival one day and the next day I went into PetCo to get some stuff to try to keep the fish alive.  Right after I visited that store I started getting PetCo ads on YouTube and other places.  That gave me the creeps!!

       I tested this by mentioning "cat food" around my phone about once or twice an hour for a full day. I don't own a cat.

       Woke up the next morning and several different apps had cat food advertisements.

       This is definitely not paranoid. This is really happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example:
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a cat person. I've never owned anything else or expressed an interest in owning anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       My GF comes in and says her friend has to move suddenly and can't take their pet with them and we need to adopt it.  It's a lizard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I say okay, and we discuss supplies we might need for the lizard.  I mention that we might need one of those heating pads that go under the terrarium.  So then I open up a web browser on my laptop and go to Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first item that pops up on my "suggested for you" list was a terrarium heater for reptiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never searched for anything remotely like that before.  We had our phones and laptops in the room. She has an iphone and I have an android.  She runs the FB app on her phone; I do not. She uses an Apple laptop and I use a Windows laptop.  We use both Chrome and FF.

       One person having the FB app on their phone can compromise the privacy of everyone on their contact list and in their vicinity. It sounds too harsh but we should start ostracizing people who use FB.

       I am a therapist. The work I do is 100% confidential with regard to client identityi. Though I keep notes in our medical record system, I do not write details of what was said in these notes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a session last year in which my client mentioned an obscure programming language. This is not something I had ever heard of or researched, and it was brought up by name only once or twice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I freaked when the next day, Amazon sent me an email with recommended books for said programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then, I have a no phone policy in my office and ask clients to put their phones in a Faraday bag at the front office.

      <p>
       Assuming you don’t have a pet, just start talking; couple times a day about said pet saying key words like BUY, NEED, WANT etc.  Do this for a couple days and I guarantee you will get your answer.

       The more I think about it, the more I don't think I can prove it - if by "prove it" I mean generate evidence via a methodology other people could repeat. I updated the past with some problems I realized after talking to people on here, but I'll paste here for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Additional difficulties that basically mean I can't ever prove it: YouTube rolls features out to subsets of users for testing. There's no reason to assume just because I have this feature, everyone does. It means that if I created some procedure people could follow they might find nothing and then I look like a loon or a liar. Also, I'm a difficult customer. I don't use Google's other products so they have no ad data on me, I purposefully skip every ad as soon as I can, and I refuse to answer any of their surveys - for all I know the mic mining could be an ad targeting system of last resort - so, again, just because I'm seeing it means not everyone would. Thus, like one of the commenters said, making it my word against "Don't Be Evil" Google. "
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah - even IF I could produce "evidence" I'd just be someone on the internet with a claim and some WAV files. Whoop dee doo. I wouldn't believe me.
