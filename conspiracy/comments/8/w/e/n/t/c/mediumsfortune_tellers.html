About a year ago my gf went to a medium she basically said stuff that couldn&#39;t of been cold read about her family and my grandad ( this stuff she said about my grandad turned my belief of mediums because it was accurate and not vague guessing ) and recently my cousin had one which again was accurate and precise to not be cold reading in fact she was in a car waiting and the reader asked was someone else here without knowing she was there. So what do you guys think of mediums and does this mean that we are way more connected and at the same time vision less to our real power/ strength as humans. I&#39;m booking myself in to a medium to see for myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your probably not looking for a religious answer but there is the case in the Bible where after Samuel died Saul seeks the witch of Endor who it says has a “familiar spirit” summons Samuel which she successfully does but it ends very bad for Saul. The story is found in 1 Samuel 28. </p>

<p>I told you that to tell you this, deception is something that has been masters by the powers of the air. Your delving into the spiritual realm and it’s very dangerous territory I would assume your not a believer so none of this would matter but there are many places in the Word of God that warn about seeking familiar spirits. </p>

<p>Isaiah 8:19 ¶ And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead?
20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.</p>

<p>Leviticus 20:6 ¶ And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</p>

<p>Revelation 18:23 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody else has, so I’ll give the requisite skeptical response.</p>

<p>First off, cold readings can be very convincing. An experienced medium can accurately guess what’s going on in your life just by looking at you, based on things like your age, what you’re wearing, and the fact that you’re visiting a medium. Also, people tend to remember the “hits” and forget the “misses”. If you could video tape a reading, you could rewatch it and count all the bad guesses your medium made (but they probably wouldn’t allow this).</p>

<p>Secondly, cold reading isn’t their only tactic. If you make an appointment, they can research you in advance; if they have a waiting room, it might have listening devices...like magicians, they go to more trouble setting up than we usually assume, so that stuff doesn’t occur to us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had been there, or if I had a video of the reading, I might be able to point out things to you. Like, maybe the medium only got around to the missing toe after fishing a lot of other information from you or asking a ton of vague questions or making bad guesses that you&#39;re not remembering. (Like, &quot;I sense there was an accident or injury of some kind...&quot;) </p>

<p>When you&#39;re around a skilled magician, it really does seem like magic, even though you know it&#39;s all tricks. Mediums are the same way. If they&#39;re very good, they can do things that you wouldn&#39;t think were possible, but it&#39;s all just tricks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mic_5:12  And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers:</p>

<p>Deu 18:10  There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, </p>

<p>Deu 18:11  Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. </p>

<p>Lucifer&#39;s spiritual principalities and powers include &quot;familiar spirits.&quot;  These are unclean spirits (devils) that have been keeping tabs on you and your ancestors since the beginning of time.  These are the spirits that interact with mediums (soothsayers) to tell them about your family and will have intimate knowledge about those people.  They can also masquerade as your assessors when doing things like meditation or astral projection.  That&#39;s just one option though since they can even pretend to be yourself (higher self, future self) or aliens, spurt animals, whatever you want really.</p>

<p>2Co_11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.</p>

<p>These entities will deceive you and eventaully try to torment you the more you involve yourself with them.</p>

<p>The truth they don&#39;t want you to know about is that you are a guilty sinner and God himself came in the flesh of Jesus Christ to pay the debut you owe with his blood.  Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>
