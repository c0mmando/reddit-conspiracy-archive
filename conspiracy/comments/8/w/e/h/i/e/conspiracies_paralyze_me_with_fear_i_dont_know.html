        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve always been prone to fearing things. When I was little, it was disease. In my teens, it was the draft and nuclear weapons. Now, as a young adult, it&#39;s been waking up. I can&#39;t escape it. I can&#39;t espace the fear. Weed doesn&#39;t help, being around friends doesn&#39;t help; nothing seems to help. </p>

<p>I honestly have no clue how to escape it. I&#39;m in college currently, and I&#39;ve posted here a few times asking for help, but I cannot find an escape. I want to plan a future for myself - save money for a business or invest time in a relationship. But each time I do these things, the thought of &quot;what does it matter, you&#39;ll be dead in five years&quot; floods over me, fills me with fear, and completely ruins my day. It&#39;s constantly in the back of my mind and I don&#39;t know how to get it out. I wake up everyday waiting for the shadow government to set off a nuke above my head or release a bioweapon that wipes out my entire family. The worst part is, I&#39;m helpless; I&#39;m in college and won&#39;t have access to a source of income from an engineering career to protect my family for at least 4 years. And I don&#39;t think the elite are going to wait that long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear is their greatest weapon, I try to remind myself this daily. Some conspiracies are straight disinfo to make you scared. TPTB want you to think they&#39;re more powerful than they are. Personally, I think they&#39;re scared shitless of informed citizens such as yourself. You&#39;re in school for an engineering degree, you should be proud of yourself. Don&#39;t lose faith in your abilities. It&#39;s that mindset that it&#39;s all gonna end that keeps them in control. It has been this way for too long. Follow your ambitions without fear and you will break through their system. I believe in you but that doesn&#39;t matter, all the power you need is within.</p>

<p>Find some hope, worry less.  There is always hope.</p>

<p>No matter what happens, what does it matter. What is matter. What is time. Is time an illusion, a construct of the mind and body. What if there is only the ever present now. You can only see the present, but the past and future exist simultaneously, everything happens at once.</p>

<p>Try shrooms. If you got money, try the anja light. Broke? Kundalina Yoga. You&#39;ll feel a connection to the world that you couldn&#39;t otherwise. You just have to focus on the good and put yourself in a warm comfortable place...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re worried about people you will never know, in places you&#39;ll never be, making decisions you&#39;ll never understand because they&#39;re based on information you&#39;ll never know.  Basically you&#39;re concerned about things you have absolutely no control over - and that&#39;s ok - fear of an existential threat has been a reality of humankind since we first developed an imagination.  What you <em>do</em> have control over is <em>your</em> world, and to some degree the world of the people around you.  Believe it or not, you have the power to make the world a better place.  The next time you see someone who&#39;s looking down, ask them if they&#39;re ok and <em>listen</em> to their answer.  Fart in a crowded elevator.  Mow a senior citizen&#39;s lawn for no other reason than it needs to be done. Start a garden and give extra food to people that need it.  The list is endless.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an old expression: &quot;If you take care of the little things, the big things take care of themselves&quot;.  You might find that if you start taking care of the present, you&#39;ll realize that the future will take care of itself.  You might even begin to think that while you&#39;re far more likely to live another 50-60 years, even if you do die in five years it will be ok because you&#39;ve packed so much living into those years that you&#39;ll be fine with it - that you did what you were here to do and left the world just a little better of a place than when you came into it.  There are a lot people in this world who can never really die because people hold fond memories of them and inspire them to be better.  You can be that person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should start by getting some counseling.  You can probably get some at your college.  Fear and anxiety can really diminish your problem solving ability bec your focus is tunnel vision. All you see is the threat. </p>

<p>It’s true things look pretty bad, but we are still here and the sky hasn’t fallen.  There are many who have known for many years what was coming, and still the sky is blue and the sun rises everyday. You have to take it one day at a time. Why are you stressing about what hasn’t happened?  You are missing out on all kinds of meaningful relationships and good/beautiful things that surround you. Like those who have seen things unfold toward destruction, you may be here for decades. There is no telling what kind of timetable is involved. There is a big wrench in it right now.</p>

<p>As much as possible, think about the things within your control. Your time, thoughts, plans, activities. Relish them more. Find the joy in simple things and friends/family. Volunteer.  Seek spiritual meaning and comfort. Pray.  Put yourself in God’s capable hands. Look to Him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude.if this an honest post then an honest answer. You could be depressed or OCD or some such related mental illness. Try CBD drops subliminally say 10 drops twice a day for a month. Also bulk up on B vitamins, try B50s  or B 100s if you can find them. 2 or 3 a day. Also Vit. C like 10000 units a day. Also fit E 10000 units a day.
Dot his for a month a see if you feel better. If not go see a shrink and see what they think. Mentally you need to stay away from news and this conspiracy page. Totally. That goes for any source of news. It&#39;s like this, if you didn&#39;t know about certain bad news would it really make any difference to your day to day life? Prolly not. Also take up meditation and maybe if your innerested look at a simple Buddisum book on mindful living. Mindful thinking, mindful action, mindful speech,  mindful employment  and so on. Conspiracies are DARK.
Bad news is just bad news. Don&#39;t buy into it.good luck.</p>

<p>Rom 8:38  For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, </p>

<p>Rom 8:39  Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worry about things in front of you. Don&#39;t loose sight of that engineering degree. Don&#39;t loose sight of the love you have for family. Don&#39;t let that fear break you, control you, live your life for you. Knowledge is your weapon, not your enemy, use it and live with confidence. If I was your mom I would break your backbone for you before I watch you let others break it for you.</p>
