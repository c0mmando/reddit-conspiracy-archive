       I've always been prone to fearing things. When I was little, it was disease. In my teens, it was the draft and nuclear weapons. Now, as a young adult, it's been waking up. I can't escape it. I can't espace the fear. Weed doesn't help, being around friends doesn't help; nothing seems to help.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly have no clue how to escape it. I'm in college currently, and I've posted here a few times asking for help, but I cannot find an escape. I want to plan a future for myself - save money for a business or invest time in a relationship. But each time I do these things, the thought of "what does it matter, you'll be dead in five years" floods over me, fills me with fear, and completely ruins my day. It's constantly in the back of my mind and I don't know how to get it out. I wake up everyday waiting for the shadow government to set off a nuke above my head or release a bioweapon that wipes out my entire family. The worst part is, I'm helpless; I'm in college and won't have access to a source of income from an engineering career to protect my family for at least 4 years. And I don't think the elite are going to wait that long.

       Trust me I know how you feel. It it helps, the reason why I hang around so much is because I want to find out how to beat all of the corrupt oligarchs. I was kind of hopeless at first, but the idea of one day saving my nation helped me keep trying. Right now, I'm too arrogant like to live in fear.

       If anything major is going to happen, then, there really is nothing you can do about it. You just got keep your ear to the ground and roll with the punches. You cannot let fear stop you. That is exactly what TPTB want.

       Fear is their greatest weapon, I try to remind myself this daily. Some conspiracies are straight disinfo to make you scared. TPTB want you to think they're more powerful than they are. Personally, I think they're scared shitless of informed citizens such as yourself. You're in school for an engineering degree, you should be proud of yourself. Don't lose faith in your abilities. It's that mindset that it's all gonna end that keeps them in control. It has been this way for too long. Follow your ambitions without fear and you will break through their system. I believe in you but that doesn't matter, all the power you need is within.

       Stop the weed! In some people it can cause psychological problems like paranoia etc. After that you’re on a journey of self discovery, if you keep looking and asking for help, (not online) im sure you’ll make some progress, baby steps. Good luck

       Or control your trip better. When you smoke, only put on positive music, educational and inspirational documentaries and comedy. Give yourself a break from the things that being you down. Have a little smoke, take some deep breaths, watch the sunset, focus on gratitude.

       With fear, with knowledge... there is hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find some hope, worry less.  There is always hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what happens, what does it matter. What is matter. What is time. Is time an illusion, a construct of the mind and body. What if there is only the ever present now. You can only see the present, but the past and future exist simultaneously, everything happens at once.

       Try shrooms. If you got money, try the anja light. Broke? Kundalina Yoga. You'll feel a connection to the world that you couldn't otherwise. You just have to focus on the good and put yourself in a warm comfortable place...

       You're worried about people you will never know, in places you'll never be, making decisions you'll never understand because they're based on information you'll never know.  Basically you're concerned about things you have absolutely no control over - and that's ok - fear of an existential threat has been a reality of humankind since we first developed an imagination.  What you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have control over is
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       world, and to some degree the world of the people around you.  Believe it or not, you have the power to make the world a better place.  The next time you see someone who's looking down, ask them if they're ok and
       <em>
        listen
       </em>
       to their answer.  Fart in a crowded elevator.  Mow a senior citizen's lawn for no other reason than it needs to be done. Start a garden and give extra food to people that need it.  The list is endless.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's an old expression: "If you take care of the little things, the big things take care of themselves".  You might find that if you start taking care of the present, you'll realize that the future will take care of itself.  You might even begin to think that while you're far more likely to live another 50-60 years, even if you do die in five years it will be ok because you've packed so much living into those years that you'll be fine with it - that you did what you were here to do and left the world just a little better of a place than when you came into it.  There are a lot people in this world who can never really die because people hold fond memories of them and inspire them to be better.  You can be that person.

       You should start by getting some counseling.  You can probably get some at your college.  Fear and anxiety can really diminish your problem solving ability bec your focus is tunnel vision. All you see is the threat.

       It’s true things look pretty bad, but we are still here and the sky hasn’t fallen.  There are many who have known for many years what was coming, and still the sky is blue and the sun rises everyday. You have to take it one day at a time. Why are you stressing about what hasn’t happened?  You are missing out on all kinds of meaningful relationships and good/beautiful things that surround you. Like those who have seen things unfold toward destruction, you may be here for decades. There is no telling what kind of timetable is involved. There is a big wrench in it right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as possible, think about the things within your control. Your time, thoughts, plans, activities. Relish them more. Find the joy in simple things and friends/family. Volunteer.  Seek spiritual meaning and comfort. Pray.  Put yourself in God’s capable hands. Look to Him.

       Dude.if this an honest post then an honest answer. You could be depressed or OCD or some such related mental illness. Try CBD drops subliminally say 10 drops twice a day for a month. Also bulk up on B vitamins, try B50s  or B 100s if you can find them. 2 or 3 a day. Also Vit. C like 10000 units a day. Also fit E 10000 units a day.
Dot his for a month a see if you feel better. If not go see a shrink and see what they think. Mentally you need to stay away from news and this conspiracy page. Totally. That goes for any source of news. It's like this, if you didn't know about certain bad news would it really make any difference to your day to day life? Prolly not. Also take up meditation and maybe if your innerested look at a simple Buddisum book on mindful living. Mindful thinking, mindful action, mindful speech,  mindful employment  and so on. Conspiracies are DARK.
Bad news is just bad news. Don't buy into it.good luck.

       Just realise you arent the one living evil. Take life one momment at a time and do what you think is right. Between 1hr and 80+ yrs from now, you will die. Nothing can be done about this, but you can choose what you do until then. Its not about wether you win or lose, but how you played the game.

       Worry about things in front of you. Don't loose sight of that engineering degree. Don't loose sight of the love you have for family. Don't let that fear break you, control you, live your life for you. Knowledge is your weapon, not your enemy, use it and live with confidence. If I was your mom I would break your backbone for you before I watch you let others break it for you.
