       Full disclosure: I identify as white. It is an interesting thought nonetheless. We know that Lucifer is always depicted as being a white dude. We know that the elite praise this fool to no end. We know that dark skinned people have always been attacked various ways. Are blacks and dark skin originally children of God while the white skins children of anti-god? Is this why throughout RECENT history, the system has attacked the black man in so many ways. Yet in ancient history, the blacks were the kings of empires. What happened in between? Touchy subject but interesting nonetheless.

       That is the belief that Noah’s sons where different races. All three of Noah’s sons were so called black. But the descendants of Shem are under the Deuteronomy 28 curses, you see it everyday on tv.

       Wow mind blown. LOL I already had this ebook in my collection as I got the  "do you want to overwrite file" msg. Anyways glad you mentioned because it perfectly summarizes the real behind the scenes story and why the elite are all demon worshipers.

       That is a good question.  It depends on what you mean by Jews.  I think that today's Israel is really the Land of Canaan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see the "Jews" as being a single group of people.  It is fractured, just like Christianity and Islam are.  I think that one group of people who call themselves Jews are descendants of Cain/Nephilim.  I hope that answers your question.

       I believe true evil has no race assigned to it. There as many colors of evil as there are colors of man. To try and blame something as simple as skin pigmentation is ignorance. Gods and demons have no race related color, or rather, they are whatever color they choose to be.

       My own theory.  A long time ago in jr. high, a warlock asked 'what if they find a cave and all get out.'  I thought that since a cave was doable then Earth cannot be where hell is because God doesn't do anything iffy.  So, after years of thought I came up with that because it covers all the bases and there are plenty of new stars to use.  I'm open to other ideas but I couldn't find anything else credible.

       It actually makes sense because in the Bible there are many references to God creating a new hell or the creation being in progress. Maybe God is waiting to see just how far the wicked take things and will build their afterlife abide accordingly. Lol God gonna be the interior designer of hell. Funny thought.

       earth has plenty of caves and a hot lava molten core. Plenty of people who had near death experiences who experienced hell, were taken "down" into it and report its in the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also lines up with Buddhist philosophy of earth being a reincarnation prison, which means those in hell are still imprisoned in the system

       That’s the Jew God which is the baddie. Good God is the God Jesus refers to. They do this constantly, poison wells, mix the evil doctrine into the holy one so believers cannot differentiate and end up unknowingly praising the evil one.

       How does that even make sense. I mean, Lucifer isn't even human.
      </p>
      <p>
       We tend to humanise everything and depict them as such. But if you look into proper depictions of angels and demons in theological works, you would see that they are everything but humans. Forget the depiction of sweet little baby angels. If they exist, they probably look horrifying and extremely alien to us. Same with demons.

       God, Angels, and Demons are able to “wear different garments,” they can transform themselves into man or any insect/animal. The garment Lucifer chose was one of a white man. Unfortunately if you google image Lucifer all you see is images of the TV show (search engine psyop), but if you look through the Mormon bible for instance, he is depicted as a white guy with blonde hair and wings.

       As I said, we depict everything as human because that's the only thing we can imagine. You have never seen an angel or a demon, therefore you can't really depict their true for, can you?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see this in action with a lot of Renaissance painters and sculptors. They depicted angels as babies with wings because babies are pure and without sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Mormon bible was written by black men, then Lucifer would be depicted as black. If it was written by asian men, then Lucifer would be depicted as an asian man. What constitutes as a white man's garment???

       Search Engine Psyop? That doesn't really make sense. I'm pretty adept at SEO, and I can assure you that search engines don't work the way you think they work.

       I always fugured white people, specifically blonde-haired, blue-eyed people are descendants of Cain.

      <p>
       Cain was marked after he killed Abel (hence the mutation).

       Personality-wise it makes sense.   He was supposed to wander the earth.   Caucasians have kind of wandered the earth not really giving a fo about our roots.

       Jews are not Hebrews. They are skilled laborers. And they, just like Christians have nothing to do with the God of Israel. The God of the gentiles who is Jesus or Lucifer teaches that God is love love love. Nope God is love and hate. Good and Evil. Every person you know that has died before their time was killed by God. Unless you think God is a liar. He does all evil in the world Not Satan. There is no such thing as the devil.
