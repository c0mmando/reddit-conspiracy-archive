        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What the fuck have we done to ourselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/unitedstates">https://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/unitedstates</a></p>

<p>At this rate, the cabal might as well put a bar-code lazer tattoo on our flesh on our hand or our head. We are literal slaves to a failed economic system yet run around propping up said failed monetary system. Our systems are crumbling. Our world is filled with plastic trash from a consumerism materialistic obsessed society. We have polluted our oceans with huge garbage patches.</p>

<p>Our air and soil has been contaminated. Our bodies are contaminated and filled with junk, and junk food. Toxins, and ill health are the norm and people scratch their head wondering why their health is so out of balance.</p>

<p>We drive useless automobiles to outdated jobs that should have been killed in the 1960&#39;s. We prop up a broken system of enslavement where we force each other to OBEY. We shake hands with each other then act conniving to one another, trying to get a broken dollar off your broken fellow humans. We continue to break each other down and act like we have to be hyper masculine or hyper femnine because if you don&#39;t youre a &quot;pussy&quot; or a &quot;ratchet&quot;.</p>

<p>We literally willingly judge each other and slam each other into deep labeled boxes and then play bumper cars with each other. We are literally a broken species. Are we going to wake up to this realization or continue to play victim consciousness for another 25,000 years?</p>

<p>I am sick of all that bullshit. Everything listed above is bull shit. And we continue to create bull shit, and sell it to each other. I am so fed up with it all. Our system needs to collapse into something far better for us.</p>

<p>We can do it without chaos, and quite honestly, a lot of people need to straighten the hell up and quit being so damn petty.</p>

<p>Not only do we have thousands of suppressed patents, we have the means and the unity possible through saving the earth that we can change it within a year or less if we truly wanted to. Not only can we pursue thorium energy and liberate the planets energy, we can get to hemp plastics and other means of textile production that phases out plastic and other toxic rubbish we produce.</p>

<p>Get back to the earths roots because the earth is us and we need the god damn earth. You can&#39;t just rip up forests and earth without thinking it will just stay in balance the whole time. We need to phase into large scale hemp production and fix our livestock agricultural problem. I am sure meat can be mass grown in labs, if we got rid of the damn profit incentive, we would be so far more advanced by now.</p>

<p>We have been basing our worth off fake illusionary material success markers that somehow ping your dopamine and make your ego think you are doing what you should in life. Well guess what. It&#39;s fake. And sooner or later everyone is going to get slapped with this reality. We can all unite together as one and change the earth for the better.</p>

<p>Here are some links I want to share with you.</p>

<p>Government Secrecy Orders on Patents Have Stifled More Than 5,000 Inventions</p>

<p>Think med beds. Alternative and free energy. Anti-grav machinery and application. Crystal type technologies. Replicators. Advanced ways of living and application to cities and living solutions. Advanced hydroponic and agricultural technology. These are all possible and only a small dent in what truly exists and is locked away in deep underground cabal bunkers.</p>

<p>“In fact, replicators are now available to all of humanity, but they are hidden along with the MANY inventions that are available NOW, but are being concealed from the masses and are only available to the few. The replicator is among the many third-dimensional secrets that have not yet been released to give comfort and support to those in need and/or humanity as a collective.” (1)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well a lot of people react in unpredictable ways and this is where the provocateurs thrive off of. At this rate, our best chance is mass awakening as the public comes to realize we need to stand together in unity and demand/create change, then the generals and military leaders and POTUS would have no choice but to follow the will of the people.</p>

<p>Seems a lot of people have forgotten we are in charge. We are why they are in power. Now their power is far too deeply rooted, and needs to be dug out and redistributed for the citizens of earth. Remember this fun picture?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly, the last thing we should possibly go through is civil war, revolutions, fighting with the military etc. A tremendous number of people will die when the food trucks are cut off and supplies no longer come to the masses in the city centers, and revolutions dont even guarantee victory.</p>

<p>We are better off having a silent revolution but changing some part of the U.S, a city, a state, or a few states, into some post democracy futuristic whaterver-the-fuck it is that people want to try.</p>

<p>Socialism isn&#39;t it (besides medical) as it will just lead to communism and collapse. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m down for turning a state or two into some sort of hybrid trial basis meritocracy that also produces tech, veg, hemp, food, etc all on renewables, with everyone working together to make it work somehow while also being completely transparent, open sourced, block chained, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at this rate, the cabal is collapsing, so we might as well take our countries back and reclaim planet earth for mankind, and not for greedy service to self power over other individuals. With the release of technology alone, would liberate the need to participate in a fiat rat race M-F 40 hrs a week. People would have new hobbies and can explore themselves and their surroundings in far more abundance and peace. This is what is possible and what we can do.</p>

<p>At this point, the TPTB are dissipating and if you are watching closely, you can actually see their empire crumbling before our eyes. We are essentially at the popcorn stage.</p>

<p>We just need to limit chaos and help one another and educate one another and also be there for one another. We are all one after all so we might as well be united and be united with earth. Ground to earth and we will experience the abundance we deserve and have earned. But we can&#39;t accomplish this with hated or violence. It is time we put an end to all that petty bs.</p>

<p>We can do it within a year, probably months. Thorium energy alone can liberate us and our dependence on oil.</p>

I mean we have enough proof that world changing technologies are hidden yet people don&#39;t even seem to care.

<p>People are owned by their indebtedness. They take on obligations that are nearly impossible to service at huge interest rates and then need credit to purchase anything else because all the money that would be going to savings for big expenditures is being used to pay revolving debt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t hold anything against you I just think we can more sustainably raise our live stock and meat, instead of whole scale chopping down the Amazon rain forest and other parts of nature just to put cattle. </p>

<p>An outright ban on meat or the raising of it is an impossible nightmare. I still eat chicken and beef sometimes personally, but I also personally think we can far more sustainability raise live stock.</p>

I agree that the industrial method of meat production has a larger down-side long term, but consider instead a system based on a sustainable model instead of an industrial one.

    <div class="md"><p>I think just going back to a more sustainable model of farming would be sufficient enough.

    <div class="md"><p>I think simpler is always better as well.</p>

<p>Especially in regards to how we get our food.</p>

<p>Sustainable agriculture/animal husbandry would be the right direction and also lessen strain on the worlds resources. Theres farms where when the animal feels ready to die it passes through a gate that allows painless killing. That way its the animals choice and not the farmers. We just mostly need to stop cutting down so many forests, to only replace forest land with cows. We can do so much better </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That can be accomplished naturally over time. The more someone is steeped in poverty, the more likely they are to have kids. This is scientific fact. Couple that with how many poor countries and citizens there are, and you have unbridled reproduction rates compared to &quot;wealthier&quot; areas.</p>

<p>If we tackle global poverty and hunger, we can fix overpopulation naturally.</p>

<p>If we continue into further poverty, births will continue to sky rocket.</p>

<p>I see you are enamored with the novelty of a currency that exists in technology, but you need to understand that the tech is not as reliable as is generally assumed. Also, why would you endorse a currency system that can be turned off (eg, those in control of it could simply deny you currency at their whim for whatever reason)?</p>

Instead It’ll be a hard teaching, biblical style.  If there is suppressed technology, the ONLY way this all ends is TPTB use that tech to vacate the planet and leave everyone behind to show us how brilliantly they played the game, how thoroughly we lost.  Don’t you think “they” had ample time to prepare for this eventuality?

<p>We didn&#39;t do it. The argument of implied consent also falls flat when you consider that the voting process is purely ornamentation and largely fixed. When congress lives like rockstars &amp; can vote themselves diamond-encrusted platinum buttplugs without any repercussions, never mind bailing out the banks [including foreign banks] for trillions, losing track of trillions of dollars [poof], and footing trillions for endless war and armaments to countless countries, or funding things like silly studies and dead-end &quot;economic developement&quot; that only seem to enrich their spouses or buddies. Nope, we aren&#39;t liable for any of that, nor is it &quot;patriotic&quot; - only idiotic - to assume &amp; believe that we&#39;re liable for any &quot;national&quot; debt. Just because they can lock you up or kill you for not paying your taxes doesn&#39;t make it just. It&#39;s taxation without representation taken to the extreme, in other words, extortion.

    <div class="md"><p>u/Spiritual_War my brother or sister, your the first person I&#39;ve met that says the same things I do. The problem is the Elite aren&#39;t collapsing, they&#39;re gearing up! <a href="https://youtu.be/2frpU6nkb_I">Neom is the city</a>. Don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve heard of this. It&#39;ll be up in 30 yrs or less. The first smart city. Brother... it&#39;s their time. The only way this can stop is literally if EVERYONE rebelled against their governments and their money. It is the only way. Every single country is connected to the BIS except Iran, Cuba and maybe Hungary. It&#39;s time to go into the forest. It ended in 1913 with the signing of the fed. These people defend the system, there is no shaking them up. Not only are they ignorant but willfully ignorant. They will fight you to not know, because deep down inside they know something is wrong. And their used to covering up shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really think the USA could afford to pay that? I mean we could scale back military and use that but what you need to understand is the United States is loaned money at a negative rate.</p>

<p>So even if we pay it off, within years we would be pretty far in debt again.</p>

<p>Also money is backed by nothing. It is literally worthless. When you own the printing press and print all the money you want, it is essentially backed by nothing but the will of people. Its fake. And worth no more than the cotton/blend it is printed on. Its essentially monopoly money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t hold anything against you I just think we can more sustainably raise our live stock and meat, instead of whole scale chopping down the Amazon rain forest and other parts of nature just to put cattle. </p>

<p>An outright ban on meat or the raising of it is an impossible nightmare. I still eat chicken and beef sometimes personally, but I also personally think we can far more sustainability raise live stock.</p>

<p>Right now it is a huge problem and contributor to deforestation, and we can do much better than we are currently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But lab grown isn&#39;t the solution. I agree that the industrial method of meat production has a larger down-side long term, but consider instead a system based on a sustainable model instead of an industrial one. If we (humans) could just stop putting profit as the highest goal then I think we could find solutions to many of our problems.</p>
