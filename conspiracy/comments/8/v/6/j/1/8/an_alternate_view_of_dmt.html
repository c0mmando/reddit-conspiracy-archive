       I’ve seen the topic of DMT come up so often here and invariably it’s recommended with the utmost praise. I think people should be careful with this chemical and question whether it’s really a good thing to do. Anyone who is telling you it’s this purely enlightening experience is feeding you a load of New Age crap. Understanding what DMT is becomes more clear in the context of Gnosticism. The universe consists of consciousness existing on all different frequencies. Residing just off our own frequency in the lower fourth dimension are entities that have come to be known as “Archons.” These entities are disincarnate beings who lack creative intentionality but are experts at manipulating and parasiting off others’ energy fields. They are also by many accounts the controlling consciousness on this planet which has utilized the human species as an energy farm for thousands of years. When a person takes DMT or ayahuasca, they are essentially projecting their soul-body into the lower fourth dimension and putting it at the mercy of these energetic parasites. Does that sound like a fun time to you? We would all do better to protect our energy fields rather than experimentally project them into alternate planes.

       Many of these natural substances such as DMT are made in the human body in some alternate form. We have endogenous systems already capable of processing these things, such as the endocannabinoid system that is responsible for modulating different cannabinoids that your body produces such as
       <a href="https://herb.co/marijuana/news/anandamide-aea">
        Anandamide
       </a>
       which is the human body's version of THC.

       <em>
        There are
       </em>
       theories that there is a "consciousness producing" system in the body, and that some of these psychedelic chemicals may modulate them in some way but not enough is known due to legality.

       I’ll wait to see the evidence. I’m skeptical of the hype around DMT. I never found it enlightening, only strange. Nonetheless, I hope we do learn more about it in the future.

       I find it interesting that the second half of your post, you say matter-of-factly without flinching as you believe it to be absolute truth... Yet, you are skeptical that something that is naturally produced within the body can interact with the brain?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not take this observation as an attack on you.  It just seems, from the outside looking in, things are a little... backwards.

       such a shame you’ve only had a strange reaction to dmt.
      </p>
      <p>
       my first and only dmt trip was so enlightening even though i was stuck in some sort of ‘waiting room’ from what i’ve read since i didn’t blast off.
      </p>
      <p>
       my soul separated from my body and i, as i knew it, ceased to exist. i was everything and nothing.  every molecule in my body in the most tingly of effervescence separated their bonds and i felt FREE

       Is DMT structurally similar to Melatonin and Serotonin? I thought it was so I'd guess that it would be produced in the same area of the brain. DMT does cross the blood brain barrier though so even if it isn't produced in the brain, some of it should end up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is converted in the brain very quickly though (which is why Ayahuasca lasts so much longer than pure DMT) so if we only produce trace amounts, it would be eliminated so quickly that it may not be detected.

       There is no spite in what I say here, but if you feel your mind is more restricted after using DMT, I question whether you have used DMT.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest is just your opinion, which you are entitled to. I have more personal evidence that DMT is medicinal than I do that 'Archons' exist.

       I purposely left that vague so I could wait for that response. I’ve done it many times. That’s not what my post is about though. I take issue with the way it’s portrayed. The idea that it’s some “positive” journey that teaches you things is false. It is purely an experience that more often than not can be described as dark, sinister and alien.

       I don’t really have any remarkable experiences that I care to tell about it. If you’re that curious, you can PM me about it. You’d do better to research some high level DMT-trips involving entity contact that corroborates what I am saying here.

       You might consider that you are seeing it through a piece of your own subconscious or concious mind that is dark, sinister, and alien.

       Many people describe the “archons” you describe, your the first I’ve seen consider them malevolent.  Not saying you are wrong, just one opinion counter too many others.

       There is a certain sensation that comes over you initially every time you do it that is best described as a feeling of dread. I believe it’s the result of tuning yourself into this lower frequency. You don’t have to agree, but that’s my take on it.

       I get the feeling it tunes to a higher one. The frequency I hear goes up and once it hits a dog whistle pitch, travel is done and I've arrived in a very familiar place.

       I get the feeling it shifts higher. I get the sense it aligns with gnostic concepts, in equally negative and positive ways. I choose to question what I know about the experience. I have call to go back, but know I'be already taken back what I can.

       Logos is the force of logic which drives all things forward, Sophia is the wisdom which comes from the experience of using divine logic, the demiurge is a byproduct of Sophia. The demiurge creates the material world. It is the source of attachment which keeps us from reconnecting with the divine.

       Really, in contrast to salvia, you very rarely hear any sort of dark, negative stories from DMT trips. If you do hear one, that person is likely extremely fucked up and should have a lot of less intense psychedelic experiences before trying the big one again.

       Eh, "strange and alien" and "sinister and evil" are sometimes conflated by theologically minded folks, but I feel like fully transcendent psychadelic experiences trigger an entheogenesis of sorts that typically overrides such 3rd dimensional pleasantries as "good and evil."
      </p>

       So my suggestion is more, not less. If the goal is to escape or transcend whatever demon apparitions that are potentially inhabiting the 3D minds of the aforementioned theologically oriented, then you gotta either up the dose or work on releasing the ego. Either way-

       That's ok. This is the sub to share idea's like that, but it comes with the caveat that not everyone will agree with you. I have an issue that bad things are put down to, so far as I can tell, imaginary entities. Rather than admitting personal agency for one's experience in life.

       DMT entities are not "imaginary." I've encountered them myself. It's very common. This is  typical breakthrough experience:

       I thought you used the term imaginary. Anyway though, all good. I know this poster who started this thread; he's trolling you guys. After studying the Gnostic mythology, I do believe that there are these "archons." Archons are predatory aliens. DMT is literally the exact opposite; it's a psychedelic technology designed to show us these other dimensions and evolve. If you've never done it- nothing can prepare you for how intense and otherworldly it is.

       No, you can't have an experience in the negative. You can't have an experience that humans are the only intelligence life around. That's called: lying. I've personally had alien encounters on DMT, so I know you're lying. Anyone can also look at the two scientific studies that have been done on DMT or read some of the many stories that I posted in this thread to get an idea of how common and how real these alien encounters on DMT are.

       Both of those studies were flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know I am lying. I had experiences with entities, I just don't use the word "Alien" to describe them because it comes with the pre-existing notion they are extra terrestrial. I don't see any evidence they are extra terrestrial. 
Different people (in those studies) all agreed on certain aspects sure, but the word Alien used by everyone? No.

       Why wouldn’t you just recommend they read up on the most scientifically factual reporting available in general, as opposed to negative, bad-trip reports that’ll mostly just support the opinion YOU have formed?

       Anecdotal recollections are well and good, but as I said before you’re telling someone who wants to learn more to just essentially go read other people who agree with you, when clearly there is more than one stance.

       This is always what you get with people who praise DMT. They tell you how much it helped them and opened their eyes, but if you ask them how, they can’t tell you. They just give you the same vague comment over and over again. The truth is it didn’t do anything for them, but they’ve deluded themselves into thinking it changed their lives. If you question them at all about it, they tell you you’ve never done it before and you couldn’t understand. Then you tell them you have done it and they say you’ve never broken through, etc... It’s amusing but also sad to see these people who have been duped into worshipping this chemical.

       Everyone’s DMT experience is unique, just because there are similarities doesn’t mean it’s corroborating evidence.  You’re skeptical about the hype around DMT and ask for proof left and right then make wild eyes claims about other dimensions and entities, without providing any evidence yourself.   How about YOU prove that there are such things as archons (let alone their intent) first then maybe we can take your alternate view a bit more seriously.

       What if it’s just a chemical reaction that unlocks subconscious activity? What if it, like other chemicals, is just a tool that needs to be used wisely? You’re peddling the same garbage as “dmt snobs”, neither of you will accept that a dmt trip happens right in between your ears.

       this is called setting. you're not in the right frame of mind to be taking psychedelics and in fact it scares many away because it opens the eyes. its far easier to be sedated by booze coke opium benzos somas. the fact that psychedelics are scheduled and inward exploration revered says much about our culture and control. the spirit molecule is a good book to learn more about dmt

       I too have experienced 'negative' or at least non-benevolent entity contact on the deems.  On more than one occasion I came back to myself thinking hmmmm I'm not sure that's always a good thing to do.  I was OK, I didn't really empower them to have a really bad time, but I felt a gut feeling that they didn't have my best interest in mind... they were suspiciously 'showy' to try and get my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've encountered other entities that seem much more benevolent, but I wouldn't be surprised to find out you can indeed get fucked up from negative entities by carelessly indulging in DMT.  I too am skeptical about it slipping more into the mainstream... netflix, joe rogan, etc.  That said, I've had some amazing experiences with dmt as well.  YMMV who the fuck knows what really is going on there!!! haha.  That said --  will do again :p

       All drugs are basically a false path if used too much or incorrectly. They can cure a person who is sick, or make a healthy person sick. We have all seen photos of people who are hooked on meth etc. Drugs are very dangerous.

        Residing just off our own frequency in the lower fourth dimension are entities that have come to be known as “Archons.” These entities are disincarnate beings who lack creative intentionality but are experts at manipulating and parasiting off others’ energy fields. They are also by many accounts the controlling consciousness on this planet which has utilized the human species as an energy farm for thousands of years. When a person takes DMT or ayahuasca, they are essentially projecting their soul-body into the lower fourth dimension and putting it at the mercy of these energetic parasites.

       I find it interesting that the second half of your post, you say matter-of-factly without flinching as you believe it to be absolute truth... Yet, you are skeptical that something that is naturally produced within the body can interact with the brain?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not take this observation as an attack on you.  It just seems, from the outside looking in, things are a little... backwards.

       Eh, "strange and alien" and "sinister and evil" are sometimes conflated by theologically minded folks, but I feel like fully transcendent psychadelic experiences trigger an entheogenesis of sorts that typically overrides such 3rd dimensional pleasantries as "good and evil."
      </p>
      <p>
       So my suggestion is more, not less. If the goal is to escape or transcend whatever demon apparitions that are potentially inhabiting the 3D minds of the aforementioned theologically oriented, then you gotta either up the dose or work on releasing the ego. Either way-
