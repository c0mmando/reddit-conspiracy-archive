        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I was about 19 I got sober and got super into Jesus. Now I think that Jesus and a bunch of other people were dope examples (Muhammad, Ghandi, etc), but none of that matters.</p>

<p>When I was super into Jesus I also had a MacBook and had worked predominantly on apple products for the last few years via art school and then more art school, and I started to really think about apple as a company and how much their logo (as a design student) resonated with me. Steve Jobs was partnered with Steve Wozniak until (essentially) money took precedent over their relationship. These days, technology takes precedent over almost any relationship (not paying attention to those we’re with, online relationships, the list goes on). Back to Jesus, Adam and Eve, the apple, you know how the story goes. </p>

<p>Does anyone else think that apple products may be a symbol for some greater downfall of man? Or am I just completely alone in this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t equate technology necessarily to knowledge. I understand your concept of knowledge but I don’t believe the happenings of this world are necessarily that to gain knowledge from. Prometheus did give (in a mythical tale) fire and therefore an adaptation to human existence but that is not the point that I’m making. Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are human beings that are fully verifiable and did well enough in life, but Steve Jobs was more than chasing, if not overlapping, the funds that were due him due to his technological advancements. The apple has always been the symbol and maybe apple is the symbol of where our generation is going as a result of the capitalist agenda. That’s all I’m saying. All of this Sent from iPhone so fuck me anyway  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No high horse. I&#39;m just commenting as someone who gave up alcohol a year ago now myself after realizing how brainwashed as a society we are about alcohol. It&#39;s amazing how much more I am able to see deception now that I&#39;ve been sober. I didn&#39;t have a &quot;drinking problem&quot; but I started researching alcohol and realized what a rabbit hole you can go down researching it. If drinking isn&#39;t a problem for you, awesome.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not why it was named apple.  Jobs was a literal hippy in his early life, lived in communes and on the campus of Reed college in Portland, in his early 20&#39;s instead of going to college.  He used to literally live in a diet of apples and water at times, as a way to fast.  His early life is kind of interesting really.  He was an asshole, but he named it apple because he liked apples.</p>
