       When I was about 19 I got sober and got super into Jesus. Now I think that Jesus and a bunch of other people were dope examples (Muhammad, Ghandi, etc), but none of that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was super into Jesus I also had a MacBook and had worked predominantly on apple products for the last few years via art school and then more art school, and I started to really think about apple as a company and how much their logo (as a design student) resonated with me. Steve Jobs was partnered with Steve Wozniak until (essentially) money took precedent over their relationship. These days, technology takes precedent over almost any relationship (not paying attention to those we’re with, online relationships, the list goes on). Back to Jesus, Adam and Eve, the apple, you know how the story goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else think that apple products may be a symbol for some greater downfall of man? Or am I just completely alone in this?

       I don’t equate technology necessarily to knowledge. I understand your concept of knowledge but I don’t believe the happenings of this world are necessarily that to gain knowledge from. Prometheus did give (in a mythical tale) fire and therefore an adaptation to human existence but that is not the point that I’m making. Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are human beings that are fully verifiable and did well enough in life, but Steve Jobs was more than chasing, if not overlapping, the funds that were due him due to his technological advancements. The apple has always been the symbol and maybe apple is the symbol of where our generation is going as a result of the capitalist agenda. That’s all I’m saying. All of this Sent from iPhone so fuck me anyway

       Maybe to add on this where some interpret the eating of the apple in the Bible as ensuring the demise of mankind, others see it as the real beginning of mankind and our human consciousness. Depends on the perspective of the person interpreting it.

       I understand that and I appreciate the logo as it stands but I think there is s poetic sense to existence and if there weren’t then words probably wouldn’t exist. I know it’s a shitball theory but at least I’m asking questions lol

       You should get back to being sober. I always think it's funny that people who are so concerned about truth have no problem poisoning themselves with alcohol. But flouride is the real problem, right?!

       No high horse. I'm just commenting as someone who gave up alcohol a year ago now myself after realizing how brainwashed as a society we are about alcohol. It's amazing how much more I am able to see deception now that I've been sober. I didn't have a "drinking problem" but I started researching alcohol and realized what a rabbit hole you can go down researching it. If drinking isn't a problem for you, awesome. I was only commenting since you said you used to be sober.

       That's not why it was named apple.  Jobs was a literal hippy in his early life, lived in communes and on the campus of Reed college in Portland, in his early 20's instead of going to college.  He used to literally live in a diet of apples and water at times, as a way to fast.  His early life is kind of interesting really.  He was an asshole, but he named it apple because he liked apples.

       It's all documented in this case.  The business began in a garage and they had no idea how successful it would be at the time, and the name and symbol were chosen early.  It was not based on some mystical theory this time.  Sorry about that.  It was just some young dudes who liked the name.  It was easy to remember and set them apart from IBM.  Get over yourself.

       A rather in your face bit of symbol magic that is of course completely ignored because it just couldn't be... now could it?
      </p>
      <p>
       As patently obvious as it is and despite knowing full-well just how seriously the elites and their secret societies all happen to take such things and hiding them
       <em>
        in plain sight
       </em>
       in order to cast their spell over all those who think that there's nothing to it, I'm not sure what it is that prevents such people from seeing that it just as obviously works.

       I just can't believe that Apple forcefully updates their older model devices and intentionally throttles them with said updatea to force their customers to upgrade to a newer model, and their customers just go with it without thinking a second thought. Truly mind boggling.
