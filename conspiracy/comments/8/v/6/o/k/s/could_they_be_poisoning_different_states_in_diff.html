    <div class="md"><p>Ok I think you’re dealing with allergies. However I’ve thought of how easy putting specific substances in air filters to dull us down or even numb is out. One idea are those air vents that blow air right on you before going into Home Depot or Walmart. Fuck chem trails there’s more dosing going on at super markets than the chem trails </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem is I saw an allergist/immunologist and did the gold standard which was an antibody blood test and I had no active antibodies in my bloodstream that correlates to any allergans, allergans are ruled out so it has to be some sort of toxic gas in the air or something thats triggering the immune response, the blood test only checks for allergans not any other substance classes so anythings possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also stress man which has a chemical effect on your body.  We are social animals and so designed to pick up the situation by observing others.  When you look at their face then it triggers processes in your body and changes you.  It could also be in addition tiny particles of mold, roach crap, car exhaust, incessant perfumes, etc.  For myself I can&#39;t help but resent typical silly bitches because if 5-10 women walk by me then I&#39;ll certainly sneeze since my body will interpret one of their fragrances as a bad thing (it probably is).  Absolutely though my gut is a lot less healthy while I&#39;m in California than other places.  I think that its a combination of phosphate and stress.  When you see something whack then the stress chemicals are designed to put you on alert and deprioritize digestion.  These things are supposed to pass and then everything is back to chill but if you live in a grindy ass grind then it just never ends.  I&#39;m also a very alert person and its super difficult for someone to just get the jump on me.  I perhaps used to be more chill but I&#39;ve lived on four continents in dangerous areas so its hard to just turn that off.  So its is exhausting though in a crazy rat pit city and just not for me.  It all adds up and I definitely think its not a single thing.</p>

<p>Isnt that just what regional allergies are? That&#39;s why they tell you to eat locally sourced honey, for instance, so you can get resistance to local allergens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny you mention this OP, because I suffer from allergies and ever since I moved to South Georgia from New York, I have literally 0 allergy symptoms and nothing that bothered me before seems to bother me down here, it’s as if I’m cured. I don’t think it’s poison or something, but it is bizarre and very coincidental especially with your examples in the OP. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, but allergies that I have were to plants pollen and shit like that, the winters and cold weather for like 6-8 months of the year in New York killed a lot of it so I assumed coming to where it is warm and plant life flourishes that it would be significantly worse down here, which it is not. Always wondered why, but I guess it could simply just be random. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man if you live in an area with lots of creative landscaping then who the fuck knows what is around you.  Just take shit from all regions of the planet and put it everywhere and its just impossible to know.  Say that you bought a house and its awesome but then you find out that something hard core fucks you up two months of the year?  What is it?  Who the fuck knows.  Have you ever been in a house where for an entire week at like 2-4am when its cooler everyone in a huge house in like 3-4 different rooms starts coughing within seconds?  It could be literally anything like fungus sporing out or some bushed syncing up with all of the pollen.  Fuck it could be a chemtrail or literally anything.  I&#39;d like to have the tools to know but some things are just mysteries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t surprise me, but, I think it would be depending on the size of the major metropolitan area. They probably spray those places hard, then it spreads out x radius from there. </p>

<p>This is why many feel healthier (mind, body, and spirit) when they move from urban areas, out to the sticks. That&#39;s certainly how it was for me, when I did. Not to mention, the absence of light pollution is truly spiritual, when looking up at the stars at night. Love it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah im originally from NYC, but other states iv&#39;e been in florida being a good example makes me feel super refreshed as I don&#39;t constantly spit up or feel congested where as when im in my hometown im constantly spitting up every few seconds it&#39;s so embarassing I have to hold my saliva back and carry a spit bag with me, doctors have been 0 help so it has to be some unknown environmental factor like a toxin because my allergist was very thorough, best in the buisness and even he said that my body will not react to any allergen period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude you&#39;re not the only one. I&#39;m the same way. I went for a month to costa a rica and all my bullshit, fibro, breathing issues, phlegm is all gone there. Come back to the states and back to shitty health. </p>

<p>When I was in CR, I met a family there who&#39;s 9 year old autistic son is actually close to normal when he&#39;s down there, playing, talking, can eat the local food with no issues, and when they take him back home he&#39;s all fucked up again and they were there for the 5th time looking for real estate to move permanently just for their son.</p>

<p>The dad told me that he was originally from AZ where they call the chemtrail illness as sky flu, and also that there is a conspiracy that all the food you buy from stores, goes through these massive irradiation machines so that everything you is already bombarded with all sort of B.S.</p>

<p>I&#39;m planning on checking out some more spots around the U.S. and outside the country as well to see if I get similar effects, and eventually move, because I deal with the same shit as you and know a few others who do as well.</p>
