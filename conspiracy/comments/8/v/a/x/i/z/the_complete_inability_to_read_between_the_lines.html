       It's a very real disorder and a very serious problem.
       <br/>
       We've got full grown adults who have the intuition, pattern recognition and bullshit radar of a three-year-old.
       <br/>
       I'm not saying the researchers on this sub can always accurately identify every deception and hidden truth, but at least we have the ability to recognize the incredibly blatant B.S. of things like 9/11, JFK, OKC, "ISIS" and the staged shootings.
       <br/>
       What is causing so many other people (such as the TMOR crowd and the Michael Shermer disciples) to reach adulthood without this ability?
       <br/>
       Help me brainstorm possible causes.

       People misunderstand cognitive dissonance. CD is the psychological stress of trying to maintain two opposing viewpoints at the same time. It's a symptom, not a cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       A better explanation would be that the fear of being ostracized by social groups causes people to uncritically accept, adopt, and even promote the groups' beliefs even when they might normally conflict with personal beliefs and reason.

       ive often wondered the same. the obvious being right in our face but still we show a different face in public, or we avoid certain topics, or just spout whatever bullshit “everyone else is saying”. the reason for the last one i think stems from being on the “winning” side for once, watching thing get torn apart, but still cant admit that whats going on is wrong.

       Many of our stories that we watch are bait and switch things.  Some watch what is in front of them  and are surprised at the reveal.  Others are looking for the reveal, but do not see what is in front of them. Others look between to see the real meaning. The last group sees the whole picture.  Which one are you?

      <p>
       So in essence: Film, TV, Youtube(Modern TV) have shaped us into what we are. Now we get to things like internet and news media, Reddit, Buzzfeed, CNN, Fox-news, MSNBC, USA-Today. You get snippets of data (McNews) and a lot of it.  A shotgun barrage of data.  Only a few pellets stick. And you are so numb from the Mass data that looking between the lines is nearly impossible.

       The issue is that there is no actual hard evidence for any of these conspiracy theories. Some people have this thing where they won't believe a theory unless there is tangible evidence to prove it.

        <p>
         If you reject possibilities just because no hard evidence has been presented, then all conspirators need to do to keep you in the dark, and keep your view of reality full of holes, is not leave hard evidence laying around. Conversely, if they want you to believe something that is false, they need only give the impression that hard evidence has been presented, and they've been doing this for decades via corruption of the scientific peer review &amp; publishing [process, purchasing lab results and corruption of figurehead institutions of mainstream science &amp; academia. The psychopaths in power absolutely love people like you - people who can't read between the lines.

       I agree with point 1. There are varying degrees of probability to these theories. Read OP's post, he does not acknowledge that point. To him, these theories are 100% true and anyone who doesn't agree they are 100% true are apparently stupid sheep that can't think for themselves.

      <p>
       This is where you lose me. Who is 'they'? You're going on some unnecessary tangent here. I'm not talking about scientific studies and academia, all I said was there is no hard evidence. The fact you don't trust scientists has nothing to do with the fact that there's no tangible evidence for these theories. So by all means keep an open mind about the possibility these theories are true, but no reasonable person would be 100% certain they are like OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting, I think psychopaths in power would prefer people like you, who are distrustful of everything in the world and open to accepting a version of reality that are not backed up with real world evidence.

       outrage fatigue ... its caused by the rapid fire news cycle that keeps getting more outrageous with its headlines ... cognitive dissonance mixed with the trauma based programming and conditioning ...but thats still no excuse .. i think the GMOs, fluoride, pesticides and prescriptions all play a part

        It would cause the upheaval of the entire society. Most people like society. It's comfortable, they know what it is. It seems safe.

       <li>
        Whats the point? They can't stop it. What good does it do to constantly worry about things you can't control. Most people have families and children to worry about and don't have time to delve in to all this stuff. They have full time jobs they need to work at so they can pay off their student load debts, mortgages and car loans. They have pre programmed and controlled view points that they plug into that feed them what they should think without even realizing it because they're too busy and distracted to really pay attention and use their brains. This is all by design.

       Some people are really that stupid or disconnected, a lot of people i think are looking too hard for stuff that isn't there or a reason to try to get that aha moment. I really don't understad how there is a difference between a conspiracy theory or a scientific theory, if it can not be repeated or tested by the scientific method then what is it good for? Either one people think that something is one way or a different way then what has been said but it is not a fact.

       for real though, the fact that more and more people have the ability to have things known around the world within minutes, peoples access to platforms to do what they want, peoples ability to record themselves saying what ever they want, before people only believed what they were told mostly, for one thing people didn't really have too much of a reason to not believe it, they had no reason to in their eyes this is the usa we have free speech and all of that. People now have access to say something and basically anyone in the world can see it say musicians like Post Malone can blow up in one night. we also live in a time that most everyone is just caught up in identity politics, being ouragged,and no one is getting along. How do people act on oh you think different then me now i am going to beat you up or they shouldn't exist anymore telling them to kill themselves or people getting blown up because of what religion they are. That is some super childish behavior that people would not want being said to them and most of the time doesn't mean what is being said or that would never be done outside of on worldstar. For real people are fucked up and they think that it is a fun game to screw with people's minds also annoy the crap out of you and make you go crazy it's a fun game for some unknown reason they just like to bother you. The lack of education, people being bored, the need to feel important or get likes, views, subs, then you have the ones who get people fired and feel super proud the ended someones career for something taken out of context or by mistake. its a fun game to people

       Well 911 is not bull shit. It happened. Its just how you view the story. And everyone in too busy living life to be concerned about how the people you give half your pay check to spend your money.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the bottom line is that its a revolution you are looking at. Murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you follow the dots, it say you have to over throw the rulers. Which means a revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which really means our country will be poor amd weak because the way we currently do things we need these fuck up devil worshippers at the reigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they will for sure leave if we actuallt change shit. So there you go.

       This is actually just another way to guarantee a false view of reality.

         Grayscale, not black &amp; white. You're supposed to assign varying degrees of probability to subject matter; not just believe or disbelieve.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you reject possibilities just because no hard evidence has been presented, then all conspirators need to do to keep you in the dark, and keep your view of reality full of holes, is not leave hard evidence laying around. Conversely, if they want you to believe something that is false, they need only give the impression that hard evidence has been presented, and they've been doing this for decades via corruption of the scientific peer review &amp; publishing [process, purchasing lab results and corruption of figurehead institutions of mainstream science &amp; academia. The psychopaths in power absolutely love people like you - people who can't read between the lines.
