When you try to think of the origin of all things, your brain seems to get a bit kerfuckulated. To be completely fair. I have no reason to believe that you are real person right now.

    <div class="md"><p>Probably shouldn&#39;t mention the company, but no I didn&#39;t get cancer. (That comment was mentioned as a side-benefit of &quot;wasted time&quot; questioning mainstream thought.) There was opposition, and some of it pretty crazy -- one woman complained that we killed her medium channeling business because the smart meters chased away the spirits, but I now suspect that was simply controlled opposition to make the protesters look crazy.</p>

<p>To sum up, I don&#39;t <em>think</em> the meters are any more dangerous than typical WiFi, but they do contribute to the &quot;EMF cloud&quot; that seems inescapable these days. And they do help lock down the public. On the plus side, they make utility operations a lot more efficient and help a lot with planning. I&#39;m on the fence as to whether I&#39;d do that work again, from a moral/ethical perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m going to write up what I believe is going to happen next with North Korea. . I&#39;ll just start out with the latest news that Kim is not only not denuclearizing, he is increasing production. Obviously, this Summit was a complete joke and a failure.</p>

<p><strong>North Korea has increased nuclear production at secret sites, say U.S. officials</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-has-increased-nuclear-production-secret-sites-say-u-n887926">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-has-increased-nuclear-production-secret-sites-say-u-n887926</a></p>

<p>So I&#39;ve been predicting this whole thing since Trump agreed to meet with Kim without even talking to anyone about it first. Not all at once mind you, but as it went along, I managed to fit the pieces together. I am on a local forum and I can prove that I made these predictions with the correlating dates on the posts and I&#39;ll post screenshots if you want. Well I made this prediction to start it all off on March 29th</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call me paranoid but I think Russia, North Korea and China are making some serious moves and Trump is the perfect oblivious buffoon to fall for their trap. They&#39;ll use his arrogance, compulsive need for praise and admiration and his need to be seen as a strong leader against him to blind him to what&#39;s really happening. The fact that Trump thinks Putin is his friend and his aggressive reluctance to put sanctions on Russia and Trump accepting a meeting with Kim without seeking counsel first just shows this tactic at work. And anyone who thinks that North Korea really wants to talk to Trump with full intention of getting rid of their nukes, well I have a bridge to sell you. Putin knows Trump is a fraud and he knows an opportunity when he sees one, especially with how divided we are as a country right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this was met with people mocking me. Those same people talking about Nobel Prizes as the process went on. Well unfortunately since I was aware of how that whole thing played out, I am also aware of whats going to happen next. Narcissists do this thing with important people in their lives (usually romantic relationships but this seems to apply here apparently), its called Idealization &gt; Devaluation &gt; Discard. You can read more about that here.</p>

<p><a href="https://neuroinstincts.com/neuroscience-behind-idealize-devalue-and-discard-rhonda-freeman/">https://neuroinstincts.com/neuroscience-behind-idealize-devalue-and-discard-rhonda-freeman/</a></p>

<p>Kim is a psychopath who runs the most oppressive dictatorship on the planet. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve all magically somehow forgotten that to the point where we didn&#39;t even mention the citizens of North Korea during this whole Summit debacle. Psychopaths manipulate people and they know exactly how to do it. Trump thinks that his charm and Charisma are going to manipulate Kim but Kim is far too smart to fall for flattery. He has been 3 steps ahead of trump at every turn. Trump is using direct flattery on Kim in the form of that ridiculous video, inviting him to the US and heaping praise on him. Kim used indirect flattery on Trump to manipulate him. All those things they willingly did before the summit. Giving up the hostages, dismantling the nuclear testing site, using Rodman to say that Kim read the art of the deal and actually is a fan of Trump. South Korea and Japan both praising Donald for the summit happening. Having a high level official deliver Trump a letter from Kim that&#39;s in a giant envelope. I can&#39;t imagine the amount of dick sucking that went on in that letter towards Trump. By the time the Summit happened, Kim could have asked for Ivanka&#39;s pussy and Donald would have handed it to him on a silver platter. It&#39;s pretty obvious who&#39;s strategy worked better.</p>

<p>So obviously, Trump is in the Idealization phase with Kim to a completely ridiculous degree, claiming they have &quot;good chemistry&quot;. Like wtf? Who says that about another world leader? Especially the most oppressive dictator on the planet. What does that say about Trump if that statement is even true. He has good chemistry with a murderous dictator.... The implications of that went over so many people&#39;s heads. Anyways, once he has to face the reality that Kim is making nukes, thus making him look like a complete fool, Trump will move into the devaluation phase and then discard. He will probably be the angriest he has ever been in his life. This will be an utter and complete humiliation to him (as it should be) and this is a narcissists worst nightmare. Being embarrassed and thought to be made a fool of in front of the world? Even a healthy person would have a hard time with that.</p>

<p>Now, something else needs to be explained about narcissists. They do something called psychological projection. It&#39;s when you attribute all of your negative qualities, actions and feelings about yourself to other people or groups. So the anti-gay politician who secretly sucks dick is an example of this. A guy cheating on his wife might accuse her of cheating. A racist might call black people lazy when really he is the lazy one. All sorts of people do this but narcissists do it almost every time they point their finger at someone. It might as well be pointed back at themselves. You remember The Snake poem Trump would read on the campaign trail and how he would relate it to illegal immigration? He did that because he read it (someone must have shown it to him) and you can tell he connected with it in some way but since he lacks the ability for introspection his &quot;ah ha!&quot; moment was him projecting it onto a perceived enemy group, &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;. &quot;You knew I was a snake before you let me in!&quot; Tell me who that really sounds like.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s next? What does Trump do to &quot;discard&quot; Kim? We only need to look at the most powerful prediction tool of Trump&#39;s future actions in existence, his own Twitter feed. Due to the concept of psychological projection, which all narcissists compulsively do, we can observe Trump&#39;s tweets about Obama during his presidency and ascertain as to how Trump will act under the same circumstances. We can see this will ALL sorts of things (I can send you a list I made if you want but you only have to go on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump">r/TrumpCriticizesTrump</a> to see it in action) he has said negatively about Obama that he end up doing the exact same or worse. Well, look at these tweets in regards to the Iran Deal Obama made to get a glimpse into Trump&#39;s mind for whenever he makes a nuclear deal, especially one that is perceived as a failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I predict that President Obama will at some point attack Iran in order to save face!&quot; 16 Sep 2013<br/>
&quot;President Obama seems so fawning and desperate to make a deal with Iran that lots of bad results can occur. Be cool and be careful!&quot; 9:47 PM - 19 Sep 2013<br/>
&quot;Remember what I previously said--Obama will someday attack Iran in order to show how tough he is&quot; 25 Sep 2013<br/>
&quot;Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!&quot; 10 Nov 2013</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says this FOUR TIMES in the span of about 4 months. He was so sure that Obama would do this because it&#39;s exactly what he would do in his shoes. That&#39;s what projection is all about. Just replace Iran with North Korea and he is in his shoes. We just have to wait for him to realize it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly what this means but I do know that&#39;s the type of shit you see when you do DMT and the middle of your forehead is where the pineal gland in, what&#39;s called your 3rd Eye, which is said to produce DMT in your body. Ancient people obviously had some real knowledge of the nature of reality and the universe. Something we keep getting further and further away as society &quot;progresses&quot;. There is more and more evidence that humanity and the Earth go through cycles and humans have built civilizations much older than we had previously thought. We progress to a certain point, some sort of massive catastrophe happens, most of us are wiped out and we start all over again. Although something different seems to have happened this time. We have no sacred knowledge to pass on like the Ancients did. Why is that? Why the more we &quot;progress&quot;, the more we separate ourselves from nature? If life is so much better with all of our technology and progression, why are we so depressed and take so many pills?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&#39;s all a matter of perspective. We have plenty of knowledge to pass on. Ability to grow food in mass quantities, sanitize water at a flip of a switch, create weapons that previous civilizations couldn&#39;t even fathom, space travel, communications with people on the other side of the world... I could go on and on. I&#39;m pretty sure Ancient civilizations would be blown away by the things we can do today.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure but you are under the assumption that they would think they were good things. Sacred knowledge is different from technology we have today and we won&#39;t be able to pass any of this on in the event of a global catastrophe. Whereas their ancient sacred knowledge could simply be written down. All this technology we have today seems great but what has it really gotten us? Massive death and destruction with wars, corrupt countries who oppress their people. The freest nation on Earth takes the most anti-depressants and does the most drugs. Our suicide rates are up. Is our way of life really any better than theirs was simply because we have smart phones? We have lost something major with all this technology. We&#39;ve lost our connection with the divine and I think it was all by design. For 10&#39;s of thousands of years we lived as hunter gatherers and then all of a sudden, we become agricultural and all sorts of new technology springs up all around the world. What happened with that change? We made our first major step away from nature.  </p>

<p>The more technology increased, the further we got away from our connection with the Earth and the cosmos. We&#39;re suppose to be able to look up into the sky every night and see the Milky Way and a VAST array of stars that I can&#39;t imagine what it must have felt like. Now you have to go to some far out remote place to even get a hint of what you&#39;re suppose to be seeing every night in the sky due to light pollution. Being separated from that basic experience has to be affecting us in some major way that we have no way of conceiving. People who live in tribes in jungles claim they can communicate with plants and animals and you know what? I&#39;m starting to believe them. It&#39;s been proven that plants have some form of consciousness and we are still confused about how some animals communicate with each other. When the shamans in South America were asked how they knew which plants from the jungle they needed to make Ayahuasca, they said the plants told them. I think it&#39;s almost telepathic from being one with everything around you. Which is why this whole thing is moving us further and further separated from everything until we&#39;re just a brain plugged into a computer.  </p>

<p>This life we all live is completely out of line with our biology and it&#39;s a distraction. We&#39;re made slaves to corporations so we can afford to buy shit we don&#39;t need to distract us from our lives. The entire advertising industry in America is geared toward targeting our sub conscious desires, creating a want for things we don&#39;t even need so that corporations can get richer. Sell us the lie that consumerism is the key to happiness. We can rape the Earth and slaughter all the animals we want and their will be no repercussions, all in the name of progress. If we would have never moved into agriculture, we would be just fine in a lifestyle that is forever maintainable for mankind and the Earth. Instead, we are rushing towards our own destruction because we have no self control in the pursuit of seeing how far we can push things. Maybe the Ancients were just smarter than us and knew where that all would lead? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Y<em>ou touch on so many different topics I&#39;m not sure I can put together a response to all of that.</em>   </p>

<p><em>I guess I agree with your overall point though. We are moving away from nature and many of the things we perceive as important are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. However, we all chose this life. Nobody is forcing you to accept modern ways of living. There are plenty of places in the word where one can get back to nature and escape technology if they so desire.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not blaming anyone for my life or my own choices, I am no better than anyone when it comes to perpetuating this type of human lifestyle, I&#39;m just pointing things out. It just seems like a sad waste of humanity what has happened to us, especially in this country. This country is so full of hate from being lied to and manipulated that we&#39;re about to tear each other apart. We are the freest and richest nation on Earth and due to centuries of passed down abuses from parent to child, combined with manipulation from the media, foreign governments and even our own, we are going to completely self destruct. There is undoubtedly in my mind, some sort of evil force pushing us all to a certain direction. Call it evil, call it Satan, call it Aliens, demons, whatever. It exists.  </p>

<p>If this was all just inevitable human &quot;progress&quot; then why do tribes never &quot;progress&quot; unless they are contacted by outsiders? There are still people living the same way now that they were since the beginning of this age. Some of them have never had contact with the outside world. You know it&#39;s interesting, we have plenty of cases of people going from modern living in cities that end up going off the grid, living in the woods. Most of them never come back to their old way of life, if any at all. But every single case of a person living in the wild or living a tribal lifestyle, when trying to live in a modern city, they freak the fuck out and can&#39;t handle it. That entire way of living disagrees with every single part of them. I know this seems like a pretty &quot;duh&quot; moment but I don&#39;t think we consider the real ramifications of mass scale human life in these living conditions and the effect it has on us as a whole. It&#39;s far too late now to turn back though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking about Joe Rogan and his podcast at the beginning of this one and only copied the end of that part because it&#39;s relevant:</p>

<p>He uses his fame to lift everyone else around him up, sowing a seed of community among his fellow comedians and literally every time someone tries to heap a bunch of praise on him or credit him for something, he immediately shifts the credit to someone or something else. If they insist (or if they are simply just correct about giving him credit) he&#39;ll very uncomfortably thank them for the kind words and then he still tries to share the credit with someone else. I think he knows the danger of letting things go to his head and has to fight that shit off to stay grounded. Joe is not perfect by any means but he is a very important objective voice in today&#39;s world of tribe vs tribe. He loses his way a bit in my opinion with his idealism. His idea of open borders and a one world government with a council of people running at the head, universal basic income (which he completely ridiculed at first but then changed his mind once he looked further into it) and his theory of humanity possibly being a sort of caterpillar turning into a butterfly in-regards to our never ending thirst for technological progress ultimately ending up in AI robots and our brains living in computers. If you looked at these things simply on the surface you could say, &quot;yea that seems like the natural progression we&#39;re in&quot;. But understanding human nature and the idea that evil has been trying to do these things since the beginning of world wide civilization adds a whole new meaning to these seemingly good goals.   </p>

<p>They sound nice (except for the AI trans-humanism stuff, that shit terrifies me) but they are just not conducive to the way humans are wired. We are not meant to live in multi million people countries. There&#39;s too many conflicting cultures and values, especially in America to not cause problems. It&#39;s not sustainable. As long as culture and different religions exist, we will never all live in perfect harmony. Our brains are not wired to care about people who are not within our groups. Being a JRE listener, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard about Dunbar&#39;s number. The theory that there are only so many people you can keep in your head at a time that you can conceivably care about beyond them just being a face. It&#39;s around 150 I think. About the size of a very large tribe. Once you have significantly larger numbers than that, they might as well just be a face to you. That&#39;s part of the reason crime is higher in cities. It&#39;s a lot harder to murder and steal from people you know and see everyday.  </p>

<p>This all goes back to what I was talking about earlier, some evil force leading us astray. Further and further away from nature and our connection with the divine. Looking at the Adam and Eve story in this context makes a lot of sense. If you look at the post where I compared this story to the ones similar to it in the Ancient Sumerian myths, you&#39;ll see a couple of complete reversals of ideas.  </p>

<p>1) Sumeria: Man listened to his God, didn&#39;t eat the food offered by the other god because he was told not to and so he was tricked into not becoming immortal.<br/>
Bible: Woman didn&#39;t listen to God, she ate the fruit offered by the serpent because it told her God was lying and so she and Adam were tricked into not becoming (or staying I guess) immortal.  </p>

<p>2) Sumeria: The main character reunites with nature at the end, which is his female companion and he has this huge revelation about the importance of this relationship.<br/>
Bible: God punishes Eve and all women from then on by making childbirth painful and making women forever subservient to their husbands. He then kicks them out of the Garden of Eden which was a place where everything they needed was ready for picking. Seems implied by omission in my opinion that Adam and Eve didn&#39;t eat meat or kill animals. In fact, God doesn&#39;t give permission to humans to eat animals until after the flood. God kicks Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden and says they have to work the land, which he has now cursed forever, with the sweat of their brow. So essentially, God has taken the first step of separating mankind from nature and the spiritual nature of the feminine. God created the patriarchy to punish all women because of what Eve did, according to Genesis. Man is immediately at odds with women and has control over them because Eve is to blame for eating the fruit first and tricking Adam into following suit.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always wondered why God and Christians were so freaked out about people &quot;worshiping&quot; nature. Isn&#39;t nature God&#39;s creation? There&#39;s this very deliberate push to not identify with nature at all. To constantly fight against it to the point of just completely separating ourselves from it. Environmentalists are dismissed as fanatics who care more about animals than people (some of them definitely do). The Bible says the love of money is the root of all evil and what is the excuse everytime we need to potentially fuck up the environment with drilling or something of the like? Money. &quot;It&#39;s going to help the economy, if we don&#39;t do this it will impede business&quot; etc. We&#39;ll worry about the potential consequences later. I don&#39;t think humans are wired to care about the future past our own children&#39;s lives and the impacts we are making could last hundreds or thousands of years, all in the name of &quot;progress&quot; and money. Funny too how Jesus pretty much tells people to live a hunter/gatherer type lifestyle instead of agricultural. Also another contradiction since God is the one who damned Adam to work the ground.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Matthew 6:28-34</strong><br/>
25“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your lifee ?  </p>

<p>“And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus is explaining the difference in abundance thinking and famine thinking. We went from abundance thinking being hunter/gatherers where everything was out in nature, you just had to go get it and you only take what you need since there was always more. To famine thinking with agriculture because you only had so many animals and crops each harvest. That induces a sort of paranoia and guardianship over what is yours because you need it to survive. In nature, everything belongs to everyone and there will always be more somewhere. This shift in thinking and lifestyle lead us all onto the path to where we are now. When farming is how you depend on your survival, you&#39;re going to try and create things that make that survival more likely and make it easier. There was no need for new technology in hunter/gatherers aside from, you could argue, weapons to hunt with and to possibly fight off another tribe but they got along just fine with what they had and there was no major competition to drive more creation of technology.  </p>

<p>Now, what is the one major theme about how we acquired a lot of our technology that is even talked about in Ancient texts in regards to our transition from hunter/gatherers to agriculture? That it all came from aliens/gods that taught us how to do these things and gaves us technology to help us out. It&#39;s an imperfect analogy but technological knowledge could be considered the fruit from the knowledge of good in evil in the Adam and Eve story. We&#39;re tempted by the supposed upsides of this knowledge because it gives you control over your survival. Instead of just nomadic wanderers who get what they are given by nature/God. Being tempted by this knowledge, the rejection of nature/God and the embrace of selfishness and the foolishness of thinking humans have control, leads us onto a long path of destruction. It does seem odd that we lived the same way for so long then over a period of time, all around the world we almost all started farming. So as I&#39;m writing this, I&#39;m just kind of exploring this idea in my head, I haven&#39;t thought about it too much until the other day but I can feel there&#39;s something to this whole idea. Well while researching the time span of the Neolithic Revolution, I just found this on the Wikipedia page.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects, mostly diseases and warfare.    </p>

<p>The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increment in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth. Average height went down from 5&#39;10&quot; (178 cm) for men and 5&#39;6&quot; (168 cm) for women to 5&#39;5&quot; (165 cm) and 5&#39;1&quot; (155 cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.    </p>

<p>The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. Jared Diamond (in The World Until Yesterday) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged inequality between the sexes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So with agriculture, you bring about the need for large scale governments, leaders, social elites, slaves. The people now fight over resources, especially because of population increases. With those increases, comes the need for more control. Today, there&#39;s only a handful of companies who control the vast majority of our food that comes from agriculture. Looking at this Wikipedia entry, you can see the various problems and devastating effects that large scale agriculture is having on our planet. It&#39;s helping drive climate change and climate change will undoubtedly cause famines due to droughts and other extreme weather patterns around the world. There&#39;s no way this will be sustainable unless some sort of major shift happens in at least the way we get our energy.   </p>

<p>Interesting to think that this one shift in our way of living has lead us down a very specific road and the knowledge from which this shift is accredited to, has basically the same story across the world, that it&#39;s from other worldly beings. Only through this shift has the control and enslavement of the entire human race been possible. The driving need to constantly improve technology, dig up oil, deforest the planet, emit greenhouse gases, use up a large portion of our water supply, etc. I&#39;m sure someone could have a field day really researching this topic under this specific lens. I&#39;ve only begun to look into it since I started this post yesterday and it&#39;s really making me think.  </p>

<p>Ever heard of invite-only subs? I have one called conspiracy7, but it&#39;s set so the invite only limits writing-access. I set it so that everyone can read it.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been obvious that Q anon is a psy op but to what end is the question and I think its very obvious. Q is creating blind loyal soldiers for Trump once the shit hits the fan and the violence in the streets starts. Everyone who is anti-Trump might as well be anti-God at that point. That&#39;s how much Q has brainwashed them. They&#39;ll have no problem getting their guns and joining in the &quot;fight to take our country back&quot;. I&#39;ve been hearing about this coming civil war for decades from my father. It&#39;s amazing the mind games that have been played on them to get them to fight for the tyrannical government instead of against it, like they always thought. This shit is so perfectly executed, it will make you believe in Satan if I explained it all to you. Using their own knowledge against themselves, using truths and attaching lies to it so they&#39;ll believe the lies. Combining Christianity and the Republicans with Reagan in the 80s was the beginning of the end. </p>

There&#39;s going to be no civil war.

We should be discussing the narrative that Q lays out in an effort to debunk or prove otherwise. Just labelling it as a psy op off the bat screams shillage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds so shilly it sounds like a troll. The anointed Q? Is that a joke? He warned you that people would call him out on his bullshit? Well no shit, what a prophetic thing to say. What is there to debunk? Except all the claims he makes that aren&#39;t true and then just explains away as having to spread misinformation. Then there&#39;s the fact that something big is about to always drop next week. Then next week comes and then it gets pushed further down the line. He&#39;s dangling the carrot on a stick til shit hits the fan and you all go out in the streets to kill and die for a megalomaniac. Here&#39;s what you Q people don;&#39;t understand. He&#39;s using your knowledge of the evil secret societies of the world and your loyalty to Trump against you. Trump is the Antichrist. It&#39;s written plain out for anyone to realize. It&#39;s completely obvious. Even the way the supposed Christian Mark Taylor says God described Trump&#39;s presidency to him is how the Antichrist is described in the Bible. It even says that God will send people who don&#39;t believe in the truth a STRONG DELUSION so they will believe the lie. Trump is the delusion. Q has you only trusting him and Trump and has you guys thinking Kim Jung-un and Putin are the good guys. How does this make any sense? By the way, I&#39;ve been correctly predicting this whole North Korea thing since Trump agreed to meet with Kim. You want proof? Q said the deal was made months ago yet no one in the White House seems to be aware of any of the details and Kim is currently building more nukes as we speak. Why is that? I can also tell you whats going to happen next with North Korea too. It&#39;s in this thread.</p>

<p>This is not far from the truth. I follow the boards. The Q people all treat him like a prophet and they refuse to believe anything that contradicts with the things he says. You can&#39;t bullshit me with this stuff like I&#39;ve seen so many of his followers do. I know what&#39;s going on over there. &quot;Where we go one, we go all!&quot; So where are we going?</p>

<p>Yes he&#39;s trying to appeal to the Trump supporters core beliefs about the world and who the bad guys are in order to hook you and manipulate you. It also appeals to your arrogance of &quot;I was right all along!&quot; and then you&#39;ll never be convinced you were fooled because it&#39;s too difficult to face. I agree this stuff exists but not in the exact way Q is claiming it. All being run by Obama and the Clintons? Please. They are puppets.</p>

<p>Yes, and that awakening is happening. And you know what they&#39;re doing about it? Trying to attach Trump to it as the figurehead in order to direct people away from the correct path and apparently it&#39;s working.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How does that only matter to people who believe in it? Going to war with the world and killing everyone who doesn&#39;t worship you only matters if you believe in the Antichrist? And if you read my link, you&#39;d know I think Obama might be the backup plan (or the plan all along) to all of this. By the way though, that wasn&#39;t Obama in the costume and the translation isn&#39;t exactly correct.</p>

<p>Trump is the Antichrist which means he&#39;s going to take over. Not sure this proves anything whatsoever for your point of view but its more evidence of mine.</p>

<p>The military is the biggest and largest tool the evil forces of the world have to maintain control. The people in the military are mostly against this stuff but they&#39;re being used as pawns, like they have been for the last century. </p>

<p>This whole Trump vs Deep State thing is pro wrestling. A conflict that will bring about the next stage of the plan and you&#39;re buying right into it by picking a side and engaging in the conflict. Trump was brought in to look like the hero that takes down the NWO when in reality, he&#39;s going to be the one who brings it in.</p>

<p>No one is paying me anything man. I am just a nobody will knowledge about what is going on and I am trying to inform people. It&#39;s almost impossible to PROVE he&#39;s  psyop. That&#39;s the whole point. I can prove that Trump is a traitor, a lawbreaker and a gigantic liar though. That should be enough to make this whole Q thing unravel because that is the entire reason he&#39;s got you guys believing in it, your undying loyalty to Trump. A mere human being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah. Chill out man. And civil war is the exact opposite of what Q says they asre trying to achieve. In fact its the media tha t continues to sow divide and discord. Its not brain washing from Q. We all here agree that the main stream media is brain washing. Following Q is investigating data for yourself. There has been a lot of sealed indictments and firings and hirings within the Trump administration. A lot of good things in the works. Q is about optimism of a peaceful good future and I dont understand the hostility from people who have not completely viewed the information that is provided in depth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make assumptions about my knowledge simply because I don&#39;t fall completely in line with the Q narrative. I follow Q too. That&#39;s how I know what is really going on. I just don&#39;t believe in it. You all are so deep in, that you can&#39;t see how brainwashed he has you. Of course he&#39;s not going to tell you Civil War is the goal but doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to happen. Yes the media are a part of that puzzle but so is Q. You&#39;re all Trumps diehards, his loyal soldiers. What do you think &quot;Where we go one, we go all!&quot; is about? Where are you all going I wonder? Following Q is never about investigating things for yourself, There is a narrative, you either believe it or you don&#39;t. &quot;Trust the plan&quot;. You Q followers constantly do this. You lie and act like I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about. Then spin some bullshit about the things that are really going on over there. You guys think you&#39;re some super secret club that no one else knows whats REALLY going on when literally anyone can read the subreddits or any of the drops. You guys seriously think a bunch of internet nerds are helping take down the evil of the world and you&#39;re all apart of the special club who&#39;s doing it. It&#39;s adorable. Like the &quot;deep state&quot; has no clue Q exists and couldn&#39;t just follow along like everyone else. Jesus you guys are such marks.</p>

Killed two Kennedys (almost killed a third but killed a young girl anyway), MLKjr and his brother, dozens of foreign leaders.  The Watergate plumbers reported to his office in the Nixon WH.  With deep connections to nazis, his father tried to lead a fascist coup against FDR, but HW realized that for it to work in America, he would need to do it gradually.  Clinton helped him carry out Iran Contra in Arkansas, BushJr just carried out his orders, and Trump helped him win the &#39;88 campaign (while also helping W win the &#39;00 campaign.)  Not to mention that under his direction, the Bush Crime Family took out the Italian Mafia families, and the Irish Kennedy (the elites of the loosely connected Irish mob), and the Bush Family is the biggest, last one standing.  With inter-marriages with royalty and billions in real estate investments and secret companies all over the US, they&#39;re like America&#39;s new Rothschilds.</p>

DMT the spirit molecule invokes self realization, overwhelming love, understanding of the interconnected nature of reality, and anti-materialistic views. Material reductionist ideology is dead. Yet people still tout it as leading science. We know as a scientific fact the human mind has nonlocal abilities (remote viewing). Some well trained viewers can even go into the past or future. We are not meat puppets with squishy super computers in our thick skulls. We are divine beings of energy experienceing material existence as humans. Every single human, every single day, produces DMT in their body. Still illegal. Why? You can&#39;t have gobal war with legal DMT. You can&#39;t have debt slave consumer culture with legal DMT.

We can learn a lot from the cultures the native Americans had developed and practiced for thousands of years before they were killed off and driven out of their land by human terrorists raping their women and spreading disease to eliminate the rest that they couldn’t use for slave labor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably shouldn&#39;t mention the company, but no I didn&#39;t get cancer. (That comment was mentioned as a side-benefit of &quot;wasted time&quot; questioning mainstream thought.) There was opposition, and some of it pretty crazy -- one woman complained that we killed her medium channeling business because the smart meters chased away the spirits, but I now suspect that was simply controlled opposition to make the protesters look crazy.</p>

<p>To sum up, I don&#39;t <em>think</em> the meters are any more dangerous than typical WiFi, but they do contribute to the &quot;EMF cloud&quot; that seems inescapable these days. And they do help lock down the public. On the plus side, they make utility operations a lot more efficient and help a lot with planning. I&#39;m on the fence as to whether I&#39;d do that work again, from a moral/ethical perspective.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know exactly what this means but I do know that&#39;s the type of shit you see when you do DMT and the middle of your forehead is where the pineal gland in, what&#39;s called your 3rd Eye, which is said to produce DMT in your body. Ancient people obviously had some real knowledge of the nature of reality and the universe. Something we keep getting further and further away as society &quot;progresses&quot;. There is more and more evidence that humanity and the Earth go through cycles and humans have built civilizations much older than we had previously thought. We progress to a certain point, some sort of massive catastrophe happens, most of us are wiped out and we start all over again. Although something different seems to have happened this time. We have no sacred knowledge to pass on like the Ancients did. Why is that? Why the more we &quot;progress&quot;, the more we separate ourselves from nature? If life is so much better with all of our technology and progression, why are we so depressed and take so many pills?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It&#39;s all a matter of perspective. We have plenty of knowledge to pass on. Ability to grow food in mass quantities, sanitize water at a flip of a switch, create weapons that previous civilizations couldn&#39;t even fathom, space travel, communications with people on the other side of the world... I could go on and on. I&#39;m pretty sure Ancient civilizations would be blown away by the things we can do today.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure but you are under the assumption that they would think they were good things. Sacred knowledge is different from technology we have today and we won&#39;t be able to pass any of this on in the event of a global catastrophe. Whereas their ancient sacred knowledge could simply be written down. All this technology we have today seems great but what has it really gotten us? Massive death and destruction with wars, corrupt countries who oppress their people. The freest nation on Earth takes the most anti-depressants and does the most drugs. Our suicide rates are up. Is our way of life really any better than theirs was simply because we have smart phones? We have lost something major with all this technology. We&#39;ve lost our connection with the divine and I think it was all by design. For 10&#39;s of thousands of years we lived as hunter gatherers and then all of a sudden, we become agricultural and all sorts of new technology springs up all around the world. What happened with that change? We made our first major step away from nature.  </p>

<p>The more technology increased, the further we got away from our connection with the Earth and the cosmos. We&#39;re suppose to be able to look up into the sky every night and see the Milky Way and a VAST array of stars that I can&#39;t imagine what it must have felt like. Now you have to go to some far out remote place to even get a hint of what you&#39;re suppose to be seeing every night in the sky due to light pollution. Being separated from that basic experience has to be affecting us in some major way that we have no way of conceiving. People who live in tribes in jungles claim they can communicate with plants and animals and you know what? I&#39;m starting to believe them. It&#39;s been proven that plants have some form of consciousness and we are still confused about how some animals communicate with each other. When the shamans in South America were asked how they knew which plants from the jungle they needed to make Ayahuasca, they said the plants told them. I think it&#39;s almost telepathic from being one with everything around you. Which is why this whole thing is moving us further and further separated from everything until we&#39;re just a brain plugged into a computer.  </p>

<p>This life we all live is completely out of line with our biology and it&#39;s a distraction. We&#39;re made slaves to corporations so we can afford to buy shit we don&#39;t need to distract us from our lives. The entire advertising industry in America is geared toward targeting our sub conscious desires, creating a want for things we don&#39;t even need so that corporations can get richer. Sell us the lie that consumerism is the key to happiness. We can rape the Earth and slaughter all the animals we want and their will be no repercussions, all in the name of progress. If we would have never moved into agriculture, we would be just fine in a lifestyle that is forever maintainable for mankind and the Earth. Instead, we are rushing towards our own destruction because we have no self control in the pursuit of seeing how far we can push things. Maybe the Ancients were just smarter than us and knew where that all would lead? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Y<em>ou touch on so many different topics I&#39;m not sure I can put together a response to all of that.</em>   </p>

<p><em>I guess I agree with your overall point though. We are moving away from nature and many of the things we perceive as important are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. However, we all chose this life. Nobody is forcing you to accept modern ways of living. There are plenty of places in the word where one can get back to nature and escape technology if they so desire.</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not blaming anyone for my life or my own choices, I am no better than anyone when it comes to perpetuating this type of human lifestyle, I&#39;m just pointing things out. It just seems like a sad waste of humanity what has happened to us, especially in this country. This country is so full of hate from being lied to and manipulated that we&#39;re about to tear each other apart. We are the freest and richest nation on Earth and due to centuries of passed down abuses from parent to child, combined with manipulation from the media, foreign governments and even our own, we are going to completely self destruct. There is undoubtedly in my mind, some sort of evil force pushing us all to a certain direction. Call it evil, call it Satan, call it Aliens, demons, whatever. It exists.  </p>

<p>If this was all just inevitable human &quot;progress&quot; then why do tribes never &quot;progress&quot; unless they are contacted by outsiders? There are still people living the same way now that they were since the beginning of this age. Some of them have never had contact with the outside world. You know it&#39;s interesting, we have plenty of cases of people going from modern living in cities that end up going off the grid, living in the woods. Most of them never come back to their old way of life, if any at all. But every single case of a person living in the wild or living a tribal lifestyle, when trying to live in a modern city, they freak the fuck out and can&#39;t handle it. That entire way of living disagrees with every single part of them. I know this seems like a pretty &quot;duh&quot; moment but I don&#39;t think we consider the real ramifications of mass scale human life in these living conditions and the effect it has on us as a whole. It&#39;s far too late now to turn back though. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite the significant technological advance, the Neolithic revolution did not lead immediately to a rapid growth of population. Its benefits appear to have been offset by various adverse effects, mostly diseases and warfare.    </p>

<p>The introduction of agriculture has not necessarily led to unequivocal progress. The nutritional standards of the growing Neolithic populations were inferior to that of hunter-gatherers. Several ethnological and archaeological studies conclude that the transition to cereal-based diets caused a reduction in life expectancy and stature, an increment in infant mortality and infectious diseases, the development of chronic, inflammatory or degenerative diseases (such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) and multiple nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia and mineral disorders affecting bones (such as osteoporosis and rickets) and teeth. Average height went down from 5&#39;10&quot; (178 cm) for men and 5&#39;6&quot; (168 cm) for women to 5&#39;5&quot; (165 cm) and 5&#39;1&quot; (155 cm), respectively, and it took until the twentieth century for average human height to come back to the pre-Neolithic Revolution levels.    </p>

<p>The traditional view is that agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to the development of different means of decision making and to governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not otherwise engaged in agriculture, industry or commerce, but dominated their communities by other means and monopolized decision-making. Jared Diamond (in The World Until Yesterday) identifies the availability of milk and cereal grains as permitting mothers to raise both an older (e.g. 3 or 4 year old) and a younger child concurrently. The result is that a population can increase more rapidly. Diamond points out that agriculture brought about deep social divisions and encouraged inequality between the sexes.</p>

<p>So with agriculture, you bring about the need for large scale governments, leaders, social elites, slaves. The people now fight over resources, especially because of population increases. With those increases, comes the need for more control. Today, there&#39;s only a handful of companies who control the vast majority of our food that comes from agriculture. Looking at this Wikipedia entry, you can see the various problems and devastating effects that large scale agriculture is having on our planet. It&#39;s helping drive climate change and climate change will undoubtedly cause famines due to droughts and other extreme weather patterns around the world. There&#39;s no way this will be sustainable unless some sort of major shift happens in at least the way we get our energy.   </p>

<p>Interesting to think that this one shift in our way of living has lead us down a very specific road and the knowledge from which this shift is accredited to, has basically the same story across the world, that it&#39;s from other worldly beings. Only through this shift has the control and enslavement of the entire human race been possible. The driving need to constantly improve technology, dig up oil, deforest the planet, emit greenhouse gases, use up a large portion of our water supply, etc. I&#39;m sure someone could have a field day really researching this topic under this specific lens. I&#39;ve only begun to look into it since I started this post yesterday and it&#39;s really making me think.  </p>
