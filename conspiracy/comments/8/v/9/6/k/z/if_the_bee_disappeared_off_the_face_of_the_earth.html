       In the UK, there's been a catastrophic annihilation of the insect population, to the point where the hedgerows are now silent.
Noticeable by their absence. Insects no longer prove a problem in the house or whilst travelling, because they're simply not there.

       I was just talking to a bee keeper the other day funny enough. He is expanding his hives, here in the UK the Asian hornet has arrived and could cause more problems apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it’s not just bees. Has anyone noticed how your car isn’t splattered with insects anymore ? I know in the UK it’s definitely noticable and someone from Germany has said the same. Somethings not right that’s for sure.

       Bees actually pollinate like 60 % of plants (random number i made up but it’s a lot of them)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also they produce Honey, and H202 hydrogen peroxide , which has been shown to be one of the best products known to man . And can be used in many many ways

       Well at least we get less insect bites. But yes it’s alarming. Though from what I understand there is a tick that is partly responsible and the armed winters have failed to kill these ticks off. So basically we need colder winters according to the new keeper I spoke to. How it effects other insects I don’t know. But we all know pesticides play a massive role in this. Plus the destruction of wilderness.

       Some forests in North America, mostly Canada, are being killed by the mountain pine beetle.  Several weeks of -40 weather is required each winter to keep the population in check, but those temps are becoming rare.  The result is mass die-offs of huge tracts of forest.  The wood turns blue and needs to be salvaged within a couple years or else it goes to waste.  The blue wood makes some neat furniture, but its an ominous sign.

Not only that but , animals in general acting weird along with the weather but that’s another story, on topic of animals acting weird , birds chirping at all times during the night when they use to never chirp at these times, running into windows a lot more, flight patterns odd, not staying together the same (more distance between the birds when in flock), Idk weird shit man

       I have had more birds hit my windows in the last month than in my whole life (WA, USA) and there is a noticeable absence of honeybees, and WAY more bumblebees. The mosquitoes didn't seem to get the notice, they are here in full force.

       Weird, me too! The insect thing I didnt agree with for my location, because although there seemed to be fewer amounts of certain species I've noticed in the past few years, this year they seem more numerous (fireflies are one example, we've had more of em than I've seen for about 5-7 years). Sometimes swings happen so I didn't think much of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've almost run over about 10 birds this year at least. That didn't want to move and barely did. I think i actually hit one today, I was heartbroken.

       This was actually something I just noticed this past month! Every time I've come across a bird in the road, it's never hopped to the right five inches to get out of the way. It's either stayed in that spot and I have to move around it, or it flies to the left right in front of my car.

       The chirping at late hours is due to artificial lighting throughout the nights (street lights, office lights etc). Unfortunately this is killing off bird life as they aren't resting correctly and becoming exhausted.

       I don't think it makes a great difference at speed. We've certainly had the window and front of the vehicle splattered to hell on long drives through areas with farmland so it still happens with the more aerodynamic shape but it's rare to see that and most long drives there aren't a lot of dead flies.

       Well there has been a huge change in how the insect population is controlled and also what controls them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been a reintroduction of numerous animal species that were previously removed from areas either intentionally or unintentionally for various reasons but usually always revolving around protecting farms/livestock. Their removal originally intended to help farmers produce more food but there were numerous consequences to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We first removed predators from farms/livestock/living areas to protect against attacks from them. While it allowed livestock/people/property to be safer it had an unintended consequence of removing a population control feature of prey animals.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q">
        Here is a short video that explains this issue with added benefit of how people have started to fix it and with that a reason why insect populations have started to be controlled better
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We next went after pest animals that had reproduced to extraordinary levels thanks to the above predator removal. This was to prevent them from eating the seeds, vegetables, etc... from farms. While it did work it too had numerous consequences that we didn't understand or think would happen. The animal pest removal had unintentionally also targeted non-pest animals which frequently ate pests i/e plant eating insects. This increased the number of insects and necessitated the need for the next issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the insect population grew drastically as they could breed/reproduce unhindered or controlled, their damage to food production did as well. This caused us to create more deadly/efficient pest control chemicals to deal with the problem. These chemicals too killed indiscriminately and so non-pest insects(pollinators and even insects which preyed on pest insects) were equally effected. It also caused mutations to appear in pest insects(not just ones that eat plants but sucking/biting insects that preyed on animals) which caused them to become much harder to kill. Eventually these chemicals stopped being as useful. This growth in insect populations also effected non-agricultural regions and so insect levels were huge all over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another major issue was the introduction of foreign species which happened thanks to lax import regulations which allowed them to stow away on shipments or even in the ballast tanks of ships(
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_mussel#North_American_invasion">
        as seen with the zebra mussel invasion of the great lakes
       </a>
       ). These species had further devastating effects on native animals specifically fish and other water based animals. As with the zebra mussel invasion and numerous others, the invasive species reproduced drastically which starved native species of oxygen which caused mass die offs of fish which was very prevalent in the late 20th century. The die offs caused a further increase in insect populations as the population in fish/other animals that ate them or their eggs/babies lowered. The invasive species sometimes would not eat insects so their benefit to the environment was generally negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time we started to learn what went wrong, how we caused it, and what could we possibly do to deal with it. We started by basically going backwards to an extent to undo the above which too had side effects that were unintentional but positive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of indiscriminately spraying pesticides to control insect populations, instead vastly more specific chemicals were introduced as well as regulated to help cut down on run off. The way we sprayed also changed as well. A new approach was found in which insects were targeted where they bred as well as where their higher numbers were found.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_30jPKzWdN0">
        Here is a good video which discusses this concept through Disney's implementation of it
       </a>
       . This lowered the amount of pesticide used which again lowered run off.
      </p>
      <p>
       That run off had unknowingly harmed animal species through various means which lowered their populations as well so the controlling efforts allowed a rebound effect of animal life. This population rebound caused a ripple effect which is discussed
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q">
        in this video
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Pest animals were also better controlled/targeted which allowed the beneficial pest eating animals to no longer be killed. An example would be how birds are dealt with around airports. Prior times all birds would just be killed off to prevent bird strikes from happening. New strategies involved deterring birds from staying within the immediate surrounding areas such as using dogs to chase them away or even sound broadcasts. This meant the birds could stay in region and reproduce.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a vast amount of further steps that were taken but this comment has already become entirely too long so I won't get into them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL:DR
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Basically we started to undo all the damage that we caused in the 1800's/1900's which allowed animal life to come back to normal levels which lowered the insect populations towards what they naturally would have been. This is why people are seeing less insects in some areas as the unnatural swarms that were prevalent in the past became something of the past.

       Surely having a set amount of wilderness per acre would go someway to start balancing out this ?  All we see is acres and acres of farmland with barely a hedgerow to sustain insect populations. Say 10 % or even 5 % of farmland given up to wilderness would help ?

       In the US, there are programs that pay farmers to not develop small amounts of land. Usually it's land that isn't very fertile, but still.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if there are any studies comparing US and UK farmland with respect to insects, and there would be a ton of confounding variables (e.g. neonicotinoids being banned in the UK). A comparison of the northern US Midwest and Canadian central-southern region might be interesting if there are rules that only apply on one side of the border.

       It would be really nice if you had some links to actual scientific papers and not videos.  Videos are almost impossible to check for validity or not - you basically have to trust the talking head, which I'm not willing to do.

       I searched but didn't hit a good search term.  I did find various anecdotes about mosquitos being extremely think for the early settlers, and lots of well-documented evidence of plagues of grasshoppers and locusts, but that's not enough.

       Growing up in Florida in the 70s and 80s, we’d have to stop at a gas station after an hour or so to wash the bugs off our windshields, the bugs were so bad.

       Is there truth to the “love bug” population dying off as well in central FL? Lived there 2000-2001 and they were ubiquitous, I recall stopping at gas stations to clear my windshield at night. Orlando.

       I have. And still don’t recall that many. Maybe there’s a spawning time ? It’s Midge central up there normally. I recall being eaten alive up in wick as a kid. I was up there about five years ago and it just wasn’t the same as I recall. And I was next to a burn on a hot day. I recall warning my SO about the midges, they were there just seemingly in less numbers.

       Aye some summer nights in Wick next to the peat stack in the garden was like being in a jungle with the amount of midges.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wondering how much of it is down to those clouds of midges being a lot bigger to a little boy who wants to play in the back garden, than they a man who'll say 'screw this' and pop inside after a couple of minutes.

       I got two downvotes for that. =(
      </p>
      <p>
       In the middle of the UK, the only people I hear using it are
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       , and other people my own age (mid 40's)......
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume then that it dropped out of favour in the mid UK sometime 20 or 30 years ago.

        Has anyone noticed how your car isn’t splattered with insects anymore ?

       I was thinking about this the other day while sitting on the back patio staring blankly off into space when I noticed that the bird feeder I filled a week ago hadn't been touched. If anything was eaten I couldn't tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminded me that I rarely run into common houseflies or mosquitoes anymore and I started to wonder what birds were eating (
       <em>
        definitely not the bird seed I was putting out
       </em>
       ) with the decline of insects and of course upon looking it up I ran across the obvious in seconds... bird populations everywhere are drastically dropping.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is going to keep trickling through the food chain and the end isn't going to be pretty.

       Sorry bud. I think I made it clear I just spoke to a bee keeper. He was talking about mites not other bees. That aren’t honey bees.

       I think I made it clear when I said Honey Bees kill other pollinators. And that the only thing that makes Honey Bees special is honey. Idgaf if you talked to a Bee Keeper, I also know Bee Keepers and I would have to let you know that anyone can become one..... no education necessary top kek

       Well that’s good for you pal. I was more commenting on the general decline of insects. Don’t recall claiming to be an expert in bees. Though I had never heard of honest bees killing other bees. But who know maybe.

       That’s normal. I believe 2017 was a mast year. A year with a lot of acorns falling from trees. There is a known correlation of mast years and ticks. More acorns means more food for small animals like mice. More ticks feed on the mice and can produce more eggs. The following year the tick population soars because of the abundant food the previous year. This happens about once every 5 years or so.

       I do not know whether bees will be the trigger or it will be something else, but you can be sure that once the ecosystem fails, humans will die in large numbers. Billions of people. We may well die out.

       Lightning bugs/fireflies seem to be on the decline as well - there's just less of them in the evening than 20, 30 years ago. I actually called my son over to the window last night to look at them doing their thing in the field next to our house. Thought about telling him to look and remember because
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       kids might not ever see such a magical thing, but I didn't want to existentially scare him so I just kept my mouth shut.
      </p>
      <p>
       My husband and I kept bees for the last ten years or so. We're not starting any hives this year because they've done so poorly the last couple of years. It gets depressing to watch after awhile.

       I have consistently had many bees feeding on clover in my yard for years.  I do not use Round Up or any other chemicals and I considered my yard a safe haven.  This year so far I’ve seen one or two.  Very concerning.

       I can't say for sure.  It's hard to find any science on the subject that Bayer or Monsanto hasn't gotten their dirty little hands on.  All the field tests have had different results depending on who sponsors the research and why, but according to some half-assed googling a conservative estimate of the soil persistence of neonicotinoids is between two hundred and a thousand days.  So yeah, it will be a good few years before we know for sure.  Might even be too late.

       I had a few bed bug bites one morning I woke up at a friend's house. Those fuckin things itched all to hell and took forever to heal. I haven't been back to his house. But who knows since it was just a few bites I could have picked it up in the Uber car.

       Whats more important, the health of the planet or presidential porn stars?  based on the media coverage, it seems that porn stars are the winner, for both Republican and Democrat party news sites.  I dont belong to any party, all the presidents are middle managers except for JFK, but If youre a Democrat, are you more interested in nailing trump to the wall for immigration and other manufactured issues, or do you want to continue to have food on the table? Combined with the grand solar minimum creating an increase in crop failures worldwide, the crash of the insect pollinators is gonna be hard on us.  Expect all political parties to blame the other for the problem, when more  important actions are needed.

       For what it’s worth, if you think immigration is a manufactured issue, wouldn’t it clearly be created by the administration that institutes cruel and dehumanizing policies? I personally believe Trump is filling the role of “headline creator and red herring instigator.” You’re pretty transfixed by the Stormy Daniels thing, but can you admit that Trump being a media lightning rod is in part because of his own ridiculous actions? Him using Twitter for insults and casual foreign policy is exactly what draws people away from his appointees like Pruitt raping the environment. Now, irresponsible and profit-driven news agencies pour fuel on the fire as well, but do you really think this is a “liberal/conservative” issue?

       There is no immigration issue, except for extreme leftist reactionary politics, and when i say manufactured, i mean peoples emotions are being used against their own common sense and rationality, by the 6 owners of the major media outlets.  Illegal immigration is illegal for a reason.

       no, but i believe the liberals are being bamboozled into reacting emotionally to  events and news cycles,  Save the immigrant children!  Maybe instead of blindly saying Trump is a monster, you actually look at who is putting the kids at risk, their own parents.  Seriously, is Trump responsible for the conditions in third world countries that cause parents to risk their child's lives by traveling across deserts and oceans, and eventually arrive at a border they know is illegal to cross? Is Trump responsible for the consequences of their actions, one of them being the separation from their children while they are held in detention?  The responsibility is solely the parent's who bring their children.  Nobody is forcing them, they are making choices, and they, and their children unfortunately, must bare the consequences.  Do you have any friends or family that immigrated legally by chance? I have several of both, and they are opposed to illegal immigration as well.  They worked hard to get here by the rules, because they wanted to be a contributor instead of a taker.

       My wife and I noticed the lack of bees in the States.  We talked about it for awhile and this spring pulled the trigger on our own bee hive.  While scary at first, I have a mild allegy to bees and spiders, it has actually been really interesting so far.  Watching them fly around and in and out of the hive is extremely relaxing.  I have done about 3 inspections of the hive and it has gotten easier with each go.  If you have a little bit of room, I would suggest looking into starting a colony.

       Honestly I don't even notice them.  The only time I see a large amount of them, and that's just by the hive, is when all the bees go out to learn to fly.  You inspect just to make sure everything is going well.  That egg laying patterns are correct as well as if you need to expand your hive.  Also like to make sure that I get my eyes on the queen and that she is ok.  Technically they can be left alone but by inspecting I could potentially catch something that would normally kill the colony

       Or it shows how honey bees are an invasive species in North america and there are 100s of other species that pollinate but their numbers are low do to the battle for food with honey bees.  So as the bee population drops these other species start to thrive and take over their jobs as the primary pollinators.

       TV "shows" me all sorts of things - aliens, a benevolent US government.  It's worthless without hard data.  Anyone can make a YouTube video to say anything they like.

       I need hard data to actually be convinced, and eventually that's going to be written data - ideally, peer reviewed studies with a link to the actual data and complete methodology.

       Or common sense.  Honey bees are an invasive species in North America.  A country with dozens of native bees species and thousands of plants that were all pollenized before the settlers came over with thier European honey bees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure we will have to get other insects to do the job of pollenizers that we currently use bee keepers for but it's not the end of days people are making it out to be.  Will losing honey bees cause a negative impact.  Yes of course.  Will it lead to world wide famine? No not even close.

       With all due respect, you can't fact-check a YouTube video very well.  You basically have to trust the talking head, and when it comes down I'm not willing to do that without seeing the data.

       Yes you can.  You can literally fact check any YouTube science video that claims to be based off facts.  Such as the fact that North America has no problem pollinating its plants before settlers introduced the honey bee there.

       The amount of Roundup, garbage, pharmaceuticals, etc in our water ends up back on our crop fields and in our taps. not to mention most older houses were originally built with copper piping which over time degrades into harmful chemicals.

       Never said anything of plastic pipes, dog. When water runs through a confined space for many years corrosion occurs. Older houses (100-150 years) also had fewer standards and precautions in the building process.
       <a href="http://www.repairmyleak.com/about/failure-copper.htm">
        This
       </a>
       says water can corrode through copper tubing in as little as two years, up to 50ish. The specks of copper end up in the water leading up to a leaking pipe.

       shows research from 2001 that copper and water at high temperature (albeit extreme temperatures) unexplainably turns into other chemicals.

       Nah man I get flies coming in the windows all the time I'm 2 floors up as well. It's so fucking annoying, they can somehow fly in the window with great accuracy and when they're in, they start circling my light shade and banging into walls. Worst part is, when you unleash the bug spray and eventually come back in to air out the room, the fly corpses are all dead on the window sill. I mean for fucksake why couldn't you just fly there in the first place and you wouldn't be dead.

       YMMV. Where I live in rural UK insects have been declining. 
Have you thought about getting nets or screens so you don’t have to spray insecticide and pesticides everywhere? Its that stuff that is killing nature and giving humans cancers.

       Wrong there are other insects that do same thing like Bee's

       For example when America was found there was no Bee's in that continent the Europeans brought Bee's to America

       Scientific fact, domestic honey bees are actually invasive species to the majority of ecosystems. Other life forms served the role of pollinators for millions pf years just fine until human used the domestic bees to out compete the native pollinators. Declining domestic bee population is bad for honey and food industry. But actually good for native species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also ecosystem are a lot more resilient than you think. One or two years of low insect populations is nothing to be alarmed of.

       I just want to point out that I work with a lot of bee keepers in a university setting. It seems thay bee drop that started a long time ago was due to a microscopic pathogen( sorry can remember if virus or bacterial) and that led to the large population decline. Their numbers have been recovering poorly due to competition by predators. They tried to create new hybrids merging the honey bee with African bees to increase the resistance to the pathogen, but the recovery process is long and the news bees show much higher levels of aggression

       I’m in Edinburgh and we actually seem to have an abundance of big fuzzy bumblebees in my garden (near coastal area) right now and at any time I’m out in the back They’re always buzzing at my oriental Lily and foxglove, and a lot of them are living under my back door step where there’s a slot between the slabs (someone said they’re masonry bees but those are meant to be solitary, these go in in groups sometimes of six a time so I think it’s a growing colony - started with one or two but seems to be getting more busy).  I won’t let my mum block the step up to prevent them because they don’t attack us, they just back and forth over the garden enjoying the flowers and go back to the step and disappear inside.  Freaks my mum out but they seem pretty non aggressive considering their nest is right where we’re standing or near our bench where we sit a lot.  Guess they lucked out finding a nest three feet from lots of flowers and seven feet from flowering shrubs.  We don’t interfere with their routes really.
      </p>
      <p>
       First time in 8 years I’ve lived here I’ve seen so much bee activity. Makes me wonder if they’re maybe doing better this year, especially with the heatwave meaning flowers are growing better, hope so, anyway.  I’m happy to see them, something about bees makes me smile.  I watch them as I have my morning coffee.

       I've definitely noticed a steep decline in the number of insects over the last decade or so here in the UK. Growing up, I remember seeing a lot of bees and butterflies. I can't recall the last time I've seen either. I'm no expert on the subject, but I'd wager the decline is linked directly to the production methods used for growing produce as well as the decline in 'natural' land.

       This is what's gong on in Massachusetts, USA for several years.
      </p>
      <p>
       none of the usual sounds of nighthawks during the evening, night and dawn during spring and summer for two years now
I've heard their raspy squeaks every year of my life during the warm season, but this year there were only a few at the beginning of the warm weather.  I heard one again the evening of June 29.  Since then none.
(nighthawk sounds:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aHlV7syK1Q">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aHlV7syK1Q
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       abnormally few crickets singing
only a scattering of junebugs buzzing 
too few katydid click noises from the up in trees where they should have been
All these insects started their noises much later in the summer than normal. There were more cricket sounds on some nights than others, though still oddly few of them, and it seemed like something happened on certain days that either killed or incapacitated a lot of them with the noise of very few, and then they'd be back a few nights later but there were still much fewer than there should be.  Some nights only one or two crickets were making noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the summers I can remember little green leaf hoppers managed to get insde in spite of screens attracted by inside lights on during nightime.  They came to pop around the light I sit by, but this year I saw maybe two.
No flies!
none of the usual scent of skunk outside where in years past they've come to drink from the fountain outside in warm weather 
no smell of skunk sprayed on some cat or dog or raccoon during an encounter
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw only one squirrel last spring, and very few the last year.  They should be jumping around the tree branches outside my window, but there are none, and I saw no dead squirrels run over by cars during spring mating season which is a predicable occurance every spring.
      </p>
      <p>
       awful silence last fall instead of starlings' yearly pre-roosting sounds
Many should have gathered in the nearby pine trees as they always have during fall, but they didn't. None at all. (starling sounds:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4pHGgV2Fqo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4pHGgV2Fqo
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Bluejays have been outside last autumn, and the sounds they make are nothing like I've ever heard.  They sound scary and abnormal, and as if they're in distress.
      </p>
      <p>
       no more gangs of sparrows on the trees outside my windows last spring and summer-only a handful some mornings and other days none at all
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one mosquito got into my apartment all last summer.
       <br/>
       No green leafhoppers, and very few of those tiny gnats(?) got in at night attracted by the artificial lights.  It's expected there'd be many as in past summers.

       Growing up in Florida in the 70s and 80s, we’d have to stop at a gas station after an hour or so to wash the bugs off our windshields, the bugs were so bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were so many you literally couldn’t see through them to drive! No joke.

       I have. And still don’t recall that many. Maybe there’s a spawning time ? It’s Midge central up there normally. I recall being eaten alive up in wick as a kid. I was up there about five years ago and it just wasn’t the same as I recall. And I was next to a burn on a hot day. I recall warning my SO about the midges, they were there just seemingly in less numbers.

       Here in central Texas, USA I know several people in a Master Naturalist program who keep hives, and they say it's been good here, but around Texas there have been less and less bees. Anecdotal, I know, so please take with a grain of salt.

        Has anyone noticed how your car isn’t splattered with insects anymore ?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I was thinking about this the other day while sitting on the back patio staring blankly off into space when I noticed that the bird feeder I filled a week ago hadn't been touched. If anything was eaten I couldn't tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminded me that I rarely run into common houseflies or mosquitoes anymore and I started to wonder what birds were eating (
       <em>
        definitely not the bird seed I was putting out
       </em>
       ) with the decline of insects and of course upon looking it up I ran across the obvious in seconds... bird populations everywhere are drastically dropping.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is going to keep trickling through the food chain and the end isn't going to be pretty.

       With all due respect, you can't fact-check a YouTube video very well.  You basically have to trust the talking head, and when it comes down I'm not willing to do that without seeing the data.
