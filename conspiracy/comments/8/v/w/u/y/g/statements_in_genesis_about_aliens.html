        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It says in the bible (the original hebrew that I&#39;m used to since I was taught hebrew as a child) that the &#39;elohim&#39; (which loosely translates as &#39;powers&#39;) created man in their image, which I take to mean that aliens engineered men in their image. Why did they create man though? Perhaps they wanted to use tech that would eventually be discovered by men.... It also says in genesis that some aliens saw that the daughters of man were good so they descended and took them for themselves. So it seems that the human girls were actually better than the alien chicks which is why they preferred them. This indicates that what they created may actually be superior to themselves.</p>

<p>It also states that god regretted what he did since man was filled with evil, so he destroyed all life in the great flood and and started over the human race with Noah and his family. I&#39;m not sure what was better about Noah it seems today that we are still in the same mode of evil.</p>

<p>Also in genesis it says the Enoch found favor in the eyes of the &#39;elohim&#39; so they took him aboard their ships.</p>

<p>Going within the bounds of your own thesis: I don&#39;t think it would have to be because human women were better. Just that they were &quot;different&quot;. Perhaps human men would be attracted to alien women if they looked humanoid enough- perhaps some men would find them more attractive than any human woman, because they&#39;re the &quot;other&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure what was better about Noah </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because in Genesis Noah was willing to listen to God. No one else would. Hence he was automatically better than anyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also in genesis it says the Enoch found favor in the eyes of the &#39;elohim&#39; so they took him aboard their ships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the wording leaves open the possibility that Enoch perhaps became enlightened like Buddha and was able to converse with God, the gods, or perhaps even aliens, on a level above the average humans of his day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend you read the book of enoch.</p>

<p><a href="http://reluctant-messenger.com/1enoch01-60.htm">http://reluctant-messenger.com/1enoch01-60.htm</a></p>

<p>Then i would recommend you practice meditation. I grew up Christian but left it after reading about other religions. I dont care much for religion. As a matter of fact the only doctrines that align sorta with what i believe are buddhism and satanism. Check out the tenants of satanism and you&#39;ll prolly find they sound reasonable</p>

<p><a href="https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets">https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets</a></p>

<p>Finally i would suggest these podcast</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up a Baptist, slid into anger and agnosticism, then atheism and Raelianism. I read Intelligent Design (free PDF from Rael.org), and nothing has better explained both the Old Testament and why the world is like it is.</p>

<p>Since you know Hebrew and I don&#39;t, I was taught that one translation of &quot;Elohim&quot; is &quot;those from the sky&quot; – the singular being Eloha. I&#39;ll give you the Cliff&#39;s Notes of the belief system, since a lot is in the book and some is from talking to other Raelians.</p>

<p>The Elohim live on another planet in the Milky Way, and they arrived at a place in their civilization&#39;s development that was much like ours today: a lot of wisdom and science progressing, but still a bunch of power-hungry assholes destroying the ecosystem, creating strife and keeping the rest from understanding they were part of a planetary culture. The scientists figured out DNA sequencing and space travel around the same time (much like us today, if you accept that there is secret UFO tech. used by those in power currently). They started sequencing from scratch and making various organic things, from plants to animals, but there was a general moral outcry and/or questioning from the public about whether they should be cloning anything at all (like when Dolly the sheep was in the news). Supposedly, they made something rather horrible, and something bad happened – like a T-Rex escaped from the lab and ate a nursery school. So the public demanded that they do it elsewhere if they do it at all.</p>

<p>Being able to travel across the galaxy led them to discover Earth, and they started playing with the ecosystem, pulled the moon into place for a nice vantage point, and made simple organisms to see how they would grow in the environment – then on to more complex plants and animals. They had developed the science to clone themselves and/or make humans from scratch, and finally decided to make hominids to see what they&#39;d do. The consensus was to keep them dumb; the people on the home planet didn&#39;t want fucked-up mutants figuring out enough science that they could come to the home planet and mess with them. Evidently, the operations were roughly successful, except they couldn&#39;t get the human prototypes to stop fighting each other over women and resources.</p>

<p>So, these experiments were destroyed a few times over, using what we&#39;d understand to be massive atomic explosions. The scientists decided the only way to proceed was to give us enough knowledge to evolve on our own, thus &quot;Let us make man in our own image.&quot; The home planet said, &quot;OK, but you can&#39;t give them the &#39;knowledge of good and evil,&#39; meaning the same science that brought us into existence, and that the Elohim must continue to appear &quot;as gods,&quot; to them. </p>

<p>It became a sort of test and competition between seven groups of scientists who created seven different &quot;races&quot; – the precursors to the races we know today, and the only reasonable explanation I&#39;ve heard as to why races appear in clusters and are largely relegated to individual continents. </p>

<p>Random tidbits:
-The head of the whole project is the dude we know as Yaweh, who is one of 12 governing Eloha for the planet.
-The most successful of the races were the Semites, which is why there&#39;s evidence of alien presence and technology in the ruins of Sumerian cultures (their precursor), and the head of that scientific team is the guy we now blame as Lucifer. This guy was a fan of telling the humans everything and bringing them up to speed – and he and his team were also the ones responsible for breeding with the Earth gals, as you mention, and is the root of many myths/stories. This was considered to be a huge no-no from the home planet and the rest of the scientific community, so Yahweh said, &quot;Dude, if you like Earhlings so much, you can just stay there,&quot; and so Lucifer and his team were prohibited from coming back to the home planet for a while. Most of the Old Testament stories about men interacting with &quot;God&quot; are about this relationship, e.g., they would bring the Elohim &quot;burnt offerings&quot; because they wanted to make sure the meat was free of Earth-borne pathogens and they liked the bacon extra-crispy. Evidently, the commandment to &quot;not take the lord&#39;s name in vain&quot; came about because the Earthlings were always bothering them about petty shit they wanted to know.</p>

<p>This went on until the teams decided that the whole project wasn&#39;t that great, Earthlings were still dumb as hell, killing each other, stealing, and generally being jagoffs, so it was decided they would wipe the place out again, and this was the great flood. They saved various species that did well – along with a selection of humans who were peaceful and seemed to have a predisposition for enlightenment (the Noah story). </p>

<p>At around the same time, there was a time capsule that either crash landed or was discovered on their own planet, and it was from their own creators, who had seeded life there in the same way the scientists were seeding life on earth. The message was that this wasn&#39;t to be taken lightly, and that it&#39;s more than just a science experiment: it is how life and consciousness is spread through the universe. So the Elohim were like, &quot;Shit, we gotta stop making people and killing them,&quot; (the post-flood &quot;rainbow promise), and they started sending prophets and teachers instead, to all the different cultures to deliver the root message of LOVE that can be found in the words of Christ and the Buddha, et. al. – and also to help us out a little.</p>

<p>After we developed atomic energy and used it to wipe out cities, they stepped up the game and started flying their crafts around in a very visible way to give us clues, crashed the team at Roswell so we could steal their tech, etc. Of course, it&#39;s being kept from us by the jackasses who still think they can be our own Earth-bound gods and control humanity themselves.</p>

<p>The part that explains everything to me is that Earth was their FIRST experiment at creating life on another planet. Evidently, they&#39;ve created three other planetary civilizations, taking what they&#39;ve learned here to do it right in the first place. We&#39;re left to either evolve or perish if we can&#39;t figure it out.</p>

<p>There&#39;s one fascinating character left: the guy we call Satan is another Eloha and another of the 12 elders who govern the home planet. He thinks this is absurd and that we should all be wiped out because the suffering that is caused by our own ignorance and inabilities is universally unjust. He literally wants to destroy humanity, which is why he&#39;s earned his bad rep., but we haven&#39;t been taught his motivations. The tests that he supposedly puts people through in the O.T. were to prove to his fellows that man is/was not wired effectively enough to survive and evolve properly.</p>

<p>I like Raelian&#39;s because their atheists but very &quot;spiritual,&quot; and don&#39;t live by a bunch of creeds and rules and they&#39;re not evangelists. If you believe the message, they don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a part of the group or not. What they teach is daily meditation, weekly fasting, don&#39;t smoke, drink in moderation, love each other, and have as much fun as humanly possible because we may not be around much longer. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave the rest to his book, if you care to download and read, and if you don&#39;t, bless you and have fun. I just think it&#39;s a great story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure elohim means either &quot;the people of El&quot; or &quot;the most high god&quot;. The truth of the matter is Genesis is tied to religious traditions long before the Jews started worshiping Yahweh. El was the supreme ruler of their proto-Judaic pantheon of gods. El is typically viewed as being analogous to Saturn (also Set and Satan, most likely). in essence, the proto-Judaic religion was the worship of Satan and his followers. And that is what is going on in Genesis. I think they likely were aliens, but they might have simply been the human god-emperors from a forgotten golden age, immortalized into myth. </p>
