        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The greatest lie ever told to women, which women swallowed hook, line and sinker, was that somehow working 60 hours a week towards a career and being financially independent is somehow more noble and worthwhile than having children and devoting their life to raising them.</p>

<p>Let us step back and consider what is the #1 most important factor in the continued survival of the human race.  What is absolutely crucial to our continuing evolution towards becoming intellectually superior beings?  Reproduction.  Yes, reproduction and the need to reproduce is pretty much the primary driver behind a majority of human behavior and, well at least up until recently, was the reason gender roles and social constructs existed.  Nature ensured the continual evolution of human to produce smarter and stronger offsprings by making certain traits, like intelligence and physical strength, and other physical features be more attractive than say, laziness or stupidity.  The system worked.  For hundred of thousands of years, humans evolved, getting stronger, taller, and smarter.  Smart women realized what kind of man would be most suited to take care of their offspring and provide for the family, so those men got to have more kids.  In return, these women were able to have more resources and raise their kids with less difficulty than women who poorly chose their mates. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s jump to the present.  More and more women are choosing their career and independence over having a family.  So, ask yourselves, who are the majority of these women who are choosing such a path.  Is it a woman with a 80 IQ?  Or is it more likely a woman with a 120 IQ who&#39;s pursuing a career in medicine, law, or science?  I would postulate that it is the latter.  What are the consequences of having the smartest women stop reproducing?  </p>

<p>Well, if we believe the recent hype that a majority of the intelligence is inherited from the maternal family line, then we are in serious trouble.  (I don&#39;t believe this.  I believe that intelligence is a combined trait inherited from both parents. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/intelligence-is-inherited-only-from-your-mother/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/intelligence-is-inherited-only-from-your-mother/</a>  But even so, the point I&#39;m trying to make is still valid)  This would mean that the people who the world needs the MOST to reproduce, i.e. highly intelligent people, are reproducing the least.  In effect, we are reducing the overall intelligence of the world. <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-05-25/western-iqs-drop-14-points-last-century-study-says">https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-05-25/western-iqs-drop-14-points-last-century-study-says</a></p>

<p>Why?  Why did they convince women to ignore the bigger picture of human survival and our evolution towards superior humanity and instead, force feed this nonsense that raising a family is stupid and having a baby is a burden?  </p>

<p>It is because a dumb population is much easier to control and manipulate than a smart population.  Those in control, those who have wealth that is hidden from us that reach levels we can not even fathom, would like a population that will never rise up against them.  It is much easier to convince a group of lesser intelligent population by telling them, &quot;hey, these guys are evil.  These guys are ripping you off.  These guys are the enemy.  Go kill them&quot; than to actually convince free thinkers and those who can&#39;t be brainwashed.  This is why feminism has been pushed so hard against us ever since the end of WW2.  Because the end of that war was the time that our current overlords consolidated their power and still rule over us to this day, even though most people aren&#39;t even aware of their existence.</p>

<p>Do you need further proof?  Consider abortion.  Do you ever notice that the left&#39;s argument is ALWAYS about the rights of the woman?  Rarely do the left debate on the father&#39;s rights (after all, you don&#39;t get pregnant alone and certainly, the father is held financially responsible for any burdens should the woman choose to have the child) or that a fetus is at least, partial human or at the very least, it has the full potential to BECOME a human, and thus, should AT LEAST, have partial rights.   Why is that?  </p>

<p>It is because abortion is another weapon used to convince the woman that having children and raising a family is a &quot;bad thing&quot;.  Now, I&#39;m not saying abortion is bad or not bad.  Nor am I saying it should be legal/illegal.  I&#39;m merely saying that abortion, among other weapons like sexual harassment, are used to convince women that &quot;Hey, having children is bad.  Relying on your husband is bad.  Just work, make money, then die alone&quot;.... </p>

<p>I am truly saddened by the antagonist relationship that is the default for couples these days.  I&#39;m truly saddened by the divorce rates that keep climbing, the MGTOW movement that is the result of the sadistic intent behind the feminist movement, and the common place hatred and anger from women towards men.  But most of all, I feel saddened by these women who are now in their 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s regretting their decisions not to have a family and a husband.  They are the victims of the plan that has been in place since 1945.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see your logic at work, but I think it was the industrial revolution and the need for factory workers that was originally behind encouraging women to work. </p>

<p>As to whether that was beneficial to the family, that is up for debate. No one size fits all. Certainly in the case of a woman having younger children, it would be better for her to be spending time at home, if the family can afford that. </p>

<p>I believe that women leaving the home is a loss for everyone there, but it is also a loss not having grandma and grandpa around (there is a larger argument here about the loss of the nuclear family and the wisdom being passed on through generations). In an ideal world both mom and dad could work part-time from home and both be present in the raising of children.</p>

<p>Basic income would allow for this; alas, so many people seem eager to pick it apart rather than find out ways for it to be implemented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make good points.  I have been and always will be a libertarian.  I always thought the Gov&#39;t should not support people.  You are responsible for yourself and no one else.  I still believe that.</p>

<p>But... recently, I also realized something.  Automation can now do the work of 100 people.   A simple bulldozer can remove dirt that took 100 people 10 hours to do, in 1 hour.  So, the amount of money that was generated to support 100 people is now shared between the owner and operator of the bulldozer.   You install a robot arm in a factory and, what took 50 people do to, you no longer need anyone.</p>

<p>And, I think I have a problem with this.  If you eliminate jobs, you should pay a portion of what it would have taken you to get the same thing done with people.  Hmm, This is an important point.  If you reduce jobs in our country by automation, then you should be at least partially responsible for taking care of those who are jobless because of you.</p>

<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong.  I think basic income allowance will the country into a worse state.  I think it will be possible when robotics takes over enough tasks that we can afford this.  Not now.  But soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the factory is unreasonably hazardous?  Say workers die because of negligence.  The owner isn&#39;t responsible because the workers could have worked somewhere else?  What about injuries incurred during manufacturing?  Is the employee responsible for that too since he/she could have worked somewhere safer?  </p>

<p>The basic point I&#39;m trying to make is that the view that worker/employer relationship is a simple financial contract is too naive.  There are many factors to consider.  Yes, I believe in employment at will.  Yes, I believe that if you don&#39;t like a job, you should quit and find another.  But to say that that&#39;s all there is to labor is quite stupid.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are either not thinking about what we&#39;re trying to say, or they&#39;re here to sway the conversation and make our claims sound unfounded. These are real concerns about our current society and the future of our world! Everyone working just to have enough money to live, is not empowering anyone except the people who profit from our hours worked, and it&#39;s not us. This is all a ploy to get everyone working and feeling like they matter. Do women who work in jobs where they are not valued and are barely making enough money COMBINED with their partner&#39;s, feel empowered just because they&#39;re working, it do they not have a choice? 
Anything someone wants to give purpose to, will be fulfilling for them. The problem here is that we don&#39;t value every individual&#39;s choice and therefore don&#39;t pay a living wage to do it. I&#39;m an over-educated preschool teacher who loves what I do, but don&#39;t make much over minimum wage. People don&#39;t understand when they ask me why I&#39;m not using my graduate degree to earn more money, that my degree is not where my passion is anymore, and truthfully, as soon as I have kids, my passion will be to raise my children. But how can I do that when my partner also just makes barely over minimum wage? You can&#39;t always just marry for money or move up the socio-economic ladder as quickly or as easily as they&#39;d like us to think. So we learn to live with less and not buy into, literally, the way of life they sell us in America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe me, that is the kind of conversation I was looking for, and yes you are absolutely right, is not only about the degree, because I know a folk who has an MBA and because of unemployment had to go drive comercial trucks for living, the pay is not bad at all (like 5 grand/mo) but he has to be away from home for weeks, his wife cannot work because she has to be in charge of the home, and by in charge I mean all of it, bills, contractors for fixing stuff, she even had to take some mechanical course for taking care of her car, she has also a degree in history and gives private lessons to neighboring children but still she cannot do the researching job she would like because the husband has to be away, and I think there are also cases in which she has the good job and earns money and the husband stays at home and do the all the errands, I think is wrong just turn a blind eye on things or get offended just because someone questions something that is labeled as “progressive” but is not totally right </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your last words sum this up perfectly, just because something is labeled as progressive, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right or good for the world. Take AI and robots, seemingly here to make our lives easier, but just think of all the bad things that could come from it. </p>

<p>Bottom line : if both parents are working, who is raising the children? This is a huge reason our world is going to shit, not the other way around like they&#39;d like us to think, that women working world wide us making the world better. That&#39;s just lies to get us all working to make them the most money possible, it&#39;s sickening when you think about it...We are just slaves to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is this theory that monogamy was established by the ruling classes as a means to control themselves in order not to monopolize all the females, and avoid an uprising. The Church then was in charge of such check and balances.</p>

<p>It makes sense; a women would be better off with an extremely rich man (theoretically better genes) than a poor one, even <em>if</em> she had to share him with other women. This is recurrent in primates. </p>

<p>Now at a 1:1 ratio between men and women, this monopolization would lead to the majority of men mateless, and with nothing to lose. </p>

<p>Males currently reproduce 5-6 times less than women do.  In times past the ratio was even steeper (<a href="https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success">https://psmag.com/environment/17-to-1-reproductive-success</a>).   </p>

<p>Men have always been the more disposable class.  That&#39;s what the numbers show.  It&#39;s funny how this never gets talked about, despite it being a remarkably illustrative bit of data.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not specific to feminism.  Many of these movements have their hearts in the right place, but are &quot;useful idiots.&quot;  The way they are idiots is because the foundation of these movements is &quot;identity politics.&quot;  Identity politics are used to divide everyone, including those who really are for each other.  Black lives matters is stoked to divide white from black.  Third wave feminism divides men and women.  LGBTQ divides straight from everyone else.  TERF (trans exclusionary radical feminists) divide transgendered folks from women.  Are you starting to see the pattern?  All of those are liberal groups, but they all cause divisions between liberals.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re on the right track, but thinking too small, and falling for the trick, pitting you against feminism.</p>

<p>To answer your question, I&#39;m using language to point out how those groups divide against one another.  How else are you supposed to show how they breed hate against one another and prevent themselves and us from actually overcoming purposeful division?</p>

<p>There are groups that don&#39;t believe in pigeonholing their group.  Like the Debt Collective, which advocates not just for student debt relief, but for a new society that doesn&#39;t simply profit by suckering the lowest common denominator, of which I am guilty of being part of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mind defending my position.  If I can&#39;t defend my position, then it&#39;s not much of a position to defend.</p>

<p>Antifa represents the left <em>insofar</em> as a lot of &quot;moderate progressives&quot; I know refuse to see a problem with their tactics.  I&#39;ve had at least 4 friends I know to be highly intelligent (artists, lawyers, research scientists) say &quot;the time for civility has passed.&quot;  WTF?  </p>

<p>If you take &quot;punch a nazi in the face&quot; literally and make it an objective goal... well, you can&#39;t.  One man&#39;s nazi may simply be a centrist espousing views that are not wrong but make the observer very uncomfortable due to cognitive dissonance or ideological possession.  That&#39;s the underlying problem preventing us reaching solutions.  </p>

<p>You can say &quot;in a perfect world&quot; we could identify and punch nazis, but in a perfect world there would be no need for violence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right&#39;s only means of gaining attention is to appeal to peoples identity (nationality, race)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, I can see from your perspective, but it has not been my experience when actually sitting down and talking with someone the left labels (yes, I see the irony) as right wing.  When you enter a discussion without using the clichés of the media, have a heart to heart with someone you believe you fundamentally disagree with, you will more often than not find that you disagree with the messaging and not the messenger.</p>

<p>Since our schools don&#39;t teach communication or critical thinking worth a damn, it can be difficult to espouse our ideas in an original manner (i.e. from the heart).  It is far easier to remember that blurb from the news we prefer and use that (carefully) crafted sound-bite to attempt to espouse our argument.  Unfortunately, those carefully crafted sound-bites are not just the literal words used, but a vehicle for a host of other ideas that are tied to it.</p>

<p>Think of it.  What are all the ideas that flood your head with these key words/terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>feminist</li>
<li>alt-right</li>
<li>nazi</li>
<li>brown coat</li>
<li>black lives matter</li>
<li>Bernie backer</li>
<li>GOP</li>
<li>DNC</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of those words/terms carries a whole host of other ideas with it that we find hard to separate from one another.</p>

<p>The solution is to talk to one another, face to face.  Let go of assumptions and find your MAGA hat wearing uncle and say &quot;Hey fam, I see you&#39;re justifiably upset about some policy or situation that&#39;s affecting you.  It&#39;s not affecting me the same, but let&#39;s talk about it like we&#39;re building a house and see if we can&#39;t come up with a solution together.&quot;</p>

<p>The same thing with how breastfeeding was disappearing by the 70&#39;s, as baby formulas were touted as &quot;better&quot; than maternal milk. </p>

<p>The same as women in the workforce. This was all to bring down the costs of labor, and increase consumption of goods and services as less time was spent on home caring.</p>

Men’s roles are elevated as worthwhile, more important and respected while women’s roles are depicted as unvalued and condemned as drudgery. All roles/tasks have their share of drudgery and high points, but that’s not what is portrayed as the “cool parent”.

<p>The reason you make a fuss about women and men’s roles is from the same poisoned source.  You think it’s <em>unfair</em> that the naturally endowed parent be limited to the role of caretaker.  This role could be portrayed as priceless, fulfilling and challenging, as well as hip and cool. But, no.  Stay at home moms are seen as wasting their potential and brains amidst endless drudgery.  Career is a mirage —it has its own share of drudgery, frustrations, abuses, and monotony. Women have been fooled into wanting something that will hurt them and their children, their partner, their family.  For what?  A little extra money?  A little prestige?  Is it really worth it?  The price is our children’s safety and well being, our family’s stability and resilience, our living for something that has no loyalty for our service. Very foolish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into this for a while now. The lies and empty promises that feminism had sold to women have undoubtedly destroyed the foundations of an enduring society at the cost of their well being. But I think you hit the nail right on the head with this. It was a genius victory for TPTB on two fronts by convincing the smart ones to relentlessly pursue education so they can get jobs to pay off the enormous debt of ever-increasing tuition costs, get them paying into the tax system, and not reproduce, while incentivizing the dumb ones to reproduce more by the welfare state saying the more kids you have, the more we pay you but you can&#39;t have a man in the house. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a breeding project to make the most docile, agreeable, and easily-controlled populace that is just smart enough to push the buttons and pull the levers, but too dumb to question the system and form a resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody says that being a homemaker is bad?  Really?  Have you not heard the feminist rants for the whole past century?  That they need to throw away the &quot;shackles&quot; that men and society have placed on them through gender roles?  That financial independence is the MOST important thing a woman can achieve?  Where have you been?  And no.  I&#39;m not saying force women to stay home and raise families.  I&#39;m saying, why has being a fulltime mom become a demeaning thing when in fact, it is the most beautiful thing in the world.  When it is absolutely the most crucial thing in the future success of the human race, why is it looked down upon?  Because we were all brainwashed by the feminists.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are stating my point but you have no idea you&#39;re doing it.  My whole point is that having and raising children is as every bit as important as becoming the CEO of Pepsi.  But you are programmed to think that becoming the CEO of Pepsi is somehow more &quot;fulfilling&quot; or &quot;noble&quot; than raising kids.  And that anyone who questions this tenet is sexist and misogynistic.  </p>

<p>The fact that YOU THINK I&#39;m saying women belong in the kitchen, or that women shouldn&#39;t choose what they do with their lives just proves how brainwashed we all are.  I didn&#39;t say it nor did I even suggest it.  You&#39;re being hostile to me just because you think I&#39;m saying women should do this or women should do that... I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m merely saying we&#39;re being programmed to THINK that women who have careers are somehow more worthy or better humans than women who choose to have a family.</p>

<p>How much can I make this clearer?  The CEO of a major company may make their shareholders happy.  She may make a lot of money for herself.  This is all good.  But there&#39;s a cost to this.  This great woman who can run a fortune 500 company?  Well, she could have had 7 kids who had her genes, who in turn could have had 7 more kids each, which would result in 49 kids being smart, inventive, successful, and creative.  They could have helped thousands of others by becoming doctors, scientists, or become rescue workers.  But we don&#39;t get that.  Why?  Because women these days think having a career and making money is more important.  I hope you understand what I&#39;m trying to say.  I really do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Classic. You&#39;re rightfully getting shredded in the comments, yet rather than consider that your argument is flawed or even just poorly explained, your only conclusion is that everyone else is simply too dumb to comprehend your genius solution for society. </p>

<p>The only one in favor of programming here is you; you want to &#39;reprogram&#39; women to stay home and poop out babies, just like the good old days. What you&#39;re failing to see is that the desire to be more than an incubator is not some malevolent illuminati programming; it&#39;s human nature. A woman&#39;s ambition to move into the world and make something of herself is no different than it is for a man. Are men also being programmed by TPTB to reach the height of their potential?</p>

<p>If your argument was intellectually honest, you&#39;d be asking men to give up their careers to be better fathers, or for society at large to refocus on families, or for pushing the ceiling of the maximum sustainable human population - but instead you&#39;re solely focused on control over women. Your argument about the potential for a woman to have a dozen children, all with their own potential, is especially disingenuous; only half of those children will have any potential. The girls are all destined to be broodmares in your Handmaids Tale society. </p>

<p>If you really cared about human potential, you wouldn&#39;t be in favor of sidelining 50% of humanity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I entered the news media industry around 15 years ago, just when the best years of critical journalism were ending. </p>

<p>You know what I observed occurring during this transitional period to what it is now? Overwhelmingly, newspaper editor&#39;s positions were being handed to females of all ages, but primarily younger. The older men were being replaced by young women. </p>

<p>I&#39;m my experience, female newspaper editors operate differently to males. The macho competitiveness is removed, the late night drinking with contacts was removed, the willingness to cover mildly dangerous and controversial stories was removed. They&#39;re more likely to want to please all parties, they&#39;re unwilling to challenge higher up direction, leading to more compliance, and they&#39;re comfortable with accepting government press releases as gospel and report it as such.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say that the culture change affects all industries, but from what I and my colleagues witness over a decade of change, we mostly agreed on basic observations regarding this.</p>

<p>&quot;majority of the intelligence is inherited from the maternal family line, then we are in serious trouble. (I don&#39;t believe this. I believe that intelligence is a combined trait inherited from both parents.&quot; Now you are saying you don&#39;t believe something that is studied, yet you have no problem using studies you DO believe in.</p>

<p>It was hard to take you serious, although believe it or not, I have written about this exact matter about six months ago. My point was quite opposite tho: men need to take a more active role as caregivers. It has been studied that children who spend more time with their fathers are healthier, have higher IQs, have better self-esteem, and are happier.</p>

<p>The reason highly educated women don&#39;t reproduce as much is because having children affect so much their careers. Now, imagine if women didn&#39;t have to give up their careers to have children, but would actually trust their partners to be an excellent caregiver too? So men of intelligent women, you need to step up, it&#39;s essential for the betterment of humanity!</p>

<p>The whole point of the post is to try to explain why women were deceived into believing that having careers is more important than having children.  From the point of the survival of the human race, reproduction is much more important than careers.  Yet we all (men and women) are taught everyday that careers are more important.  Why is that?  What could be more important that the survival of our species?  You talk very condescendingly without making any valid points.  Perhaps instead of trying to attack people, if you actually make a case to refute a point with examples and logic, you&#39;d make much better posts.</p>

<p>After doing all this, how the hell do you think they were &quot;deceived&quot;? as if women had better life back then. This is a classic case of you having a rose tinted worldview of the past, and not having a proper grasp of history and various movements of your own country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yet we all (men and women) are taught everyday that careers are more important.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets use common sense for a moment here. Who in their right mind would want to give up their individual goals, their motivation to achieve great things in their chosen careers and instead want to clean up your utensils, cook food for you and clean your toilet? </p>

<p>You conservatives offer no compelling reason why women should give up their goals and be subservient to you. At every turn and way, people with views like you try everything to try and remove their hard earned rights. And get surprised, shocked even like you are doing here, that many women don&#39;t subscribe to your archaic beliefs and views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiments, it&#39;s something that&#39;s dawned on me the closer I get to having kids. We&#39;re barely making it without a kid with both of us working, how can I be raise my child and take care of the how with only one income these days? The system wants me to put my child in the care of strangers from almost month one, and make you go work on someone else&#39;s dream, when you think about it. Being a preschool teacher, I&#39;ve seen that even rich parents chose to work and put their kids in daycare rather than be at home and not make as much money. </p>

<p>My feelings boil down to this: CHILDREN NEED THEIR FAMILIES! Children need to be taught morals and values from their family and be nurtured in their culture and educated on their history. America is severely lacking in these areas and I think we can all agree that our society is going down hill, and fast, especially when you factor in technology and the lack of connection amongst our youth. They have hopes like we all have had in our generations, but they are being bombarded by distractions and cheap thrills that unfortunately cloud the minds of too many. But things are changing, I feel it when I talk to people, I can feel it.</p>

<p>I believe that the intent is to have EVERYONE working so we&#39;re busy, stressed out, and exhausted, saving just enough energy and money to shop for things we don&#39;t need. We&#39;re chattle to tptb, just here to serve whatever they need from us. Now with technology advancing the way it is, we are being driven from our jobs and there won&#39;t be an equal replacement of jobs for the masses in the coming years, so what do they do with us? I think they will kill off a good amount of us and then pur the rest to work in ways they want that robots or AI can&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m glad at least ONE person actually read the damn post before attack.  LOL.  The whole post is about why women feel it is more fulfilling and worthwhile to pursue a career over family.  I&#39;m not saying that it is or isn&#39;t, or that women shouldn&#39;t be able to choose.  They certainly should choose.</p>

<p>But why is having and raising children looked as a lesser accomplishment than say, becoming a CEO at a fortune 500 company?  From the point of view of survival of the human race, raising kids should be a top priority for all of us.  It is not, thanks to the brainwashing that has been taking place for the past 100 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  Let&#39;s look over your comments.  Yes, I said &quot;roles that nature chose&quot;.  so, let&#39;s consider the rest of you observations.</p>

<p>&quot;It’s clear you think a women’s place is at home making baby’s and cooking dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>When did I say that?  When did I imply that?  When did I say women should do this or that?  This is the problem with the left.  Instead of understanding what I&#39;m saying, they just attack.  I have no problem with women choosing to work.  Are you stupid?  I want women to &quot;choose&quot; without being brainwashed.  I want them to see that, &quot;hey, you know, having babies and raising kids isn&#39;t that bad....&quot;</p>

<p>Get back to the 1950&#39;s?  Are you real?  You are the one living in 1950.  Do you even know how much in control women have today?  Do you even know just what kind of role women play in today&#39;s society?    And the funny part is, so what?  So, who cares?  lol.  you&#39;re a fucking joke who makes no sense.  </p>
