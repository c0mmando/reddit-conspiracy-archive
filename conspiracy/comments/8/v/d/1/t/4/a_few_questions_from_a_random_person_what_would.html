       Hello, I just came up with this question a little bit ago since I was wondering if anyone had a good answer.  That questions has several follow ups that are optional to include in your answer, state which answers you are responding to below.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         What would it take for you to believe someone (or some coperarion or organization) was being honest with you and not playing in to a conspiracy? 
1.5. (Follow up) does this belief in some one change with what groups they are apart of? (Ex. Liberal, Republican, feminist etc.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you think that the large amount of people in on a conspiracy makes it less likely to be true?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you think that you are apart of any conspericys? (Involuntary does count.)
3.5 (Follow up) if so, which ones do you feel effect you The most?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does having people say there is no conspiracy or retracting their belief that at conspericy is true, reinforce how true you think a conspiracy is?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What type of people do you trust the least? (Bankers, government officials, presidents)
5.25 (Follow up) why don't you trust these people?
5.5 (Follow up) would having someone like these people convince you that they are being deserved or part of a conspericy?
5.75 (Follow up) would having these people agree about a conspiracy change your mind about them or the beliveable-ness of a conspericy?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What conspericys do you think are too crazy to be true?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       That's for all you answers, I understand that as a person who personally doesn't believe conspericy theories, me being on this sub Reddit is annoying to some of you but I am interested to hear your responses (and maybe I'll change my thoughts on some theories if I get good responses. )
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a wonderful day!

       1) Depends entirely on their method of communication and exactly what they are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Comparmentalization allows for many thousands to be involved yet ignorant at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Yes, we are all a part of the conspiracy of society. We are all products of multilayered memetic constructs dictated by society and family
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Seems irrelevant to me. Where the data leads is more important than group think.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) I distrust those who seek power over others without a justified reasoning for holding such power.

         Not necessarily. It depends on the large amount of people, and if they gain from such a conspiracy. Also, a conspiracy with more people means it's usually (but not always) harder to maintain its secrecy.

       So you made this post in response to this:

      <p>
       Yet you made no attempt to engage with the points made in that video. Did you even watch it? Why do broadcasts from the ISS include the use green screens? Why can ISS astronauts clearly be seen wearing harnesses in some shots? How can rising air bubbles exist in space?

       Look, to be honest after one of the points in the video was pointing out how they edited a stuffed animal fading in and then somehow taking that to mean " they have vr contact lenses I just stoped watching.

       It wasn't an actual stuffed toy - because they don't fade in and out of the visual spectrum in real life, do they? Why are films from the ISS using digital superimposed artefacts which the astronauts pretend to interact with? If you are not willing to have your own preconceptions challenged, you are not going to be able much to the conversation here.

       I think this message come off a a bit ironic, considering that I suggested that it was an editing trick and you shut me down, but ok let's play by your idea bit.

       Why does it matter that NASA is making films with fake stuffed animals?

       That's a pretty strange question, and I am repeating it  back to you in the hope that it might spark some introspection.

       So it doesn't trouble you that NASA's "live transmissions from the ISS" include the use of greenscreen and augmented VR? You think they have that technology set up on the ISS?

       Ok, I know what your building too, the whole "there is no ISS" so let's add this to the question.

      <p>
       So the ISS doesn't exist. Why does this matter?

       This is classic sliding, why can't you entertain an idea and discuss it instead of being hostile and repeating something silly? I feel into your trap this time on purpose to see what you are up to.

        Physical evidence that supports their stated intentions.
1.5 Credibility and physical evidence are unrelated, so no.
       </li>
       <li>
        No. The assumption that major conspiracies require large numbers of people to know the conspiracy is false. If a large number of people are involved, then still no. Organisations large and small keep secrets the same way: compartmentalization.
       </li>
       <li>
        Yes. Almost everything you have been told about the world around you is bullshit.
3.5) The matrix is real. Everything is artificial. The mainstream media exists only to propagate those lies. The origins of the current historical record and all of its spin-offs go back no further than a couple of hundred years. Beyond that, anything is possible.
4) It raises my suspicion, and makes me want to investigate further. Only evidence (or a lack of evidence when there should be plenty) changes my opinion, though.
5) I only trust people with whom I have a personal relationship, if trust was earned. I give the benefit of the doubt to friends of trusted friends. Beyond that, I don't trust anyone or anything. Why would I?
6) I'm open-minded to any theory supported by evidence, or an absence of evidence where one might expect to find some.

       You'd have to completely take away the human factor. After you've been lied to enough, it's impossible to fully trust someone. It's safer to assume you're being deceived, than blindly trusting people you've never met
