        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, I just came up with this question a little bit ago since I was wondering if anyone had a good answer.  That questions has several follow ups that are optional to include in your answer, state which answers you are responding to below.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What would it take for you to believe someone (or some coperarion or organization) was being honest with you and not playing in to a conspiracy? 
1.5. (Follow up) does this belief in some one change with what groups they are apart of? (Ex. Liberal, Republican, feminist etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think that the large amount of people in on a conspiracy makes it less likely to be true?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you think that you are apart of any conspericys? (Involuntary does count.)
3.5 (Follow up) if so, which ones do you feel effect you The most?</p></li>
<li><p>Does having people say there is no conspiracy or retracting their belief that at conspericy is true, reinforce how true you think a conspiracy is?</p></li>
<li><p>What type of people do you trust the least? (Bankers, government officials, presidents)
5.25 (Follow up) why don&#39;t you trust these people?
5.5 (Follow up) would having someone like these people convince you that they are being deserved or part of a conspericy?
5.75 (Follow up) would having these people agree about a conspiracy change your mind about them or the beliveable-ness of a conspericy? </p></li>
<li><p>What conspericys do you think are too crazy to be true?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>That&#39;s for all you answers, I understand that as a person who personally doesn&#39;t believe conspericy theories, me being on this sub Reddit is annoying to some of you but I am interested to hear your responses (and maybe I&#39;ll change my thoughts on some theories if I get good responses. )</p>

<p>Have a wonderful day!<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Depends entirely on their method of communication and exactly what they are talking about.</p>

<p>2) Comparmentalization allows for many thousands to be involved yet ignorant at the same time.</p>

<p>3) Yes, we are all a part of the conspiracy of society. We are all products of multilayered memetic constructs dictated by society and family</p>

<p>4) Seems irrelevant to me. Where the data leads is more important than group think.</p>

<p>5) I distrust those who seek power over others without a justified reasoning for holding such power.</p>

<li>Proof. Especially proof that has been reviewed by an unbiased or academic (for lack of a better term) third party</li>
</ol>

<p>1.5. Absolutely not. Identity politics are a scourge upon society.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not necessarily. It depends on the large amount of people, and if they gain from such a conspiracy. Also, a conspiracy with more people means it&#39;s usually (but not always) harder to maintain its secrecy.</p></li>
<li><p>I have no idea. 3.5. Unsure</p></li>
<li><p>No. People are allowed to change their mind, in my opinion. But again, who benefits? Even to a tiny degree, <em>qui bono</em>?</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone in military intelligence, high-up-the-ladder government officials, law enforcement, media companies.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>5.25. All usually have something to gain from hiding something</p>

<p>5.5 Not sure I understand this question [Sorry! :( ]</p>

<p>5.75 Depends on the conspiracy theory, and if the circumstances warrant suspicion of a PSYOP or not.</p>

<ol>
<li>Perosnally, Flat Earth, inter-dimensional aliens taking form of humans, Reptilian people, the theory that all history is false (embellished? absolutely. &quot;<em>I know history will be kind to me, for I intend to write it</em>&quot; - Winston Churchill. But not false)</li>

<p>Yet you made no attempt to engage with the points made in that video. Did you even watch it? Why do broadcasts from the ISS include the use green screens? Why can ISS astronauts clearly be seen wearing harnesses in some shots? How can rising air bubbles exist in space?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It wasn&#39;t an actual stuffed toy - because they don&#39;t fade in and out of the visual spectrum in real life, do they? Why are films from the ISS using digital superimposed artefacts which the astronauts pretend to interact with?

<li>Physical evidence that supports their stated intentions.
1.5 Credibility and physical evidence are unrelated, so no.</li>
<li>No. The assumption that major conspiracies require large numbers of people to know the conspiracy is false. If a large number of people are involved, then still no. Organisations large and small keep secrets the same way: compartmentalization.</li>
<li>Yes. Almost everything you have been told about the world around you is bullshit.
3.5) The matrix is real. Everything is artificial. The mainstream media exists only to propagate those lies. The origins of the current historical record and all of its spin-offs go back no further than a couple of hundred years. Beyond that, anything is possible.
4) It raises my suspicion, and makes me want to investigate further. Only evidence (or a lack of evidence when there should be plenty) changes my opinion, though.
5) I only trust people with whom I have a personal relationship, if trust was earned. I give the benefit of the doubt to friends of trusted friends. Beyond that, I don&#39;t trust anyone or anything. Why would I?
6) I&#39;m open-minded to any theory supported by evidence, or an absence of evidence where one might expect to find some.</li>
