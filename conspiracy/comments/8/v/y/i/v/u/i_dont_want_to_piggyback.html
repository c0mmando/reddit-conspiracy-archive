       This thread got me thinking earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone think it's possible they are only spending $350,000 in export costs, while obtaining pure and cheap product number 5 from stepan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Cut it down, and sell 100x what they bought worth?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's probably not easy to import much to Japan. We only get it from stepan and mexico really. Doesn't grow well worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Stepan Corporation, a New Jersey-based chemical processing company, performs the extraction on the coca leaves. Stepan has an arrangement with the Drug Enforcement Agency and is the only company allowed to legally import the coca leaf into the United States. Stepan imports 175,000 kilograms of coca leaves into the United States each year. That is a street value equivalent to roughly $21 billion of cocaine, according to the United Nations."

       Coca-Cola includes as an ingredient a coca leaf extract prepared by a Stepan Company plant in Maywood, New Jersey.[2] The facility, which had been known as the Maywood Chemical Works, was purchased by Stepan in 1959.[3] The plant is the only commercial entity in the United States authorized by the Drug Enforcement Administration to import coca leaves, which come primarily from Peru. Approximately 100 metric tons of dried coca leaf are imported each year. The cocaine-free leaves are sold to The Coca-Cola Company for use in soft drinks, while the cocaine is sold to Mallinckrodt, a pharmaceutical firm, for medicinal purposes.
      </p>

       From their Wikipedia. Yes, they do sell cocaine if that's what you meant.

       I've tried to look up how much medical grade cocaine can be made from a kilo of dried leaves and saw answers ranging from 5 grams to 500 grams per kilo of leaves..so it really depends on the plant. But I doubt that they would be growing the 5 grams per kilo of leaves plants at a medicinal grow op

       In the U.S., a kilo of stepped on cocaine (low grade) can sell for upwards of $40,000... So even at that price it would be about 7 billion dollars worth of cocaine... You cut that medical grade (99% pure) down to low grade (60-70%) and you make quite a nice profit if your the only company in the United States allowed to produce it..

       The article states a shipment to Japan. Coca doesn't really grow there. It would probably fetch quite a bit more.
      </p>
      <p>
       If shipping cost was $2mil over 6 years, that's a lot of powder.

       Yeah, I was trying to look up figures for how much weight can fit in a shipping container of powdered pure cocaine, and how much it would cost to get a fully loaded shipping container from the u.s. to Japan to see what the real numbers might be if that's the export price.. and I'm definitely not high enough at the moment to actually go deep enough into export laws and such to figure that out at the moment haha.

       I misread, sorry plc. You are correct, I'm trying to find the numbers now for exporting in shipping containers, but as one might expect, it's hard to find the export fees for a shipping container filled door to door with cocaine..

       No worries, and yea it is, lol. I tried looking up costs of importing, but didn't want to be added to a list for this "product" so just stopped, hah. I'd imagine that importing (legally) 170 kilos is going to be more in the ball park of like 35+ million, if the profit(s) is in the billions. A complete guess, but, sounds more "reasonable", imo. Could be wrong.

       Ok.. so.. a large shipping container of 40 ft length can hold 2,400 cubic ft. of product if stuffed door to door. One cubic ft. Of cocaine is 38.08lbs still trying to figure out the cost to ship said container from New Jersey to Japan.. but a standard, large shipping container can fit 91,392lbs of cocaine not including whatever wrapping/packaging it is inside of.. which is obviously a whole heck of a lot lol

       Cost to ship a 40 ft container on average after getting price quotes from a few places is $2.60 per mile, so it depends on the route that the ship takes, and how many stops it makes along the way. But it is really freaking cheap to send 91 thousand pounds of cocaine from New Jersey to Japan.

       A hell of a lot cheaper than that I would imagine, also when talking to the receptionists at a few international shipping stations on the east coast. It seems excessively easy to send large amounts of cocaine overseas, I was asking basic questions that a cocaine smuggle may ask. Are people going to look in my crate? What about customs? Customs overseas?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was told that the chances of my shipping container being checked at any point along the way was about 1 in 10..

       Happy I could help you out, if I did. Not too many people on this sub are going to go out of their way to make themselves look/sound like a Colombian drug Lord trying to ship 45 tons of cocaine to Japan.. lol..

       Not at all, it's been known for a few decades now that America mass produces medical grade cocaine in much larger amounts than could ever be used for the medical industry per year, just in producing coca cola. And coca cola was a pretty hot commodity during the Iran contra days, so if we werent producing enough cocaine back then to meet demands... Well..

       My thought is that $350,000 is the total exporting cost. I don't know, but would assume stepan would have some govt contracts regarding their product.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't imagine the govt pays much for their product, considering they are the only company allowed to deal with drug farmers in South America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which means they're funding drug farmers.

       They're not exporting it, they're importing it.

       I'm saying, it seems possible to me that, stepan imports, while the govt funds a "study" which justifies $350,000 dollars in export costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       $350,000 being the total coast this year of the study in Japan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see a breakdown of the costs of the study. Though being me, I doubt I wouldn't doubt it.

       Ah, I see. I was a little confused with what you were saying. Very interesting thought, indeed and it really would not surprise me. Thanks for posting!

       No worries! Probably my fault. Lost in the sauce.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd imagine shipping via a company would be expensive, but I guess they could have an agency that takes care of things for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you owned the company that shipped it, $350,000 would stretch pretty far.
