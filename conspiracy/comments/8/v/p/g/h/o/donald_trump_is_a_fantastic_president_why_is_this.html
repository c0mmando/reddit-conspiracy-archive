    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no persona. He is who he appears to be. We know this because he&#39;s been the same man for the nearly 40 years he&#39;s been in front of the public.

<p>Sometimes a guy who acts like an idiot just happens to be an idiot. For Trump, it&#39;s even more telling that there&#39;s a noticeable decline in his ability to speak. There&#39;s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZpMJeynBeg">interview</a> from &#39;88, on Oprah, and Trump is talking about tariffs and trade with much the same opinion of them as he has now. Except he could speak in complete thoughts then.</p>

<p>Maybe it appeals to you to think a man with Altzimer&#39;s running in his family is putting on a grand illusion and somehow faking a decline in articulateness over a period of decades without any sign of his supposed masquerade slipping, but that doesn&#39;t make it likely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>why his style of speaking is completely deliberate and effective</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is his inability to not speak like that when it matters. It may be deliberate, but it&#39;s also something he seems unable to shut off. Code switching is nothing special, people do it all the time. Except Trump can&#39;t speak like he did on Oprah in &#39;88 anymore. He speaks to Prime Ministers and Presidents with the same way of speaking he does at a rally. There&#39;s a reason why people call him &quot;fucking stupid&quot; behind his back within his own administration. And it&#39;s not because he&#39;s an articulate speaker when he wants to be.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a nice <a href="https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/122-the-qanon-code">podcast</a> that talks about your guy for those not initiated into it, and it does a pretty good job of describing it.</p>

<p>Frankly, I find it silly. I don&#39;t know about you, but if my job was to crack a global cabal of political and economic elites running underage sex rings, I wouldn&#39;t reveal my operation to a bunch of randos on 4chan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean when he went to Singapore and traded stopping military exercises with South Korea for a photo op with Kim?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason we have ambassadors and diplomatic entourages, it turns out you can&#39;t just have a private one on one conversation with every global leader and come out with a deal. Which if you can be honest about the outcome of the talks, Trump completely forgot to do.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing committing North Korea to anything, just Trump&#39;s word on what was said. Likewise he has no evidence of what North Korea expects us to do, so they&#39;re free to claim what they want. Which now both sides are doing.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one who just made up this goalpost. You&#39;ve also done absolutely nothing to validate it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#39;t just a photo op</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Kim has made real concessions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What separates a real diplomatic endeavor from a photo op is something committing both sides towards forward progress at the least. Nothing Trump said Kim conceded has any mechanism in place to make him do it, or even measure progress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess you also missed the part where the two Korea&#39;s leaders met and crossed the DMZ</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously it had nothing to do with two neighboring countries negotiating between each other to make it happen, or China pressuring its ally North Korea. This one&#39;s all on Trump.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s just pathetic at this point</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s pathetic is this need for validation from both Trump and his supporters. Everyone isn&#39;t giving him enough credit. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/us/politics/trump-north-korea-nuclear-threat-.html">Trump effectively declared the matter solved</a> after his meeting with Kim. Only to days later walk it back and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44584957">warn</a> that maybe it wasn&#39;t. It obviously isn&#39;t, but here you are still demanding credit for his half-assed job.</p>

<p>What&#39;s embarrassing is you can&#39;t see how more clever men than Trump take advantage of that need. Do you see Moon or Xi demanding Nobel Peace prizes for their role in the talks? Are you seriously going to tell me that Trump did more work than either of those two men in making the talks happen? Trump couldn&#39;t even be bothered to prepare for the meeting. He declared it unnecessary.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re talking about blinders. What a joke.</p>

<p>JFKs dad was a politician. His grandpa was a politician. The kennedy family dates back to the 1800s in politics. And everything I told you about his platform is correct. Jesus man, I thought you enjoyed researching things outside of just vampires. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of politicians have been in extramarital affairs and been born of money (though I dont think JFK ever bragged about grabbing anyone scot free due to his stature). JFK wanted to push back against the Dulles-era deep state, and while Trump has spoken out against some entrenched agencies and agendas, it&#39;s only been cause they&#39;re investigating him. He&#39;s pals with Kissinger and surrounded by Council for National Policy people, John Bolton, Erik Prince. Look at the actual policies and positions he&#39;s taken. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear that Trump wants you to compare him to JFK, seems that&#39;s what the Q thing aims to achieve as well. I&#39;m not falling for it when so much neocon shit keeps bubbling up. Not to mention the unnecessary chaos and trauma of this family separation policy-- would you see JFK initiating such a thing? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kennedy was actually smart and didn’t go out of his way to tell everyone that we actually had it all wrong about the Soviet Union. His actions on the world stage were carefully thought out and implemented by seasoned professionals, he didn’t just pick up his cell phone and complain like a fucking toddler about literally everything. He also could laugh off an insult, and not have it immediately effect markets/policy because his incredibly bruised ego (due to daddy issues and not being told someone was proud of him. And I mean, like, Fuck, if I were Fred trump I wouldn’t have said that either.) </p>

<p>They’d be the same if Kennedy weren’t better in every way</p>

<p>Trump is an idiot child. There’s no chess. He’s throwing his toys out of the stroller cause he’s a whiny Fuck that doesn’t understand anything, nor will he grow to because he has surrounded himself with yes men. Just stop making excuses for him. And don’t you tarnish JFK’s reputation by placing it in the same comment as the current shitstain at 1600 penn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo your last point is magnificent.  Mainly because the Russians did try to get Kennedy elected.  They thought he would be a pushover in some circles and like FDR in others.  When Khrushchev met Kennedy for the first time, he essentially made it known to Kennedy that the USSR is why he won.  Kennedy&#39;s campaign was not a part of the plan and Kennedy had no knowledge.  It was after this meeting that Kennedy started thinking more strategically with Russia and it is why he took no shit from Khrushchev during the CMC. </p>

<p>My hunch is that Trump was kind of a useful idiot, but I also think that there is an element of information being withheld from him by his inner circle.  I think that some--like Manafort--had no major love or respect for the guy but that others--like Manafort&#39;s old friend Roger Stone--really love Trump and would prefer to shield him from legal trouble if possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo your last point is magnificent.  Mainly because the Russians did try to get Kennedy elected.  They thought he would be a pushover in some circles and like FDR in others.  When Khrushchev met Kennedy for the first time, he essentially made it known to Kennedy that the USSR is why he won.  Kennedy&#39;s campaign was not a part of the plan and Kennedy had no knowledge.  It was after this meeting that Kennedy started thinking more strategically with Russia and it is why he took no shit from Khrushchev during the CMC. </p>
