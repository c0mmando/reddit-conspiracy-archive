        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I speak of &#39;power&#39; here, I&#39;m referring to the ability of an individual or collective to exert their will on their surroundings. This power may be expressed politically, economically, culturally, spiritually, or otherwise. </p>

<p>Power as such exists in our species currently, yet it is fractured and contentious. We produce more information than ever in the history of our species, and yet, much of our effort goes towards thwarting the efforts of others. We justify this by saying the others (the Criminal, the Foreigner, generic Other) cannot be allowed to succeed, and thus we must fight them. This is how we are kept divided, corralled like cattle into our separate pens. </p>

<p>This all serves as the backdrop to what&#39;s going on behind the scenes. For the first time in at least the last 12,000 years, and possibly the first time ever, humanity is reaching the point of having the power to be a truly planetary species with a planetary consciousness. Assuming we don&#39;t exterminate ourselves or virtually destroy our civilization in the next 15-30 years, humanity reaching a planetary consciousness is inevitable. The internet is a form of it, but only the beginning, and only the physical manifestation of a deeper reality. </p>

<p>Certain groups understand this, and have understood this for millennia. They have been cultivating and directing humanity to amass this power. Some plan to use this power to enslave humanity, and some to liberate it. Yet these powers are one in the same, and both groups need it. This power, to enslave or to free, is the prize of the Great Game, whose moves have been played by hidden (<em>occulted</em>) forces since time immemorial. </p>

<p>Whoever wields this power when it has come to form will determine that fate of humanity, and I believe that time is coming soon. The path to the liberation of humanity requires a trust and a faith in each other, and a maturity which I feel our species lacks in many key regards. We cannot even be civil with our neighbors and our friends, let alone people across the world. </p>

<p>The path to enslavement requires only sufficient technology and unopposed will to use that power. That technology is nearly here if it hasn&#39;t been for years anyway, the will to use it certainly exists, and we as a species are too busy squabbling over crumbs to oppose it in any meaningful way. </p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>By creating this technology to enslave us, however, those who would seek to use it against us are playing a gambit. This technology also allows us to come together in ways we never could, to learn and grow as people and as shipmates on Spaceship Earth. The technology to enslave us gives us the power to free ourselves as well. Those who created the technology knew this; they&#39;re banking on us not finding out, not learning to trust each other. So far I&#39;d say that&#39;s working, but I think we can turn it around. </p>

<p>The power structure certainly benefits some of those at the top more than the rest of us, but it only works because the rest of us go along with it. If the people with the $$$ order the military and the police to round up the people and they refused, those with the money wouldn&#39;t have any recourse.

<p>The difference is that TPTB&#39;s control over us is not something external to us, but something which we actively participate in and perpetuate. The government does not oppress us by force, we pay them the tribute by which they hire the men to oppress us. </p>

<p>There is a deep state, but we don&#39;t beat them by &quot;exposing&quot; them or &quot;bringing them to justice;&quot; we beat them by refusing to play their games. </p>

<p>If you do not obey tax laws you will be locked in a cage. </p>

<p>Your strategy requires a massive majority that is not listening. </p>

<p>I agree with you: tax evasion is a really poor strategy at this point in the game. It would just get us locked up and put out of any game. Running across the battle lines alone is not bravery; it&#39;s stupidity. </p>

<p>Being completely free of their game is the last step of the strategy, and certainly not the first. But just because we can&#39;t evade taxation doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t lessen our participation in the game. When we grow our own food, or buy from local farmers&#39; markets, we lessen our need for governments and financial systems. If we live in smaller houses, purchase less luxuries, and build stronger relationships in our communities, that&#39;s less money which goes to the taxation and usury that funds our collective enslavement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like what you say about the internet only being the beginning. I think a lot of the division that we see online these days is due to the inability of text to replace face-to-face communication. Human language is much more than words- there&#39;s so much importance in our gestures and tone and eye contact. When we communicate without those elements, we tend to fill in that missing information with cynicism and heuristics in a way that highlights our differences and makes us forget our common humanity. And of course many take advantage of this habit and thrive off division. But as you say we can turn it around- I don&#39;t know what that step would look like, that unites us and not just connects us, but it may be much closer than the current gloomy outlook would have us believe. </p>

<p>This is something I know, but it&#39;s easy to forget so thank you for articulating it. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>And it&#39;s almost impossible not to use heuristics and cynicism online. We need heuristics. Because we cannot possibly have detailed knowledge about each person we speak with online, yet we must quickly decide how to respond, we must use shortcuts and make assumptions about other users which we cannot know. And we&#39;d be naive not to be cynical, though I might say skeptical, about the people we see online because we know that users are not always, or even usually, what they appear to be. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think part of our problem, or at least part of my own problem, is trying to arrive intellectually at an answer to that question, when we all know it intuitively. There&#39;s not any <em>one thing</em> — one ideology, one religion, government — because these are all intellectual things. They are concepts and not realities. </p>

<p>If I ask my heart and not my head for the answer, it knows instantly that the answer is extending love and compassion to everyone. That&#39;s the end state we all want to be in, and all thrive in. If all of us, or even enough of us, are truly living with the aim to extend love and kindness to those around us, we can make it through anything, even those people who would seek to control and exploit us. </p>

<p>The answer is to take one step forward. One step forward to a loved one or a stranger to offer a helping hand or a kind word and a smile. One step forward to do something for someone else other than yourself. One step forward into the spirit of the gift. We don&#39;t get through this in one giant leap, by one deus ex machina or in one singular moment of collective awakening; we get through this by dozens then hundreds then thousands then millions and then billions of us each taking one step forward at a time. Together. Trillions of steps forward, taken by brave individuals like you and me, each taking a step forward together for each other. For

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-globalists don&#39;t give a damn about harmony or &#39;togetherness&#39;. Smacks too much of kum-ba-ya socialism /communism / NWO. They want cultural homogeny, not international integration...religious and even racial segregation...zero immigration / strict border controls...bilateral trade deals instead of global free trade, etc. The current resurgent resistance to any kind of global order is strong evidence that most folks just can&#39;t bring themselves to trust &#39;the others&#39;...no desire to cooperate in &#39;good faith&#39; because paranoia that &#39;the others&#39; want to dominate and even exterminate them. Unfortunately, humans haven&#39;t had near enough time to evolve to think globally. We&#39;re just now only emerging from millenia of extreme cultural isolation, and the ever-growing global population (net 83 million per year) is stoking a helluva problematic feedback loop. </p>

<p>In whichever case, as FEAR and SUSPICION are so much easier to propagate and stoke than TRUST and COOPERATION, then the odds of WWIII happening before any global harmony are about 1,000,000 : 1. Hate to say it, but shit is about to explode into a conflagration that will likely consume us all. And those who think they can ride it out in a bunker are merely prolonging their deaths, because the world into which they re-emerge will be completely uninhabitable.</p>

<p>That said, have a nice day, and enjoy it while the getting is still good.         </p>
