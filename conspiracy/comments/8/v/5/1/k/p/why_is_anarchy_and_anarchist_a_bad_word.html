    <div class="md"><p>The point is organization wins out over disorganization. The better organized side will come out ahead in almost all conflicts. Having some form of permanent government is more stable than having none. If you want to know what anarchy would really play out like look at the African nations wrecked by warlords. You can&#39;t just hope that the power vacuum created will be observed by everyone when so many people lust for power. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to put words into your mouth but from my other observances of anarchist arguments they seem to criticize the idea of government and focus on the negatives that abolishing it would fix while not considering the ease with which a completely decentralized structure is compromised. </p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of legit criticisms of any form of government or rulers. Considering the absolute worst aspect and biggest danger of any government is it being completely controlled by a power hungry ruler or ruling class how can the answer possibly be to create an environment where there exists no standing, organized continuum intended to safeguard against such people? </p>

<p>Structure always wins. You have no sufficient safeguards against someone forming a structured group and taking over. This is why the better governments at least have checks on permanent power grabs and even those are often compromised. They at least prevent a full, outright takeover. </p>

<p>Human nature is a constant struggle for power, like a body of water constantly seeking to fill out the space it has been given. A good government functions as a levee, attempting to contain the water&#39;s continual push for expansion and channeling it into the least destructive path. Sometimes the levee breaks but without a levee you&#39;re essentially just asking mother nature to play nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anarchy can nothing more than a temporary state.  A transitional period from one order to the next.  It cannot exist as a permanent state.  Order will be imposed for better or worse because humans depend on some sort of order to survive.  A state of anarchy a chaotic mess consisting of individuals doing whatever it is they please to whoever they feel like.  Order will soon spring from anarchy as people will inevitably organize themselves to improve their share of basic resources (food, mating rights, security, etc) .  Nothing good comes of anarchy much like communism.  The strong will inevitably subjugate the weak.  It&#39;s simply human nature.  Deny it at your peril.</p>

<p>Many, many years ago I too was convinced that anarchy was the perfect system.  I have the tattoo to prove it.  As I grew older and wiser I realized that there is no perfect system due to the very nature of man. I kept the tattoo because it reminds me of not only how naive I was back then but also how falsely I assumed that most people were kind and caring like me.</p>

<p>Probably not what you wanted to hear and the anarchist larpers will probably get their panties in a bunch and try to defend it.  I don&#39;t care.  The first thing I would do should a state of anarchy ever happen where I am would be to gather as many arms and manpower and leverage that in order to control as many resources as I possibly can.  Why?  Because i understand that if don&#39;t  that I know goddamn well that someone else will.  That is why anarchy can only ever exist as a temporary transitional period between systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best answer. Order out of chaos is a principle of reality, just as order tends to deteriorate through entropy. We wouldnt have rules and societies if man&#39;s natural inclination wasn&#39;t towards order...the average person doesnt think for themself, they are not capable of an every man for himself situation...in a mad max world, only the strong would lead, and we would be more oppressed than we are now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The movements have been villianized over the years, much more so recently, because these ideas are very dangers to the fat cats sitting at the top of the food chain. </p>

<p>Believe it or not, people are rapidly making up and move further away from the rather archaic 2-party paradigm. This creates openings for new concepts and systems.</p>

<p>We are probably fucked for other reasons greater than the collapse of our political system, but it&#39;s nice to see these conversations happening. </p>

<p>This is not an anti-government subreddit, but we are against <em>bad</em> government. Anarchists are welcome of course, but it&#39;s a fallacy to think that conspiracy theorists would never support a particular politician just because they are part of the government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because of the view of Anarchy and traditional Anarchists.</p>

<p>The View: Anarchists are seen as fringe beings who do not believe in societies goals and do not want to pay into a system that seems flawed and corrupt and want to take down the system through violent means.</p>

<p>Traditional Anarchists have though violent means attempted to take down societies institutions through violence and terror. </p>

<p>This portrayal of Anarchists are why they are railed against. </p>
