        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am holding thinking like &quot;I shouldn&#39;t regard something as true if I can&#39;t prove it myself&quot;.... so for example &quot; the earth is round&quot; or &quot;you should vaccinate your children&quot; are statements I deeply struggle with.</p>

<p>I am not saying I disagree with those statements about the earth and vaccines, only saying that I struggle with the fact that I just simply do not know definitely myself. So how can I assert them?</p>

<p>I&#39;m worried maybe my perception of reality has been skewed by the extremism of internet expression. As I&#39;ve isolated a lot in the last few years and reddit has been almost my only window to the world. Aside from going to work and the most minimal of social interactions necessary to survive another day. I have realized I am to the point that I almost don&#39;t speak at all. </p>

<p>I suspect some degrees of my experience could resonate with redditors who frequent this sub-- so I am asking if you have any advice on the topic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything sort of is a conspiracy though. People act out of self interest always...in every situation, someone will find a way to further their own goals, be it through cherry picking facts, outright lying, or instigating it from the get go. Human nature is a bitch when applied to the huge scale of our current populations relative to the small number of elite that govern said populations. Someone always gets screwed, and its usually not them.</p>

<p>Skepticak of vaccines? Go look at the ingredients and research each ingredient and how it affects the human body.</p>

<p>As for depression there is much out there thatbhas nothing to do with conspiracies. Look up a channel called people are awesome. It&#39;s a channel of people doing amazing physical feats. It&#39;s astounding and reminds you of what we are capable off.</p>

<p>Politics, conspiracies, and all the rest is just one littlenpart of life. Just like this is simply an internet forum to share information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re walking up to some of the deeper truths of our reality. Don&#39;t be scared of it, you need to embrace it and not run.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about being woke or anything like that. I&#39;m talking about awakening at the deeper level of consciousness.</p>

<p>Instead of asking &quot;what is true&quot; you need to shift your perspective/paradigm to ask...&quot;does it really matter if it&#39;s not true&quot;. Believe me, it&#39;s not an easy thing to do. When you do make that shift a whole world of possibilities opens up to you.</p>

<p>I think all the stuff that you have encountered on the internet has actually awakened thought and curiosity in your mind and brought up doubt in the fabric of social institutions(which is a good thing imo).</p>

<p>In your case the clarity and truth will reveal itself to you inwardly. I&#39;ve just recently come to the conclusion that if every conspiracy is true or not true what does it really matter to an individual? If they realize that the universe and ultimate contentment lies within one&#39;s self then there is nothing that can take that from said person.</p>

<p>Keep learning and searching out those ancient principles of the mind and self. Manley P Hall is a great place to start.</p>

<p>Best of luck on the first step of your journey...your not the first to walk it and won&#39;t be the last.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skepticism is good, but it can slide into cynicism. One good corrective is to always remind yourself that humans are flawed and change their minds, so conspiracies are hard to maintain. The bigger the group, and the bigger the falsehood they are trying to project, the less likely it is to last (if it exists in the first place). People change their minds, have disagreements, angry divorces, they have deathbed conversions or confessions, they die and leave their papers. There are an infinite number of ways for conspiracies to get revealed. The fact that giant conspiracies are so rarely revealed shows how rare they are. So there&#39;s no point in worrying about most of them.</p>

<p>Focus on yourself and ignore the world if you can. Find your center? If we as individuals aren&#39;t healthy, we should not be worried about all this shit anyway. Not yet. </p>

<p>Not to say it&#39;s wrong to care about the world. It&#39;s just important to take care of yourself first. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s difficult because learning becomes addictive when you feel like you’re achieving something. (Figuring out life) 
I’ve started only looking into to conspiracies/deep thinking at the end of a good day. Going into it with a positive mindset makes a huge difference. Try to avoid it when you’re already feeling a bit down. </p>

<p>I struggle with feeling like I have to ‘act’ out my normal life. I’m not overly confident so having to change the way I act around other people which is the opposite of how I feel inside is difficult. Daily tasks become a struggle, watching tv for example. I haven’t watched it at home in months/years, but at a friends etc, I am shocked at what is on there nowadays! I can’t help but feel like we’re all being brainwashed. Society is not heading in the way I imagined it would. There’s an awful lot of change going on in the world right now - you are NOT ALONE in this thinking! Scepticism and paranoia is everywhere, but balance it out with logic and relevance. Do you need to worry about it? Do you want to? You have a choice. </p>

<p>The options are - accept the brainwashing and be happy, or fight it, achieve things and risk being a bit sad. (As others tend to say on here - canine companions make a huge difference. Give yourself some more responsibilities and something to live for.)</p>

<p>Good luck, it gets easier. I find it helps to talk to people about it too. If you have anyone who you can talk to about this in real life (sharing ideas of conspiracies etc), it can help you to feel a bit more normal but continue your research. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>How are your eating and sleeping habits lately? Making sure your body is fueled up and rested will do wonders for your stress levels.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re close with your family maybe spend some more time with them.</p></li>
<li><p>You mentioned that you haven&#39;t been very social lately, but maybe now is your chance to reach out to your friends and hang out for a few hours.</p></li>
<li><p>When was the last time you went for a walk around your neighborhood or to a park? A little fresh air and exercise might give you a chance to focus your thoughts without all of the other distractions.</p></li>

<p>This stuff will all still be here for you when you&#39;re ready to dive in again with a fresh focus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen. I have a very analytic and cynical mind. And I can honestly admit that while visiting this sub, my paranoia and random depressive slumped have become a little more exaggerated. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to suggest a stranger what to do to feel better sometimes, but I find putting down the phone helps. Disconnect from technology (the Internet, this sub) just take a little time away. Find someone to talk with and laugh with. It helps A lot. Someone suggested rescuing a puppy, I&#39;ve heard that helps. But really anything or anyone you can share yourself with. Shit, talk to me if you have nobody. </p>

<p>It&#39;ll help you realize that, in the end, it doesn&#39;t matter if the earth is flat. It&#39;s all about the life you live here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re showing a level of independent thought that very few seem to have in the developed world. I concur with one of the top posters here. &quot;What does it matter&quot; if the things you read are true or not. If the earth is round or not, it affects you or us very little. That is a futile argument to be involving yourself in, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>In all likelihood, we will never find out the truth in these situations... or we may already know and just not accepted it yet. If you really want to change it, unplug yourself from the most extreme situations. Find yourself a hobby or two. Go outside. Get reading and nurture this thirst for truth with books. Help other people. </p>

<p>The best thing when it gets too much is distractions. Good luck to you. Don&#39;t be afraid to reach out!</p>

<p>Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target&#39;s belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t fill your days with this subreddit’s content. It’s too much to take in, especially a bunch of YouTube videos talking about every single thing in the rabbit hole. I’ve been in your shoes not too long ago, you gotta just accept you can’t do anything about these problems and focus on yourself, getting a job, a new job, being excited for life again. You just got to accept that you can’t do it alone and that no one today is ready to fight the fight along side you until they find their peace too, and the support from the people that have  accomplished big things in their lives, enough to make a difference. i.e. becoming wealthy and and having money in order to fix these problems of the world. You also gotta really believe that you’re good through all of this, that it’s meant to happen, try and find Jesus or the Bible or something that can uplift your spirits. This world runs on good or bad energy and you have a choice which one you can run on. Good luck fellow wokeman</p>

My reasoning was that if the entire msm was against him, he had to be the best possible choice as president.

    <div class="md"><p>You are not wrong to be skeptical when pieces of truth keep making their way into our radar and keep fitting like puzzle pieces into an ugly picture.  All the points of reference have been moved. The systems that  protect us are disabled. It seems insurmountable. But there is good news. We can defend ourselves from deception because <em>we now know</em>, there are many, many lies from ppl that appear to be respectable.  We can make better choices within our realm of influence bec we have seen the hidden predatory agenda behind “good causes”.  We can support the truth and expose the lies and move incrementally toward awareness on a community level. I read recently it takes 25% of a group to start a tipping point. We can pick our battles bec we know what agendas are the most destructive.  Knowledge is power and we have some unprecedented amounts of disclosure on a global level.  Hidden agendas and deception <em>are</em> in the open thanks to Wikileaks and other collaborating sources. </p>

<p>I guess we need to figure out the new points of reference and options.  </p>

<p>We are not the first who are oppressed in history or the most abused of our day.  We can be thankful we are but witnesses of great atrocities and seek to help our suffering brothers/sisters.  </p>

<p>We can’t forget God and His eventual triumph over all evil.  He has the words of eternal life, which tames this chaos into a temporal, contained season that will pass. We must seek His help, strength and deliverance from obviously demonic sources.  Our prayers release His power and grace in this world; they are weapons against evil that we can use at will —as is faith and love.  I guess this is a different kind of battle, and realizing that is also powerful knowledge. </p>

<p>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>
