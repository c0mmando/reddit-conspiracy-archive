       It seems that the social culture of America has become so split that anyone who disagrees with the mainstream narrative is a bad person. Supporting gun ownership because it's about being able to defend yourself from a tyrannical government is wrong because you support mass shootings. Believing that socialism as requested by the liberal left is not a means to a productive society means that I'm a rich bigot who doesn't want to share. Supporting legal immigration laws means that I'm cold hearted, hate children, and want to separate them from their families. I can express myself however I want but if I don't want tax payer funded abortions, kids choosing to alter their genes to fit a gender identity, or a regression from trying to right every historical wrong ever done than that makes me a bad person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Healthy conversations, debates, and dialogue are out of the window. Now it's just yell and protest until the loudest voice gets what they want. Certain things cannot be quantified as right or wrong. Liberty is being able to do whatever you want while allowing that same privilege to others. Let gay people pay to get a marriage license, let people pay money to get a license to register a tank, stop the oligarchy of media and pharmaceuticals, create sustainable legal immigration policies to generate a work force, and a host of other things that should expand liberty in a controlled way. This and giving law enforcement the ability to enforce the laws on those that refuse to allow people these liberties or don't follow the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm open having conversations with others so feel free to give me your thoughts and try to change my mind.

       I've been attacked because I'm a gun owning person on the Left. Don't fall for the propaganda. The Real Left aren't your enemies. We're all fighting for a better future against the Corporatist Neocon/Neolibs who have captured the controlling apparatus of the Republic.

       You're exactly right but unfortunately where I live (the pacific northwest) is full of the puffed up, social justice warriors, and if you don't agree with me you're fascist. I think there is a silent moderate majority but what frightens me is the divisiveness and lack of civil dialogue. At the end of the day most people are coming from a place of love and just differ on small things which is why it's so sad to see the lack of empathy towards people with different opinions.

       Pseudoliberals, they are like the 3rd wave feminists of political alignment. Utterly retarded and insane. And the world taught them to be that way. We got a lot of problems to address before this side of the spectrum can be sane and whole again.

       Right now, our acedemia and intelligentsia are contaminated with this shit that is leading to the safespace mentality, and ultimately the pseudolibs. We are seeing the fruits of a 40yr degeneration project by the Soviets play out in front of us. And i'm not talking about gay rights and shit. This was a broader effort of making everything negotiable. So, there is no right and wrong...just a bunch of conflicting radical opinions where "my way is right". Thousands of subgroups that could easily live together, but are convinced the are antithetical.

       Third wave feminism is just intersectional feminism, it's not some boogeyman version of feminism. It just means modern feminists don't ignore race, sexuality, class, etc.

       Not trying to pick a fight here, just saying they do ignore the differences between genders and how society expects them to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The forced equal opportunity situations are one of the results of such ignorance of difference, where you get some quota at a profession that must be filled up with women. In order to make room for those positions men gotta get fired only because they're men, and you can bet your bottom dollar that those women won't all get in based on merit and capability of doing the job. Some of them getting in only because the quota needs to be met.

       The truth is never "invalid," whatever that means. The only divide here is between the hasbara and those of us unwilling to accept Israel's attempts to hide its vast number of crimes.

       So you want to continue to villainize people like me, a liberal, while not wanting liberals to villainize people like you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you heard the phrase "Be the change you want to see in the world?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is going to change when both sides refuse to see each other as human beings instead of villains of the "other side".
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't have to go to places like that to see how liberals are villainized. It happens a lot on reddit in various subs, including this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one solution to all of this hyper polarization is for people of opposing views to meet each other in person, and try to as civil as possible explain their views, how they came to form their views, and as well as possible solutions that both can agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The important part is to start to see the other side as humans and have empathy for each other even if you wind up not agreeing on anything or changing minds.

       I don't see anywhere where I villanized anyone or stated that I was being villainzied. I just stated that people tend to think in arbitrary right and wrong when it's really just a opinion. Instead of attacking me why don't you attack what I said?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you support government entities being abolished just because they're enforcing laws? Because I truly do think that's ignorant but am happy to hear someone elses view.

       I apologize for not frequenting places where people are attacked for their views but I am sure they exist. That doesn't make doing the same thing with a different agenda right.

       I live in Portland, OR feel free to DM me and we can meet in a public place to speak. I am open to having conversations and I think my post made that clear.

       Just to be clear, I do believe in being the change, and if you were to ask those who know me they would argue that I do that on a daily basis.

       I don't see how my quote villainizes anything. How does saying that people's statements speak for themselves make them a villain?
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you comment that "you want to continue to villainize people like me, a liberal, while not wanting liberals to villainize people like you?" you're doing exactly what you claim is being done to you and calling it good. I did not villainize liberals and you may say you did not villainize me but I believe that quote is an assertions of villainization. You may disagree and you are perfectly welcome to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel it is very apparent that my opinion is in the minority and I am well aware of that. This is why I am trying to create dialogue to understand where other people are coming from. That being said I've seen very few people willing to engage in serious conversations with those they disagree with without having it turn into negativity, victimization, or a personal attack.

      <p>
       Calling liberals ignorant and that they only care about what facebook tells them to is a way of villainizing them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So when you comment that "you want to continue to villainize people like me, a liberal, while not wanting liberals to villainize people like you?" you're doing exactly what you claim is being done to you and calling it good.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, I'm not calling anything good nor am I attacking you or villainizing you. From my perspective and how I perceived your comment, it looked like you were trying to villainize liberals while not liking it when liberals villainize others. This is not an attempt at villainizing you. I was pointing out a contradiction in the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was not your intention to villainize liberals, then I can understand that, but you also have to understand how others like me can misunderstand you when you say things like I've already mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I also want to have serious conversations with people I disagree with. This is not directed at you, but I just wish there was more people who want to genuinely talk and discuss these things.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So for that sake, lets drop that the previous argument and find some other topic that you would like to discuss with me in a serious genuine way. I'm open to anything.

       what if i told you that this is not a debate about " don't want tax payer funded abortions ". but a debate whether abortions are legal at all. those are two separate issues. there is no state funded abortions for anyone not on assistance, i cant speak for anyone on assistance though. that is a false narrative i hear a lot, and if people realized the difference there wouldn't be much of a fight. the only people left fighting are the ones who want it to be illegal.

       The abortion debate should be about when a fetus becomes a life. Because once that fetus becomes a person you're refusing that person the right to live by having an abortion. That's the debate that needs to be had. We charge murders for 2 lives when someone kills a pregnant women but a women can end that life and not be held responsible.

       We can argue semantics but tax funded abortions do happen, non profits provide abortions and resources with tax payer money (because they're not paying taxes), and abortion is such a polarizing topic that comes down to what you believe in. For that last reason alone I typically refuse to talk about it and let people believe whatever they want.

       that is a debate, and certain states had set certain cut off times. so from here on out, i'm assuming that you would support common sense abortion, where you aren't killing an already developed person.

       i have seen that reference. think about it deeply. what difference is there between when a women chooses to get an abortion *** before the cutoff date, and then someone who fires and injures a pregnant woman who wanted to have a baby, regardless of whether the fetus was developed or not?

        so you are saying" the church" steals from the tax payers as well for not paying property tax, yes?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       your idea of tax payed funded abortions is a non profit that raises money from outside sources to provide a service at no profit to the workers or company, to a person who could not afford to do so otherwise, theft from the government tax payers because they do not pay taxes on the money they receive?  is yes, then see point 1.

       I do not support any of those states cut off times so that's where the debate ends. Life starts at conception that is my belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       When does the child get the right to decide whether to get the chance to live or not? I really don't understand your middle paragraph response at all. I couldn't see a difference between anything you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said anyone is "stealing". But yes I am against non profits as they've become. I think there needs to be serious considerations about getting rid of the whole concept of non profits. "No profit to the workers or company" is outright disingenuous. They get PAID to work for the non profit, Planned Parenthood CEO makes over $500,000 a year. Maybe if you actually knew how to write I could articulate exactly how flawed your logic is but there is no train of thought to follow.

       because that specific non profit supports a cause he doesn't support. so he blanketed it to all non profits.  im sorry but i see this type of fallacy a lot. i really am sorry, because the logic isn't there. the passion for a better country. but the logic was replaced by emotions.

       im curious, if we are banning abortions, are we banning vasectomies too?  that's really where life begins.

       Their posts read like angsty teenager that just found out the world isn't a very friendly place. Non-profits aren't a bad thing. He seems to take issue that people are paid to work at them. Which is rather confusing.

       But I agree, he doesn't like that non-profit because of abortions, then also stated doesnt give a fuck about abortions.

      <p>
       My take on abortions is pretty much mind your own fucking business. A families decision is their decision. Not mine and i won't impose my views on them. If for whatever reason someone has to take that option, I trust they're weighing all options. It doesn't effect me, so let them deal privately.

       exactly. he doesn't like non profits that doesn't fit his moral obligations. he had no problem when i said what about the non-profit status (tax exmept) churches carry? silence, no rage.  its rare you find another account that isnt; A. an account aimed twords creating divide. no matter how much logic you throw at them, or B a straight up propaganda slinging account complete with bad english.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Calling liberals ignorant and that they only care about what facebook tells them to is a way of villainizing them.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So when you comment that "you want to continue to villainize people like me, a liberal, while not wanting liberals to villainize people like you?" you're doing exactly what you claim is being done to you and calling it good.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, I'm not calling anything good nor am I attacking you or villainizing you. From my perspective and how I perceived your comment, it looked like you were trying to villainize liberals while not liking it when liberals villainize others. This is not an attempt at villainizing you. I was pointing out a contradiction in the argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was not your intention to villainize liberals, then I can understand that, but you also have to understand how others like me can misunderstand you when you say things like I've already mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I also want to have serious conversations with people I disagree with. This is not directed at you, but I just wish there was more people who want to genuinely talk and discuss these things.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That being said I've seen very few people willing to engage in serious conversations with those they disagree with without having it turn into negativity, victimization, or a personal attack.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So for that sake, lets drop that the previous argument and find some other topic that you would like to discuss with me in a serious genuine way. I'm open to anything.

       Their posts read like angsty teenager that just found out the world isn't a very friendly place. Non-profits aren't a bad thing. He seems to take issue that people are paid to work at them. Which is rather confusing.

       But I agree, he doesn't like that non-profit because of abortions, then also stated doesnt give a fuck about abortions.

       My take on abortions is pretty much mind your own fucking business. A families decision is their decision. Not mine and i won't impose my views on them. If for whatever reason someone has to take that option, I trust they're weighing all options. It doesn't effect me, so let them deal privately.

       I don't know if you noticed but someone downvoted you in a hurry after you expressed your worry for the lack of empathy towards people with different opinions, so here, take my +1 ;)

       Its a mad world out there. The voice of reason is rarely present.
