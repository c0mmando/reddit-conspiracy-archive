        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No one claims they are 100% safe. But most &#39;mainstream&#39; sources say they are &#39;safe and effective&#39; to the point where anyone who questions that, is a crazy person. Bots then heavily downvote you on Reddit, in particular.</p>

<p>But when we go deeper concerns arise.</p>

<p>We know that thousands of cases have been proven in court, damages paid of over $3 Billion, and hundreds of thousands of cases of adverse reactions being reported (that is only in the US with about 4% of the global population)... <strong>safety</strong> seems to be extremely subjective.</p>

<p>Some data points:</p>

<p>1.Prior to the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, Vaccine Manufacturers were being successfully sued for damages caused by their products. The Pharmaceutical Lobby persuaded Congress to pass this law that grants them COMPLETE IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY. </p>

<p>2.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">After passing the NCVIA</a>, Vaccine Manufacturers began ramping up production of Vaccines. </p>

<p>3.Autism Rates have seen a steady increase clearly in relation to the increase in the vaccine schedule.</p>

<p>4.<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-152.pdf">US Supreme court has ruled that vaccines are “Unavoidably unsafe”</a></p>

<h1>Changes in vaccine schedule since NCVIA took effect</h1>

<p>As an example we will look at the DTP (Diptheria, Tetanus &amp; Pertussis) Vaccine. <a href="http://www.albionmonitor.com/free2/dpt.html">The DTP was causing the vaccine manufacturers to be sued successfully.</a> In 1978 only two suits related to DTP were filed, but by 1986, more than 250 were brought annually. In 1985, lawyers sought <a href="http://www.albionmonitor.com/9701a/mediavaccine.html">$3.16 billion in damages</a> -- 30 times more than the value of all DTP vaccine sold privately that year. Clearly there was a problem with the DTP Vaccine.</p>

<p>Instead of fixing the problem with the DTP Vaccine shielding manufacturers from liability resulted in the increased use of  DTP, and then DTaP, (acellular pertussis) plus adult TDaP vaccine from 1 dose in 1960 and 5 doses in 1983 to 7 doses by the age of 18 in 2016 – not including the “every 10 years” adult boosters and pregnancy doses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>VACCINES have NDA&#39;s.  Basically doctors are involved long enough to know if the vaccine actually caused the issue.  Specialist get involved and if a vaccine injury is proven to be the case.  There is a process. The government has set aside large funds with pharma companies for vaccine injuries.  If someone is injured as a result of a vaccine - they must go through the process to get funds for damages.  If they are rewarded $ - the victim cannot share or tell family, friends, public or press about the vaccine and injury as well as the payout.  If they do, they will have to repay all monies received and will have to go to court for violating the agreement.  Essentially they would be bankrupt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An NDA for a settlement (which is what the vaccine &quot;court&quot; process results in - an offer of settlement) is common and unremarkable.  A claimant can reject the proffered settlement and take their chances in federal court, and will not be bound by any NDA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s different and you know it.  Usually you hear the prosecution&#39;s reason for taking the defendant to court and it is know that a settlement is made.  With vaccines you don&#39;t have any of that information because it has a special court and the data of injuries could be made public and anonymous.  By having an iron ring around it... impacts our health.  The only way to convert the antivaxx movement is to be transparent.  To show the data and efforts being made to make more options available.  Also notifying people of test to identify potential underlying risks that cause vaccine injury.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re analogizing to a criminal case, which is wrong.  It&#39;s akin to a civil lawsuit (because it&#39;s <em>in lieu of suing the manufacturer for damages sounding in tort</em>), and it&#39;s totally unremarkable.  I &quot;know it&quot; because I am a litigator that routinely deals with settlements, mediation, alternative dispute resolution, and civil trials.  So whatever point you&#39;re trying to make with &quot;prosecution&#39;s reason&quot; is wrong.  </p>

<p>What you&#39;re asking for - making the data public and anonymous - is beyond what would occur should, say, Merck enter into voluntary settlements with individual vaccine injury claimants unless there are special circumstances - legislation - mandating otherwise.  But it has little/nothing to do with the wholly unremarkable NDA process.</p>

<p>Yeah, at leas when the assertion I&#39;m responding to is &quot;Autism Rates have seen a steady increase clearly in relation to the increase in the vaccine schedule.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would they need to be shielded from lawsuits then? </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="/u/MoldyPoldy">/u/MoldyPoldy</a> explained it nicely in another thread:  &quot;We do not punish drugmakers for creating medicine that has more beneficial properties than detrimental. This is why we mandate vaccines, because for everyone that they make sick, they help x many more avoid illnesses. This is also why the government immunizes vaccine-makers, because they are not medicines to save an individual, but to protect a society, and so society must bear the costs on those who are unavoidably harmed.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, we shield them from lawsuits so that they continue producing.</p>

<p>They shielded them from lawsuits because if they didn&#39;t they wouldn&#39;t be in business?  Not because you could actually take a chunk out of their profits but because taking the amount of lawsuits out the media spotlight would be the goal.  It is really not about money.  If they can take it from the public view, they can carry on as if tbey can do no harm, business as usual.</p>

<p>Not what I said. Companies like Pfizer would obviously still be in business without this protection. But they may not still be producing vaccines at the scale necessary to protect public health.</p>

Ill be keeping an eye out for the replacement.  Meanwhile, ill start as sprinkling some aluminum phosphate and mercury salts on my oreos since its safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have confused yourself, you need to refine your understanding of the term &quot;mock&quot;, and then reread some of the comments, this time more slowly.  Read this sentence aloud to yourself: &quot;You tried to mock me... and ask for a citation.&quot; Does your internal logic scale not protest at this fallacious double standard? You read something as me &quot;mocking myself mocking you&quot;... i dont know that i can pinpoint which comment you mean here, but ill venture a guess that you refer to my comment that i was &quot;annoyed with myself for engaging with this game of citation tag&quot;. This is not mocking in any way.  Its a straightforward criticism of the quality of the discussion.  You do not seem interested in providing reasoned and supported arguments nor willing to candidly consider and respond to counterpoints.  Your consistent methodology is to derail any substantive discussion and flame the tone by insulting, redirecting, antagonizing, and moving goal posts.  Therefore, i cannot blame anyone but myself for being in the middle of such an asinine scenario... i cant be &quot;mad&quot; as you fantasized i might be, because i willfully wasted my time trying to engage in forthright debate in a thread populated by someone seemingly unwilling or incapable of doing the same.

    <div class="md"><p>What are you on about m8? In that string of comments below, all I asked was for you to provide one scholarly source that says vaccines and autism have any link. The only thing you have seems to be the one article about aluminum in the brain that other people <em>in this very thread</em> have already debunked. </p>

<p>What points have you made for me to candidly respond to?</p>

<p>What citation do you need? You keep saying I think I&#39;m immune to what I&#39;m asking from you, but you have yet to ask me for a citation on anything. Are you asking me to find a scholarly source that the whistleblower fiasco is often used as an argument for anti vaxxers, but is completely misleading? There is no scholarly study on that whistleblower lol. There is, however, plenty of studies that directly contradict people trying to use the whistleblower as evidence. The article simply explains the misrepresentations and failures of the original study that caused it to give the illusion of vaccines having any link to autism. Do you understand now? There is no citation tag happening here. I am asking you for a <em>single</em> scholarly source to support your claims, that you cannot provide, and you haven&#39;t asked me for anything.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how you&#39;re confused about the comments. I literally have &#39;first&#39; and &#39;second&#39;. Read your first comment and then read your second comment. 1... 2. You start off by accusing my source of not being scholarly (when there&#39;s clearly no need for that source to be scholarly (see above)) and then the second comment you point out the own ridiculousness of your first comment with the bogus blogger journal thing. Yeesh man, you haven&#39;t said anything of value and just keep projecting on to me. Instead of providing the single source in asking for all you can do is deflect and say I&#39;m doing what you are actually doing. This is really strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say study, do you mean &quot;review of literature&quot; or... the paper on the link between Aluminium in the brain and autism is perfectly credible, peer reviewed, and accepted in the biomedical field.  Its really common sense anyway.  Mercury is no longer available in consumer thermometers, thermostats, or any other common use (except fluorescent bulbs and those are considered a toxic hazard if shattered). This is because of the long-established and acknowledged long-term neurotoxicity of mercury, particularly organomercuries such as ethylmercury (thimerasol). Aluminum is also a toxic hazard because of its hyper-reactivity and reducing properties.  Do you read the inserts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are generally skeptical of big pharma and drugs. After all side effects of drugs are well understood and written on the box. But when it comes to vaccines, common sense and logic seem to be disengaged with the general public, and they seem willing to have unlimited amounts of shots injected into them, with the belief the result can only be positive, and that side effects for vaccines don&#39;t exist. Or id they do exist, they are so rare as to not to worry about them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL:DR - non-lawyers are very misleading about NCVIA and SCOTUS opinions.  </p>

<p>Anyone using the SCOTUS &quot;unavoidably unsafe&quot; line like this has no idea what they&#39;re talking about.  SCOTUS was quoting the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and discussing whether the term &quot;unavoidable&quot; was a term of art as used in the statute.  A good rule of thumb when looking at SCOTUS opinions is to remember that the court rules very, very narrowly in 99% of circumstances.  This is one of them; don&#39;t overextrapolate.</p>

<p>Examples of &quot;unavoidably unsafe products&quot; include drugs, medical devices, guns, certain cleaning compounds, bleach, acetone, etc... All that the categorization means is that courts tend not to have strict liability for those products.  In other words, it&#39;s harder to hold manufacturers accountable for injuries stemming from those products as compared to, say, a stove.  Or folding chairs.  Or cars.  The reason is that there is inherent risk in the products, but the benefit is (as a whole) much greater to society.  Now, you may think this is wrong, but you&#39;d have to have an understanding of the history of products liability law to really get into the details of why certain products are exempt from strict products liability law (which is a relatively recent thing, in legal years, stemming from 1960s California case law and spreading quickly).  But that&#39;s a completely separate issue.  </p>

<p>And there was a risk that vaccinations would become completely uneconomical due to lawsuits and the fear of lawsuits.  The success of a lawsuit is often not about the absolute truth; there can be successful lawsuits against a variety of products regardless of the merits because we have jury trials.  Have you ever conducted product liability litigation in front of a jury of twelve uninformed people?  I have.  It&#39;s not a system I would praise for its accuracy, and I say that as someone that professionally benefits from product liability trials.  </p>

<p>NCVIA makes it easier for most claimants to make their case (no need to show causation in most instances, and no need to show defective manufacturing, labeling, or design like in other products liability cases), faster (shaving off years), and cheaper (attorneys&#39; fees covered in all but frivolous claims).  Basically, it&#39;s a form of mandatory non-binding alternative dispute resolution (like mediation or non-binding arbitration).  Many contracts, even between commercial sophisticated parties (i.e. large companies) have mandatory arbitration and/or non-judicial dispute resolution procedures, and for good reasons.  </p>

<p>Vaccine injury claimants can reject the offer and sue manufacturers in tort.  There are limits as compared to things like auto manufacturers, most significant being that there is absolute immunity for unavoidable side effects (so long as the vaccine was properly prepared and accompanied with the proper warnings and directions).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pilot Vaccinated Vs Unvaccinated study finds that vaccines are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and chronic illness.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U-S-children.php#Article">http://www.oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U-S-children.php#Article</a></p>

<p>&quot;the apparent “dose-response” relationship between vaccination status and several forms of chronic illness, and the significant association between vaccination and NDDs all support the possibility that some aspect of the current vaccination program could be contributing to risks of childhood morbidity. Vaccination also remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors, whereas preterm birth, long considered a major risk factor for NDD, was not associated with NDD after controlling for the interaction between preterm birth and vaccination. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife has a vaccine injury, went through the Vaccine court, after almost 5 years of litigation, HHS acknowledged the TDAP caused her injuries and we reached a settlement and a lifetime annuity payoff. It cracks me up when people say vaccines are safe and effective, I know several other people working in the medical field, and personal life, adults and children (staff and patients) who have suffered vaccine injuries. Lots of them never make the connection, the ones that do don&#39;t know about the national vaccine compensation program, or they find out after the 3 years cutoff has passed. Even if someone attempts to petition the vaccine court, it&#39;s estimated less than 10% of claims will ever be compensated and it can take several years for a decision. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The harsh truth:</p>

<p>The real purpose of vaccines is to damage people&#39;s immune systems on such a large scale that chronic incurable diseases become normalized. Each victim then becomes a lifelong customer of the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
