       Everything is pattern. Certainly all code and data in our current digital age consists of pattern - the famous one's and zero's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crypto of any kind must find the most unfindable patterns in the universe of patterns of sequential one's and zero's - binary numbers. That characteristic differentiates a good crypto solution, which is hard to find - or guess - from a crypto that is easy to break.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the crucial step that ties together a search for good crypto candidate patterns and a parallel search for interesting algorithms or other scientifically useful patterns?

       Solving the blockchain is using processing power in an arbitrary way.  Huge amounts of processing power to do calculations slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know the formula ahead of time and can calculate infinite coins in no time then convince people to run the code that is the AI and then, as the AI spit out coins as a random reward.

       The concept of currency requires an increase in that currency itself over time.

       As soon as you cant mine a new coin bitcoin stops existing.  Literally.

       So what?  We could use the tech to create a distributed and stable AI.  Thats my main point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mining algorithm takes tons of resources tondo very little work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Figured those resources could be doing something more than just mining.
      </p>
      <p>
       And judt because you can take the bitcoinncode, load it on a machine and watch do work doesnt mean that there are other parts of the bitcoin business, since the machines talk, that would load new code into your mining process to change it from what you loaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be easy to do.

      <p>
       That and its called crypto currency despite the fact that it is less crypto than cash.

       Yeah, and I can.  The thing is the algorithm to mine coins and what keeps the coins scarce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just calculate more digits of pie or find every prime number?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the formula actually doing to spot out a coin?
      </p>
      <p>
       It isnt the code thats hard its the math in the algorithm.  Code is just another language to describe math, sure, but you can desribe things without understanding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like this formula describes something that I dont know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the conspiracy theory.  Not that I really believe in it but its like a "it could be maybe".

       I’m a software engineer by trade. There is absolutely no AI code in bitcoin’s source. Just because you don’t understand the math behind it doesn’t make it AI. My day job is machine learning and automation in the financial sector using various AI products and in-house developed tools. There is no “could be maybe”, there’s no AI in BC. It’s just complex encryption and like it well should be for products handling financial data.

       Yeah?

      <p>
       Just because "in the source code" it doesnt exist doesnt mean the code couldnt change as soon as it starts running and connects to the global bitcoin thing.

       Besides, where and why is bitcoin enceyption?  Its just a large ledger.  No encryption necessary except for uniwue keys.  You dont need encryption to keep the keys unique, you just need an abundance of consensus.

       I was under the impression that blockchain was well understood and so transparent that you couldn't hide something like that in it. I do know there's some secrecy behind the creator/creators of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe social media is far more widespread than cryptocurrency is and would the best place for anyone to be operating things like that and I imagine that they already are.

       No, the processing power and electeicity use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin mining consumes way more electricity just for processing than anything else on earth.  More electricity is used for that than some large countries use in a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I didnt mean bitcoin specifically.  You could build an AI into the mining algorithm and distribute that algorithm globally.  Then through emergent behavior of that algorithm the AI would come alive and start handing out coins like taking a dump, or something.

       I'm really sorry dude. You just seem to know very little about the technology and AI. You're using terms like algorithm and emergent behavior but you don't really understand them. What your positing here sounds like a rejected Terminator script or a Michael Crichton screenplay.

       Well yeah, it sounds stupid.  I posted it on conspiracy.  I dont believe in conspiracies but it is a good exercise for the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do coding.  I understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crux of myargument is this:  someone created bitcoin, started up the network, owned most miners and THEN gave out the code.
      </p>
      <p>
       The core code that started it could be different.  When you start mining you connect to the network and exchange information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of that information could be designed to alter the way your miner functions, changing the code from what you see as open source to the closed source variant.
      </p>
      <p>
       That change in behavior could be the code for a distributed AI.

       I'm sorry, I just don't understand posting something that you know sounds stupid especially if you "don't believe in conspiracies" anyway.
And I'm still dubious on your blockchain and coding knowledge. You're using some of the right words but in a very rudimentary way that tells me your understanding is limited. And I'm not gonna discuss this more if you think it's stupid and don't believe it anyway. What a waste of everyone's time.

       Waste of time?  Its useful to play pretend in an effort to better understand something.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a place that tolerates crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My pretend is crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You yourself have already given me the words and concepts to educate myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have also pointed out gaps in my understanding making clear some bad assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because I say stupid things doesnt mean I am stulid or dont understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, wieldy concepts in novel or creative ways would appear rudimentaey to the person who doesnt understand the creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning that I can understand something better than you, implement it, and get good results.  Describe it to you without divulging the good results. Then have you tell me I dont understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get it?  Happens with me alot.  I have a problem to solve.  Talk it out with smart people.  Understand the concept.  Build the solution.  Describe my approach.  Get told I am wrong and it wont work.  Then show them it working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them being people who have coded more years than I have been alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just becasue you dont understand or agree doesnt mean I am wrong or that I dont understand.

       It's very possible and likely that AI will function on a blockchain of some kind, in the near future.  Bitcoin only does one calculation and that's sha 256d.  If anything, bitcoin is inadvertently cracking the security of sha 256.  Every day we get closer and closer to a collision, and that should scare you more than AI.

       Quantum computing could kill all crypto currency not by flooding the market with more coins but by accessing all crypto accounts and rendering them useless and worthless. that's independent of the fact that without electricity, crypto currency is useless as well.

       You clearly do not have any background on IT.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can think whatever you want, but sometimes you should stop and take a look in the mirror, maybe find a psicologist to help you with paranoia over things YOU CLEARLY do not understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blockchain technology has NOTHING to do with A.I. and the whole process is very well documented, opensourced to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop the paranoia. Stop believing in things you don't understand. "Free energy", "UFO", "pure A.I.".
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the concept of counciousness is probably not understood by you, so just seek for some help, stop smoking weed, exercise. That will make your mind clearer.
