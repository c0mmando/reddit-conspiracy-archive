       You're thinking of Mega Earth, which is round, but MUCH larger than we know.  Supposedly we are in one warm spot on the earth, and yes there are other warm spots you and I have never heard about.  There's also Mega Flath Earth, which is pretty much the same thing, but it's flat.
       <br/>
       I think what you're actually referring to is Admiral Byrd, who said that he saw land beyond the Artic, which people believed was actually him going into a hollow earth.
       <br/>
       So 3 different things you're thinking about.

       Personally, I believe hollow earth is the most plausible theory of the three.  Not counting Simulation Earth, which I would rank at 2nd place or 100% certainty, depending on your view on the subject.

       If Simulation Earth why aren't we all kings? Maybe there isn't enough computer capacity on the server we are living in.... or they are feeding off our negative energy like David Icke says.

       Wow, you ask some good questions.  Well, honestly, within each type of possible earth, there are subtypes, so the context changes, depending on which you choose to believe.  For instance, one simulation theory would imply that we are in fact the most insignificant things, versus kings as you put it.  We're just the necessary insignificant beings inside the simulation that make the greater simulation work.
       <br/>
       Then there's a simulation theory stating that we are actually a historical ancestral simulation that humanity in the distant future ran to see what life was like during this time, at which point we are all being observed probably each of us by probably many observers all the time, but we would be "kings" and "precious" to some degree in this scenario.  Within that subset, some believe that it could be a loop, like one era replaying over and over, or possibly, it's a simulation that is currently playing all the way through from big bang to whatever end it could be.
       <br/>
       However, personally, I feel that if something is "feeding" on us, then we are probably more in an actual physical reality, where they probably are siphoning off some psychic energy or the energy of suffering or whatever else you might think.

       Well, there's different types of hollow earth too haha!  There's one hollow earth that says that at the poles there are holes that go into the earth where there are subterranean creatures and huge caverns, like super large holes in the earth that beings live in, they survive by living close to magma and/or warm spots under the earth due to vents and such.
Then there's the hollow earth that says that the inside of the earth has its own sun right there, right in the middle of the earth.  In that case, if you think of a the earth as a basketball, then there's 2 surfaces of the earth.  One on the dimply outside of the basketball, where we live and one on the inside lip, right on the other side of the surface of the basketball, with the other sun in the middle of the basketball.  In this scenario we would have the outside sun and the inside sun, in which case, yes that inside sun would be smaller than the earth,

       Well, I just think those two are more based on "science".  Flat earth involves a lot of our current conceptions of reality to be proven untrue.  So literally just the most plausible theories.  Not that they have to be correct.

       Well, if we're talking about flat earth, and assuming it was true, then the conception of the earth being flat instead of round.  Then what is space?  Is it gravity or bouyancy?  Basic scientific principles would be proven false overnight.

       I’m not trolling (also into these postulatings) but there are flights from lax to Asia, check out flight 24 app (addicting when you’re into this stuff) I used to hear there are no flights from Australia to South Africa but turns out there are.

       What is vey interesting, is the flight paths.  A lot of times they seem odd, and definitely could help with learning the true material nature of this place

       I don’t know what shape the earth is. I don’t believe everything NASA says though. But lately I have been enjoying the Oculus Go and I love the 360 Drone footage, in VR all the videos i have watched shows no curve whatsoever. I know 360 videos are stitched together so of course it can be easily manipulated. If anyone can do VR without vomiting watch drone footage. But always do it while sober. Lesson learned.

       They don't. A good zoom lens shows objects reappearing over the horizon. A good zoom lens also shows cities miles away that should be completely buried under curvature. When things get too far away to see, it's not that they went over a curve. It's that the air density becomes too thick to see through. Just like a mirage in the desert. Things right at the horizon can become hazy or invisible at a certain distance and that distance changes depending on what kind of lens you're looking through.

       I think it's more the latter, light distortion. Just as I was saying before with a mirage. It's not the skyline itself that is a mirage, as some meteorologists would like you to believe, rather the missing bottom part of the city is a mirage that blends in with the water due to light refraction at a certain distance and angle. Water doesn't curve.

       Truth, water doesn’t curve , also , this one got me recently , if stars are at so many different distances apart and such, why don’t they appear to pass by (or supposedly as we go through them) at different speeds , like when you’re on the highway and the trees close to you are going by way faster than the mountains farther away

       I always think about what if the ocean was some sort of gateway. We still don’t even know a lot about it, there’s literally a different world underwater. What if we were under and the water was actually above us and we had to go
       <em>
        up
       </em>
       to find new societies and places? Idk, it’s something to think about

       Game of Thrones, hints at that idea, yes. I personally think the Earth is Hollow and Growing. I think this is the real reason, that we have no real photo of Earth. It's way bigger than they say, and hollow. Inside the Earth, is where our Annunaki overlords reside.
