    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re thinking of Mega Earth, which is round, but MUCH larger than we know.  Supposedly we are in one warm spot on the earth, and yes there are other warm spots you and I have never heard about.  There&#39;s also Mega Flath Earth, which is pretty much the same thing, but it&#39;s flat.<br/>
I think what you&#39;re actually referring to is Admiral Byrd, who said that he saw land beyond the Artic, which people believed was actually him going into a hollow earth.<br/>
So 3 different things you&#39;re thinking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, you ask some good questions.  Well, honestly, within each type of possible earth, there are subtypes, so the context changes, depending on which you choose to believe.  For instance, one simulation theory would imply that we are in fact the most insignificant things, versus kings as you put it.  We&#39;re just the necessary insignificant beings inside the simulation that make the greater simulation work.<br/>
Then there&#39;s a simulation theory stating that we are actually a historical ancestral simulation that humanity in the distant future ran to see what life was like during this time, at which point we are all being observed probably each of us by probably many observers all the time, but we would be &quot;kings&quot; and &quot;precious&quot; to some degree in this scenario.  Within that subset, some believe that it could be a loop, like one era replaying over and over, or possibly, it&#39;s a simulation that is currently playing all the way through from big bang to whatever end it could be.<br/>
However, personally, I feel that if something is &quot;feeding&quot; on us, then we are probably more in an actual physical reality, where they probably are siphoning off some psychic energy or the energy of suffering or whatever else you might think.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s different types of hollow earth too haha!  There&#39;s one hollow earth that says that at the poles there are holes that go into the earth where there are subterranean creatures and huge caverns, like super large holes in the earth that beings live in, they survive by living close to magma and/or warm spots under the earth due to vents and such.
Then there&#39;s the hollow earth that says that the inside of the earth has its own sun right there, right in the middle of the earth.  In that case, if you think of a the earth as a basketball, then there&#39;s 2 surfaces of the earth.  One on the dimply outside of the basketball, where we live and one on the inside lip, right on the other side of the surface of the basketball, with the other sun in the middle of the basketball.  In this scenario we would have the outside sun and the inside sun, in which case, yes that inside sun would be smaller than the earth,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t. A good zoom lens shows objects reappearing over the horizon. A good zoom lens also shows cities miles away that should be completely buried under curvature. When things get too far away to see, it&#39;s not that they went over a curve. It&#39;s that the air density becomes too thick to see through. Just like a mirage in the desert. Things right at the horizon can become hazy or invisible at a certain distance and that distance changes depending on what kind of lens you&#39;re looking through.</p>
