    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If vaccines don’t work how did they eradicate so many diseases? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea is not to get rid of vaccination programs. The idea is to make vaccines that are effective and safe.</p>

<p>I did my own research into this issue and discovered that the main problems with today&#39;s vaccines are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Adjuvants like aluminum salts.</p></li>
<li><p>Preservative compounds containing mercury in the form of thimerosal.</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-immunization schedules, where young children are given multiple vaccines combined into a single shot.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The older vaccines were based on weakened or killed pathogens. They often had to be refrigerated to maintain their effectiveness. Adjuvants and preservatives have been incorporated partly for effectiveness and partly because there&#39;s an economic incentive.</p>

<p>As soon as you introduce economic incentives into any kind of medicine, the quality suffers. Why? Because the profit motive always becomes an ever greater priority. Medicines begin to be produced in the way that makes the most money. Compromises go without being recognized (or admitted) in the name of making higher profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the case of the additives in vaccines, let me address all three you mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adjuvants like aluminum salts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it’s true that aluminum is toxic in high doses, it’s the dose that makes the toxin.  Everything is safe in sufficiently small quantities and this is a sufficiently small quantity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Preservative compounds containing mercury in the form of thimerosal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, vaccines don’t even contain that anymore.</p>

<p>Secondly, the mercury is part of a molecule which means that it no longer has the same chemical properties.  Salt contains chlorine yet it’s not toxic because being bound to sodium completely changes it’s chemical properties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Multi-immunization schedules, where young children are given multiple vaccines combined into a single shot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And calculations are done to make sure no chemical gets past the threshold of becoming toxic.</p>

<p>Last I checked economics made companies competitive and that was the single greatest motive for improving products.</p>

<p>If you started rambling on about how you are smarter than doctors I would blame that on the Dunning Kruger effect but if you think I could blame this on it you either don’t know what it is or think that I don’t know what it is.  The problem is you are getting your information from conspiracy websites which instead of actual scientists are run by moms who want something or someone to blame for their child’s autism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As another guy put it, the peer review process is brutal and being caught faking data is the kind of thing that ends careers.</p>

<p>Scientific journals aren’t just a collection of opinions by guys with lab coats, and they aren’t like some blog that publishes anything they are sent.</p>

<p>Anti-vaccers, climate change deniers, young Earth creationists, flat earthers, homeopaths, UFOlogists, psychics, ... they all have one problem in common: no scientific papers support their view.  They all claim that it’s a conspiracy to keep them quiet but the truth is peer review is too brutal and thorough to let bullshit like that slip through.  What do they do instead?  They fall back on ways of getting their message out there which cannot be foiled by silly things like fact checking, and they depend on reaching people who don’t know any better.</p>

<p>That is why the anti-vaccine movement targets mothers of autistic children, not any kind of scientific institution.  They don’t try to write scientific papers, they organize protests as if that would change reality.</p>

<p>You seem to think that although science is so robust that it’s conclusions are used to build computers and put men on the Moon, it suddenly fails when dealing with vaccines.  Like, scientists can measure the local relativistic effects caused by black holes colliding in another galaxy (the LIGO experiment) yet when it comes to counting polio antibodies and seeing if vaccines make a difference they suddenly can’t tell the difference between zero and a fuck ton.  Is that what you’re trying to tell me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your sense of reasoning is out of whack. Modern physics is pretty great. Part of the reason for that is a lack of money acting as a corrupting influence.</p>

<p>Modern health care and medicine is big business. Power corrupts right? Money represents power, therefore it is a corrupting influence.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m suggesting is that money should be removed from the equation. Keep on vaccinating people. But form an institution to develop, produce and distribute vaccines for what it costs to do so. Take the corrupting profit incentive out of the equation.</p>

<p>Now you will see rational immunization schedules. You&#39;ll have vaccines made without chemical preservatives and weird adjuvants. You won&#39;t have to worry about some greedy fucker making your kids vaccine in the way that makes  more money for the shareholders.  </p>

<p>Instead I guess there will be vaccines which go bad incredibly quickly limiting the number of people they can get to, and vaccines that are ineffective because they can’t trigger an immune response.  Much better, right?</p>

<p>“Chemical preservatives”.  You do know that everything made of baryonic matter is considered a chemical, right?  I guess instead they can use dark matter as a preservative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, but I still think there&#39;s a problem with vaccines. In plain English, we&#39;re overdoing it.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there weren&#39;t any vaccines. It sucked because people died from a variety of diseases for which there was no known treatment. </p>

<p>Then the principle of vaccination was discovered and vaccines started saving lives. And what diseases were the first vaccines aimed at? The really serious ones, right?</p>

<p>The first vaccines were for diseases like: smallpox, rabies, tetanus, typhoid fever and bubonic plague. Notice the common factor here? All serious diseases that either kill or scar for life.</p>

<p>So think of the push to develop and implement vaccines as a kind of pendulum. It begins to swing from no treatment at all, towards beneficial treatment for serious illnesses.</p>

<p>But at the other end of the swing, you&#39;ve got vaccinations for every disease. Including the ones that aren&#39;t such a big deal. But your pendulum swing has momentum. People have a favorable impression of the practice precisely because vaccination has such a successful track record. And then things start to go too far.</p>

<p>You start making and selling vaccines for diseases that don&#39;t kill, that generally represent more of an inconvenience than anything else. You get to the point where the drawbacks and potential risks of the vaccines themselves are worse (for some individuals) than the disease they immunize against.</p>

<p>So I question the need for vaccinating kids against measles, mumps, chicken pox, rotavirus and HPV. I&#39;m not saying these are bad vaccines. But I am still saying they could be better and I am absolutely convinced there&#39;s a profit motive behind the push for vaccinating against every little thing.</p>

<p>You&#39;re problem is that you&#39;ve been influenced by group psychology. You share your opinions about vaccines with a numerical majority. This gives you the false impression that being part of the majority = being absolutely right. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to explain some dissenting viewpoints and ask some reasonable questions about vaccination. Bu my guess is that you will reject everything on an emotional basis... because being part of a majority and having that sense of superiority is so comforting and so attractive it&#39;s almost impossible to break free.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a vaccine timeline if you don&#39;t believe me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spent most of my life as a conspiracy theorist, and I’ve changed my opinion so many times that I have stopped strutting my own intuition.  If I were still influenced by group psychology than I would still belong to the religion I was born into.</p>

<p>The main thing I’m arguing is that vaccines aren’t a bad thing, because a popular opinion among anti-vaccers is that all vaccines are evil autism causing poison.  If you don’t believe that then we disagree on less than I thought.</p>

<p>There is certainly a debate to be had on weather an inconvenient disease or a vaccine is worse, but bad reactions to vaccines are incredibly rare and are usually just an inconvenience with no permanent effects or risk of death.  Really it’s choice between a low risk of inconvenience or a high risk of inconvenience which is worth while.  There certainly is a place to draw the line though such as the common cold, there are so many strains with mild enough symptoms that vaccinating all of them would probably represent an increase in risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess would be that the effect is jack shit, except for premature babies that are better equipped to fight disease.</p>

<p>You assume without evidence that the dose given to full term babies is on the edge of what’s safe for their body weight, but the concentrations of potentially harmful chemicals in vaccines is well below the safety limit leaving plenty of room for body mass differences.</p>

<p>It sounds like you think that the vaccine dose was calculated by taking an average baby’s weight, finding exactly how much vaccine would kill them, and subtracting a little bit from that.  No, it was calculated based on how many diseases are the most important for them to be protected against at that time in their development and as it turns out that lands so far below the safe limit that precise body mass calculations are not even necessary.</p>

There are over 7 billion people on Earth and some of them have had bad things happen to them right after they got vaccinated, this is fully expected given enough people.  What would be good evidence is a statistical study which looks at data from an unbiased sample and studies like that consistently show that vaccines have no correlation with death or autism.

<p>&quot;the apparent “dose-response” relationship between vaccination status and several forms of chronic illness, and the significant association between vaccination and NDDs all support the possibility that some aspect of the current vaccination program could be contributing to risks of childhood morbidity. Vaccination also remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors, whereas preterm birth, long considered a major risk factor for NDD, was not associated with NDD after controlling for the interaction between preterm birth and vaccination. &quot;</p>

<p>A further potential limitation is under-ascertainment of disease in unvaccinated children. Could the unvaccinated have artificially reduced rates of illness because they are seen less often by physicians and would therefore have been less likely to be diagnosed with a disease? The vaccinated were indeed more likely to have seen a doctor for a routine checkup in the past 12 months (57.5% vs. 37.1%, p &lt; 0.001; OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.7, 3.1).

<p>They mention this as a possible limitation in the paper, but just brush over it.  Correlation doesn’t imply causation.  There is also an unsubstantiated claim that the increase in autism diagnosis cannot fully be attributed to an increase in awareness.</p>

<p>Okay, so the virus behind polio has not just been isolated but it is one of the most well understood RNA based virus out there.</p>

<p>At best the DDT explanation accounts for one recorded Polio outbreak, but the vaccine has reduced Polio to infecting no more than a few hundred people a year.

<p>How can you, as a layperson, distinguish between Disease A vs Disease B when the symptoms are nearly (or completely) identical?

<p>I wonder at what point in medical school the students are told “Vaccines don’t actually work and instead we put autism causing poison in them as a prank.  Sure, we could put something harmless in there instead but what’s the fun in that?  Anyway, every time a new vaccine is released you will have to change the way you diagnose the disease it targets.  Unless you are in a region with a lot of anti-vaccers though, in which case you still need to fake a breakout every now and again.  Don’t tell anyone, although with our perfect track record of nobody spilling the beans yet I’m sure I don’t have to worry.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question is <em>not</em> do vaccines work, but <em>how well</em> do they work?  Informed consent glosses over details like:  some vaccines make the injected person contagious, it depresses the immune system so you are more likely to get sick from other circulating infections, the vaccine immunity is not lifelong like natural immunity, some vaccines carry more risk than the mild illness they are preventing, the risk of death or severe disability from many diseases are <em>much lower</em> than the risk of vaccine-related harm.  </p>

<p>Then there are also questions about <em>unnecessary risk:</em> no individual case consideration, a cookie cutter schedule that does not account for prematurity, body weight (unheard of in pediatrics otherwise), genetic predisposition to bad reactions, history of past adverse reactions (can’t take penicillin for life if you get a little rash, but vaccines, no problem).  A schedule that is <em>Untested for safety</em> of the administration of several vaccines at once, which put loads of neurotoxic ingredients over the fda limits. </p>

<p>Hospitals compete with Pharma, but it is Pharma that has captured regulatory, legislative and professional agencies.

    <div class="md"><p>I’m going to need to see sources for those claims of yours.</p>

<p>You seem to be forgetting to account for heard immunity here.  Diseases can only spread exponentially if a certain percentage of the population is susceptible, otherwise each person who has the disease will infect an average of less than one person and the outbreak will end quickly.  The exact threshold depends on how contagious a disease is.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s true that when surrounded by vaccinated people most outbreaks will die out well before they reach you and it’s relatively safe to not vaccinate.  However, if more people follow your example a tipping point will be reached and outbreaks will be able to spread exponentially with each person infecting an average of more than one other person.  Suddenly the effects of not vaccinating would become apparent.</p>

<p>Sure, adverse reactions to vaccines exist but they are rare and the problems are far less bad than the results of letting the rate of vaccination drop low enough to let diseases spread exponentially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Herd immunity is a myth bec you have vaccinated ppl who lose their immunity <em>all the time</em> putting holes in the “herd” of immunity. Most outbreaks are traced to recently vaccinated ppl infecting those who have lost their immunity or never achieved adequate immunity from their vaccine —<em>not unvaccinated ppl</em>.  So we have more and more boosters with neurotoxins and so many associated illnesses and chronic conditions.  Where is the point of diminishing returns?  It appears that unless you make more effective vaccines, we are past that point.  </p>

<p>You also make the mistake of assuming acquiring these illnesses will lead to certain death, which is fear mongering. The chances are very small — than the risk of long term vaccine harm. </p>

Fda aluminum LIMITS and currently delivered loads. </p>

<ul>
<li>“Hib (PedVaxHib brand only) – 225 micrograms per shot.</li>
<li>Hepatitis B – 250 micrograms.</li>
<li>DTaP – depending on the manufacturer, ranges from 170 to 625 micrograms.</li>
<li>Pneumococcus – 125 micrograms.</li>
<li>Hepatitis A – 250 micrograms.</li>
<li>HPV – 225 micrograms.</li>
<li>Pentacel (DTaP, HIB and Polio combo vaccine) – 330 micrograms.</li>
<li>Pediarix (DTaP, Hep B and Polio combo vaccine) – 850 micrograms.
OK, I’ll do the math for you. A newborn who gets a Hepatitis B injection on day one of life would get 250 micrograms of aluminum. This would be repeated at one month of age with the next Hep B shot. When a baby gets the first big round of shots at 2 months, the total dose of aluminum can vary from 295 micrograms (if a non-aluminum HIB and the lowest aluminum brand of DTaP is used) to a whopping 1225 micrograms if the highest aluminum brands are used and Hep B vaccine is also given. These doses are repeated at 4 and 6 months. A child would continue to get some aluminum throughout the first 2 years with most rounds of shots.
Just to remind you, the FDA feels that premature babies and any patient with impaired kidney function shouldn’t get more than <em>10 to 25 micrograms of injected aluminum (per kg)  at any one time.”</em></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you even know what heard immunity is?  People losing their immunity does not “poke holes in the heard” as long as the average rate of immunity remains high enough, the entire concept of heard immunity is that “holes” are okay as long as there are not too many.  It is well known that vaccines are not 100% effective but having people around you who are immune creates a barrier of sorts between you and any out outbreaks that happen.  If every infected person can only infect an average of 0.5 people then if you have 8 infected people that will spread to 4 people who will spread it to 2 people who will spread it to 1 person, then the outbreak will be over with only 15 people having been infected.  On the other hand if each infected person can infect an average of 2 people than 8 people infect 16 more, who infect 32 more, who infect 64 more, and so on.  It’s just basic math, and the number of people who are immune directly influences the rate at which a disease spreads. Whether the average number of people each person infects is above or below 1 determines the fate of the disease, weather it quickly does out or grows exponentially.</p>

<p>As for the sources you cited, I mostly ignored the ones published in 2017 because there has not been enough time for their results to be implemented and it’s just the self correcting nature of science you see all the time.  If the results only just came out you can’t say that there has been a conspiracy all along to hide them.</p>

<p>On the article about aluminum toxicity if you read down far enough you find that the conclusion is that there is no evidence that the amount of aluminum in certain vaccines is harmful and no evidence that it’s not harmful, basically saying that more research is necessary.</p>

<p>Vaccines reducing immunity to other things isn’t new information as one of your cited studies points out, but it does allow us to chose which things are the most important to be immune to which is a valuable tool.</p>

<p>It’s also well known that vaccines are not 100% effective, but as I’ve explained they don’t have to be to get below the threshold where each infected person infects an average of less than 1 other person.  Heard immunity at it’s finest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I will go through each point.</p>

<h1>1: Considering that around half of all instances of disease happen in the tiny percentage of the population that is unvaccinated, I would say that it’s fully justified to be concerned.  Per capita people who don’t get vaccinated get infected more often and they can spread the disease to people with weak immune systems or people who didn’t respond to the vaccine.</h1>

<h1>2: Strawman.  Heard immunity doesn’t require everyone to be vaccinated but it does require that immunity be over a certain threshold.  Considering that vaccines are not 100% effective the vast majority of people do need to be vaccinated to create heard immunity though.</h1>

<h1>3: 146 research papers showing a possible link between vaccines and autism?  That’s cute.  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/publications.html">Many studies are done on vaccines</a> which conclude that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/study-risk-autism.html">vaccines and autism have no link</a>, so many are done in fact that out of the tens of thousands of studies one out of every hundred shows a link which has a 1% chance of being coincidental.</h1>

<p>Not to mention the Andrew Wakefields of the world who take money from snake oil salesmen.  Vaccines are responsible for less than 0.5% of profits from the medical industry and they prevent expensive hospital visits, I honestly cannot think of a single possible conspiracy involving them which even makes economic sense.</p>

<p>Which would be easier: bribing most of the scientific community to say that vaccines are safe (protecting a tiny percentage of your profits) or bribing 146 scientists to drive traffic to alternative medicine and cause that industry to grow significantly in recent years?</p>

<p>So many of your points only need basic math to refute.  Yeah, often times the majority of disease cases happen in vaccinated people.  However, it’s only a slight majority of cases despite vaccinated people making up the vast majority of the population so accounting for that you find that nearly half of all cases happen in the few percent of the population who didn’t get the vaccine.  How is this supporting your argument again?</p>

<p>From the research I’ve done the vaccine opposition movement is different in different countries.  Here people say autism is caused by vaccines, but in other countries they blame vaccines for different things almost as if the independently started movements are not really based on what vaccines actually do.  The flat Earth movement is nothing particularly new either but that doesn’t give it any more credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now it seems we have contradictory studies.</p>

<p>Studies can be wrong, so a meta-analysis finding what most studies say is valuable.  Also, studies showing negative results are often considered more trustworthy.  You don’t get Nobel prizes by proving that correlations don’t exist and that the currently accepted theories are still correct, so sometimes scientists stretch the data a bit to get a more controversial and interesting result.</p>

<p>On top of that, every study comes with a probability of the results being a coincidence.  Let’s say 1,000 studies are done, 10 find a surprising result concluding that the probability of their results being a coincidence is only 1%.  10 studies each with a 1% chance of being wrong?  What are the chances?  As it turns out, almost 100% when you have 1,000 studies.  Fluke results are expected and normal.</p>

<p>In scientific literature, the vast majority of studies agree that there is no link between vaccines and autism despite all the incentives to come up with a controversial result.  This is clear evidence that the cherry picked positive results are chance flukes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you forgetting that correlation doesn’t imply causation?  I happen to know a thing or two about autism because, you know, I’ve been diagnosed with it.  One of the symptoms is an impulse to constantly be fidgeting with something, which often includes metal objects which can produce metal shavings.  Another very plausible explanation is that autism causes higher levels of metal.</p>

<p>Shit, take me for example.  I once had these magnets which would rub together and produce these metal shavings which severely irritated any skin they landed on.  Even knowing exactly what was going on it took my like a week to get myself to stop touching them and find something better to fidget with in their place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, amounts of a known neurotoxin that is found in food and is well below the safety limits.  Plus, it’s usually aluminum based salts that are used in vaccines and putting something into a molecule changes it’s properties.</p>

<p>Let’s just assume for the sake of argument though that vaccines are the only cause of autism.  I would still vote to keep them around, because a 2% chance of autism is better than a 10-20% chance of dying from the diseases would run rampant again if not for heard immunity.</p>

<p>From the data I have seen that “$billions” figure gives on the order of $100,000 to each person with the slightest adverse reaction to vaccines, so if you ask me it seems to be a bit on the high side.</p>

<p>Did you know that the scientific paper which found a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was written written by Andrew Wakefield who later confessed that it was a hoax?  It is widely considered the most damaging medical hoax of our century.</p>

<p>Sure, there are problems in scientific literature which is why there are contradictory papers.  However, you can’t pretend like only one side is full of corruption and economic incentives.</p>

<p>I would argue that vaccines prevent more medical expenses than they cause so overall they make the medical industry lose money.  The only reason left for them to exist is an ethical one and because stopping vaccine production would be such a blatantly obvious conspiracy to make more people get hospitalized that public protest is inevitable.</p>

<p>All sources I have seen say that more caution is used in vaccines than in most other medical procedures since vaccines are preventative.  They are tested for over a decade before being released into the wild and carefully monitored after that.  With so many thousands of studies being done there are expected to be some with data showing a correlation that has a 1 in 1,000 chance of being a coincidence, but the majority of studies still show that vaccines are very safe.  Plus, positive results advance careers more has  negative ones.  Nobody wins Nobel prizes for proving the lack of a correlation that everyone already expected would not be there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this funny, every time vaccines drive a disease to near eradication anti-cancers blame statistical anomalies but the increase in autism surely has nothing to do with the increase in awareness and the definition changes in the DSM-5.  Right?</p>

<p>More mild cases of autism often go overlooked.  Considering that I have been diagnosed with mild autism myself and have been active in autism related internet communities I am very familiar with what’s going on there.  One person I talked to on the forum had recently been diagnosed with mild autism at age 70, it had been overlooked up to that point and the recent increase in awareness brought him to look into the possibility.  I myself was only diagnosed as soon as I was because my mom is a mental health professional.</p>

<p>I’m going to go out in a limb here and say that the increase in autism has something to do with more people seeking diagnosis under a definition that is more lenient than ever.  Diagnosis rates are fully expected to go up as a result of this and there is no evidence that autism rates are actually increasing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read through the study and looked through the data.  It is worth noting that in the case of autism and ADHD the p-values were on the high side, on the order of a 5% and a 10% respectively of the results being a coincidence.</p>

<p>That aside, I find it odd that the researchers found a reasonably strong to very strong correlation with vaccination and literally every condition on their survey.  Even if vaccines were as dangerous as anti-vaccers believe I find it far fetched that they could raise the probability of every condition in the book.</p>

<p>Here is what I think is going on which I believe explains the data better: parents who chose not to vaccinate their kids are simply less likely to seek diagnosis for those conditions than parents who do chose to vaccinate their kids.  I bet we can agree that parents who don’t vaccinate their kids don’t have the best opinion of the medical industry, so it stands to reason that they would be less inclined to talk to doctors when their kid has trouble focusing at school.  No controls existed in that study to rule this out, and any possible controls like a mental health screening would be outside of the apparent budget of that study anyway.</p>

<p>It certainly saves money when instead of finding treatment you just leave conditions untreated, although I wouldn’t recommend it.  I have heard of anti-vaccers even declaring their kids to be cured after using alternative medicine on them even brought they still meet the diagnostic criteria.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, so the CDC has some bad practices and some guy who says he would “never recommend not vaccinating” gets an award for calling them out.</p>

<p>That sounds like no conspiracy I’ve ever heard of.  Shouldn’t the mustache twirling medical industry use their apparent power over the scientific community to get this guy laughed out of his career or at least prevent him from getting an award?  This looks to me like a case of an honest mistake being corrected which in science happens every time you turn around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, I’ve seen that book.  It’s the one which thinks that an increase in autism awareness and changing of the diagnostic criteria causing more reported cases is...  Well,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>evidence of an epidemic, not, as the deniers will have it, “an optical illusion” or “a statistical mirage“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because reasonable people like the author think that diagnosis rates are expected to remain exactly the same even though in the relatively new DSM-5 Asperger’s syndrome and PDD-NOS were reclassified as mild Autism Spectrum Disorder, the bar for being diagnosed has been lowered, and more people than ever are seeking diagnosis.  No, that’s clearly either just “statistical mirage” (whatever the fuck that’s supposed to mean) or evidence of a coverup, because if vaccines didn’t cause autism we would definitely not expect changing diagnosis standards to change the diagnosis rates in the slightest.</p>

<p>Please excuse my hopefully obvious thick sarcasm, it’s just the easiest way to respond to an obvious strawman on the part of the author.</p>

<p>For those that buy the narrative, they couldn&#39;t dream of being duped on such a nefarious level. <em>Some</em> of those people aren&#39;t stupid, they are trusting and defensive.

<p>&quot;the apparent “dose-response” relationship between vaccination status and several forms of chronic illness, and the significant association between vaccination and NDDs all support the possibility that some aspect of the current vaccination program could be contributing to risks of childhood morbidity. Vaccination also remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors, whereas preterm birth, long considered a major risk factor for NDD, was not associated with NDD after controlling for the interaction between preterm birth and vaccination. &quot;</p>
