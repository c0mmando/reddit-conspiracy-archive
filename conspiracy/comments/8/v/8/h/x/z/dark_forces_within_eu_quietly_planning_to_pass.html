       The EU politicians are either asleep at the wheel or under the control of dark forces, this sweeping new legislation will be used to censor to Internet, effectively hand-cuffing the power of the people in their fight against the corrupt elite and psychopath-controlled corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plan is undemocratic, anyone based over in Europe should
       <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/your-meps/uk_meps.html">
        write to their MEPs
       </a>
       before the vote on the 5th July and explain to them on why it needs to be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some more details below:-

       "A committee of MEPs has voted to accept major changes to European copyright law, which experts say could change the nature of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       They voted to approve the controversial Article 13, which critics warn could put an end to memes, remixes and other user-generated content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 11, requiring online platforms to pay publishers a fee if they link to their news content, was also approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       One organisation opposed to the changes called it a "dark day".
      </p>
      <p>
       The European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs voted by 15 votes to 10 to adopt Article 13 and by 13 votes to 12 to adopt Article 11.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will now go to the wider European Parliament to vote on in July."

       The EU is killing our democratic spaces using copyright as a Trojan horse

      <p>
       "The EU has recently embarked on a new mission: controlling the Internet through the monopoly of copyright. This attempt to reform and control the Internet has not received half the attention it deserves.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Julia Reda, MEP for the Pirate Party, has explained, the current project of EU legislation would impose automatic filters that control ANY content that anyone wants to upload. The reason would be the protection of copyright, a monopoly right that primarily benefits large media behemoths, without any possibility of advance verification.
      </p>
      <p>
       You read that right: the EU wants to put in place a global censorship machine, on the basis of unverifiable monopoly rights, mostly held by large media corporations."

       EU's Copyright Reform Proposal
       <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/eus-copyright-reform-proposal-article-13">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Article 11 would require extra copyrights for news or media outlets, requiring anyone who would like to link to a news site must first get a license from the publisher. Julia Reda writes, "The automatic link previews social networks generate when users share links (showing the article headline, a thumbnail picture and a short excerpt) would require a license, as well as anyone analysing news content on the web like news aggregators, media monitoring services and fact checking services."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Article 13 requires that internet platforms that rely on hosting large amounts of user-uploaded data must monitor that content. Additionally, they must moderate the content to identify copyright infringement. The proposal could limit freedom of expression and harm independent creators."
      </p>
      <p>
       "On June 20th, the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs voted yes to on articles 11 and 13 of the referendum. Many criticized the vote stating that it "threatened the openness of the internet and made it less free." However, despite the vote, the vote does not put the rules into law, but rather only secures European Parliament's position on the issue, before moving the process to the final stages."

       Article 13 addresses the case that people who produce memes don't get anything for their effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use case: John Smith makes a "Y U NO meme". A website (9gag, Reddit etc.) take that meme and post it. The website gets traffic and shows ads to that traffic, earning money. John Smith gets 0%. Website gets 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intention: John Smith can now ask the website, "I want 50% of money earned from traffic generated by my meme". Website refuses. John Smith complains to EU authorities. Website gets fined and John Smith gets his money. If website agrees, John Smith can ask for a
       <em>
        filter
       </em>
       so the meme isn't posted by users, only by the website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Result: Shitty sites that steal content get struck down. Sites that fairly pay content creators get all the traffic.

       But what's the redress mechanism if someone steals your content or mine and starts making money off of it? Article 13 provides it
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       13(2) also says "Member States shall ensure that the service providers referred to in paragraph 1 put
in place complaints and redress mechanisms that are available to users in case of disputes over the application of the measures". This means Google is now obliged to put proper anti-copyright claim mechanisms on Youtube, rather than just having a series of automated emails.

       With these rules it becomes to easy to wrongly censor information and kill the flow of the Internet.

       If people want to make money from memes there are other ways to do it.  There are already ways of protecting copyrighted property

       Memes by definition are
       <em>
        designed
       </em>
       to be shared and many people would put theirs in a copyleft license if they knew to. They aren't supposed to be monetized like cartoons, and by their very nature, probably infringe on another's copyrighted work (the old Dat Boi meme is a perfect case study for Article 13).

       To be clear this won't change anything in the US. We have clear protections for memes as they would be considered critique or satire. Both of which make use of loop holes in copyright law.

       How can the EU be sure John Smith made the meme? Also, it is more often a person who posts a meme, and not the website itself. Memes are different than for example music, a meme is an idea meant to be spread. In my opinion this article will hinder memes, not help them.

       You're asking me for legal opinion I don't have. All I can tell you is Article 13 does not appear to be made for censorship. I saw the Net Neutrality outrage boiling over and nothing substantial has changed.

       How do you know that? Who are the gatekeepers of what is copyrighted and should be removed/censored? Who decides? How in the fuck are they supposed to enforce this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what happened to YouTube, they started using algorithms to block, remove or downright censor specific content. What happened? A lot of channels and content that wasn't warranted for being taken down did, this is still happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       How are they going to be 100% sure of the origin of the meme/content? People have used systems like this for abuse before, especially in the case of YouTube, where people and corporations have reported channels for copyright strikes when it is clearly within fair use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether this censorship will be intentional or not, it will be happening. And this is not just for memes, governments have used laws like this to censor those with opinions they don't like. I can't for the life of me understand how you connect this Article to the freedom of speech, it is in my opinion the opposite.

       A meme is essentially a piece of advertising- it’s there to draw attention to itself and be spread about. For people to turn around now and say these need protecting is preposterous. If you don’t want people to circulate your meme, don’t publish it.

       Personal at this point I don't care if we leave or not, it's been a train wreak from the start and the only reason I'm a 'remoaner', is because the leave campaign never made a sound argument and just threw numbers and nazi-esk propaganda around.  There was never a real structured argument, there was never a plan, we can leave the EU whenever so why don't we have a plan before we start the countdown?

       You’re missing the Bignone. Time. You weren’t listening to the arguments, or they weren’t reaching you. They can see what’s happening with immigration in London and the results of so much immigration from Pakistan and the looming promise of more “refugees” they wanted control of the borders now because if this is allowed to be dragged out, as is being done anyway, the damage will be irreparable.

       If the arguments weren't reaching me then surely that just proves my point?
Not a single person voting leave could structure an argument or even briefly justify it beyond a misplaced sense of patriotism and xenophobia.
       <br/>
       Besides, the Tories are already causing lasting damage with their shady bullshit.

       You just handwave with name calling that lacks substance. This is why remain lost.

       aren’t making an argument. You’re dismissing it. You’re right though they didn’t have the infrastructure prepared after they won. That wouldn’t be as much a problem if every effort to leave wasn’t being obstructed.

       If the jury had seen Tommy's Facebook live the defendants for the major case in question would've had the opportunity to apply for a re-trial on the grounds that the jury could be biased.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I very much doubt it would result in the defendants walking away, it would give them more time to prepare thselves, knowing the evidence against them, and forcing witnesses and victims to give evidence all over again. Also would've cost alot of taxpayer money

       Although not British, if this gets passed I join the eurosceptic side. The strange thing however is that most of the eurosceptic parties seem to actually vote in favor of this proposal, apart from, if I'm not mistaken UKIP's fraction.

       Imagine a world government. Imagine one group of people that dictate everything. They would censor everything, no discussions allowed, no ability to even question anything and constant monitoring. That really would be hell on earth. This is real. They are trying to destroy humanity. This step is just one of many they have already made. We don't have much time. And that's sad because I never thought people would be this stupid.

       I am from Europe and must tell you that this is the start of the end of Europe. Receive by force un-assimilated migrants who rape and don't go to jail, people are forced to go out of their houses by the police to give "room for migrants" it's just the tip of the iceberg. I know usa is going down the drain too and trump is the one holding on the country. We need a guy like trump in Europe believe me.

       Idiots, he is one of the few who still cares about your country, he doesn't profit from any of this yet he still pushes forward to keep you guys safe from bullshit like this. Yet you continue to degrade your own president when 3 presidents down the line helped destroy and dismantle everything your ancestors have worked for.

       I know that you are probably a born in middle class, or what I like to call the iPhone communist. US economy is booming again, unemployment is so low that is in a record low for African Americans and spanics, historic low since the start of the US history, do you understand that? If you are unemployed is because of your own stupidity and lack of skills. Not because of trump.

       You do realize that the WORLD'S economy is booming right?  This isn't because of a single man or a single administration (or even the past half year exclusively).  If you want to show 'Trump's success' use the rest of the world as a baseline and compare them.

       Some of our countries will not give up as they expected, the case being, Poland, Hungary Slovakia and Czech Republic. Those are the one who strongly are against the command of the liberal German agenda, and "unexpectedly" also with fast growing economies, plus they do not use euro (apart from Slovakia that is the weakest in the group exactly because of that) they command their economy and are thriving. But I can say that Paris is now Africa/middle east. Just go and visit, don't take my word. Go to Berlin, you will be in Turkey. Seriously, just go and see, it's depressing. By the way, I love the foreign communities that work and adapt and thrive. The problem is that 90% of them close themselves in ghettos and just create trouble. Like Muslims in UK.

       Not really. I never ever pray in the middle of the street, I know how to use a toilet, I know that rape is wrong, I see woman as equal to men, I think acid attacks are wrong...the list continues... So I was pretty much assimilated to start with.

       You absolutely have no idea who are you talking with. But I will enlighten you. 80% of my best friends are from middle east. Others are simply from Muslim countries (Marroco as example) and I have been in middle east for months in a row and I am writing this from a moderate Muslim country that I seriously respect. Although, everyone from Muslim countries keeps telling ME that Europe has no idea of what human garbage they are importing. My Muslim friends run away from those people and now, we are welcoming them in Europe. One of my friends is think to move back to middle east because it's safer than London! The people that he run away from, keep pouring in Europe, people are blind, and, I AM SEEING FAKE NEWS! Any person living in middle east with a certain level of education is laughing at the border control of Europe and they can't understand why we let all of this radicals, prisoners and murders in! I strongly advise you to make that tour and come here and comment again.

       Omg! Way to dismiss all the Trump criticism as memes! Trump is avidly anti-free internet, if you think otherwise you’re a moron. Trump is savior only of his own bank account, having faith in him to help this country is to ignore all the evidence and live in delusion.

       Kek, you actually believe that huh? Media pro immigration meanwhile ur all convinced that immigrants are coming to rape and pillage you while stealing all your gooda and values. Ffs open your eyes duded. What percentage of your nation’s people are immigrants? Who is fucking the working and middle class? It’s not immigrants, you are just being riled up by people who want to rob you blind.

       yeah, that's cute
      </p>
      <p>
       in my experience, tho, and at least where I live uneducated working class typically voted left because "they care for the working class, bro, not like the conservative richs" and educated people voted right because it usually was better for the economy at the bussines level.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me, only these past few decades the left has abandoned the "working class"  piece and they went full social justice, minority mode, so obviously poor working class people are getting assblasted and they are opening their eyes while  privileged college pseudointellectuals had gone the other way just to feel they are morally superior.

       You mocked him for not answering you as seriously and concisely as you would of liked, and then went on with how unchecked immigration isnt a problem but rather the rich and powerful behind the scenes manipulating the playing field are. When he implied one was a result of the other your response was, "you know conservative voters are less educated right?"

       How is the plan “undemocratic” when it’s voted on by the European Parliament? That’s kinda the definition of democracy. Also, these alleged terrible effects of the legislation are speculative, which people would do well to remember.

       Having to get licenses to link to someone's website is a bit far. Protecting copyrights not so far. It would force people to be a little more original and not so mindless. It's virtually impossible to sustain a business online with any product that is either digitized or can be without getting ripped off by the generation that thinks everything should be free to them, including people's hard work.

       good informative post, well done
      </p>
      <p>
       that said, i have no idea what to do about this because, well, the institutions doing this have no method for the general public to contact them and their connection to the large corporations demanding it are invisible
      </p>
      <p>
       the justiication for it is non-existent, but they don't have to justify it as the system is anti-democratic
      </p>
      <p>
       i am not sure the e.u. would have been implemented if it were outright known and said clearly that they are making an anti-democratic institution filled with suit wearing types with names no one has ever heard of

       Federal governments naturally give rise to national governments. This was the lesson of the US, made permanent after the civil war.

       United States became
       <em>
        The

       United States, a union of sovereign states becoming one single state with provinces.

       I can't help but feel that this ties into what is going on with Trump and Qanon. Seems like they're leading up to disclosing A LOT of information on the corrupt deep state running the world to the public very soon. Q said July 2018 is the month the world discovered the truth. Guess we'll find out soon enough! This seems like a last ditch effort and pathetically desperate attempt to censor it all.

       Article 13 and 11 are ridiculous. How is it logical to mandate websites pay to link to news outlets, when them linking to those site only increases the sites revenue anyway. Clicks=money.

       I’m a bboy/dancer and I can’t even post a clip of me getting down to commercial songs anymore. FB and Insta have cut the Cypress Hill song out of my clip and made it a silent vid. This is beyond ridiculous. It’s not only going to kill freedoms it’s going to take the Arts down with it. I make my own music and I can just use that but I wanted to share the music that inspired me. It’s also risky for major corporations cause we got enough tech now to do it all ourselves and if we get organised we could probably leave em behind and start our own arts community.

       I think it's just so sad that everyone wants to fuck up the internet. If it's not one way it's another, and they really try to hurt us every time.
