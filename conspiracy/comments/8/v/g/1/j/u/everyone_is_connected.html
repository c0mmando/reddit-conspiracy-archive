       Do you have a source for the 2006 falling out with Epstein? the links are very interesting, and make me wonder if certain private islands are utilized among the rich and famous for either a)sick feats, or b) a place away from celebrity staus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm intrigued. Please provide more links?

       Well beyond my knowledge but I would say no. The island would fall under the jurisdiction of some other country. That country would dictate the law of the island.

       Omg. This is validating. I went with my parents in the 90’s to see him in Vegas. Can’t remember how old I was (maybe 10-12?). He chose me from the audience and pulled me onstage for The Floating Rose illusion, and I was beyond uncomfortable. 
This doesn’t surprise me in the least.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

       No shit he's friends with Epstien. Trump is a successful billionaire. Wealth and fame only associate with wealth and fame. It's not shocking news.

       He's also been on his plane and had 15 different numbers for him in his little black book. While constantly talking about how he wants to fuck his own daughter from the time she was young. Talked about how hot a 12 year Paris Hilton was. Got accused of raping a 13 year old girl 4 times until she withdrew the case due to threats. But yea, I'm sure his deep connection with Epstein means nothing at all.

       The Guardian totally outed and humiliated the former Jerry Springer producer Norm Lubrow as the fraud behind the fake 13 year old girl's accusations.

       Nor did "she" withdraw her accusations due to "threats." "She" withdrew them because The Guardian exposed "her" as a fraud perpetuated by a former Jerry Springer producer.

       Ok fair enough. I'll take your word for it. There's not much validity in pushing an accusation as fact when it wouldn't go to court so I'll leave that be. Thanks for the information though.

       I mean, obviously he's never going to say that outright, but he has said it in so many words several times. He's called her a "hot piece of ass" with Stern. In the video in my link, he says, "'If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her."

      <p>
       What do you suppose "dating" means in the mind of "Mr. Locker Room Talk?"

       I don't think it means "Let's go rollerskating, and if it's going really well, maybe we can share a root beer float."

       Oh shut the fuck up. Donald Trump did not call Ivanka a "hot piece of ass". Howard Stern said it. Howard Stern asked Trump if he could call her that, because that's the kind of shit that Howard Stern does.

       Let's call it a mistake then because the words weren't exact, I was recalling from memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will change it from
       <em>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Is that okay? Can you refute anything about that? Is it any less creepy when paired with the other things he's definitely said about her? We can argue about a misplaced word or two, but facts are facts and context is context, and my misplaced word or two doesn't alter the facts, so I'll repeat the most important one again:

       You just proved my point. You made this mistake precisely because people have repeated that
       <strong>
        lie
       </strong>
       over and over. That is intentional. Whoever is pushing this propaganda wants people like you to remember something that literally didn't happen. It's brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting the literal words aside, you still haven't interpreted that interaction in a reasonable way. Howard Stern asked if
       <em>
        he
       </em>
       could call her a piece of ass, not if Trump thinks of her that way. Guess what? When you're on Howard Stern's show, you smile and nod when he says crass stuff because that's his whole schtick. We shouldn't even need to have this conversation. It's common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with a father calling his daughter beautiful. That's how you
       <em>
        avoid
       </em>
       daddy issues. They can talk like this and make jokes
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       they are so secure in their healthy father-daughter relationship. Donald Trump didn't even understand that people would think twice about his jokes because the idea that they would be taken seriously was completely absurd to him. The attacks say more about the people making them than they do about Donald Trump.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “After I met Ivanka and praised her to her father, he said, ‘Yeah, she's really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren't happily married and, ya know, her father . . .’”
       </p>
       <p>
        According to several studio witnesses, Mr Trump replied that he kisses Ivanka “with every chance [he] gets”. The comment was apparently edited out of the final cut of the show when it went to air.

        When
        <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">
         Donald Trump
        </a>
        was watching his 16-year-old daughter Ivanka host the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he turned to the then-Miss Universe and asked: “Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?”
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Trump replies in the affirmative when host Howard Stern asks him if he can call Ivanka "a piece of ass”.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump: “My daughter is beautiful, Ivanka."
       </p>
       <p>
        Stern: “By the way, your daughter…”
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump: “ - she’s beautiful"
       </p>
       <p>
        Stern: “Can I say this? A piece of ass.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump: “Yeah.”
       </p>
       <p>
        When asked how he would react if Ivanka, a former teen model, posed for Playboy, Trump replied, "It would be really disappointing — not really — but it would depend on what's inside the magazine."
       </p>
       <p>
        He added: "I don't think Ivanka would do that, although she does have a very nice figure. I've said if Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her.

       Trump is (was) a business man. He was cordial to everyone even the Clintons. Epstein and Trump both resided in south Florida. Trump also uses a lot of hyperbole "terrific guy" when speaking, be it of others or of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump may be a lot of things but he certainly is not a pedophilia nor did he need someone to help get him laid. It's ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Clinton's on the other hand (both of them) liked others getting them their prey. That's how TRUE pedophiles act. Like a King/Queen on a throne---being served.  That however is NOT Trump.
Intelligent people will see that. Hateful small minded democrats, won't. (and I'm not even conservative)

       See, everyone, this is how you spot someone who is either a liar or they are under deception. They deny evidence and facts with hyperbole using exaggerated words like "certainly", "ludicrous", "phony". Then they project their own inner motives onto you, "Just stop the hate!!!" with an almost desperate tone about them. Then here comes the deflection + projection onto their perceived enemy which is just their scapegoat for all of their own faults, negative feelings and misdeeds. They attribute all of that stuff to outside people our groups because they can't possibly accept these things in themselves. See how sure he is that how that "is NOT how Trump rolls!!!!" Those that scream the loudest. Isn;t that something you guys like to say over on the Q board? Funny how you never apply that logic to Trump. "NO COLLUSION! (except by the democrats" , WITCHUNT!", "NO PUPPET! NO PUPPET! YOU'RE THE PUPPET!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I like how he finishes it by informing me of how intelligent people see things and they just so happen to agree with him. And how only hateful small minded democrats won't see it this way, yet he claims he's not a conservative (while not telling us what he does believe) either so that means he's better than both of them. The way he framed this last part tells me that he lives in a black and white world. Right vs Left. Republican vs Democrat. Obama vs Trump. Democrats are the "other" in his head. They are the enemy. So since I am against Trump, something he is strongly for, that means I must be the enemy and that enemy is democrats. He already knows my intelligence and my entire belief system simply because I don't support Trump. There is only one word for people like this. Delusional.

       I couldn't even get through your post. It was psycho babble.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let me edify one point:
If you think every single person who went to Epstein's island was up to no good, you're fucking insane!
He did have underage girls but he also entertained legitimate people and hosted legitimate party's too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to be under this impression it's all or nothing.
That's like saying, if a priest molested a little boy then every single child he came into contact with was molested too!?

       You're not even worth my time. You're simple and you're delusional.
Have a good life!

       Most Trump supporters are straight up delusional at this point. I have argued with many of them. They use the same tactics and I break down their arguments, step by step and point out what they're doing and then they finally do what that person just did. Give up while acting like I'm delusional one.

       Again, more personal attacks based on perceived differences of opinion. I'm apparently "fucking insane!" for thinking something that I never actually even claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then comes the made up justifications for how the guy they idealize isn't guilty of anything. Like they have personal knowledge and insight that isn't available to anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       They couldn't get though my post because it was all psychobabble but then they proceed to show they did indeed get through my post because they are responding to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here comes the projection again by accusing me of having black and white thinking after I accused them of the same. Complete with a terrible analogy that they think is genius and just won the argument but just really makes them seem desperate and out of arguments, grasping at straws. Seems I struck a nerve with that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here we have the favorite response of the delusional person who know's subconsciously they lost the debate. "You can't fire, me I quit!" complete with more projection and a final civil sounding goodbye to try and save a little bit of face.

       Im sorry but the links you provided have nothing to do with anything you posted. It really just shows that he bought an island, was accused of rape by a woman, who then said another person raped her also. Then, once the police found surveillance footage of her and the guy who raped her, police dropped the rape charges against the guy and charged her with filing false reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       These kinds of people make me sick. I had a similar situation happen to me at an old job. Was accused of sexual assault by an employee of mine who was stalking me. If I wouldn't have had my old cell phone with all the crazy ass messages she sent me, I may still be in prison right now. It seriously would have ruined my life.
