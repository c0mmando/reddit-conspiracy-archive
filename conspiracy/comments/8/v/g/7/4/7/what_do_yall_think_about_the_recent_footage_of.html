       I just saw the video and it begs the question why let the man continue to massacre innocent people? It this cause of the liberal Anti-gun agenda attempted to push stronger gun laws or just total recklessness.

       Sounds like their all for pizzagate to me and a troll if you go look at their other shit. Instead of leaving insightful comments with a good amount of productive information, he's a one liner. Must be their life story.

       You’re taunting a human being who just told you that their friend was murdered in a random act of mass murder.

      <p>
       Being “woke” doesn’t absolve you of the responsibility to be a decent fucking human being.

       You have zero doubt, which leads me to believe you are probably suffering from a mental illness of some sort snd should get help.

       Yeah, you're probably right, he has my comment from over 7 months ago on that website. Sad actually. It pisses me off, he did a good job at setting off my emotions today, in my post from 7 months ago, it was him who I replied too. I was kind as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's whatever, people will believe what they wanna believe, there's not productivity in his comments. I'm done arguing with him. I'm just going to continue on with my life cause whatever happened, it happened and I can't let that affect me forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Closure would be nice though and with Paddock not leaving a damn finger print on the web, drives me nuts. I should probably just stop looking for answers because I'm not going to find any, at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to love coming here because people were so insightful but after this, I'm done. Conspiracies are out there, in the government, in other operations, there are so many tracks to follow but like I mentioned, I'm just an ant in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I shared a story, I shared an emotion with this thread and choose to spit in my face.
      </p>
      <p>
       My was filled with love from others on their birthdays. It broke my heart so bad, I just ditched FB. I've got work to do and finish and when someone spits in my face it's kinda hard to focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone here is entitled to their opinions but there is such thing as respect and PRODUCTIVE conversation. You don't kick someone when their down and make them relive that pain, that's bullshit. Idiot should be banned for being a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have my own issues but I don't go take them out on the world or other people. I have my suspicions as well. It's about keeping an open mind but when you someone comes and says b-dawg wasn't shot. I get a little pissed, I won't get to hear his new music anymore, I won't get to see his posts anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I get is "there are no answers." No fucking answers to why my friend is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking wonderful.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should rephrase that, NO LOGICAL answers or theories. This one is just an attack and he went ahead and posted everyone who "claimed," to have lost someone on that website. Which is poorly worded to begin with, putting people on blast like that is wrong. And you're right, being "woke," doesn't mean you go and act like a complete jackass.

       Uhm, why the HELL would I do that when I went to his GODDAMN funeral! OBVIOUSLY something sketchy went down. I'm not sure what kinda proof you guys want but I can get you fucking proof. Don't fucking call me a liar and a terrorist when I lost my fucking GOD DAMN FRIEND, THANK GOD I wasn't fucking there and my friends MOM is still in the fucking hospital healing from the bullet wounds and can't even keep ice cream down last I spoke to her, fucking bullshit. You guys, it happened but that doesn't fucking mean it wasn't some bullshit gun run or god knows what the fuck THEY were trying to achieve here, I saw all the videos, in fact, I watched one that studied gun sounds and how many shooters were actually there as well as whether it could have been Paddock himself or someone else, why the fuck would I waste my time (that I don't get back) trying to understand all of this if my friend didn't pass, he was a fucking singer. Don't be so cold to other ideas of what MAY HAVE happened, I don't know what the hell happened that night but I'm fucking glad I didn't go to that fucking concert!

       I don't understand you man. I get it if you think this shit was a hoax, whatever but can you tell me where the hell my friend went then? You "didn't read," which means you're quite close minded to anything other than your own beliefs, why be so biased? I NEVER SAID that it wasn't fucking weird. I shared a fucking story and you're just spitting in someone's face.

       You must be enjoying this, a lot. Thanks for fucking up my Monday. You're deserve a gold medal for making someone suffer more than they already have.... You sound paranoid as fuck.

       Honestly wish I did, I would have to go look through photo-bucket, that's where I kept allllllll of my pictures from middle school. But I will go look, I kept a whole journal of my passwords. I know T-dawg (we used to skate together) and I have pics and they were best friends throughout middle school. After he graduated we went to different schools then I moved away to get closer to my career in film.

       Got an original photo of your friend that hasn’t already been posted on the Internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a screenshot of his Facebook profile page.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve got loads of original never-before-published photos of friends and colleagues on my phone. That would at least establish that you know him.

       I'm going to check my photobucket. I carried a camera around during the last year of 8th grade. If not there I'm going to have to look in photo albums from then because this guy pissed me off. The one thing I have are my pooka shells. And yea, I know "anybody could of gave them to me." But it wasn't just anyone.

       I think ... that you’re here to get people arguing about what kind of shooting it was, instead of the fact that no shooting took place at all.

       No innocent people were massacred. It’s exceedingly clear to me that that is what we are “not allowed” to question about the event. While everything else is fair game, the question of “did people get shot, really?” is and has completely been off-limits on this sub, whose front page is a repository exclusively for kosher trivialities and pure disinformation.
