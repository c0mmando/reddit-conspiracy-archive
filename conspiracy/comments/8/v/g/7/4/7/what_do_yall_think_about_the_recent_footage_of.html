    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you&#39;re probably right, he has my comment from over 7 months ago on that website. Sad actually. It pisses me off, he did a good job at setting off my emotions today, in my post from 7 months ago, it was him who I replied too. I was kind as well. </p>

<p>It&#39;s whatever, people will believe what they wanna believe, there&#39;s not productivity in his comments. I&#39;m done arguing with him. I&#39;m just going to continue on with my life cause whatever happened, it happened and I can&#39;t let that affect me forever. </p>

<p>Closure would be nice though and with Paddock not leaving a damn finger print on the web, drives me nuts. I should probably just stop looking for answers because I&#39;m not going to find any, at all. </p>

<p>I used to love coming here because people were so insightful but after this, I&#39;m done. Conspiracies are out there, in the government, in other operations, there are so many tracks to follow but like I mentioned, I&#39;m just an ant in this world.</p>

<p>I shared a story, I shared an emotion with this thread and choose to spit in my face. </p>

<p>My was filled with love from others on their birthdays. It broke my heart so bad, I just ditched FB. I&#39;ve got work to do and finish and when someone spits in my face it&#39;s kinda hard to focus. </p>

<p>Everyone here is entitled to their opinions but there is such thing as respect and PRODUCTIVE conversation. You don&#39;t kick someone when their down and make them relive that pain, that&#39;s bullshit. Idiot should be banned for being a troll. </p>

<p>I have my own issues but I don&#39;t go take them out on the world or other people. I have my suspicions as well. It&#39;s about keeping an open mind but when you someone comes and says b-dawg wasn&#39;t shot. I get a little pissed, I won&#39;t get to hear his new music anymore, I won&#39;t get to see his posts anymore. </p>

<p>All I get is &quot;there are no answers.&quot; No fucking answers to why my friend is dead. </p>

<p>Fucking wonderful. </p>

<p>I should rephrase that, NO LOGICAL answers or theories. This one is just an attack and he went ahead and posted everyone who &quot;claimed,&quot; to have lost someone on that website. Which is poorly worded to begin with, putting people on blast like that is wrong. And you&#39;re right, being &quot;woke,&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you go and act like a complete jackass. </p>

Don&#39;t fucking call me a liar and a terrorist when I lost my fucking GOD DAMN FRIEND, THANK GOD I wasn&#39;t fucking there and my friends MOM is still in the fucking hospital healing from the bullet wounds and can&#39;t even keep ice cream down last I spoke to her, fucking bullshit. You guys, it happened but that doesn&#39;t fucking mean it wasn&#39;t some bullshit gun run or god knows what the fuck THEY were trying to achieve here, I saw all the videos, in fact, I watched one that studied gun sounds and how many shooters were actually there as well as whether it could have been Paddock himself or someone else, why the fuck would I waste my time (that I don&#39;t get back) trying to understand all of this if my friend didn&#39;t pass, he was a fucking singer. Don&#39;t be so cold to other ideas of what MAY HAVE happened, I don&#39;t know what the hell happened that night but I&#39;m fucking glad I didn&#39;t go to that fucking concert! </p>
