       As many of you may know, people have been experiencing the Mandela affect, which is when a large group of people remembering something a certain way that isn’t how it is now. Many people have remembered the “Berenstain Bears” to be spelt “Berenstein Bears,” along with “Wite Out” spelt as “White Out.” A theory claims that there has been a collision with our universe and an alternate universe and changed parts of our reality. People started noticing changes to things that they swore were different for a few months, maybe longer. The way this links to the sun vanishing is because of a twitter account: @TheSunVanished which shows what seems to be an alternate reality that is somehow showing in our reality about how the sun (and everything else outside of earth) has vanished. I think that this is proof to alternate realities being real and that we are just fortunate that not everything has gone the same as the sun-less Earth. The twitter account shows his experiences in his lightless Armageddon world, riots and break-ins are plentiful in the beginning of his story while it slowly gets darker and darker. He has had the aid of two people, Danyon and Tucker. In his recent posts, there was an intruder or intruders looking for him. His last post showed him getting in a car with his friend Danyon, but we haven’t heard since. Hopefully the sun comes up tomorrow.

       some speculate that back in the 2000's, scientists were messing with cern. our dimension bumped into another one, think stranger things but instead of mindless beasts, it was a dimension almost parallel to our own. so instead of, "ma always said life was like a box of chocolates," it was, "ma always said life is like a box of chocolates." another one, is the tale of the wolf and the lamb in the bible. some will remember it as the lion and the lamb, i am one of them.

       I'm definitely affected by the ME. Probably more so, than others. I remember most of all of them. I have my theories on what it is, but, what I really would like to know, is... how many people with this, suffered very traumatic events in their lives or NDE's on or around the time of 2010-2012?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand why some people will refrain from answering, but, I'll go out on a limb (in honesty and transparency)... and admit, that I did. I think there might be a connection with this, along with the ending of the Mayan Calendar - Great Awakening/Unveiling.

       Hey, thanks for answering honestly and I'm truly sorry to hear you were at that low point, as well :(. I was there, too, friend. It was a very dark time in my life, where I figuratively "killed" the old me. Literally in all sense of the meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've talked about this before, but, never really got that discussion I was seeking (this was years ago, though - times are a changing). I really do think there might be a connection to this. I've been pondering this for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, glad you didn't and I hope you are doing better. I sure am. Peace and love!

The ones that are most "confirmable" for me are several out of the Bible.  I was pretty hardcore fundamentalist in my youth, lots of Bible study, KJV only, and there are parts that I studied fairly in-depth that got totally wiped out by ME.  Wineskins, lion laying with the lamb, and Moses never had friggin horns.  That last one had some strange implications...

       Once I went through this stuff, topics like reincarnation, gnosticism, ancient ruling families, and others were much more relevant and even compelling.

       This has gotten real strange for me. I’ve had certain favorite scriptures that I’ve memorized that are now different. Years ago before 2012. My youngest brother and I had been up for days and had a conversation. I had a distinct memory of having that conversation. I felt in a dream state. M/A effect....

       Not a big subscriber to the ME, it is interesting, especially some of the things I have seen that I remembered completely different, but it's really weird you mention NDE because I had TWO in that exact time frame, one I still feel to this day I shouldn't have walked away from. Used to give me ptsd and heart start racing when I would try to remember it. Ive had a thought before that, what if every near death experience, actual splits your reality and one existence you actually die, but you continue living in the other where you walk away. Maybe thats logically the only outcome, because essentially that other reality ceases to exist for you, since you're dead, so you have no choice but to live on in the other....cool stuff to ponder regardless

       '12 Graduated from grad school, didn't get a job until 9 months later. I found reddit during my free time and with that free time, I was able to stretch my mind's horizon and question things, open my mind to things, and just soak up info. It was overwhelming and beautiful and frightening to learn some of these things. I hadn't really thought about this coinciding with the year, but that's kind of interesting...

       None of this makes any sense at all.  Either the world around us is changing while our brains are not effected at all for no reason, or it’s our brains that are wrong.  Brains that are known to change existing memories in response to subliminal stuff, and sometimes even create false memories.  Call me crazy but I’m going with the latter possibility.

       Also your Brian only calculates what you believe. It’s not going to tell you if facts are wrong or right.. sometimes I don’t learn about new animals.. or scientific breakthroughs in technology for years.. doesn’t change the course of my life.

       Yeah, our brains are easy to fool.  That’s why I use the scientific method instead of my own intuition, and what that’s telling me is that the most likely source of your problem is our brains misremembering things, not the universe changing.
      </p>

       If you misremember someone’s phone number that doesn’t mean that their phone number changed after alternate realities collided, it just means that human memory is shit.  Why is this any different?

       Honestly, the Mandela effect is interesting but entirely unconvining. Human brains do not encode information in a precise format, so it is understandable that people would often misremember certain minor details like this, even en masse. The example that you presented here is just plain silly.

       This has gotten real strange for me. I’ve had certain favorite scriptures that I’ve memorized that are now different. Years ago before 2012. My youngest brother and I had been up for days and had a conversation. I had a distinct memory of having that conversation. I felt in a dream state. M/A effect....

       Not a big subscriber to the ME, it is interesting, especially some of the things I have seen that I remembered completely different, but it's really weird you mention NDE because I had TWO in that exact time frame, one I still feel to this day I shouldn't have walked away from. Used to give me ptsd and heart start racing when I would try to remember it. Ive had a thought before that, what if every near death experience, actual splits your reality and one existence you actually die, but you continue living in the other where you walk away. Maybe thats logically the only outcome, because essentially that other reality ceases to exist for you, since you're dead, so you have no choice but to live on in the other....cool stuff to ponder regardless

       '12 Graduated from grad school, didn't get a job until 9 months later. I found reddit during my free time and with that free time, I was able to stretch my mind's horizon and question things, open my mind to things, and just soak up info. It was overwhelming and beautiful and frightening to learn some of these things. I hadn't really thought about this coinciding with the year, but that's kind of interesting...
