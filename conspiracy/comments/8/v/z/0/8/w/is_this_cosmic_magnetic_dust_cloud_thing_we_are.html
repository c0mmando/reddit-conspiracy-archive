        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Im referring to corey and david wilcoks claims if you havent heard this yet.</p>

<p>I think it gos something like this.  Basically we are following behind alpha centauri starting  to go through this cosmic magnetic dust cloud and apparently nasa has comfirmed it.  Its already been effecting the weather and Apparently Alpha Centauri already went through it and when the sun hit the cloud shit didn&#39;t go so well.  As it looks like it roasted everything over there.  He had pics showing the nasa footage.</p>

<p>Is there truth in this or has this been spun like crazy?  I always dismiss crazy apocalyptic claims like this.  However this is one I want to know more about because of that nasa footage.  Not a wilcoks fanboy or anything.  I just want to know whats up with all of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alpha Centauri is 4.3 light years distant from us. Any images we have of it are at least 4.3 years old. If NASA have confirmed some new activity there, it must have happened around 4 years ago. If we were following Alpha Centauri at the speed of light, there would be a 4.3 year &quot;lag&quot; between that star going through a dust cloud and ours. But we are not traveling at anything close to that speed. </p>

<p>I was taught that our Sun is heading toward the constellation Hercules, at a speed of 20 KM/sec. That is 1/15th the speed of light. <em>If</em> we were following Alpha Centauri at that speed it would be 60+ years before we reached the location of where the cloud was 60+ years ago. It&#39;s just more of Wilcocks ego-boosting bullshit. None of his audience will even be alive in 60 years but he wants them to worry about interstellar dust clouds.</p>

<p>I went looking to see what cloud Wilcock might have been talking about. If he meant the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interstellar_Cloud">Local Interstellar Cloud</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interstellar_Cloud#/media/File:Local_Interstellar_Clouds_with_motion_arrows.jpg">this image</a> also contradicts what he is saying.</p>

<p>It shows AC mostly outside of the cloud. It shows the cloud moving away from AC. It shows our Sun moving in a direction away from AC. That could all be wrong, but I&#39;d like to think somebody would have noticed before now, and that somebody would have more credentials than David Wilcock has, his reincarnatory attributes aside :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah.  Maybe he got jealous of David Ike being the second coming of Christ back in the day and wanted to share his glory.  I can get you the link later if you want to check this out.  I never really listened to the guy before this.  That&#39;s why I came here to ask yall.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;David Wilcock&quot;, enough said...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a clue, OP, if it came out of Wilcock&#39;s mouth it is either a lie, fantasy, or someone else&#39;s material he is just parroting.</p>

<p>The guy is pure bullshit, he even tried to claim he is the resurrected Edgar Cayce.</p>

Just curious what everyone thoughts are on it.  Im gonna follow it closely, but like i mentioned a bit ago.  I&#39;ve seen this movie before.  This is some bold shit to say.  I would think its career destroying.  But it seems his 2012 claims didn&#39;t do it so who knows.  This is a lot heavier than that though.  Its just so hard to not be skeptical as hell on this but so intriguing to listen to.  Better than a good movie :-)</p>
