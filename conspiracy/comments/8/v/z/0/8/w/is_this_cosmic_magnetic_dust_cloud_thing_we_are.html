       Im referring to corey and david wilcoks claims if you havent heard this yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it gos something like this.  Basically we are following behind alpha centauri starting  to go through this cosmic magnetic dust cloud and apparently nasa has comfirmed it.  Its already been effecting the weather and Apparently Alpha Centauri already went through it and when the sun hit the cloud shit didn't go so well.  As it looks like it roasted everything over there.  He had pics showing the nasa footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there truth in this or has this been spun like crazy?  I always dismiss crazy apocalyptic claims like this.  However this is one I want to know more about because of that nasa footage.  Not a wilcoks fanboy or anything.  I just want to know whats up with all of this.

       I don't know Wilcox and this is new to me, but it seems like if there's any merit, he's doing the service of soft disclosure. If TPTB knew civilization was facing impending wipe, they would surely get their evil on first.

       They’ve been getting their evil on, doing as much as they could get away with, for quite some time.  It’s almost as if they have known something we have not.  Maybe not.  Just speculating.

       they call it a magnetic dust cloud for the masses. it is an electrical cloud, filled with particulates of varying sizes. they aren't wrong, it's just quite an oversimplification. people dont think of clouds as being electrical, bu they are... and the obfuscation of this fact is intentional.

       Well, thats actually the other part of this apparently.  He's claiming an uprising from within that wants this shit out.  Great entertainment.  Some Q___ fellow is posting shit on youtube and 4chan about it.

       I'm gonna follow this because its very appealing.  However, fucker has 30 days to show me something miraculous before he go's down in my book as bunk for spraying bullshit everywhere.  Even if it doesn't develop as planned... Show us SOMETHING believable to string us a long.  I've seen this movie before.

       The theory is somewhat plausible to the mind and seems to have some amount of “historical” support however depending on which model our physical universe is constituted from it may just be part of the smoke and mirror show.

       Wilcoks is a massive fraud and scam artist. If the man's laughable claims to be the reincarnation of Edgar Cayce don't let you know where things stand right away you need to try to be less gullible.

       Not death. ancesion. Tied to an event a lot of religions report.  He claims this is the event.  I don't know what I make of it so I came here for opinions.  I just want to know if this cloud statement can be confirmed screwing up alpha centauri.

       Just did some checking and we are entering solar minimum. It’s the time when the sun is least active. It’s usually an 11 year cycle. The last one came in 2008-2009 so we’re nearly at the 11 year mark for the new one. My guess would be that’s the reason for the decreased sun spots lately.

       Hey sry I just saw this. There's no if about this. We are very likely heading into another mini or full on ice age. Please start watching Oppenheimerranchproject and adapt2030's channels on YouTube. Now is the time to prepare. Their going to keep lying about what's going in. Have you ever heard about the mammoth they found that still had food in its mouth? Like it was frozen in an instant?

       Alpha Centauri is 4.3 light years distant from us. Any images we have of it are at least 4.3 years old. If NASA have confirmed some new activity there, it must have happened around 4 years ago. If we were following Alpha Centauri at the speed of light, there would be a 4.3 year "lag" between that star going through a dust cloud and ours. But we are not traveling at anything close to that speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was taught that our Sun is heading toward the constellation Hercules, at a speed of 20 KM/sec. That is 1/15th the speed of light.
       <em>
        If
       </em>
       we were following Alpha Centauri at that speed it would be 60+ years before we reached the location of where the cloud was 60+ years ago. It's just more of Wilcocks ego-boosting bullshit. None of his audience will even be alive in 60 years but he wants them to worry about interstellar dust clouds.

       We'll the following statement may be my mistake then.  He said alpha already want through it so I was under the assumption we are following in its path.  He did say 4.3 light years.  You make some great points.  Thanks for the heads up.

       I don't know enough to say we aren't following it, but AC is not in the direction of Hercules. So there is conflicting info there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went looking to see what cloud Wilcock might have been talking about. If he meant the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interstellar_Cloud">
        Local Interstellar Cloud
       </a>
       ,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interstellar_Cloud#/media/File:Local_Interstellar_Clouds_with_motion_arrows.jpg">
        this image
       </a>
       also contradicts what he is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       It shows AC mostly outside of the cloud. It shows the cloud moving away from AC. It shows our Sun moving in a direction away from AC. That could all be wrong, but I'd like to think somebody would have noticed before now, and that somebody would have more credentials than David Wilcock has, his reincarnatory attributes aside :P

       I first came across him about 8 or 9 years ago. He has a talent for attaching himself to popular people or stories, and each time his popularity and reach increases. In that time I've also seen his stage presence develop in an odd direction. He is unusual in how comfortable and engaged he is with his audiences. He really enjoys that role. And that might be nothing or it might be the whole reason he does this. I just get a bad vibe from the guy, he doesn't seem sincere and he enjoys his role and popularity too much IMO.

       - Here is the thread on the rest of his "latest developments"  .  Just curious what everyone thoughts are on it.  Im gonna follow it closely, but like i mentioned a bit ago.  I've seen this movie before.  This is some bold shit to say.  I would think its career destroying.  But it seems his 2012 claims didn't do it so who knows.  This is a lot heavier than that though.  Its just so hard to not be skeptical as hell on this but so intriguing to listen to.  Better than a good movie :-)

       We'll the following statement may be my mistake then.  He said alpha already want through it so I was under the assumption we are following in its path.  He did say 4.3 light years.  You make some great points.  Thanks for the heads up.

       Not death. ancesion. Tied to an event a lot of religions report.  He claims this is the event.  I don't know what I make of it so I came here for opinions.  I just want to know if this cloud statement can be confirmed screwing up alpha centauri.

       I first came across him about 8 or 9 years ago. He has a talent for attaching himself to popular people or stories, and each time his popularity and reach increases. In that time I've also seen his stage presence develop in an odd direction. He is unusual in how comfortable and engaged he is with his audiences. He really enjoys that role. And that might be nothing or it might be the whole reason he does this. I just get a bad vibe from the guy, he doesn't seem sincere and he enjoys his role and popularity too much IMO.

       The speed of light is 299792.458 kilometers per second, I don't think that 20 kilometers per second is even close to 1/15th that speed.
