       Having trouble archiving the cnn story so gone for a text post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dailycaller.com and others have been foaming at the mouth for a year claiming all sorts of shenanigans from Awan being Pakistani ISI to allegations of hacking senators. Hopefully this guilty plea to the loan fraud charges finally puts the story to bed but I have a feeling it won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though it's Trumps DOJ that said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The government also acknowledged Tuesday there is no basis to claims that Awan stole information from the servers, or the servers themselves. The plea deal says: "The Government has uncovered no evidence that your client violated federal law with respect to the House computer system."
       </p>

       What do you mean? Trump's federal prosecuters found no evidence of hacking of any kind, even examining servers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it actually be that Awan was only guilty of bank fraud? The one thing he's been charged without throughout the case?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest the true conspiracy is how this was blown up by fake news sites like true pundit, daily caller etc even going so far as to have Trump tweeting about it.

        Meanwhile, Steven Wasserman, Representative Wasserman Schultz’s brother, has been an assistant U.S. attorney in the office for many years. I have seen no indication that he has any formal role in the case, notwithstanding some cyberspace speculation to the contrary. What is clear, however, is that the office is low-keying the Awan prosecution.

       Do you even read the nonsense you post? That is from your Zerohedge article. So do you have actual evidence her brother was on the case or do you have another article that will refute your statements while trying to use it as evidence.

       It's beyond frustrating that they refuse to see that they are the real victims of the actual conspiracy. I know it's hard to admit that you got, got but goddamn. Have some dignity and self-respect and get pissed at the folks doing the actual getting.

       It has gotten so ridiculous over there. The main thing that sticks out to me is all of the corruption Trump is supposedly draining from the swamp. Q says to look at all of the politicians and CEO's resigning as proof. If there really was proof of it, why don't you put those motherfuckers in prison? Why do you allow them to walk off into the sunset with pensions and benefits to go on living their lives? If Trump wanted to win over everyone in this country, like he so desperately wants, why not charge some politicians with corruption? I mean some high level motherfuckers, not some advisor's or asst's.
      </p>
      <p>
       And my thoughts on Q have been out there for a while. I 100&amp;#37; think Assange was Q until his internet was cut. There are a lot of reasons I think that. Mainly though, the day before Q's internet was cut, he posted, "will be offline", then the day after his internet is cut Q has a different page. The way that Q would post stuff was very similar to how Assange would tweet. He would never just straight up tell you what something was, he would always say, "the evidence is there, you just need to find it!", like he did with Podesta's emails. Then MEGANON coming out saying she had been larped and Assange was Q. And it is a proven fact that the "unbiased" Assange was Pro-GOP in the election. Proven by his own comms with the Wikileaks task force, which they leaked because of it. Then the fact that he was in comms with Trumps campaign, on and on. To me, there are just a lot of coincidences that show he was Q. Now, with all of the nonsense that goes on with that site, there is no telling who it is. That one guy did come out and say it was a group of people, how they got Trumps tweets ahead of time and that he wanted to come clean, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       It has grown so much now that it will never stop so it doesn't matter but the content makes me think that Bannon is doing what he does best, riling up Trumps base and creating havoc.

       The fact of the matter is that the awan  bros were fired for making illegal access to sensitive systems on capitol hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a fact.  that's where this all started.  The fact that they're not charging with anything should be a red flag to everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case people aren't aware, it's illegal just to log in to somebodies computer without them knowing.  Let alone sending sensitive government materials to an offsite location, and then to who knows where.

       Awan was an isi Aman team op. Since Israel got Trump in working with Israel Russia Pakistan Saudi UAE to reshape the middle east against Iran syria, Trump will cover for them even at the expense of protecting Clinton stooge. The 2016 election was for Israel to get Jerusalem and the west bank. It also allowed UAE to grab islands, Saudi to push on Yemen, and for the Sunni world to move against Shia. Since they control the oil market propping the dollar, they get concessions as they all know the comming global depression that'll bring on war as a way to distract the world until they can resituate money and math to keep the ruling powers in and purge those they dont like. Its a way to work things from industrialization/ technology to the new world of service based economies bc industrialization will become automated. Humans will be more free to explore themselves which is dangerous to keeping the rich in power so we will switch to a service based economy to keep the peasants busy.

       "DOJ admits no evidence..." that's not really accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that people are saying he got immunity from other crimes is pretty telling.  I highly doubt the people saying there's no evidence actually dug into shit like them sending people's blackberry information offsite to stores they controlled which is likely a whole other set of crimes in and of itself.

       Yes, there was a lot of evidence that isn't even discussed here. And it's stunning how on a conspiracy subreddit, so many people are here saying "Welp, the government and CNN said he didn't do anything wrong with the computers, so it was just an alt-right witch hunt." Come on.

       No, I'm not ignoring that. I'm saying that it doesn't matter if it's Trump's DOJ or Obama's DOJ. Most of the actors are the same. The elites take care of the elites (and their stooges). More corruption, more coverups, more of the same.

       And Trump reauthorize FISA while at the same time crying about it being used against him.  His DOJ and FBI have slowed the release of the Clinton emails
  I'm not sure how partisan beliefs some how makes the Government any more trust worthy, especially on a conspiracy forum.

       That's a great quote!  You may want to investigate how most federal legislation is passed... Then look into the
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/139">
        2017 FISA bill
       </a>
       that was signed by Trump the same week the media flipped out about the FISA memo.  Infact, that memo started trending on Twitter within 2 hours of that bill passing the Senate.  Weird huh?

       Trump can fire people in the DoJ, but that's about it. And it wouldn't be a good idea to do so now, for optical reasons. So in effect he has little control over DoJ.

       As I pointed out to another user, the official narrative is just wrong.  Imran was fired for computer crimes.  Then people started digging in to all his shit and it didn't look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he tried to flee the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now today he's in the washington post suggesting he's the target of an attack at the hands of trump because he's from pakistan lol...
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is just so odd.  Anybody unwilling to talk about these things is clueless.

       The statement is inaccurate because they obviously didn't investigate.  This is a clear cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you recall this guy was literally kicked out of the capital hill network when he was found to be illegally accessing computer systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why his quotes in the wapo article are so funny.  He tries to hide behind his nationality as if Trump himself made up the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy was committing a wide range of felonies to which they charged him with just one in an effort to make the whole thing go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily we already have enough facts prior to this to see that this is a cover up.

       People said the same thing when Hillary staffers got immunity. Nothing came of that either. But question for you, since Flynn took a plea deal too. Do you think hes singing like a canary to the FBI about Trump? Let's see some consistency here your Highness.

       Flynn was a casualty of a vast conspiracy to attack Trump by any means necessarily.  A conspiracy that's still going on.

       I'm not sure that has anything to do with cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flynn and his legal team have been watching all the fbi stuff unravel and probably have second thoughts of entering any kind of guilty plea because none of that shit will fly in a trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       You couldn't possibly convince a jury there's no funny business going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do is show that strok was embedded in the clinton case, and the trump case.  Clinton people lied and didn't get charged with anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump people are being held to a different standard.  That's the type of shit that simply doesn't fly in an actual trial situation.

       Nice dodge. The reality is you have nothing to support the notion that Awan flipped aside from a cultish devotion to   Q.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        MSM ideals

      <p>
       You know that MSM sometimes gets shit right don't you? Even as it relates to conspiracy theories. The Washington Post published the Pentagon Papers and exposed Watergate. The New York Times broke the story on Clinton's private email server. The AP first reported on the Tuskeegee Experiment, and the next day the Times carried it on its front page.

       Not sure. The worst thing is if you actually started banning these users you'd get an outcry from other neoliberals declaring this sub has become an alt-right bastion or some bullshit, while buying up other old reddit accounts to just continue the spam bot vote manipulation anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you can really do is constantly remind them what this sub is here for, and point out their retarded arguments and talking points for what they are. They aren't particularly subtle in their manipulation. My concern is that they're going to eventually learn to get better at it.

       <p>
        Federal prosecutors concluded an 18-month investigation into a former congressional technology staffer on Tuesday by publicly debunking allegations — promoted by conservative media and President Trump — suggesting he was a Pakistani operative who stole government secrets with cover from House Democrats.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Imran Awan pleaded guilty to a relatively minor offense unrelated to his work on Capitol Hill: making a false statement on a bank loan application. U.S. prosecutors said they would not recommend jail time.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the agreement included an unusual passage that described the scope of the investigation and cleared Awan of a litany of conspiracy theories promulgated on Internet blogs, picked up by right-leaning news sites, and fanned by President Trump on Twitter.

       Who cares?  It is possible that you can oversee a sensitive and potentially damaging case involving your sister's employee in a fair and balanced manner.  But it looks so fucking bad that no intelligent person would ever believe the case was handled fairly and honestly, which is why recusals are a thing.   Your comment is absolutely pointless.

       He was overseeing the case, so it doesn't matter if there is no evidence of him interfering.  The base assumption is that he did.  Imagine trump jr overseeing the investigation of Flynn.  Do you see the problem?  Even if he handled it perfectly, it doesn't matter.  There is no good way to spin it.

       SOURCES: WASSERMAN SCHULTZ SCREAMED AT HOUSE OFFICIALS TO KILL HACKING PROBE, INTERVENED IN PAKISTANI CRIMINAL MATTER
1:05 AM 06/05/2018
Luke Rosiak | Investigative Reporter
 9888

      </p>
      <p>
       Ex-Democratic National Committee head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she intervened in a Pakistani land deal involving her then–IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees. The dispute came after Awan’s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when a House Office of Inspector General cybersecurity investigation found that Awan made “unauthorized access” to House servers, including the House Democratic Caucus’ shortly before the election, Wasserman Schultz became “frantic, not normal,” “making the rounds” to House officials in an attempt to kill the investigation, one House employee told The Daily Caller News Foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Awan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter, Leza — a Jewish name — and that the Florida congresswoman’s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility, sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasserman Schultz cornered House Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko and called him a “fucking Islamophobe,” saying “you will not so much as take away their parking spots,” the two House employees said Kiko told them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan’s whole family to her daughter’s bat mitzvah and said she had “helped him with a land deal,” the sources said. A spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story.
      </p>
      <p>
       A 2009 article in the Pakistani publication Dawn, headlined “Influential expat shields father from long arm of law,” said Awan’s father was facing criminal fraud charges involving a land deal, but Awan used political connections to pressure the police into targeting the alleged victims instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Awan’s father purchased “huge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,” but all the checks bounced, the report said. “The police high-ups are ‘ominously’ indifferent to proceed against Awan,” and it’s “noteworthy” how they were “complying with the desires of” Awan, who the paper described as a “White House employee.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “About a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings — all aged between 57 and 70 — have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is the father of White House employee Shahid Imran,” Dawn reported. Imran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with “frivolous” cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Mohammad Abid, a victim of [Ashraf] Awan’s alleged high-profile swindling, said that [Ashraf] Awan’s son had easy access to the corridors of power and that’s why he was able to [pressure] the police to dance to his tunes,” Dawn reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article details a series of people who say they were then subject to retaliation, including widow Bushra Bibi who said, “now Imran was threatening her with dire consequences.”
      </p>
      <p>
       A third source, who’s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened. A fourth source — a fellow House IT aide — previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that “Imran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Ashraf Awan’s business partner in the land deal, Rashid Minhas, told TheDCNF that the elder Awan gave a USB to a Pakistani senator who is a former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency, and that Imran claimed his IT position in Congress gave him the power to “change the U.S. president.” Minhas is in prison for an unrelated fraud charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       On July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family. Awan, his wife, two brothers, his brother’s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz’s Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
       The finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       In February 2017, Kiko and the House’s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network. The letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on “websites” and “printers,” which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.
      </p>
      <p>
       The congresswoman also added Awan’s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network. Wasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 — 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her actions so rattled the Administration Committee’s Democratic staff director, Jamie Fleet, that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz, his fellow Democrat, was continuing to pay the suspect, two House sources said. The story also said Wasserman Schultz had a “friendly personal relationship” with Awan and Alvi.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fleet did not respond to a request for comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kiko said in an April 2018 hearing spurred by the scandal that he was powerless to stop members who refused to fire a bad actor. (RELATED: Hearing Reveals Congress Provided ‘No Supervision’ Of IT Aides, Missed Red Flags, But Members Block Proposed Reforms)
      </p>
      <p>
       “Termination, now it’s the member’s responsibility … We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,” he said. He added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule-breaker on the government network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said. House investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement,  “my office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.” (RELATED: Own Wife Turns, Accuses Him Of Fraud, Violent Threats)
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasserman Schultz was defending someone investigators allegedly told her was suspected of cybersecurity violations, despite having resigned from her position as DNC head following a devastating hack during the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite Wasserman Schultz’s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 — two months after he was banned from the computer network — the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk. Capitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan’s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said “attorney-client privilege,” according to a police report. Awan’s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with “consequences” for not returning the laptop. When he refused, she mulled attempting to restructure the Capitol Police’s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       House sources told TheDCNF these exchanges were only a public glimpse into numerous such interactions, which were frequently profane, with every official she could buttonhole. One source said she also went to the Department of Justice and “made a stink.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasserman Schultz hired the House’s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard — who had recently quit the House — to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported. Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami — one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton. Wasserman Schultz’ district includes much of Miami.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of Awan’s lawyers told a judge he felt “very strongly” that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument. Prosecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.
      </p>
      <p>
       In August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January. Prosecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret. Capitol Police “requested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn’t want to tip off the employees,” she said.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wasserman Schultz’s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it.
       </p>

       So you can't find anything saying he has no involvement with the case?  Me neither!

       I dont have to prove a negative, that's not how this works. There is no credible source saying he oversaw the case, AND I provided you a far right wing source that says he works in the same office (but no mention of overseeing the case...cause he didnt).

       Believe whatever unfounded nonsense you want, but it's just that. Entirely unfounded and without merit.
