        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: During the 1990s, the World Wrestling Federation faced multiple sex scandals that involved both pedophilia and the sexual coercion of adult male talent by management. The owner, Vince McMahon&#39;s, right-hand man, Pat Patterson, who has since come out as homosexual, as well as Pat Patterson&#39;s booking assistant Terry Garvin, were both among the accused, as well as ring announcer. Pat Patterson remained a major insider in the WWF for decades after this occurred. Garvin and the announcer both permanently resigned. </p>

<p>Here is a link to the Donahue episode where most of the scandal came out:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump definitely has historic ties to WWE, but Hillary Clinton and Obama were both featured on it once as well, to be fair. I honestly believe that politics and wrestling are much more similar than most people could ever possibly believe. I&#39;m not convinced that the entire election in 2016, and the political divide that has since emerged in this nation, wasn&#39;t staged by Trump, Clinton, and the rest of TPTB from the get-go. 10 years ago, Trump was a limousine liberal, Barak Obama was a progressive, Hillary Clinton was unlikable and unelectable, and George W Bush was the most inept POTUS one could possibly imagine. I can only qualify one of those as being the case without question today. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you can tell that I don&#39;t often participate in ANY of the P-Gate or sexual assault or MeToo threads, but I don&#39;t find that these threads are researched fairly across the political spectrum. I do read the threads and can tell you that in my experience way more time is spent gathering &#39;evidence&#39; for targets that lean left versus targets that lean right. </p>

<p>Just my opinion. I was offering my thoughts on the topic posted and one reason I think the topic isn&#39;t researched as heavily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that evidence of a bunch of Democrats being pedophiles and rapists emerged at around the same time from completely different sources doesn&#39;t prove it was politically motivated. Not that it would even matter if it were politically motivated, because pedophiles and rapists all belong in jail.</p>

<p>Go ahead. I don&#39;t imagine you&#39;ll go into the details, though, because Trump allegedly went with Epstein one time and kicked him out of Mar a Lago. The Clintons went dozens of times to pedophile island.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t find you making any threads about Republican pedophiles and rapists. Either you&#39;re lazy and wanting us to do the research for you, or you&#39;re trying to divide this so we can be filed back into the false left-right political paradigm without anything changing.</p>

<p>Do you think the same level of attention was paid to other accusations? I can&#39;t go into details because I am not the one conducting the research. Just reading threads and observing that again, in my opinion, the research is skewed towards one side.</p>

<p>Or, I&#39;m just a casual reader of conspiracies and I&#39;m offering my observations on the topic at hand. If offering my opinions and observations seems divisive to you, I can&#39;t help that. I try to approach these conversations with an open mind and a middle-of-the-road mindset. I will note that since the start of this thread you have implied that I am paid, lazy, and divisive while I have not once commented on you&#39;re behavior, post history or political leanings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>P-gate researchers are overwhelmingly disgusted by the Democrats. Some are also disgusted by the GOP. If more people who were disgusted with both parties became P-gate researchers, then naturally, there would be less of a disparity, methinks. In other words, there&#39;s a bias, but I think its because both sides trust their own side too much, and care more about preserving their own fictitious world view than they do about getting to the truth. But it&#39;s really only natural, also, since most of the people who read the Podesta leaks and the Clinton emails were people who inevitably wouldn&#39;t support Clinton in the election. Rather than looking at this scandal as a means of pointing fingers across an imaginary aisle, we should use it as a means of enlisting more diverse support to the cause of taking down the cabal, no matter who they claim to vote for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Savage-Stephanie rumor has always seemed weaker than most to me. Vince being a deviant though, I&#39;d be surprised if it wasn&#39;t the case. </p>

<p>Even if it all was on the up and up, as the owner of a Wrestling company and at one time a bodybuilding federation as well, he&#39;s only a couple degrees away from being a legal pimp with a large stable of hard-bodied, mostly naked men. It&#39;s certainly the best example in society of the sale, fetishization, and objectification of the male physique, and its target audience is primarily pre-teens and teenage boys. It&#39;s a weird industry to want to control, and I&#39;m sure it attracted all kinds of crazies. </p>

<p>I found it somewhat troubling/amusing/ironic while reading Pat Patterson wikipedia page that he&#39;d initially hoped to become a Catholic priest when he was growing up. LOL. That was what caused me to post this actually, because I started thinking about it in terms of a profession that a child predator might try to exploit; and as one where a group of child predators could infiltrate and exert a great deal of influence given enough time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sunny ruined Chris Candido tho... She was banging both Michaels and The British Bulldog during their marriage, and even after it was over he was under the impression that she was faithful while they were married, just flirtatious.</p>

<p>If you mean that they exploited her as a sexual object on camera while failing to utilize her exceptional charisma and talent as a performer, then yeah they did that to her. The objectification of the human body is an inherent aspect of the business, and plenty of talent is utilized poorly by the &quot;creative&quot; department, though. If you want to talk about a woman that was ruined by the actual behind the scenes going ons, I&#39;d look to Chyna. She basically got pushed into a kind of side show attraction pornography. She was pushed into doing Playboy by Vince. HHH left her for McMahon&#39;s daughter, which got her fired and alienated her from all her friends because siding with her would hurt their careers, then she fell into the arms of wrestler who was a violent drug addict that videotaped her having sex with him, she did playboy again because she had no other way to earn income since she was blacklisted, and then her boyfriend sold the sex tape without her permission making her an unwilling porn star, which killed what little value she brought as a TV or movie personality, forcing her to do more porn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check out the video of Roddy Piper pretty much saying he was molested by Pat Paterson. Plus Shawn Michaels was Vince McMahon boy toy. Wrestling as has a history of drug trafficking and I wouldnt be surprised if some of the boys were mob inforcers if not out right hitmen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the Piper vid, and he was arguably the third most famous wrestler during the height of his WWF run, behind only Hogan and Andre, based on his movie credits alone. If they could do it to him, then it could be done to all of them. </p>

<p>As to HBK, something made him act like a crazed diva behind the scenes. I think it&#39;s plausible because he got some huge pushes from management and seems like he&#39;d be a target as a somewhat smaller and highly sexualized wrestler, but also, he was my favorite performer to watch during the mid 90s, so I hope that one&#39;s not true. </p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p>Not that it would even matter if it were politically motivated, because pedophiles and rapists all belong in jail.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t imagine you&#39;ll go into the details</p>

<p>Do you think the same level of attention was paid to other accusations? I can&#39;t go into details because I am not the one conducting the research. Just reading threads and observing that again, in my opinion, the research is skewed towards one side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t find you making any threads about Republican pedophiles and rapists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I know. I stated that in the last comment. </p>

<p>Either you&#39;re lazy and wanting us to do the research for you, or you&#39;re trying to divide this so we can be filed back into the false left-right political paradigm without anything changing.</p>

<p>Or, I&#39;m just a casual reader of conspiracies and I&#39;m offering my observations on the topic at hand. If offering my opinions and observations seems divisive to you, I can&#39;t help that. I try to approach these conversations with an open mind and a middle-of-the-road mindset. I will note that since the start of this thread you have implied that I am paid, lazy, and divisive while I have not once commented on you&#39;re behavior, post history or political leanings. </p>
