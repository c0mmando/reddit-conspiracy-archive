<p>Vaccines cannot be simultaneously safe and unsafe. Yet, by mincing terms, spinning propaganda and misinterpreting and manipulating scientific research to whitewash vaccine’s life-threatening risks, this is what the government pressures parents to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unavoidably unsafe means that in the opinion of the SCotUS, vaccines are unsafe, BUT, the dangers are outweighed by the overall benefits to society.  </p>

<p>Regardless, there needs to be, at minimum, transparency and independent double-blind studies on every aspect of every vaccine, starting with avoidable dangers (like using preservatives that cause harm, like RFK Jr. talks about).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>SCOTUS made a conclusion about how to treat vaccines <strong>as a legal matter</strong>, and it has nothing to do with whether or not vaccines are safe, effective, or desirable.  Instead, SCOTUS was tasked with <em>parsing the language in a statute passed by Congress</em>.  Congress made policy choices, and SCOTUS upheld those choices.  </p>

<p>Products liability law (which is relatively new in the legal world, which moves slowly) typically imposes strict liability for product manufacturers on three potential bases: 1) design defect, 2) warning defect, and 3) manufacturing defect.  The categories are pretty self-evident.  Strict liability means that the manufacturer is responsible for injuries regardless of intent; that is, the claimant need not show intent to harm or negligence.  </p>

<p>Understand that products liability law was a policy decision made by courts and legislatures to hold manufacturers accountable for the injuries that they cause, and it removes the intent (or negligence) requirement typically imposed on civil tort claims.  Part of that policy choice, as it has been developed over the years, was to lessen the impact of strict liability law on certain types of products that have risk but whose risk is far outweighed by the benefit the product gives to society - guns, most medications, medical equipment, bleach, draino, knives, most cleaning compounds, certain cosmetic items, etc... These are &quot;unavoidably unsafe products,&quot; which is a legal term of art.  There is inherent risk in their intended use; no one claims vaccines are 100% risk-free.  Vaccine manufacturers are shielded from design defect claims (as are most &quot;unavoidably unsafe products&quot;), but not claims related to faulty manufacturing or failure to warn.  And injury claimants can get compensation (including attorneys&#39; fees in almost all cases) for developing any of the listed side-effects.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pilot Vaccinated Vs Unvaccinated study finds that vaccines are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and chronic illness.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U-S-children.php#Article">http://www.oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U-S-children.php#Article</a></p>

<p>&quot;the apparent “dose-response” relationship between vaccination status and several forms of chronic illness, and the significant association between vaccination and NDDs all support the possibility that some aspect of the current vaccination program could be contributing to risks of childhood morbidity. Vaccination also remained significantly associated with NDD after controlling for other factors, whereas preterm birth, long considered a major risk factor for NDD, was not associated with NDD after controlling for the interaction between preterm birth and vaccination. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>great dense post.  there&#39;s a lot to read there.  </p>

<p>the first link post which enumerates the court&#39;s position is very educational.  first you&#39;ll note that the family that pursued this case had to do it on various levels.  they had to be very persistent.  this tells you how ineffective the courts are and how difficult it is to change an inherent bigotry in the courts.    </p>

<p>secondly the courts changed how their bigotry would be packaged in this case. &quot;although products-liability law establishes three grounds for liability - defective manufacture, inadequate directions or warnings, and defective design - the Act mentions only manufacture and warnings.  It thus seems that the Act&#39;s failure to mention design-defect liability is &quot;by deliberate choice not inadvertance&quot; &quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll note that when I tried to copy past that block of text it came out in a format that was all fucked up and would not be indexed by a search engine in the visual format one would expect.  </p>

<p>&quot;althoug
h
 pr
oduc
ts-lia&quot;</p>

<p>anyway, moving along from that interesting sidetrack.  the reason the design can&#39;t be included as it typically would in the criteria, is that the design is inherently flawed.  it&#39;s basic combinatorics.  the human body is a complex machine.  if you introduce a single new behaviour into a complex machine that has N processes you will have a lower bound of (N+1) edge conditions you&#39;d have to vet.  in the human body, N is in the thousands.  so vetting side-effects is not something that can be easily done.  it&#39;s akin to a software testing problem.</p>

<p>i&#39;d also note that design defects aren&#39;t the only way that Bad Vax has been seen in the wild.  there have been incidents where the vax has been adulterated.  in one of these incidents, the bad vax was only caught by ad-hoc QA done by the lab that received the shots for distribution!  the QA had utterly failed up to that point.  in effect it was absent.  craziness eh.</p>

<p>know that your gov won&#39;t save you from this shitty state of affairs. it has failed to both accurately articulate the issues with vax.  and it has failed to prevent others from pushing it as a panacea.  and it has failed to protect the basic rights of citizens by making vax mandatory in places instead of a consumer choice.</p>

<p>so the next time you hear some talking head fuckwit on the tv shaming others into vax, know that it&#39;s just part of a larger agenda by people who are not honest about the subject matter.  i suggest others learn the smells of this rhetoric so they can learn discernment about which actors tend to do these things.  </p>

<p>finally one last thing.  when you have a tech like vax whose side effects can&#39;t easily be tested - in other words when you have a tech that has combinatorics problems - there will be groups who are compatible and groups who are not.  finding out which groups are compatible with the standard vax schedule would be a great way to identify a smoking gun.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally feel that with all the issues surrounding vaccines, there should be a nationwide push to research the underlying diseases better so that they can be cured or avoided altogether by the acquisition of knowledge.</p>

<p>The reason this isn&#39;t happening is because we live in a klepto-plutocracy.  I don&#39;t care what country you live in, you are being robbed and manipulated by the plutocrats of the Western world.  It is far more profitable to treat symptoms, and even give unsafe vaccines, because then you can sell medications to treat the side-effects.</p>

<p>Given what we have, what our real options are, I&#39;d rather people did vaccinate, because the risk to society is actually greater by not vaccinating.  But that is only acceptable if the people are going to demand we do something about finding real cures.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some doctors claim they had good results with altering the schedule, giving vaccines later and were able to avoid a lot of harm doing it that way.</p>

<p>As for the risk of non-vaccinating being greater. I think we have no clue what the real long-term risks are.</p>

<p>Autism affects 1 in 30 now and very often leads to premature death. That are over 100000 children each year and many will die prematurely sooner or later...</p>

<p>In 1965 we had controlled most of the infectious disease risk with just 5 vaccine doses. Today we have over 70 vaccine doses. Makes you wonder what the additional 65 doses really is.</p>

<p>unfortunately america is a liberal country by its design.  it gives people choice.  it doesn&#39;t have a priesthood class be the deciders of individual choices.  that&#39;s how it was designed.  and it&#39;s people like yourself who are declaring themselves heroes who know better than everyone else, who seem to have forgotten that. </p>

<p>i&#39;m talking about the constitution and the principles upon which the country was founded.  it encodes free choice.  that&#39;s what made it different.  and yes, there have been abuses of power, sure.  but you have to start somewhere.  and that somewhere is in the encoding of agreed upon rules.  if freedom, as a principle, doesn&#39;t exist in America, then America no longer exists.  take it or leave it.</p>

<p>What has changed about vaccines?  Im old and I do not recall the same vaccine related problems being discussed back in the 70s or 80s.  Do you know what is put in the vaccines has changed?</p>

<p>Maybe they used to be less dangerous but have become more dangerous due to what is being put in them now that was not put in them early on?</p>

<p>I appreciate your response.</p>

<p>Good question. Probably but I do not know any details and if there is a new ingredient that could cause problems.</p>

<p>The amount of vaccines correlates to the problems associated with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>“Unavoidably unsafe products. There are some products which, in the present state of human knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended and ordinary use. These are especially common in the field of drugs. An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected. Since the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree of risk which they involve. Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and warning, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very reason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the prescription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or perhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.”</p>

<p>Much ado about nothing. What were you saying about &quot;mincing terms, spinning propaganda and misinterpreting and manipulating scientific research&quot; again?</p>

<p>If we apply that same logic to other ailments.....</p>

<p>Since chicken pox almost never leads to death, the possible side effects are not justified.</p>
