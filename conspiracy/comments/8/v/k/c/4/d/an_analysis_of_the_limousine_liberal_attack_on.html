        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a conspiracy I want to share with you all.  At a minimum, it&#39;s an interesting case study on the anatomy of a political smear and how it propagates.  I am going to attempt to provide detailed evidence to show that:</p>

<ul>
<li>There appears to have been a coordinated effort over the last three days to smear Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being a &quot;limousine liberal&quot;.</li>
<li>The smear originates with Breitbart.com.  It is not a secret that Breitbart has deep ties to the White House.</li>
<li>The effort to spread it on reddit looks very much like the tactics used by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43093390">Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA)</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Yesterday morning, I saw a rising post on r/libertarian about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/8vaxq8/all_hail_the_limousine_liberal/">&quot;All Hail the Limousine Liberal&quot;</a>.  WARNING:  It&#39;s a cancerous thread.</p>

<p>Especially early on in the thread, there were 10x more trolls than normal for r/libertarian.  That sub is totally unmoderated, and trolls, especially alt-right ones, are no new thing, but usually in the minority.  The Ocasio-Cortez attack had an entirely different and Orwellian feel to me.  I got sucked into a frustrating semantic debate with one individual over the factual claims in the meme.</p>

<p>The post slams Ocasio-Cortez for claiming to be from the Bronx, while spending her formative years in &quot;Yorktown heights, one of the wealthiest enclaves in the country - complete with 2 golf courses.&quot;  When I went to look for information about Yorktown Heights (I just wanted to see if it was actually &quot;a wealthy enclave&quot;), it got really weird.</p>

<p><em>Someone had editted the wikipedia article on Yorktown Heights.</em>  Anonymous users had added an important new section, <strong>Golf Courses</strong>, noting, that there are two.  It&#39;s a weirdly specific add in an otherwise minimal article.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more, a wikipedian had added a link back to a <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-06-29/girl-bronx-ocasio-cortez-called-out-fact-check-actually-grew-wealthy-enclave">regurgitation of the smear</a> on an Alt-Right site ZeroHedge.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yorktown_Heights%2C_New_York&amp;amp;type=revision&amp;amp;diff=848323961&amp;amp;oldid=8428411">You can see the wikipedia revisions from over the weekend here.</a></p>

<p>I thought that was a little interesting and hilarious, so I spent some time looking for more information.</p>

<h1>Origin of the Smear</h1>

<p>Based on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?biw=1311&amp;amp;bih=895&amp;amp;tbs=qdr%3Aw&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;ei=ks85W7fhIYeB5wKVwar4AQ&amp;amp;q=%27girl+from+the+bronx%27+alexandria+ocasio-cortez&amp;amp;oq=%27girl+from+the+bronx%27+alexandria+ocasio-cortez&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...3857.19792.0.19904.56.49.6.0.0.0.128.3130.47j2.49.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.19.1120...0j0i13k1j0i10k1.0.C8PSbkrThKk">Google News results</a>, the smear first shows up on June 29th in <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/06/29/fact-check-girl-from-the-bronx-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-grew-up-in-one-of-richest-u-s-counties/">an article on Breitbart.com about &quot;The Girl from the Bronx</a>.  The <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5905247/Girl-Bronx-Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-actually-grew-wealthy-Westchester-County.html">Daily Mail drops it</a> the next day, June 30th.  A bunch of other alt-right (Newsmax, the Blaze, ZeroHedge) and blog spam sites follow.</p>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/395090-ocasio-cortez-shreds-conservative-commentator-for-sharing-picture-of-her">The Hill covers the controversy yesterday</a> including Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s response on Twitter.</p>

<h1>The Trump Connection</h1>

<p>It won&#39;t be news to anyone here, but Breitbart has strong connections to Trump.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon">Steve Bannon</a>, who served Trump&#39;s as Chief Strategist during the election and in the White House, was a founding member at Breitbart, and also served as CEO before and after his White House tenure.  Breitbart is currently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekah_Mercer">owned by Rebekah Mercer</a>.  Mercer is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/01/05/rebekah-mercer-the-billionaire-backer-of-bannon-and-trump-chooses-sides/?utm_term=.f862f49051b0">a top Trump donor and confidant.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ll acknowledge, none of this is terrifically remarkable or even news.  This is hardly the first Brietbart smear.  There&#39;s no direct evidence the White House had any connection to the smear, and even if they did, the Trump white house wouldn&#39;t be the first to dictate a political attack to favorable media.  People are probably sick of hearing the about the Bannon-Trump-Mercer boogeyman.  It also is possible that the originator of the smear is Joshua Caplan, the author of the Breitbart article, and the whole thing is perfectly organic.</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s more to it.</p>

<h1>Social Media</h1>

<p>The twitter discussion is predictably vitriolic. <a href="https://twitter.com/johncardillo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1013510482433626113&amp;amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fcampaign%2F395090-ocasio-cortez-shreds-conservative-commentator-for-sharing-picture-of-her">Newsmax&#39;s Cardillo seems to lead the charge there and his comments get a ton of a traction.</a> He concedes only that she did indeed go to BU, and dies on the semantic hill of &quot;you&#39;re not from the Bronx because you moved when you were five.&quot;</p>

<p>In addition to well known alt-right journalists like Cardillo, there&#39;s the usual army of trolls tweeting obnoxious shit directly at Ocasio-Cortez, <a href="https://twitter.com/Oil_Guns_Merica/status/1013508807689949186">like this one</a>.  I have no indication they are Russian spammers, and I&#39;m not a Twitter user so I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d tell.</p>

<p>&quot;Limousine Liberal/Bronx Girl&quot; is also <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:4chan.org+%22limousine+liberal%22+alexandria+ocasio-cortez&amp;amp;biw=1227&amp;amp;bih=899&amp;amp;tbs=qdr:w&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=iu&amp;amp;ictx=1&amp;amp;fir=NXz6u3p2QQz1vM%253A%252CZo91rpCJnQofoM%252C_&amp;amp;usg=__Zlrv_K_pyKHnvlky_jn_EPuJWTg%3D&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwioqNG6h4DcAhWDtVkKHUPaCk8Q9QEIKzAB#imgrc=NXz6u3p2QQz1vM:">pumped heavily on darker corners of the internet like /pol/</a></p>

<p>On Reddit, the smear gets gets a lot of airtime at The_Donald <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8uwku2/fact_check_girl_from_the_bronx_alexandria/">on this thread, +3.1k</a>.  r/Conservative <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/8uytd6/girl_from_the_bronx_ocasiocortez_called_out_in/">discusses it here, +357</a>  The r/Libertarian [thread is here, +32]().  It gets posted in quite a few other places where it gets no traction, such as r/worldpolitics, where it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/8ux0tb/fact_check_girl_from_the_bronx_alexandria/">sunk to zero</a>.  It also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/8vaxx6/all_hail_the_limousine_liberal/">sinks to zero</a> on <a href="/r/WayOfTheBern">/r/WayOfTheBern</a>.</p>

<h1>Russian Trolls on Reddit</h1>

<p>In response to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/16/17020974/mueller-indictment-internet-research-agency">Mueller&#39;s indictment of Russia troll farm &quot;Internet Research Agency&quot; in St. Petersberg</a>, reddit announced three months ago that reddit had seen <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/">&quot;direct propaganda&quot;</a> from the IRA.  Admins reported two months ago that they had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/">subsequently have banned</a> 944 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts">suspicious accounts</a> linked to the IRA.</p>

<p>The 944 banned accounts have lots in common with the three perpetrators of the Ocasio-Cortez meme on Reddit:</p>

<ul>
<li>High volume posting for hours and days on end.</li>
<li>Very low participation/comments, even in their own threads.</li>
<li>Posts are 98% consistent with the IRA strategy of inflaming and dividing.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ultimaregem">ultimaregem</a> is egregiously busy posting dozens of articles an hour every day in 8-10 hour blocks.  That account is so busy with submissions, it&#39;s lucky if it makes 10 comments for every post.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aldebaran333">Aldebaran333</a> appears to be an inhuman machine.  That account is making dozens of submissions per hour, often times 24 hours a day, and has been doing so for days on end.  If there&#39;s a single human there, someone needs to pry them off the computer immediately before they die of addiction to reddit.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aldebaran333">Aldebaran333</a> dates back to July 2016.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/brotherbear12345">brotherbear12345</a>, in his brief time on Reddit since April, and has a different posting strategy.  That account posts almost exclusively to T_D, at lower volume than the others.  BrotherBear has a knack for hitting home runs.  Yet in hundreds and hundreds of submissions with thousands of karma each, Brotherbear hasn&#39;t participated in the discussion at all.  They&#39;ve made only a single comment: &quot;There&#39;s No Such Thing As A Law-Abiding &quot;ILLEGAL ALIEN&quot;, posted yesterday.</p>

<p>It appears that just about all of the discussion of the topic of &quot;Bronx Girl&quot; on reddit was prompted by Russian trolls.</p>

<p>Having said all of that, there&#39;s less nefarious explanations for the activity from these three accounts, I&#39;m sure.  And absolutely, my analysis and evidence doesn&#39;t prove they&#39;re trolls from Russia.  The best I think one could do without access to more data is show a pattern.  I think the patter is clear enough to warrant a closer look, maybe even from the admins.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>You can imagine Ocasio-Cortez reveling in the aftermath of her surprise victory last week.  She&#39;s already seen some backlash, and she&#39;s prepared for more, I would presume.  But unbeknownst to her, there&#39;s a dark tidal wave forming in the alt-right media, on reddit, twitter and 4chan.  By Sunday, the whole thing crashes on top of her when she&#39;s forced to respond to people tweeting pictures of her home.  Imagine too, that a week ago, few had heard of her.  A wild ride, I&#39;m sure. </p>

<p>I hope at least, the whole thing is maybe case study on how political attacks are spread. I&#39;ll acknowledge again, there&#39;s no direct link to the White House.  And I haven&#39;t at all proven the posts on reddit are coming from Russia.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I&#39;ll speculate somewhat irresonsponsibly on a conspiracy.  </p>

<p><em>It&#39;s possible this whole thing starts with communications from the White House, or someone close.</em>  An order goes out to Breitbart - &quot;this is the story we&#39;re going with today, write it.&quot;  That&#39;s a &quot;talking point&quot; and not unprecedented in US politics.  </p>

<p><em>The second communication is to someone in Russia and is treasonous.</em>  &quot;Put your team on pumping this story up, comrade.&quot;  It becomes a tremendous hit, which is a huuuuge win for the White House.  In one fell swoop, they&#39;ve fired up the base about a new boogeyman, demonized an up-and-comer in the opposition party, and also completely distracted people from the relentlessly negative news that surround the White House.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same partnership with Russian intel that got Trump to the White House, and it keeps working.  And not just on this smear.  Just look at those post histories for the trolls I mentioned!  There&#39;s dozens of specious claims like this each week, and plenty that catch on.  Even as the Mueller investigation rages, the Russian government is still hard at work on Trump&#39;s behalf.  Is that implausible?</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s too ambitious of a claim given the limited evidence.  Nonetheless it&#39;s fascinating to dive deep on how these smears spread.  What do you all think?</p>

<p>Definitely the left plants attacks in favorable publications.  I acknowledged as much.</p>

<p>The difference is the trolls.  Russian or not, they&#39;re organized, and seem to work in concert with the pro-Trump media.  </p>

<p>If the left is doing the same thing, show us!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google &quot;Trump Pee Tape&quot; and you&#39;ll see the exact same kind of organization. </p>

<p>And, I&#39;m not saying that there isn&#39;t a conspiracy to create liberal and conservative echo chambers. I just know that it has little to do with Russia, because the entire Trump-Russia narrative was a blatant propaganda blast from the &quot;left&#39;s&quot; echo chamber to provide Clinton and Obama with cover for all the shit they did to Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump during the election. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and seem to work in concert with the pro-Trump media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now there is some organization and some, shall we say, inconsistencies in the right wing echo chamber. Newsweek, International Business Times, the Washington Times are all tied to South Korean super-wealthy cult leaders. </p>

<p>Breitbart through Bannon has deep ties with the Jesuits. </p>

<p>So why are all these right wing media outlets affiliated with so many religious groups? That&#39;s the real conspiracy. And it all has to do with how the two parties launder money differently. The right uses religious institutions and the left uses &quot;foundations&quot;, 503s, and 527s. Which is why Chelsea Clinton is an exec for the Daily Beast and why David Jang owns Newsweek. </p>

<p>The Russian Troll Farm was a joke. They primarily targeted black voters. Just take a look at the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=accounts+banned+from+reddit+russain+troll&amp;amp;atb=v38-7aq&amp;amp;ia=web">accounts</a> (and notice the cut and paste journalism on the subject matter as well) that were banned from reddit for being Russian trolls. 9 out of 10 of them only posted in african american subreddits. It&#39;s not the right wing that they were trying to manipulate. they were infiltrating the left&#39;s echo chamber in an attempt to subvert their messaging. </p>

<p>I think just because they did it before.  One of the accounts I posted has been around since July 2016, so this isn&#39;t likely a completely brand new effort.  </p>

<p>The incentive sowing distrust to destabilize American politics seems suitable enough for me.  There are plenty of other possibilities.</p>

Russia is only a thing right now because they&#39;re a convenient boogeyman. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is thorn in the side of DC insiders, but she&#39;s not even on the radar of the world stage.</p>

<p>The Russians would love this crazy little socialist girl.</p>

<p>Her policy positions are plenty of fodder for people to ridicule her. She&#39;s clearly not thinking certain things through and will get destroyed in any kind of real debate.</p>

<p>If media and journalism(however partisan) is digging up on her it&#39;s only because she&#39;s being completely shoved in everyone&#39;s face as the leader of the DNC. </p>

<p>Trust, Trump doesn&#39;t &quot;fear&quot; this girl in the slightest. If anything, <em>pushing</em> her popularity will do great things for his brand of politics and for the positions of his supporters. They would be stupid <em>not</em> to promote her. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mostly agree with you on &quot;claiming&quot; the Bronx.  She can play that up a little.  It don&#39;t think it&#39;s at all like Breitbart et al plays it out, some conspiracy to hide her true identity as a super wealthy prep school kid. She had a pretty middle class upbringing, and definitely did not live in a &quot;wealth enclave with golf courses&quot;.</p>

<p>Having said that, I think the way attack is propagated is much more interesting than the actual claim and even how accurate it is. Fundamentally, I think it&#39;s pretty trivial - the arguments over &quot;she said she&#39;s from the Bronx&quot; are semantic and not that important.  </p>

<p>The fascinating part is who and how the smear gets propagated.  On reddit, that was done exclusively by questionable accounts that appear to be Russian trolls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok let&#39;s drop that line. I&#39;ve had this argument a million times. Conservatives don&#39;t like anything associated with the right to be alt-right because they like to see the alt right as extremist bigots and thus not them. Would you agree that the site is extremely right wing? Do you think they focus on right wing issues younger folks care about or the ones older ones do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a conservative.  I&#39;m a total fucking pinko, and in the past year I&#39;ve been accused of being alt-right and a trump supporter by just about every establishment democrat I&#39;ve met. Not more then five years ago zerohedge was up near the front of the occupy movement and the Wikileaks drops.  Zerohedge is not right wing by any stretch of the imagination.  Just because it doesn&#39;t lean all the way to <em>your</em> fruity, chicken shit, peezus version of what the left is doesn&#39;t make it Klan rally, nazi kind of bullshit.</p>

<p>In other words, the community hates this post and almost universally downvoted it, but the vote bots are keeping it afloat. As they are also trying to hide your and all other comments disagreeing at -4, where they can&#39;t be seen without a click.</p>

<p><em>Lots</em> of vote bots pushing literal CIA propaganda (muh Russian interference!) today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll agree that my observations on reactions to this candidate&#39;s coverage is quite varied.  The left absolutely loves her.  People on Pro Trump subs and such have an almost illogical animus towards her, with no real reasoning.<br/>
I will go ahead and just say that I&#39;m skeptical of both.  She&#39;s obviously someone very well connected, or someone very powerful has taken her under their wing.<br/>
I suspect this might have happened before her upset victory even, but definitely at least after her win.  This is only a feeling.<br/>
Personally, looking at her issues, I don&#39;t disagree with a lot of them, at least not enough to dislike her based on her views alone.<br/>
Although she did wear the same dress the day after her win as well as on Conan, but it might have been the same day.  So this is a check in the &quot;not an evil swamp creature&quot; column as well, but I&#39;ll be watching
I guess in all my rambling, I haven&#39;t come really to any position on her, other than good for her.  </p>

<p>As for the Trump connection, it appeared as though Trump was delighted that Crowley had lost at least:<br/>
&quot;Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi’s place, just LOST his primary election. In other words, he’s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!&quot;<br/>
Of course, in typical Trump fashion, he made it about himself, but still, other than being staunchly against a couple of things she is for, I don&#39;t see any hostility there from Trump&#39;s camp.  I will say that I have been out of the news cycle for a couple days, not sure if Trump&#39;s even mentioned her?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, she knocked out a ten term New York Dem swamp monster that had his eye on the Speaker seat and the President thought it was hilarious. I&#39;m pretty sure the smear campaign is coming from those that want to maintain the swamp and are pissed that their career politician crony got ousted. And they are being stupid about it. She may have embellished her &quot;poor girl from the Bronx story&quot; but she obviously had a middle class upbringing in a modest home with normal working parents. I don&#39;t care for her politics, and I disagree with her dishonesty but I think this is manufactured outrage from the political establishment that fears the change that is coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than likely I think she&#39;s a plant who if anything was boosted initially by the Russians or others to help win her district and dethrone the third longest tenured Democrat.

<p>They needed her to win the battle, to eventually lose the war. Since her victory in the primary, the left has been tearing themselves apart much like the right was tearing themselves apart during the 2016 elections. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the real problem with your analysis: you believe that posting a lot in a particular sub makes someone a russian troll because you don&#39;t like those particular subs. the black lives matter sub was the subreddit most frequently used by russian trolls according to cbs news and reddit admins. So your argument makes literally zero sense. There are people on every subreddit that post too much content, most of which you won&#39;t agree with. That doesn&#39;t even come close to qualifying it as evidence of russian troll farming. </p>

<p>Why do you think Russia is involved here?</p>

<p>I think just because they did it before.  One of the accounts I posted has been around since July 2016, so this isn&#39;t likely a completely brand new effort.  </p>

<p>The incentive sowing distrust to destabilize American politics seems suitable enough for me.  There are plenty of other possibilities.</p>
