<p>Is the true history (not saying there is one) of the site being covered up intentionally(not just narrow minded studies) and if so why?</p>

<p>Does this site predate the Indus Valley as it is said to predate the Sumerians?</p>

<p>Any suggested books or studies?</p>

<p>Forgive me if these are already found here, I just want to learn what our history is and accept whatever that may be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>|  Is the true history of the site being covered up. </p>

<p>Yes.  The site dates to 9,000 to 12,000 BC and the artwork there is amazing for the time period.  It is a very inconvenient truth for established history.  There was obviously an older civilization that was very advanced (many believe they actually built the pyramids all over the world).  Ice core samples in Greenland suggest a massive temperature change at that time (like another meteor impact) that wiped out that civilization.  Perhaps they were the &quot;giants&quot; written about in many ancient texts (Nelphian) and that&#39;s why its covered up so aggressively in academia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like Robert Shoch&#39;s take on this. That evidence points to extreme solar activity around that time, to an extent that this activity would have decimated global populations. We&#39;re talking massive plasma storms (lightning) around the globe for long periods of time, causing instaneneous melting of glaciers and massive flooding. Radiation would have covered the surface of the earth. </p>

<p>Shoch&#39;s  (a tenured professor at Boston University and a geologist) website has interesting stuff. He argues that the people of Easter Island recorded these plasma storms in their cave drawings sometime after Gobleki Tepe was purposefully buried. It&#39;s a good rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Now the giants thing interests me some more. Indeed, giants would help to explain how pyramids actually got built. Yeah, I know, &quot;slave labor&quot;. Nobody explains how the slaves built them.  And in case people think Shoch is some lunatic out to make a buck off wild theories, his site features him debunking several theories including evidence of giants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry you took offense to my post. I didn&#39;t mean to sound arrogant, however it is a fact that the matter of the time investment (as well as manpower) is not often mentioned (though I admit maybe that&#39;s just my perception), and was not mentioned in the particular thread I replied to. In order to seriously discuss the methods necessary to erect the pyramids, this is a point of primary concern. Am I wrong about that? </p>

<p>Moreover, I did not mean to imply, as it would seem you think, that the discussion before my post was wrong. Heck, I didn&#39;t even deny that it might have been giants. I&#39;m just saying it would take a lot of time and manpower to build the pyramids. Some 20 years for 100,000 workers, according to a cursory Googling. Is there something greatly the matter with that number? Modern techniques accomplish arguably comparable feats in a few years with a fraction of the number of people.</p>

<p>You see, my point of view regarding this comes from the fact that in the modern age, we&#39;re quite used to having things go quickly. We tend to want everything right away. Instant gratification, and all that. So, it stands to reason that it is for many of us hard to intuitively imagine the time and effort that goes into a project like the pyramids, which may make it seem as if the project is more difficult than it would have seemed to people of the time, which in turn invites speculation about methods, since to the eyes of someone blinded by the speed and technology of modern life a giant pile of ancient rocks apparently seems wondrous.</p>

<p>So sorry for my arrogance, but I&#39;ve been called ignorant by people on any number of sides of the conversation and I&#39;m tired of being given insults in lieu of satisfying answers or debate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks for an honest reply, and while I don&#39;t take back what I said I don&#39;t think you are a bad person. Perhaps overconfident would have been a better word, what I meant is that you were too sure of what you said and seemed to imply that most others were wrong. Anyways it comes down to a matter of perception. If it truly took 20 years (which sounds pretty long) to build the great pyramid, they would have had about 7,200 days. To place the estimate 2.3 million blocks they would have had to place 319 blocks a day, or 23 blocks an hour assuming they had 14 hours of daylight. An average of 2.5 tons a block (ranges are 1.3 tons for a small one and 6.5-10 tons a large block) means they laid about 57.5 tons of stone an hour. That&#39;s insanely fast and it&#39;s probable that they had less hours in a day and had to move even faster... I can&#39;t imagine constantly putting down huge blocks every 2.6 minutes perfectly. That&#39;s not a ramp with slaves pulling it, that is an assembly line screaming along. It is enticing to think that they just kinda slowly moved out in the desert heat and gradually built the pyramid at some slow place but that comes from ignorance of how freaking massive it is. Now imagine that they did this over and over to make all the pyramids... those builders knew how to work, and they made the pyramid terrifyingly precise. Due to the age and some probably minor shifts due to earth stuff it was probably perfectly aligned when it was new. That isn&#39;t trivial and yet they did it quickly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I see what you&#39;re saying. That is an insane amount of work. I also see now how my comment must have seemed very flippant, and very ignorant. Thank you for taking the time to explain!</p>

<p>Incidentally, I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t lay one block at a time in a long queue, but probably did a few at a time. I&#39;d guess at least one on each side of the pyramid roughly simultaneously. I say that because it makes the timeline as stated much easier to swallow. The suggested 100,000 person workforce would surely be enough to be constantly bringing in new blocks and setting a few at a time, assuming reasonable organization efforts. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to make it sound like I was trivializing anything. In fact, I tend to think that people who suggest they would have needed some special kind of help (giants, aliens, unknown technologies, what have you) are guilty of this. It is a ton of effort to make something not only this big, but as you say, this terrifyingly precise, as well. People are capable of the most incredible things, given enough time. Your calculations are very welcome, they add a dimension to the conversation I obviously hadn&#39;t given enough consideration. But I don&#39;t feel like they really change that much, except the total time investment. I can&#39;t imagine putting down 2.5 tons of stone block every 2.6 minutes either. But, assuming they put one on each side at the same time, that&#39;s 2.5 tons of block every 10 minutes or so. Further, assuming it took them, say, 40 years instead of 20? That&#39;s still extremely impressive. The point is, I think it&#39;s reasonable to think it took them much longer than is often suggested to build them, than thinking they must have had incredible help, or access to mysteriously advanced technologies. </p>

<p>There isn’t so much to cover up in this time period. This is the oldest site in the world with such developed civilisation, and it’s well studied and published.</p>

<p>The <strong>real</strong> cover ups in archaeology are numerous. One of the biggest is the ancient America, and contacts with the rest of the world. Clovis Point cover-up was big, but now it’s basically over. This cover-up was meant to deny real antiquity to ancient Americans.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians were in America. But this is covered up.</p>

<p>Velikovsky cover-up was big, and it’s still partially continuing. He was the first to propose the catastrophic climate changes in the historical past, and this part is now mostly admitted.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/america/clovis_first/">http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/america/clovis_first/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In spite of evidence for human activity at 19,000 years ago from Meadowcroft in North America, many American archaeologists still insist that the earliest reliably dated evidence of human habitation in North America are 11,500-year-old fluted projectile points found in Clovis, New Mexico.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, human presence in South America is way older than 19,000 years. Maybe 30,000 years. Monte Verde in southern Chile was the key site, and Tom Dillehay is the real hero of archaeology, for fighting this fight, until his evidence was accepted.</p>

<p>Many of these buried buildings are no more than 400 years old many are much younger. </p>

<p>Officially these meters of soil are referred to as a &quot;cultural layer&quot; which is an absurd label suggesting that people didn&#39;t clean their streets and the filth just covered the first floor. </p>

<p>This is absurd for many reasons but It isn&#39;t just the first floor. Anecdotes have reached us of two sets of windows below ground level. </p>

<p>This all suggests a very recent within the last 200 years global cataclysm that has been written out of our history. </p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t been entirely erased and the finger prints of a cover up are many.  </p>

<p>Chronology of certain events have been pushed back in time to lessen their significance on the global consciousness. Artifacts have been fabricated and destroyed. People have been duplicated to fill in missing time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy moly just when I thought there can&#39;t be that many more mind blowing theories out there some one posts something like this and proves me wrong. LOL looking forward to diving down this rabbithole General. I have caught some bits and pieces of people suggesting our chronology has been intentionally manipulated, I always lean toward ignorance over conspiracy but that is most certainly not always the case. I haven&#39;t come across anything really convincing yet, the only researcher I have had much exposure to is Sylvie’ Ivanowa, It&#39;s interesting but to be honest I think there is a little bit lost in translation there. After a quick gland at r/culturallayer I think this might be some good hearty food for thought!</p>

The fact that this site was intentionally buried makes me think there will be something there to help translate the info found on these stones. I think it is reasonable to think that the civilization there knew something catastrophic was coming and wanted to do something to preserve some knowledge or history. And if I remember correctly didnt Graham Hancock say the astronomical alignments found there match that of today? I may be misremembering that part, but if it is correct what in the heck does that mean!? </p>

I can narrow it down to either his interview with Joe Rogan and Randall Carlson or one of his interviews with Greg Carlwood...

    <div class="md"><p>I even question the building dates of 9000 - 12,000 years ago. I think it&#39;s a distinct possibility that is even older than that. The ongoing excavations have only unearthed about 5% of the total complex I believe. There also seems to be structure built upon previous structure as well. As with the Egyptian civilization, the oldest seems to be the most impressive in size and complexity. </p>

<p>The reason that they&#39;ve come up with that date is because of the bones that have been found there in the buried layers of sediment. I believe that this is still being given the construction date due to the theory of the linear evolution of man and society.</p>

<p>Think about it this way...what if Gobekli Tepe had been built prior to the Younger Dryas and was only rediscovered by a hunter gather group that survived the cataclysm. When they came upon it, it would be natural to venerate and celebrate it. It would instantly become a focal point for gathering and celebration and possibly worship.</p>

<p>One of the things that lead me to believe this are the size of the stones themselves. I have never heard of a realistic expansion our hypothesis as to why a nomadic hunter gatherer group would decide to quarry, move and build something of such size. What on earth could have motivated them to do that unless it was insanely easy for them to do it. You have to remember that they would literally be following herds of game around for food and sustenance if we&#39;re to believe in what we&#39;ve been taught.</p>

<p>But the real clincher for me is the exquisite craftsmanship that is on display at Gobekli Tepe. Some of the stone pillars are done in a 3-dimensional bas relief. That is not an easy feat for people who didn&#39;t really have tools so to speak. There are also multitudes of other carvings of animals that some have linked to constellations. I don&#39;t know if this is true or not but then the ideas that are conveyed on the stone is a real smoking gun as well. </p>

<p>There is also the problem of when you look at some of the pillars from the side they appear to have hands that are folding together for a lack of better term. Some have suggested that these pillars could represent gods. If I recall they seem eerily similar to the way the hands on the Moai sites statues on Easter Island are represented.</p>

<p>So in closing I think that the site is a remnant of a previous civilization that had been discovered by hunter gatherers. They quite possibly worshipped there and it formed some of our earliest ideas about religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like how you bring up the hunter gather theory currently being postulated by MSM. I am trying to keep an open mind and reserving judgement for what I believe the truth to be until I&#39;ve read more into it. However, as of now I don&#39;t think that hunter/gathers would have done this. It&#39;s far to complex and not at all nomadic in appearance. Not all hunter/gathers were nomadic, but they would still have to move at least slightly with the seasons (they weren&#39;t farming) to gather and hunt what&#39;s available.</p>

<p>Thoughts? Am I way off?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not one to say your way off or not. I also don&#39;t believe we&#39;ll EVER get a true account of our history.</p>

<p>The thing you have to keep in mind with any of this is that there is going to be some level of bias no matter who you choose to believe.</p>

<p>Archeologist X who is studying this will come to conclusions based on his preconceived notions, schooling and personal paradigm of history. He believes that hunter gatherers were the beginning of our progression as societal humans...</p>

<p>Archeologist Y will see the same evidence and believe that it is indicative of prior civilization because of x,y,z...</p>

<p>Researcher Z will say that there is no possible way humans did this by themselves and had extraterrestrial assistance...</p>

<p>I think the most prudent thing to do intellectually is to just research all sides and see what rings true with YOU. That can come in many different forms but don&#39;t let that dissuade you if don&#39;t agree with the consensus.</p>

<p>From all of my research(which there is no end) it leads me to believe that there was a global civilization that existed before our written accepted history. If you come to a different conclusion then that is perfectly fine...it&#39;s not like if it was proven then we all get a lump sum lottery payment...lol.</p>

<p>One last thing....be wary of anyone who claims the have the absolute truth on anything. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the truth is subjective...although that just may be my philosophical underpinnings showing through though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible but there are a bunch of other sites spread across the area more than a days walk (some two or more) from each other. These sites have some similar stones etc as GT but smaller in scale. This could indicate that these &#39;satalite sites&#39; were used by small seperate groups that would then meet in GT for special rituals (GT is the largest and most central site). As GT seems to have a lot to do with the night sky it was probably a time of the year when certain stars were in alignment. </p>

<p>It is also possible that a singular nomadic group visted each site over a year in a kind of round trip. Each site could have had a special purpose or rep a certain god/whatever and GT could just be for the most important of those gods.</p>

<p>There are a number of possiblities but hunter gathers could have certainly done this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the sights were built by the ancestors of said hunter gatherers. Would it make sense to say that the people living at GT at the time of the last Global catastrophe knew something big was coming so they buried this place to preserve their knowledge or history, then after the site was buried and preserved, perhaps they went underground or to someplace safe to ride out the cataclysm. Then centuries and centuries later the population of human survivors of the catastrophe was absolutely decimated and the survivors had no other choice but to be hunter gatherers until they started to meet up with other surviving groups and rebuild civilization as we know it? I try to imagine what would happen to today&#39;s civilization if something like that were to happen... I don&#39;t think we would fair very well, and those that would survive wouldn&#39;t be the most cultured and educated of us, it would be the ones with the knowledge of how to forage and hunt and fight who would survive, thus leaving our art and history to the sands of time and our fragile technology would be all but useless in a few decades or so. I bet it would not take very long for our civilization to be completely erased or at least unrecognizable. Add to that 10,000 years and try to imagine what would be left of the physical structures we have today. 
     I like thought experiments like this, good choice of Topic bennyguns! I agree with you all that we will probably never know the truth of the matter, simply too much time has gone by, and then add to that those pesky folks that want to hide things for their own benefit. So all we can do is speculate and try to find a story that fits the evidence.</p>

<p>One of the things that lead me to believe this are the size of the stones themselves. I have never heard of a realistic expansion our hypothesis as to why a nomadic hunter gatherer group would decide to quarry, move and build something of such size. What on earth could have motivated them to do that unless it was insanely easy for them to do it. You have to remember that they would literally be following herds of game around for food and sustenance if we&#39;re to believe in what we&#39;ve been taught.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have heard one mainstream academic hypothesis.  Not saying it&#39;s true or false (and I believe the academics aren&#39;t either, it&#39;s just an idea developed from the archaeology observations of people groups and movement):</p>

<p>Climate changes forced a group from the north to migrate south into this region and two populations mixed.  This mixing included a convergence of neanderthal/homo sapiens/cro-magnon peoples and this lead to a certain kind of cultural development.  The peoples from the north brought with them their legacy of civilized stonework, and this developed into the constructions of Gokekli Tepe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Possible and somewhat intriguing. If this were to be proven accurate that would raise a ton more questions. We would have totally missed the boat on both the Neanderthals and the Cro-Magnon culturally. </p>

<p>My next question would be exactly how large or strong were these people to do stonework like that? The next thing would be the knowledge and meaning of the depictions/carvings in the stones. </p>

<p>In this scenario what would the homo-sapiens(us?) have offered? If the smarter/stronger group didn&#39;t outright kill or breed the weaker race out of existence then it must have been civilized. How would they have communicated if homo-sapiens barely had a proto language and wouldn&#39;t have documented language for another 6000 years in Sumaria?</p>

<p>Fascinating for sure!!!!!</p>

<p>Have you ever moved? You buy your friends a case of beer and pizza. They don&#39;t have to be strong, but they have to show up.</p>

<p>These things are mostly about social organization or simple tools, not brute force.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Agriculture or hunting, probably. If it was a migration, as suggested, then the locals would understand how to gather food.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it&#39;s a lot harder to breed a weaker race out of existence than you&#39;d think. That takes time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There might be a simple reason for the cover up: some secret societies are guarding the knowledge that ancient civilizations existed and that they left some artifacts that are valuable to science. Of course those discoveries are kept secret to keep some nations&#39; technological avantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a theory that the area was intentional covered because they anticipated a major catastrophic event taking place, specifically an asteroid hitting earth. The ancient civilizations were experts at mapping the stars, so they may have seen  something that was going to hit earth and covered the area with the hope that one day it would be rediscovered.  </p>

<p>This theory also ties in with Derinkuyu, the massive underground city also located in Turkey. They saw something approaching the earth, built an underground city to try their best to survive and buried their important sites so that hopefully one day someone would discover their civilization.</p>

<p>The site does predate Sumer. There is another site called Aratta, which is located in Ukraine, that is believed to be the oldest site that man has found so far. Some date Aratta at 22,000 BCE. Very little is known about these people. What&#39;s very interesting about Aratta is that there have been carvings/artworks that specifically mention the Annunaki. So now there are 2 cultures that mention the Annunaki, which makes it pretty difficult to simply disregard the Sumerian account as folklore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve listened to several interviews with Graham Hancock and in one of them he said that the way the dirt over top of gobekli tepe is they could tell somehow that it was buried intentionally, that&#39;s how I learned about it or I would give you a link... I can narrow it down to either his interview with Joe Rogan and Randall Carlson or one of his interviews with Greg Carlwood... I&#39;ll post a question on the forum for his podcast and see if someone can remember which one it was or maybe they could send a link to an article or something.
