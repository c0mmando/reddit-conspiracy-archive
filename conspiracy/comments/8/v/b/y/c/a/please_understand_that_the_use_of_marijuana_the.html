       The Cannabis flower is a special one for many reasons. Not only for the relaxed, joyful, euphoric and creative sensations it brings, but for how it specifically expands our consciousness. When the user (i.e. receiver) is tuned into the cannabis frequency, that is, tuned into the plant’s intention aligned with our own, awareness often grows into areas of the unknown which instantly changes our vibration.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason cannabis does this so well is due to its alliance with Gaia and the human template. It’s why THC, the primary psychoactive component in cannabis is so welcomed by the endocannabinoid system of the brain. That system is innate to the cannabis plant. It’s familiar and this instantly harmonizes the frequency within our DNA field and the pineal. This means that cannabis can interact in a multi-dimensional framework within the human’s field and change its own consciousness in the process. Psychoactive plants are particularly exceptional at changing their own awareness by using the human being as a conduit, but cannabis is one of the best hence its widespread use throughout the world. This is how incredibly aligned it is with the human. But if the user doesn’t tune in, all that is experienced is a buzzing which travels though the head and body with nowhere to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature’s psychoactive components are designed to transition our current reality, and they do this while synchronizing perfectly with the human field to send the user down another path that is quite different from everyday life. It can shift those seeking other levels of consciousness through portals to experience a different reality, one where common interactions are enhanced, especially since all senses must shift up. Sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch, and extrasensory perception are all enhanced. This makes food taste better, visuals appear more alive, heightened sexual experiences, and a nose that will track down your most desired scents. This is all completely dependent on the user’s intention to align with the cannabis frequency, one that requires permission to show you its beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flip side, it can also allow other less pleasurable frequencies to internalize, hence paranoia. So it can both expand and contract consciousness depending on the user’s alignment and intention. This is one reason why adults above 30 years of age (who are new to cannabis), can have very different experiences than those consuming it for the first time at a much younger age. This relates to differences in the maturity of sexual energy, wisdom attained, intentions, relationships, and many other lifestyle factors that influence how the cannabis frequency is integrated within.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting high recreationally and expanding our awareness with cannabis in meditation can be two very different things. When the consciousness of the human being is in a state of expansion, cannabis brings a sense of wisdom that is unique because it delivers concepts through Gaia. These concepts end up being intimately related to our lives, since nature reflects a part of itself onto every aspect of us, just as we do to nature. It goes deeper than that. It can connect with not only our own lives, but other lives recorded on the planet through consciousness imprints while it gathers conceptual data. This includes data from those present on the planet and those who have past. Meaning it can retrieve information relevant to concepts it seeks to illustrate from today or from thousands of years ago. All psychoactive plants can do this through their unique interface with our field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cannabis brings the underlying operating system to the surface. Shamans have used it for thousands of years for this purpose, to bring mindfulness where there is none so that we can see the world through an upgraded landscape that connects people to something more beautiful than what they know. Many of the shamans of today, those all around us, are just starting to realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let us welcome what is now the full expression of cannabis, marijuana, weed, pot, ganja, etc, imprinting its consciousness on the world, embracing all the beauty it provides if we choose to tune in. Are we ready for new lessons?

       Cannabis can be very helpful in many cases and had been introduced to this planet, this consciousness here. It is something from the Great White Brotherhood. We introduced it. It is something that is good for you. Not in over indulgence, though. Do not overindulge in it. But use it as a form of helping to move in to higher states of consciousness. This is what it is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can also be used for pain and these types of things and it is a very natural substance but be careful with it; that is all we are saying. Because if you utilize it too much just like you utilize other drugs too much it can open up pathways within you that can allow for negative forces to enter you. Not in terms so much of possession, we are not speaking in that terminology, not like your “Exorcist” and things like this but it can open up to a slight possession type of deal where you allow in and invite these entities to come in. And once they are invited in, they come in just as you’re vampire movies and things of this nature. Open up a window and they’re in. You see? Know not to open up a window to them. Okay?
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms again of the various medications and those kinds of things, that is all going away people. You are not going to have those much longer. It is a transition, it is part of the transition, but you are moving into more natural methods, more natural ways of handling the old diseases and sicknesses. But even more importantly than that, the old diseases and sicknesses are also going to be going away. Because as you raise your vibrations more and more as your frequency as a collective consciousness increases across the planet, you are going to find that you cannot have any of these maladies and diseases and sicknesses and all of this. Not even a headache! That will be gone. Stomachaches will be gone … all of this. You will have none of this anymore. Isn’t that wonderful?! Say hallelujah! You can celebrate. Oh my goodness, we can go into that song: “Celebrate!” But no, we’ll save that for another time. Okay?

       Wonderful! I too can feel it intertwined within the body to great deal, it’s naturally part of human existence and when used properly can greatly enhance the way we perceive and interact the universe. This goes for not only thc but also cbd. I feel as if the mind or psyche is very receptive to thc and cbd is for the body as thc is for the mind.
      </p>

       However it’s unfortunate so many burn outs just abuse it to escape life giving it bad wrap when it should be used to thrust your self into life it self. Abuse is just so overwhelming to the senses that imo causes more harm than good in someone not trying to realize it’s true potential, or purpose, within us, without knowing how to process these new feelings. Thus a typical sessions consist over over indulgence, zoning out with a bag of Oreos and watching cartoons all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I love your post, just think of how the world would be if we the people didn’t underestimate the true power of the ganj and used it properly. Pipe dreams....

       Many people use drugs AND weed to escape reality because the reality we have built is failed and sucks...
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that many do abuse it and use it as a means of escape, however, many people have no way to financially make themselves better off. We can always improve our surroundings and cannabis helps with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is, we need to release technology and build a better society that does not encourage people to run and escape from it. So many people drink alcohol as well just to get away from their mind or their situation. Well we can change a lot of reality just by releasing advanced technologies.

       This is a free will universe. Therefore they cannot tinker directly with the free will of humans. They can plant trees, life forms, nature itself, but they cant directly tell us what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was a none free will universe, then yes, they probably would of told us to stop fucking killing each other hundreds of thousands of years ago. But instead they observe and cross their space fingers that we wake the fuck up.

       You do understand that planting seeds or any other intervention IS directly tinkering with free will. In order for free will to exist, there can be NO intervention, direct or indirect.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, this post is something that I cannot get behind in any fashion, as the OP and the comments get progressively less connected to any rational example of the world. FWIW, I also don't believe in 'channellings'. Solid proof, for me, or else I simply don't agree with it. FWIW, I've also done both weed and more significant drugs in my lifetime and I fully recognize the altered state--but do not accept that it's a 'higher vibration' or anything like that. I DO accept that once you are in that state, you're a lot more likely to BELIEVE that's what it is.

       I totally understand, I am also working on this. I think we all experience this once we've seen into whatever
       <em>
        It is
       </em>
       . We just want what's best for others but we get a bit defensive when there's opposition because we've seen
       <em>
        It

       .

       It's been recently discovered that while THC might help you fall asleep in a similar manner that alcohol can, it also similarly disrupts the REM sleep cycle in a similar manner to alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been a daily THC consumer for about 12 years.  Several years ago I noticed that I stopped having dreams.  Turns out, whenever I stop smoking weed for whatever reason, my dreams return.

       Not sure, the Poppy could have been from the original beings that seeded planet earth or it could have been added later.

       I can look into it if youd like.

       Otherwise I am pretty sure poppies were seeded at the same time as other species.

       Why do you believe that life on Earth was seeded rather than evolving naturally over time? I understand the possibility behind seeding, but the evolution hypothesis seems to work just fine to explain the natural world.

       Im not OP but as you keep going on down this road it starts to become clearer and clearer - we have been seeded my many different alien species - this can be seen by the different races on earth. The fact that we are told in the bible not to eat mollusks and shell fish - it's because thy were not seeded as the same time from the same aliens as humans were.

       That's the question we should be asking, who gave it to us? It's too perfect to be random. After my experiences with DMT, I've come to really consider what the Gnostic/animists say about the world. They say it's literally conscious down to the level of DNA and that there's a network of communication that exists based around light energy and fungus, which they call "Gaia." Otherwise known as Mother Earth. But it's not dead, it's very much alive and interested in human beings and our development. I believe this very strongly at this point. Psychedelics and cannabis are tools for our evolution, and we'd be wise to take them seriously.

       Your comment is a little confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying cannabis is a tool used by the military for pacification of the surface population?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill wait for a reply to that. As per the PTSD, yes, it can be used (and psyilobyn too) to treat PTSD in not only soldiers but citizens as well. Pacification used against the population? Not at all. If anything it helps people tap into their own divine feminine and divine masculine and therefore walk the fine line between the two.

       If I remember correctly, the word assassin was derived for the word hashish. Apparently they would get lit then  kill their targets.

       Move into higher consciousness ? If that means dribbling and not being able to speak I’m practically a guru.  Different drugs for different mugs. I have friends who still smoke but for most people I see it dull down your personality. Though I see it as no worse than alcohol. In fact probably better considering the crap drink can get you into. Cocaine and heroine are no different, used in doses they are fine but who can ? Most people end up getting addicted.

       There is this peak moment when you get high, lasting just a minute were you really feel connected to everything, you can feel, hear and see every single thing from around the world inputted to your mind. It's just a devine sensation, it was similar to how I imagine what the 'limitless pill' would be like. Weed helped me transition from being a fake attention seeking sheep to a rebel in the shadow who's following his dream no matter what society tells me.

       You get suicidal from weed? Are you smoking a ton? I'd say try a super tiny amount, like one hit or a small edible. If that doesn't feel good, then take a long break. That's very rare.

       Yeah, pretty much every time. I simply avoid it now. One friends thinks that I may have Pre-Schizophrenia or I am susceptible to Schizophrenia or Paranoia in the Future.  I get really depressed on any hallucinogen.  I have to avoid Vicodin.

       Maybe it's something deeper in your life that the self reflection is forcing you to deal with. Many of of us have pain or trauma that we have had in our past and we bury it deep down instead of taking the time to confront our emotions and heal from them.

       Personally I was depressed for many years, and marijuana helped me understand the power of perception. It wasn't easy but I am in a much, much better place now.

       Possible, but I only get depressed when exposed to hallucinogens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally I am a happy person.  And I can see when I am getting depressed because of lack of sleep, encroaching financial ruin, medical bills piling up, the usual stuff. And I can talk through all of that.

       "The fact that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a more potent stimulator of oxygen radical formation than acrolein indicates that glutathionylpropionaldehyde is a toxic metabolite of acrolein and may be responsible for some of the in vivo toxicity of acrolein."
      </p>
      <p>
       Acrolein literally forms an adduct bond with glutathione and turns into glutathionylpropionaldehyde, which in turn, loses its free radical scavenging ability (loss of glutathione), AND there is a GREATER production of free radicals/oxygenated species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone immediately wondering, what does this have to do with smoking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when I told you that they add glycerol to cigarettes?
      </p>

      <p>
       "Chemical reactions responsible for release of acrolein include heat-induced dehydration of glycerol,"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Smoking of tobacco products equals or exceeds the total human exposure to acrolein from all other sources. " THIS IS IMPORTANT, because acrolein is formed in small amounts when we deep fry french fries, and other various food stuffs, BUT NOTHING compared to what a smoker will get, literally like 100~500 to 1 in terms of exposure amounts
      </p>
      <p>
       "Acrolein is metabolized by conjugation with glutathione and excreted in the urine as mercapturic acid metabolites."
      </p>
      <p>
       Glutathione is depleted by Michael addition to acrolein, which leads to even more ROS/free radicals. The glutathionylpropionaldehyde formed, as stated with peer reviewed information, also enhances/increases the amount of ROS/free radicals, and glutathionylpropionaldehyde does an even better job at elevating ROS than acrolein alone.
      </p>

       "The biological effects of acrolein are a consequence of its reactivity towards biological nucleophiles such as guanine in DNA and cysteine, lysine, histidine, and arginine residues in critical regions of nuclear factors, proteases, and other proteins. Acrolein adduction disrupts the function of these biomacromolecules which may result in mutations, altered gene transcription, and modulation of apoptosis." EDIT: This could lead to cancer, tumors, and other various disorders.

       What they are going to do is add glycerin/glycerol to marijuana, so it is doing the same thing as tobacco.

       Vape pens are a much safer alternative to combusting plant matter into your lungs directly that's wrapped in even more plant matter, but they need to be made extremely well and in this day and age have already been perfected, your unlikely to pay less than 80$ for a new one, but that is because the market demanded the quality be brought up.

       I was readying about wet lung and what not. Was concerned with the vaporization of the mix inside the cart, as we know its not 100% THC but cut with glycol to make it semi viscous.
      </p>
      <p>
       We get the dino ones, single sale yeah $80 seems bout right. But in bulk they are much more affordable.

       Not true at all, THC pen's use butter or shatter and have a closed chamber that heats it up to an appropriate temperature to vaporize it, instead of overheating and "burning" it and this process would turn the shatter/buter semi viscous during the process of vaporizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       THC distillates, extracts, etc do not use glycol, what I was referring to was normal vape juice which uses propylene glycol.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may be referring to a vape juice which may contain THC/CBD, and I don't know much about that, but I would think you would be fine, the removal of plant matter from the equation completely makes it sensible that vape juice containing THC would be absolutely fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       How it burns with other chemicals, is another question, but pure distillate used with vape juice would be able to be a good indicator of whats happening, etc.

      <p>
       Yes exactly these. The THC juice inside those pens without a doubt is mixed with glycol. They are viscous while not being heated. You tilt and juice flows. The brand i was referring to is called Dyna Puff. They market as 80% THC Co2 extract. And most extracts, dont normally flow at room temp.

       Much prefer shatter/butter and glass. But always was curious of the safety of those damn juice pens. They make my throat feel like its the size of a straw after one hit.

       Yup, it does the same thing salt does.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you add salt to your pasta noodles, it changes the amount of energy/heat required to heat the water, so before it boiled at 100, now it boils at 102, and road salt is the same thing just with anti-clumping chemicals in it, it makes the water on the ground need to lose more energy to freeze, if its too cold outside, road ice won't do shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why if you dropped a bag of road ice in the antarctic, it would just collect a layer of permafrost and do nothing.

       The weed today is so genetically modified in the CBD shops here in Cali that you should not be telling people to smoke it for spirituality! It fucks you up! And maybe a post should be made about the conspiracy of the new weed???

       Ok you are being so patient with me and I appreciate that! I know this sounds crazy but deep inside of me I know without a doubt that in my state the shit you buy at the "shops" are NOT organic! I will find the " info" for you if I decide to further prove my claims! Because I already know it's true, I don't feel the need to justify. Does that make sense?

       Ive stepped inside many grow facilities, personal grows, and have grown myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am aware of the impacts, and am worried about the pesticides being used, genetics are usually golden and OG grown but I worry about the new strains. Im keeping my eye on GMO weed but so far in my state ive only sampled OG strains. I dont try much Cali buds, but now im wondering whats going on over there

       I am definitely not against our new laws.  so much is proving to me about healing affects (CBD). but I am concerned about the distributors and there lack of??? Damn can't think of the word. In a nut shell the growers at this point do not give a crap about the product! Only the $$$$

       Yes, thankfully I have my GF on the inside of the industry and im honored to have her pass on nuggets of wisdom to the growers. Right now there was a recent problem with sulphites being used incannabis. Im thankful to have the inside scoop on local growers and companies and I agree the distributoers only see the cash in it which brings greed

       If you do try it, make sure to ease into it. Don’t go crazy your first time, don’t want to ruin your first experience because you went overboard. Just a dab will do ya. Also get a friend who also wants to try it to try it with you...you’ll enjoy it more if you have someone to experience it with.

       All I see is more shitty drivers, reflectors installed on the roads because people who are too stoned to drive are partaking &amp; driving down the wrong side of the roads.

       Plus everyone in the state of Nevada is now subjected to much higher minimum liability auto accident insurance.

       To be fair you can get a lot of weed from just a couple plants if you know what you're doing. In fact it's probably better if you grow your own so that you can control exactly what's going into it.

       This has been going on since the late 60’s. Both my parents involved.Dad at NASA Mom was “Air Force at Lockheed”… volunteered me for some of the first experiments. This just touches the surface. They found that very specific thoughst and emotions have “energetic signatures” that can be replicated on many levels…. the one mentioned above, chemically, and simply with the very precise blending of color on a screen. Just about any disease or thought or emotion can be stimulated. This came from a technology that was gifted to Humans that would have cured all of mankinds ills..(well, not actually cured the causes, but alleviated the effects) .. actually a fairly simple technology…. but once in the hands of the corrupt controllers they found other uses. The lead scientist got second thoughts and died”mysteriously”…was murdered. What this article does not mention is the antidotes….. things that create a vibrational white noise….. certain strains of Marijuana for example. The experiments I was part of were really quite amazing..when I was just a young teen they were actually able to control my mind to a point where they had me build a machine that registered a plants emotions and allowed it to “verbalize”… Everything I needed was supplied to me by NASA and monthly “science kits”…. I “zoned out” and simply listened to instructions in my head from a guy I called,”the German” because he had an accent. I had no idea what I was building….as it evolved I believed it was a alarm system that utilized plants for sentries…. because when I cam within 30 feet of the plant I had (supplied by NASA..I’ve never seen another like it…very sensitive, would move away from touch but not a “sensitive plant” was more like a Grass or bamboo. My Dad said it had been in space. Well it turned out it only responded to me at 30 feet ( I was constantly burning…or just threatening to burn it’s leaves…and it would “scream”… So I figured it would make a great alarm system…but when I finally showed it to my Dad he had to come within inches before it responded…. As soon as it was done the “German” left for about 7 years, when he came back is when I found out that I was a guinea pig…and what was actually going on… it’s a long strange story, but true.

       Wow, sorry I never got notified of this reply… Just got notified of one other today to someone else. It’s a long story. I recently did some research, remembered my Mom’s Boss’s name. Googled it. Turns out he was Asst. Sect of Defense in charge of Weapons . George Marianthal…. I haven’t written too much about it all and have very little time right now…. (work 15 hours a day just to make meager ends meet off the grid )…. but here’s a link to part of the story. It’s a section on my blog titled something like “coming out of the scary weirdness closet”…you just scroll down to the chapter of meeting the German…. But I don’t think I wrote about when he came back 7 years later and told me what was really going on…. but this part tells about how they used me as a guinea pig….though I only figured that out years later, before that I thought maybe I was chanelling some dead scientist in order to pull off making the Plant Machine as I came to call it…. Here’s the link :

       On another note...
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, I try to sleep in different locations. Jumping from place to place to avoid being zapped. I go camping in different places, I stay at motels, and visit places where I hope there is no way to be tracked and attacked. I always try to think of locations that would be immune from attacks (aspect, shielding). Currently, I have found that camping at the base of shear, mountainous, north-aspect facing, densely forested areas are the best. Shear north aspect facing mountainous areas seem to be places where it is difficult for space-based satellite weapons to track targets. Heavily forested areas are difficult for drones to maneuver in for the same reasons.

       Do you suspect the energy they use is scalar? I always thought they were just microwave range. I'm not aware of any means of blocking scalar waves, nor do I really understand scalar much. Microwave can be shielded for sure, deep water will do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other interesting thing is that this energy tech they use on TIs does seem to have some connection to the spinal cord somehow, which goes down another weird rabbit hole into the whole chakra thingy which I am not even close to being able to discern anything solid on yet, ramblings of hippies aside.

       I can handle it sometimes. The medical shit just got a little too good for me to handle. Plus I had a pretty bad acid trip that I smoked on, so I have some negative  association everytime i partake. I did open my root chakra on too much edibles once. I got the biggest period of my life the next day, it was nuuuuuuuts

       I had the same prob. My cycles aren't cycles just like a couple a year with no rhyme or reason. So when periodgeden happened it was like months, possibly years of build up...ill spare you the gory deets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, yes, hormone imbalance for sure...probably thyroid or adrenal related...any vitamins she can take to support those systems would help. I'm not a western medicine gal myself (for overall health anyway). But acupuncture and Chinese medicine might be an option to look at. Also try to find a holistic doc in your area. If you happen to be in LA, I can recommend a miracle worker.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to the above, I go on random cleanses and regularly exercise, and while I'm not month to month, I get them more frequently (maybe every 3) and got pregnant recently! I definitely attribute those changes to my female success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway don't know if you were looking for some tips, just thought I'd share my experience! Good luck to you and yours.

       Yes! My ex husband and I loved it when we were younger! I had kids (and lots) but quit smoking. duh! But would dabble in it now and again. However, my ex is 52 and never quit and continues to use the medicinal ( strong AF) He is fucked up! I am not. It did help me wake to the catholic bullshit i was subjected too! But sadly his kids just think he is a stoner with zero enlightenment!

       We can also increase our vibration and experience higher consciousness without marijuana. That takes some work, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that pot is like any drug in that your body builds a tolerance, and you need more to get the same high the longer you use. A spiritual way of looking at that is (to paraphrase Don Juan) "if you overuse the plant, the spirit in it goes away." So, if you're using it to just experience temporarily higher consciousness (not just for medical purposes), probably best not to be using every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've known more than a few potheads in my life, and their art, relationships, and other skills did not get better being high during most of their waking hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want people be free to use THC to explore consciousness, but I think it's important to not let it become a crutch in that you can't handle normal everyday consciousness because it's too boring. Not to fall into belief systems being touted about it that make a chemical something spiritual and almost religious ("God gave us pot to increase our vibration"). Everything one can experience while on marijuana, can be experienced starting with normal consciousness without a drug--the power is in you. But it takes work (a playful kind of work) to learn how to adventure in consciousness drug free.

       Cannabis was given to us by god as our main medicine it can heal your spiritual and physical illnesses. It’s cured me of severe depression and more. It’s opened me up to understand spirituality more. The ignorant people will think it’s a drug.

       While I don't buy into all of the vibration and shamanistic gobbldey guck cannabinoids do have some pretty good potential for helping a lot of people. Weed doesn't make you lazy, just don't give a lazy person weed.

       What I’ve been thinking is, marijuana puts you in a state where you’re learning more of what you read or try and understand, could it however, be a bad combination now a days with the technology and EMF’s and other things changing the way the experience of the marijuana should be?

       Combusting cannabis definately can contribute towards lower vibes. For lack of a better explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you vape its cleaner and healthier but when you combust over and over youre also combusting potential pesticides, and other matters into your system
      </p>
      <p>
       if you vape you get the direct benefits but no BS side effects

       Yes it makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive stepped inside many grow facilities, personal grows, and have grown myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am aware of the impacts, and am worried about the pesticides being used, genetics are usually golden and OG grown but I worry about the new strains. Im keeping my eye on GMO weed but so far in my state ive only sampled OG strains. I dont try much Cali buds, but now im wondering whats going on over there
