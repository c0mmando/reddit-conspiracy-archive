Having said that I truly believe that only an absolute moron devoid of any scientific understanding would even consider the idea of a flat earth. 
It took my mind 10 seconds of rational thought to dismiss the flat earth. </p>

<p>Can you observe anything though a telescope that&#39;s a flat floating body? No! 
Are rain drops round? Yes! 
If im looking at a picture of 1/10000000000th of the total curvature of a basketball it will appear flat to the human eye? Yes! 
The moon is obviously a sphere? Yes! 
There a working model showing proper maths explaining our solar system and its round planets ? Yes !<br/>
There&#39;s working maths showing a flat planet model works in space or wherever you idiots think it exists doesn&#39;t exist! </p>

<p>Flat earthers are either; Trolls, complete morons or someone has an agenda to stupify some gullible morons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever since the flat Earth thing started I felt it was an Anti-Conspiracy Psy Op.  </p>

<p>Imagine the average American who believes the MSM narrative of 9/11, doesn&#39;t know the Federal reserve is a private corporation, etc etc.  Their only understanding of conspiracy theories is what the MSM calls conspiracy theories. And of course, They know this, and have created an <em>easily</em> disprovable and clearly fallacious &quot;conspiracy theory,&quot; even inacting the help of celebrities (B.o.B.) to push this agenda to seem legit.  So now any time your grandma heard the words &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; she&#39;ll snicker and laugh because she&#39;s no dummy and she knows those conspiracy nuts are clearly tin foil hatters off their rocker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly...God, we need to find a way to more aggressively or productively wake people up to at least the simple stuff...People take all the extreme examples of &quot;beliefs&quot; from so many non-mainstream groups. They end up closing their ears and eyes to anything that resembles what they&#39;ve been warned about, and then cling steadfast to what they&#39;re told the experts&#39; opinions are. If you think for your self, you are part of the problem, you&#39;re toxic, bigoted, ignorant, among a litany of other insults...It&#39;s all like a trigger word that practically turns them into Agent Smith. You conform, or else...Resistance is futile!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s strange because in reality there&#39;s far more posts bitching and complaining about the flat-earthers here on this very forum on a regular basis, at least once every week, than anything at all being mentioned about them anywhere else.</p>

<p>And I say bitching and complaining because it consists mainly of name calling and disparaging the flat-earthers and completely ignoring the growing body of facts that they&#39;ve been assembling by using the scientific method and very carefully done direct experiments to try and prove things one way or the other.</p>

<p>Something that those who are so critical of them aren&#39;t even the slightest bit curious about and avoid any mention of like the very plague itself. </p>

<p>Equally as interesting is just how many flat-earthers started out thinking just how easy it should be to disprove any notion that the Earth might be flat only to find that what there is, is far from being as convincing as they originally believed it was in the face of more logical and very direct evidence to the contrary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a flat earther that is not Christian or religious at all - I only know the earth is flat because of the scientific method - nothing else.  Faith does not enter into it.</p>

<p>I also do not support Trump or any extant political party that I&#39;m aware of and will probably never vote in an organized election.</p>

<p><a href="/u/SlickInfinity">/u/SlickInfinity</a> seems to have made this thread after he literally asked me to kill myself in another thread because I was talking about my flat earth beliefs.  He did not post these thoughts in the thread but as a specific response to my flat earth comments.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the link:
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vb4iv/do_people_still_believe_aliens_are_a_conspiracy/e1lzv6s/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vb4iv/do_people_still_believe_aliens_are_a_conspiracy/e1lzv6s/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow the stupidity in flat earth believers is off the charts. Moon is round, sun is round, raindrops round and we&#39;re all using sattelites daily. Can you please explain to me how I flew around the world? The flat earth conspiracy is most likely just to see how retarted some people are. There&#39;s definitely hard science backing it up too omg lol. I honestly believe if you think the world is flat, the best thing you can do for our species is suicide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this the kind of behavior we should be seeing on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  To openly advocate for people to kill themselves?  Seems like this is going too far to me.  What do other people think?  Or am I really &quot;retarted&quot; ???</p>

<p>This is roughly what we believe it looks like.. they hide that the Earth is a habitat made by Intelligent Design. </p>

<p>If they allowed everyone to know this, God would be undeniable.</p>

<p>We changed from believing the Earth was flat to round in hundreds of years ago before we had today’s technology, and NASA still can’t provide us with a telescopic picture of earth from outer space.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, there are plenty of people not commenting that are ready reading my points and looking deeper into it.</p>

<p>That’s how I woke up, and if you don’t take the time to do your own research and just think I’m “crazy” then you are one of the “sheep” that don’t even think for two seconds.</p>

<p>It’s just the internet though, think about a day where people like me get throw in prison for believing this shit and speaking about it on platforms like Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn’t cut it. Let’s assume your UN map is correct. The equator then becomes just an arbitrary ring equidistant from the North Pole and the edge. In a flat model, you ought to be able to see stars revolving about the north celestial pole/North Star/ Polaris from anywhere on the ~globe~ sorry plane. Why then is it the case in our real world that anyone closer to the edge than the equator who looks up at the night sky in any region of your map can clearly and easily see that the North Star is no longer visible, and that over the course of the night, stars in fact revolve around an entirely different location in the sky? </p>

<p>Have you even ever been to the Southern Hemisphere? Because I have, and I personally observed stars going around the Southern celestial pole and I never visited the opposite side of the flat earth to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look it’s just geometry. If the earth were flat you would be able to see any star in the sky from any point independent of latitude. Just imagine a dome over your UN model with the stars on it and the North Star in the center (or wherever it doesn’t matter). You can draw a straight line from the North Star in this model to any location on the map including the Southern Hemisphere meaning in your model we should be able to see the North Star everywhere. But we don’t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is what the bible teaches, and would therefore be easier to appeal to people who are more &#39;things&#39; orientated. (It&#39;s late and it&#39;s my second language, so I don&#39;t know which word to rather use, maybe pragmatic?) </p>

<p>Anyway, if I can talk to someone and say, hey, listen, this is how the world works, this is where we are, there is heaven, there is hell. We can&#39;t leave this place and go anywhere else. We are confined here. The people in charge of this world is not your &#39;friendly government&#39;, it is not even the illuminati/bankers or whoever you might think. The devil still rules most of the people that are in charge, and he will try his best to make you think either he/God/both do not exist. (Insert the whole big bang theory/evolution/endless space/multiple universe theories and so on to make you feel smaller than dust particle and insignificant and without purpose)</p>

<p>But all that does not matter anyway, what only matters is how you choose to live your life. Will start to share my own story if the person still wants to hear me out. </p>

<p>So yeah, for me personally I believe the earth is flat, and you have to admit, if it is really the case, our lives here on earth do immediately seem a little bit more intentional.</p>

<p>And I agree the earth being flat/round will not change <em>my</em> view on God/bible as I place my trust in them based on more personal and immediate life situations/choices.</p>

<p>But, if the bible mentioned flat earth from before we even started asking questions regarding our earth, for me that says that the bible knows what&#39;s up, that it holds the truth of life, and that it can be trusted. </p>

Neither does saying water curves to a surface because raindrops are round, that is surface tension, not mass attracting mass. If you knew the Earth was flat, you&#39;d also know there was a God. Being an atheist, how would that affect you? Would you not see the world around you and everyone in it differently? Wouldn&#39;t the shitty world as we know it sort of, <strong>stop spinning</strong>? ;)</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t flat, it is level.</p>

<p><em>A line or surface to which, at every point, a vertical or

<p>It is a pressure gradient.  Pressure decreases slowly as you get higher from the surface.</p>

<p>How does one get a receiver position dependent Doppler shift if the transmitters aren&#39;t moving much at all?  You can use the shift to work out the speed of the transmitting object and it shows they are moving very quickly.  In fact the speed it shows exactly matches what is required for them to orbit and the altitude they are said to orbit.  If they moved that fast in atmo then they would put off an amazing amount of heat that could be detected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sensing a wink wink nudge nudge here, but for anyone really curious still, the reason this proves the Earth is not flat is that if it were, the fact that the sky maps to a sphere means that there would be either one observed celestial pole or two necessarily situated on opposite horizons. This is of course in addition to the simple and easily observable fact that the spherical sky changes exactly accordingly between different locations as it would should you use a globe Earth as your geographical model.

<p>Those curved windows preclude you from being able to appreciate the curvature of the earth.  That&#39;s why I suggested a helicopter, rather than a commercial airliner.  I was able to look right out of a UH-1 Huey, as did several others.  We all noted to each other at that moment that the earth is in fact round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a matter of perspective - if you&#39;re sitting on a beach, or if you have a camera placed near the ground, and someone walks away from you you will first lose sight of their feet, then the bottoms of their legs, etc.  Things always disappear from the bottom up, but this does not mean they are going over a curve.</p>

<p>This is also why the Sun appears to &quot;set&quot; - it&#39;s disappearing from the bottom - but this is simply because its traveling away from us on a flat plane.</p>

<p>Interesting.  When we learned how to jump we were taught to focus on the horizon.  Of course I didn&#39;t jump HALO.  3500 AGL was the highest I ever jumped.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a flat earther. Erasthosenes was right, the earth is a roughly 26000 mile diameter ball orbiting our sun. In turn the sun is in the milky way orbiting a giant black hole, which in turn is one of many galaxies formed in the big bang likely eternally expanding from each other. </p>

<p>What that video is things dipping beyond the horizon, which is because of the earth&#39;s curvature. Why I am talking about is seeing the horizontal curvature of the earth with the naked eye which requires being at around 35,000ft with a 60 degree field of view. </p>

<p>I have a monthly UFO Meetup that I attend in my town. In the past year, 3 out of 12 meetups devolved into Flat Earth spats between people attending the event (three vociferously believed in FE, the rest of the room vociferously advocated spherical Earth). The original intent of the meetup got derailed each time. </p>

<p>You go ahead and call me whatever names you wish, because words have meaning, and don&#39;t mean whatever you want them to mean. Bigot is a beloved word by stupid people with stupid opinions, who simply cannot understand why their opinions are so fucking stupid, therefore anyone calling them stupid dismissively is a bigot. I&#39;m intolerant of stupid opinions posted as if they were science. Your views are not exposing a conspiracy, they are merely idiotic.

Yes I&#39;m using the roundness of rain to support my case that our planet is round and think its a good example. It&#39;s definitely not the only thing I use to support the fact the earth imo is a sphere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im aware the original moderator/owner of this channel also doesn&#39;t believe in flat earth. I also vaguely remember a guideline saying not to talk about flat earth here on conspiracy theory. That&#39;s unfair because the majority of the world has never been to outter space to begin with. Nasa and the One World Government has been lying to us about everything that has to do with space. A good example is the 60&#39;s &quot;moon landings&quot;. What makes you believe the earth is round and spinning? In these days when we are being set up for the worlds great deception, and the fake alien hoax invasion that they are preparing for us. Our ancestors had ancient wisdom and knowledge which has been replaced by pseudo-science which most ppl blindly follow with out any questions whatsoever. It&#39;s a shame when other conspiracy theorist dismiss their fellow brethren who are also on the same path to seek the truth that has been hidden from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From youtube - not mine - regarding FECORE.  </p>

<p>FECore&#39;s conclusion &quot;the earth is flat&quot; is based on wrong calculations, errors in the calculations, using Snell&#39;s law wrong, assuming a flat earth and a wrong physical model of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It is really embarassing what they published. Either all FECore members are too stupid to even execute simple trigonometric calculations with a calculator or they did not review the paper at all before publishing their paper to find this obvious errors in their refraction correction calculations.</p>

<p>4 fatal Errors in FECores laser experiments</p>

<p>Note: I will use the values of the 4th measurement on the lake Ijssel as an example:</p>

<p>Distance = 28.68 km
Laser height = 2.85 m
Laser visible height at target = 0.85 m
Temperature at 2.85 m height = 11.8°C
Temperature at 0.85 m height =  7.6°C
Refraction index n1 at 11.8°C = 1.000283508 (source?)
Refraction index n2 at  7.6°C = 1.000286716 (source?)</p>

<p>First of all, refraction in the atmosphere is gradual. It depends mainly on the temperature Gradient (change of the temperature with height), which results in a corresponding density Gradient. If you have a density gradient, you can&#39;t simply apply Snell&#39;s law like FECore did. See Error 4 how refraction is correctly derived.</p>

<p>Snell&#39;s law:   sin( theta2 ) / sin( theta1 ) = n1 / n2</p>

<p>Where theta1 is the angle of incidence (angle of the ray measured against the perpendicular to the boundary layer) in the medium with refractive index n1 and theta2 is the angle of incidence in the medium with refractive index n2.</p>

<p>Error 1: using Snell&#39;s law with the wrong angle of incidence</p>

<p>FECore used not the angle of incidence but the angle measured up from the boundary layer. So they should have used 90°-0.0040° for theta1. But FECore did not even get the calculation right with the angle 0.004°. Using the wrong angle of incidence from FECore should result in:</p>

<p>theta2 = arcsin( sin( theta1 ) * n1 / n2 ) = arcsin( sin( 0.004° ) * 1.000283508 / 1.000286716 ) = 0.003999987°</p>

<p>FECore got 0.0000012184657704270384°</p>

<p>So lets use the correct angle of incidence which is theta1 = 90°-0.004° = 89.996°. In this case the FECore &quot;refraction angle&quot; theta2 would be:</p>

<p>theta2 = 90° - arcsin( sin( 90°-theta1 ) * n1 / n2 ) =&gt;</p>

<p>theta2 = 90° - arcsin( sin( 89.996° ) * 1.000283508 / 1.000286716 ) = 0.14516°</p>

<p>FECore got 0.0000012184657704270384°. That is 120,000 times too less!</p>

<p>Note: Snell&#39;s law is generally true only for isotropic (the same refractive index in all directions) or specular media. Air is not isotropic.</p>

<p>Error 2: calculation error</p>

<p>I wondered how FECore got the peculiar refraction angle of 0.0000012184657704270384°, because I get 0.003999987° using their values. I finally figured it out. FECore not only used the wrong angle of incidence, but could not even compute the correct result with the angle of incidence they used. They did not convert angles from rad to degrees and vice versa at the right places:</p>

<p>The angle mode of sin and arcsin was set to radian. They correctly converted theta1 from degrees to radian by multiplying with pi / 180° before executing the sin function. But before computing the arcsin they again converted degrees to rad multiplyed with pi / 180°. This is wrong because the value is not even an angle at this step of the calculation. They must first take the arcsin to get an angle in radian and then convert the result back to degrees by multiplying with 180° / pi.</p>

<p>wrong: theta2 = arcsin( [sin( theta1 * pi / 180° ) * n1 / n2] * pi / 180° ) = 0.0000012184657704270384°</p>

<p>right: theta2 = arcsin( [sin( theta1 * pi / 180° ) * n1 / n2] ) * 180° / pi = 0.00399998735°</p>

<p>with theta1 = 0.004°, n1 = 1.000283508, n2 = 1.000286716. Note theta2 = 0.00399998735° is the correct result of this equation but wrong because it uses the wrong FECore angle of incidence theta1 = 0.004°. Garbage in, garbage out. But FECore could not even get this right.</p>

<p>FECore most likely used the built in calculator of MS Windos as I did to figure out their results. I cross checked my findings with the published values of Experiment 3. They did the same error there too and most likely on all other measurements too (did not check all experiments).</p>

<p>Error 3: invalid equation and wrong refrecation correction</p>

<p>To compute the refraction angle, FECore used the following formula (Snell&#39;s law), but with the wrong angle theta1, see Error 1:</p>

<p>FECore&#39;s formula as published: sin(theta2) = (n1 * sin(theta1)) / n2 = 0.0000012184657704270384°</p>

<p>This is not even a valid equation, because you have different units on each side of the equation (sin(theta2) is not an angle). The mathematically correct equation would be something like:</p>

<p>theta2 = arcsin( (n1 * sin(theta1)) / n2 ) = 0.0000012184657704270384°</p>

<p>Lets compute now the refraction correction using the wrong &quot;FECore refraction theory&quot; (see Error 4) but with the correct calculated refraction angle theta2 = 0.14516°.</p>

<p>FECore computed the refraction correction simply using the following equation, which I have reconstructed from the published values (theta2 in degrees):</p>

<p>correction = dist * tan( theta2 * pi / 180° )</p>

<p>So the correction according to FECore is:</p>

<p>correction_FECore = dist * tan(theta2<em>pi/180°) = 28680 m * tan(0.0000012184657704270384</em>pi/180) = 0.610 mm</p>

<p>Using the right angle of incidence and refraction angle (theta1 = 90°-0.0040°, theta2 = 0.14516°) we get a refraction correction of:</p>

<p>correction = 28680 m * tan( 0.14516 * pi / 180 ) = 72.7 m</p>

<p>So FECore published a refraction correction value of 0.610 mm. This value results from the wrong &quot;refraction theory&quot; using Snell&#39;s law wrong (wrong angle of incidence) and making calculation errors. If we use the same wrong theory, but the right angle of incidence and without making calculation errors, we get a refraction correction of 72.7 m. The published FECore value is 120,000 times too small, even if their refraction model would be correct!</p>

<p>The calculated hidden height was 40.21 m. So the refraction correction of 72.7 m would make the laser visible from the ground without problems on the globe.</p>

<p>Error 4: stupid refraction model</p>

<p>FECore assumed a flat earth and that the air consists of 2 flat layers with constant refractive indices. The lower layer with refractive index n2 = 1.000286716 is assumed to go from ground level to 2.85 m, which is just below the height of the laser. Above that, where the laser is placed, they assumed a layer with refractive index n1 = 1.000283508. The &quot;refraction theory&quot; FECore used is that the laser enters with an angle of 0.004° from the n1 layer at the position of the laser the n2 layer. From there on they assumed light does not get bent the whole distance to the target.</p>

<p>This is complete BS!</p>

<p>The air is not composed of a few layers with constant refractive indices, that very conveniently have their boundaries at exactly the right height to make the calculations of the refraction correction easy.</p>

<p>When I do debate, it is mostly for the benefit of others reading to raise awareness to the fact the person is FOS. Not to convince the person I confront.

    <div class="md"><p>I do not ascribe to Flat Earth because I think that in the consciousness hologram we are all logged into shows similar patterning at all levels of existence—from the microscopic to the macrocosmic. </p>

<p>I feel like our giant solar system we inhabit is not unlike the structure we see in a tiny, tiny atom—with a central nucleus (sun) and orbiting electrons (planets). In nature, things tend to form in a spherical or bubble-like form. So why would our realm &quot;break the rules&quot; that we see all around us in order to be flat like a coin? To me the adage &quot;as above, so below&quot; bears truth in things of an esoteric nature as well as a literal nature. It seems odd to me that there would be harmony expressed throughout the universe—yet the surface realm of our planet would be the aberrant exception to the rule. </p>

<p>But then again, we live in a consciousness matrix so I&#39;m trying to remain open to all sorts of possibilities. Maybe higher dimensional entities will reveal to humanity that we live in a giant plastic Barbie Dreamhouse. That probably won&#39;t happen but I&#39;m trying to remain open and flexible with my perception of &quot;physical&quot; reality. </p>

<p>You should not argue in favor of things you cannot prove yourself simply because someone else told you it was so. Many people believe the earth is perfectly round, but that&#39;s easily disproved from the simple observation of Mount Everest.</p>

<p>The depths of the earth&#39;s oceans have never been fully explored and many people understand the moon landing was likely a hoax, but want to support narratives from those same agencies about other things such as the shape of planets. This is why you must prove it for yourself.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;but the scientific method&quot; is not good enough, if you yourself cannot use the scientific method to draw the same conclusion.</p>

<p>People say the scientific method proves vaccines or safe, but the scientific method also proves that the compounds contained in vaccines are harmful.</p>

<p>I find it strange that the flat earth/dome enclosed system was the norm since the bringing of time until Pythagoras came up with the ball earth though experiment. Then it was advanced by masons and jesuits. When the jesuits brought religion (and destruction) to native populations they also brought with them the flat earth model. </p>

<p>If you look into the history of ball earth ideology it is rife with religion, corruption, and a lack of scientific backing. </p>

<p>How the fuck do we see the same stars every night since ever? How the fuck do they spin in a perfect circle around Polaris? We are traveling 100,000’s of mikes through the Milky Way. How has nothing changed? Seriously. Oh is it relativity? Convienent. </p>

<p>Lastly, most of you guys are casuals when it comes to the truth of this world. We are controlled by occultists elites who control all aspects of our lives and say the opposite of the truth.

<p>Well, by your theory, every place on earth should see the same stars. But we don&#39;t. The southern hemisphere sees some constellations, the northern hemisphere sees others. People in the southern hemisphere cannot see polaris. </p>

<p>In fact, the reason they rotate around polaris in the northern hemisphere is because polaris is very far away but inline with our axis of rotation (within 1 degree). And the circle is not perfect, the images you see time lapse stars rotating around polaris are just intentionally centered on polaris. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well things do change, just the scale of the universe is so great that even as we hurtle through space, in our lifetimes, or even in humanities existence is but a trivial amount of time in the scheme of the rotation of the milkyway or galaxies moving relative to one another.  In 1 or 2 billion years things will look quite different. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe flat earthing posts, or more like barrage of making fun of flat earthers on reddit, precedes some major political or propoganda campaign. Its quet now, but when the front page floods with flat earther jokes. A day or two later some major news thing pops up, usually to be false or flalse flag. Happened before syrian gas attacks, happened before scripals, happened before 13 torlly bois russian trolls, happened recently with the ICE, before the news broke out reddit was again flooded with flat earther posts(making fun of, havnt actually met a legitimate flat earther....). </p>

<p>Why? Well I think in order to get people on board with acceoting the lie, or to go with official narrative, they stigmatise conspiracy theorists with the most ludicrous and stupid conspiracy, the flat earth. Humanity knew earth was round before ancient greece! Yet this persists. And when you browse comments of such bullshit posts that are the false narratives of the msm, you meet a circle jerk supporting the claims. Ythose that question or propose a conspriracy, are met with downvotes. </p>

<p>That video was a savage debunk of the ships over the horizon thing, we can watch a boat “sail over the horizon” and then zoom in to see it didn’t and then watch it “sail over the horizon” again and again and again for however far your camera is good if the conditions permit. </p>

<p>Savage debunk of the spinning pear, pretty solid proof the earth is flat thanks for sharing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he cherrypicked the zoom dishonestly.</p>

<p>go outside to the beach yourself with a nice zoom camera. Watch a ship sailing away from you sail fully &quot;over the curve&quot;. Then you can zoom in until you can see the bottom of the boat agian like he showed, but then if you hold the zoom still you can watch it &quot;sail over the horizon&quot; again and bring the bottom of the boat back in again.</p>

<p>It is about perspective and the vanishing point, and obviously not about cured water and we can know so because we can keep bringing the bottom of the boat back into full view indefinitly. </p>

<p>Yes you can bring it back in from &quot;halfway over the horizon&quot; because the earth is flat. What he did was shamelessly dishonest and actually proved that you just need to zoom in to see boats after they &quot;sail over the curve&quot;. </p>
