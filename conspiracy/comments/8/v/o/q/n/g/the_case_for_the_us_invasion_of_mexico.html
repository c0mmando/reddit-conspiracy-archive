        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a propostetous idea: Let&quot;s fight our next war on behalf of the US citizens. Instead of destroying Iran for Israel, let&#39;s invade Mexico. Mexico has done far more damage to the US than Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Iran have combined. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mexico is a narco-state that is the primary route for drugs into the US. Its open border is responsible for the opioid crisis. </p></li>
<li><p>Mexico promotes illegal immigration into the US, which has decimated the standard of living of the US lower classes. </p></li>
<li><p>Mexico allows manufacturers to relocate their in order to skirt environmental responsibility and avoid having to pay a living wage. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>By invading Mexico, the US can depose the utterly corrupt government and install its own puppet government that stabilizes the country with the backing of the US military. Stability will remove the incentive for illegal immigration and encorage would-be illegal immigrants to improve their country instead of destroying ours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Illegal, but Not Undocumented
Identity Theft, Document Fraud, and Illegal Employment</p>

<p>This Backgrounder examines illegal immigration-related document fraud and identity theft that is committed primarily for the purpose of employment. It debunks three common misconceptions: illegal aliens are “undocumented;” the transgressions committed by illegal aliens to obtain jobs are minor; and illegal-alien document fraud and identity theft are victimless crimes. It discusses how some community leaders rationalize these crimes, contributing to a deterioration of the respect for laws in our nation, and presents a variety of remedies, including more widespread electronic verification of work status (E-Verify and the Social Security Number Verification Service) and immigrant outreach programs to explain the ramifications and risks of document fraud and identity theft.</p>

<p>The findings include:</p>

<p>Illegal immigrants are not “undocumented.” They have fraudulent documents such as counterfeit Social Security cards, forged drivers licenses, fake “green cards,” and phony birth certificates. Experts suggest that approximately 75 percent of working-age illegal aliens use fraudulent Social Security cards to obtain employment.
Most (98 percent) Social Security number (SSN) thieves use their own names with stolen numbers. The federal E-Verify program, now mandated in only 14 states, can detect this fraud. Universal, mandatory use of E-Verify would curb this and stop virtually 100 percent of child identity theft.
Illegal immigration and high levels of identity theft go hand-in-hand. States with the most illegal immigration also have high levels of job-related identity theft. In Arizona, 33 percent or all identity theft is job-related (as opposed to identity theft motivated simply by profit). In Texas it is 27 percent; in New Mexico, 23 percent; in Colorado, 22 percent; California, 20 percent; and in Nevada, 16 percent. Eight of the 10 states with the highest percentage of illegal aliens in their total population are among the top 10 states in identity theft (Arizona, California, Florida, Texas, Nevada, New York, Georgia, and Colorado).
Children are prime targets. In Arizona, it is estimated that over one million children are victims of identity theft. In Utah, 1,626 companies were found to be paying wages to the SSNs of children on public assistance under the age of 13. These individuals suffer very real and very serious consequences in their lives.
Illegal aliens commit felonies in order to get jobs. Illegal aliens who use fraudulent documents, perjure themselves on I-9 forms, and commit identity theft in order to get jobs are committing serious offenses and are not “law abiding.”
Illegally employed aliens send billions of dollars annually to their home countries, rather than spending it in the United States and helping stimulate the American economy. In October 2008 alone, $2.4 billion was transferred to Mexico.
Tolerance of corruption erodes the rule of law. Corruption is a serious problem in most illegal aliens’ home countries. Allowing it to flourish here paves the way for additional criminal activity and increased corruption throughout society.
Leaders support perpetrators and ignore victims. Political, civic, religious, business, education, and media leaders blame Americans for “forcing” illegal aliens to commit document fraud and identity theft. No similar concern is expressed for the American men, women, and children whose lives are destroyed in the process.
The Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service facilitate illegal immigrant-driven identity theft. Both turn a blind eye to massive SSN fraud and take no action to stop it. The Social Security Administration assigns SSNs to new-born infants that are being used illegally. The IRS demands that victims pay taxes on wages earned by illegal aliens using their stolen SSNs, while taking no action to stop the identity theft.
State and local governments need to adopt tougher laws to supplement federal efforts. The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is targeting large document fraud rings and the most egregious employers, but their resources are limited and stretched across multiple priorities. In 2007, identity theft cases represented only 7 percent of the total ICE case load.
Employers must do their part. They can ensure that they have a legal workforce by using a combination of the federal government’s E-Verify and Social Security Number Verification Service systems and by signing up for the federal government’s IMAGE program or privately conducted audits.</p>

I don&#39;t disagree with those facts at all. I worked construction for a long time though and can confidently say that there are still many undocumented workers as well. 
      There are many who have fraudulent identities too, as you pointed out. 
     I&#39;m just not seeing that they get stuff for free. </p>

<p>Illegal immigration was the answer for companies that couldn&#39;t take advantage of disastrous trade agreements like NAFTA. Plus, illegal immigration has the added bonus of weakening the classes that would oppose the globalist subversion of the US government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, my initial comment was meant to be more facetious than anything. Personally, I&#39;ve seen a lot of shady shit from illegals. I was born in Michigan and I&#39;ll tell you this, I&#39;m sick of seeing people talking advantage of the system. Families where the guy works but his &quot;wife&quot; and kids are on Medicaid and getting assistance because he doesn&#39;t claim his income and they are, guess what, illegal. I&#39;ve seen people who were born and raised here get turned down for assistance because they made too much. We can go on and on about this but in the end it is all by design. It keeps us at each other&#39;s throats while the political and ruling class treat us all like pieces of a puzzle. My dad has a degree in human resource management and I always thought that the term human resources was an ironic one. We are resources to the people who run the place. The main point I&#39;m trying to get at is that it&#39;s dangerous to talk about invading sovereign nations as if there aren&#39;t people around the globe talking about doing the same thing to us. We have set dangerous precedents with some of the things we have done. </p>
