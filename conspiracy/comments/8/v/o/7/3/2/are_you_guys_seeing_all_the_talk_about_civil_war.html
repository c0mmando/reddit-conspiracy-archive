<p>I don&#39;t really watch his stuff but That flat earth British guy was the one who informed me that reenactments began immediately after the war ended. Which is suspect on its own but I&#39;ve don&#39;t my own analysis of the photographic evidence from the time and many images are absurd. </p>

<p>There is a blogger who goes by cat-779 who I&#39;m not sure Reddit will let me link to. They have some compelling blogs about the falsification of photographic evidence and how photoshop has been liberally used to construct the current historical narrative. They have some other ideas which are indeed out there even by my standards but it&#39;s good exercise in entertaining new ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love that you start off with &quot;the British Flat Earther&quot; informed you.  The Flat Earth theory is maybe the most ridiculous conspiracy theory and the easiest to disprove.  I am glad it exists though because it makes it easy to ID fringe members of society, kinda like the auditory version of visible neck tattoos.  </p>

<p>The Civil War didn&#39;t happen and was all an elaborate hoax?  Honestly, this is the first time I have ever heard of this theory and it&#39;s a doosie. Easily the single most written about event in American history.  Millions of pages of letters from thousands of people document the war.  Hundreds if not thousands of diaries.  Physical evidence in the form of pictures, buttons, belt buckles, weapons, etc.  Archeological recovery of Graves, campsites, battlefields.  Veterans lived until the 30s thousands of them with  amputations.  (You really have to admire their dedication to perpetuating the hoax).  </p>

<p>Okay, I think that does it.   Is there like an official vote or ratification for an official Debunked status that we can stamp these two with?   I have made reasonable  arguments dispelling both the Flat Earth and Fake Civil War, let us speak of these no more.</p>

<p>Only takes a few at a protest to shoot at the police for them to shoot back and then bring more people out. Just look at Colour Revolutions. Thankfully many Americans are too fat to walk 1km, and their brains are putty so pose no real threat. As well as the populace being conditioned to poverty, oblivious to how bad they actually have it.</p>

<p>Just read any askreddit about rich people and it&#39;s simple things Americans want like walking to school, being able to cycle instead of driving everywhere, not having to worry about short periods of unemployment and healthcare. This things aren&#39;t even that radical, but won&#39;t happen any time soon. Corporate interests are king in the USA.</p>

<p>Russian professor named Igor Panarin was making rounds in that country&#39;s policy-making circles, also doing his best to undermine America. The map below is his creation. Released in 1998, it predicted the breakup of the U.S. into six pieces by 2010.</p>

<p>He seems to suggest that each would be its own republic, but if not, that  the North would fall under Canadian influence, the South would fold into Mexico&#39;s sphere of influence, the West would go to China, the East to the E.U., Hawaii to Japan or China, and of course Alaska would be returned to Russia.</p>

<p>man, this shit is confusing. On the one hand, if it prevents civil wars, then I&#39;m all for it. On the other hand, dividing us makes us weaker.</p>

<p>Democrats specifically are horrible with fiscal policies, and taxes are highest in democratically lead states. They end up selling out key infrastructure to foreign countries. See the Chicago parking meters being owned via Lease by Saudis.</p>

<p>If this happens, the DEM zones will sell out to foreigners and being divided in this way makes us weaker. </p>

<p>It makes the <em>state,</em> meaning the federal government, weaker. A strong state is the cause of many of the problems in the US, and many problems across the globe are caused by that state. A strong federal government has helped the common man at some points in our history, but today it&#39;s size, bureaucracy and corruption make it the among the worst governments in the developed world. </p>

<p>I never said that it would? That said, it would help eliminate certain animosities, obligations, and would unite the people.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I reread and see it was a loose Confederacy you mentioned. </p>

<p>But the same dynamic would still be in play. Inter-regional trade would generate the same level of resource conflicts and trade problems. The subsidies and obligations would just be within regions and the same discord would exist just at a different scale. </p>

<p>Also I grew up a military kid and spent a decade in myself. The regional differences really are not as big as people think. I have lived in Hawaii, Arizona, Florida, Vermont, Texas, Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee and North Carolina. And I have traveled to all the states minus the Dakotas and Maine. In my experiences the bigger difference is city versus rural and not state versus state.</p>

<p>The diverse nature of our country is actually what allows it to endure everyone can find a place that fits them best. If we throw up more borders and walls we will lose that strength. </p>

<p>But that’s the thing, the vast majority of people don’t see themselves as being on either side in most of these cases. The center right wants nothing to do with neo-Nazis, and the center left wants nothing to do with Antifa (once they understand that they stand for a lot more than just anti-fascism). There have been some instances of Antifa attacking the center right, and even in those cases the center left considers the violence uncalled for. </p>

<p>That’s one of the nice things about living in a democratic society. People who actually believe in democracy do not condone violence to promote their narrow political objectives. Democracy may not be perfect, but the peace that it brings to a society or a group of countries is very beneficial.</p>

<p>In America the pendulum swings, and it&#39;s swinging with more energy now then it ever has before.  When the pendulum swings back, the left is going to do some really extreme things.  I&#39;ll guarantee it.

    <div class="md"><p>The left in this country have overextended themselves alienating reasonable democrats, hence the #walkaway movement. There&#39;s a vocal minority that&#39;s mischaracterized almost every move Trump makes and people are beginning to see through that nonsense. I for one am not at all concerned. The Democratic party is dying and is refusing to do so quietly. </p>

<p>They can try to pack the courts if they like but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll have the opportunity to do so unless they change their methods drastically. People are brighter than liberals believe and aren&#39;t falling for their extremist politics and pulled heartstrings any longer. All the evidence necessary to see this is in the White House. Trump is the reaction to the left losing it&#39;s collective(ist) mind.</p>

<p>And as far as states refusing to cooperate with the federal government, I believe that is a good thing. State&#39;s rights have been ignored for far too long and if a state goes overboard, people will relocate to a place that better suits their priorities and life goals. The people fleeing California right now should be evidence enough of that.</p>

<p>All I see is people screaming at the sky and throwing a temper tantrum. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter, and I&#39;m not a casual observer. I have lived in urban and rural areas and think I have a pretty good understanding of the current zeitgeist. </p>

<p>I could be wrong and maybe I am, but what I see is people tired of being taken advantage of by the political elite. I think the country by and large had an agenda of it&#39;s own putting Trump in charge. Trump represents everything that goes against what the tenor was in DC before he was elected. This was the country effectively doing what they could to put the government in check. How else do you reconcile the 90 minutes of no incoming vote totals on election night? Trump won by such a large margin that the powers that were realized they couldn&#39;t cover up the fact that he had overcome the rigging of an election no matter how they tried to math around it (and yes I just used math as a verb).</p>

<p>Russia or China would never be stupid enough to do something like that. Never mind the possibility of the US government responding, it would make millions of Americans into of well-financed, well-armed terrorists against whichever country carried out the attack. Blowback like the US sees after 60 years of messing with the Middle East, but on steroids. </p>

<p>In a civil war scenerio, I&#39;d take 1 jamal before I&#39;d take 5 jimbos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the American public lives way too comfortably, including the so-called &#39;oppressed&#39; and heroes of justice, to consider going to civil war. If it&#39;s part of a masonic simulation, that level of &#39;comfort&#39; can be easily taken away systematically by a global war and that will eventually culminate to a civil war. Honestly, a power shift is the only thing that can save America. For the most part, it doesn&#39;t matter if Hillary or Trump is in power; American foreign policy and the Christian holy war narrative has been consistent across parties. This needs to change. How that change can be brought about depends on everyone and how far they are willing to sacrifice.</p>

<p>TPTB are going to get everyone worked up until riots and serious clashes break out, then the government can step in and impose a martial law for a threat that never seems to go away.

    <div class="md"><p>I could see it happening if the internet/power grid got blacked out or peoples smart phones stopped working. Otherwise people in this country are too fat and lazy and dont even know why theyre upset anymore. Too busy looking at their phones. I keep seeing all these videos about civil war pop up on youtube and shit the past few days like... why? Is there some major thing happening politically thats out of the norm that im unaware of...? Cause it doesnt feel any different and its not like some huge crisis is going on. I feel like there has been a lot of manufactured nonsense and rhetoric about it for years now so maybe thats the plan. Get it in the public conciousness then knock out the power grid and we all wake up and our phones arent working, nobody has a generator or food supply to last more than a few days sooo it could have the potential to pop off fairly easily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only see it online and at coverage of any sort of unrest/protest. I legitimately have never felt IRL that we are heading towards a civil war with one another, maybe feeling people waking up and a revolution of sorts...but not a civil war. Not that many people care THAT much in real life to fight a war over the president.</p>

<p>I assume it is a lot like video game forums, the majority of issues and complaints are vocalized by a small minority in the group (regardless of right or wrong) while the rest while still recognizing faults and flaws just don&#39;t put forth the effort.</p>

<p>Obviously I&#39;m simplifying it a lot but I genueily do not feel we are heading towards a civil war. Who would fight in it? Who&#39;s my general? How to I get supplies for the front-line? Who EXACTLY are my &#39;enemies&#39;? Who is their leader? The whole thing is so dumb when you really think about the logistics of our admittedly half fat nation fighting with one another.</p>

<p>It blows my mind all the hate that man is getting from the left. I think they expose themselves when they go after him.

The weird psychological effect he has on the left with the reasons they come up to hate on his are truly bizarre.</p>

<p>How are you are not worried about Trump? The country is about to tear itself apart while Trump destroys our standing in the world, our economy with these tax cuts and trade tariffs are while helping Russia achieve their geopolitical goals. You think Trump cares about the constitution or Christianity? Really? I can debunk that real quick if you want to go there.</p>

<p>I see that last part happening if Trump takes over too. Trump hates the 1st amendment. He only like the 2nd because those are the people who are going to fight for him when the shit hits the fan.</p>

<p>This whole thing with Trump vs the Deep State is pro wrestling. Yea, he&#39;s ending the world order and bringing in the NEW World Order. That&#39;s the whole point of this. The Illuminati and all the elites, they were just pawns to set up the board so Trump could come in and look like the hero taking down the bad guys when he IS the bad guy. He&#39;s a Trojan horse. He&#39;s the one who&#39;s going to bring about the NWO one world government. Did you think they were going to do it in an obvious way when so many people know about the plan? They LET us all know about the plan so they could use our own knowledge against us. Obama was a red herring to get everyone all riled up to vote for Trump. The NRA wasn&#39;t arming the people for a rebellion against a tyrannical government, they were arming the people to fight FOR one. Trump has been groomed for this for decades. Why do you think he was the leader of the birther movement? How do you think that got started? What about the fact that they made him into like a Reagan 2.0 that doesn&#39;t strike you as odd? And the biggest tell of all. He literally checks every box of the authoritarian, Fox News watching conspiratorial Christian conservative right. Goes after the &quot;liberal media<br/>
, The Clinton&#39;s and Obama, strong support of police and the military, speaks up for the working class, hardcore against illegal immigration, hardcore against Muslims, speaks about secret government factions and fights against them.</p>

<p>You take the left&#39;s response of foaming at the mouth as a sign that Trump is doing something right? That&#39;s not exactly a good measuring stick.</p>

The right use to be aware of this and regard them as our enemy and now the mere suggestion that Russia would do that is met with jokes of fake news and silly conspiracy theorists.

<p>You have to give me a little credit here, you seem to support him more than not. Being a libertarian has little to do with anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>acceptance and understanding of how things are, does not equal, supporting him more than not</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I never claimed you were anti-American and if you are a full on Trump supporter than you are not on whatever side I am on because those people refuse to listen to anything that isn&#39;t pro Trump. Trust me, I&#39;ve tried a ton of them. But seeing as you say you&#39;re just sort of on the edge, I&#39;ll gladly take that position and see if I can maybe push you over to the other side some more, if you&#39;re open to discussion about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its the same deal with left. I&#39;ve tried to talk to the left, and they wont listen. You&#39;re not gonna push me to any side, believe me. I&#39;m also guessing you are lacking my context which includes reading certain books, understanding certain history, understanding culture, etc. If you&#39;re not well read and understood on topics such as the cultural influence of atheistic nihilism, then you wont get where Im coming from</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It blows my mind all the hate that man is getting from the left. I think they expose themselves when they go after him. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its another example why the left is dead to me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I sincerely think they attack him for the grave sin of trying to help out young men, more specifically white men. Since white men are their sworn enemy, helping them makes you the enemy too. The weird psychological effect he has on the left with the reasons they come up to hate on his are truly bizarre.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another example why the left has gone insane and is dead to me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How are you are not worried about Trump? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>NK peace talks, closed borders, tariff renegotiations, didnt sign TPP or Paris agreement (both globalist scams) and the controlled propaganda media absolutely tears him to shreds unlike Obama. That&#39;s all I had to see to be okay with it all</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The country is about to tear itself apart while Trump destroys our standing in the world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hardly. He&#39;s deeply respected in asian countries. Last time Obama went to China he was bowing and they never even rolled out the red carpet, they saw him as weak and spineless.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/barack-obama-deliberately-snubbed-by-chinese-in-chaotic-arrival-at-g20">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/04/barack-obama-deliberately-snubbed-by-chinese-in-chaotic-arrival-at-g20</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>our economy with these tax cuts and trade tariffs are</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our GDP is at 4.8% which is UNTHINKABLE at this time and China just agreed to lower some tariffs and negotiate. Are you ok with us getting ripped off and leaving things the way they are, or would you rather see someone negotiate so there is more $ for the country and more fair trade?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are while helping Russia achieve their geopolitical goals. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is? Would you rather we kill each other in WW3 or be in peace talks?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think Trump cares about the constitution or Christianity? Really? I can debunk that real quick if you want to go there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, he went to military school where you eat, sleep, breath patriotism. Also, it all depends how he grew up as a child, how his parents were to him, that will establish how he really is in his heart</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump hates the 1st amendment. He only like the 2nd because those are the people who are going to fight for him when the shit hits the fan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doubt it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yea, Trump supporters think America belongs to them and sharing the pie with other groups means their country is being taken from them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cant just leave your borders wide open, let everyone in, and give freebees to everyone. U.S. has always been built on checks and balances, same deal here</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This whole thing with Trump vs the Deep State is pro wrestling. Yea, he&#39;s ending the world order and bringing in the NEW World Order. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other way around. The NWO was what the bohemian grove and skull and bones guys were doing. It includes getting rid of borders, flood of migrants, destabilizing the economies, endless wars, wage/debt slavery, having everyone chipped, signing globalist agreements like TPP/Paris, and so on. You misread the links. NWO is pissed that trump is in, Soros, who is one of them, has openly said this and is meeting in secret with the DNC:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/soros-holding-secret-democratic-meeting-pelosi-plan-overthrow-hamdan">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/soros-holding-secret-democratic-meeting-pelosi-plan-overthrow-hamdan</a></p>

<p>DNC, Pelosi, Soros, and all who are at that meeting are NWO Globalists</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s the one who&#39;s going to bring about the NWO one world government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. If this was true, he would have signed TPP and Paris</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do you think he was the leader of the birther movement? How do you think that got started? What about the fact that they made him into like a Reagan 2.0 that doesn&#39;t strike you as odd? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being a &quot;birther&quot; is a bad look. He had to eventually admit he no longer is one during his campaign. I&#39;ve always been a birther, still am</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Goes after the &quot;liberal media, the Clinton&#39;s and Obama, hardcore nationalist, strong support of police and the military, speaks up for the working class, hardcore against illegal immigration, hardcore against Muslims, speaks about secret government factions and fights against them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, all of that proves he&#39;s not one of them. If he was, then he wouldn&#39;t be what you just said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You take the left&#39;s response of foaming at the mouth as a sign that Trump is doing something right? That&#39;s not exactly a good measuring stick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. The left is a Soros/Globalist psy op, anti-white, feelings based, socialists/communists, believe in propagandist media, and have gone completely insane at this point. The only one left who has any sort of normalcy that I like is Tulsi Gabbard</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soros is the forever boogeyman of the right. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Go use the search bar in this sub. Soros has always been a bad dude, part of the illuminati. He&#39;s been enemy number 1 or 2 since forever. The right adopted this view because they started doing their research and finding out what we conspiracy theorists already know since forever </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Russia has been sowing discord in America for the past century. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure perhaps, but so is China, Soros, Rothschilds, Globalists, Cultural marxists, Post modernists, Banksters, M.I.C., and so on</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The right use to be aware of this and regard them as our enemy and now the mere suggestion that Russia would do that is met with jokes of fake news and silly conspiracy theorists. Why the sudden change?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the russian collusion thing is a fake witch hunt. There are no smoking guns, no impeachment, Mueller has nothing. Read the wikileaks hillary emails, &quot;Russia&quot; is robbie mooks brain child</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the lefts reaction to Trump in either 2020 or 2024 when they inevitably take over will decide if the future of this country.</p>

<p>I believe we ARE at a decisive point in history, and while Trump can take the first move, he doesn&#39;t get to decide the whole thing.  The fact is half this country wants to move towards something called &quot;socialism&quot;.  The progressive left is showing us exactly what they mean when they say that.   To 50&amp;#37; of the country, that sounds like the perfect agenda.  It will be an agenda with identity politics, economic equality, and for some reason gun control.  Anti-Immigration will be replaced with open borders.  It will be an equal and opposite reaction to Trump + all the stuff Bernie stood for.</p>

<p>The other 50&amp;#37; of the country believes &quot;socialism&quot; is a 4 letter word, and will see the policies of the left as an indication we have a tyrannical leftist government.  Comparisons to Hitler will be replaced with comparisons to Stalin and Mao.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the wedge though.  This is situation normal today, but each side can just say &quot;VOTE!&quot;, but with the latest development with the supreme court, the left is going to lose their ability to enact the policies they want.  They the house, senate, and presidency, but if the court strikes down every policy they make, they&#39;ll never win.  So the only thing they can do is pack the courts.  Remember the constitution doesn&#39;t specify how many judges are allowed in the court.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s what&#39;s going to break the system.  If they pack the court, they&#39;re GOING to start pushing a bunch of things that would make the right go CRAZY.  It&#39;s made worse because today they think they&#39;re winning.  Losing something you thought you won is worse then never having it in the first place.</p>

<p>So Then, there&#39;s a few scenarios... but here&#39;s how it played out in the past.  A few &quot;Red&quot; states will decide not to comply with the new &quot;laws&quot;.  Well with the courts gone, there is no &quot;civil&quot; way to deal with that issue.  History shows us how that plays out.</p>

<p>And </p>

It seriously would never actually come down to any civil war though because the people calling for it are just not capable of establishing anything like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is that you?  Come on mate, stop with this hope porn. Nothing is going to happen, nobody is going to be arrested.  Stop waiting for the already exposed, corrupt government to make these supposed mass arrests of the cabal, it&#39;s just never going to happen.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve fallen for a pretty sophisticated pycsop in Q. Don&#39;t feel bad about it, but stop hanging your hat on this fairy tale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are saying that the deep state is liberal? I am under the impression they are anything but liberal and only one side uses liberal ideology as a control mechanism. In so much as their ‘white hat’ counterparts use religion as a control method with conservatives. All of the deep white/black hat power players are suppressing the populous for their own gain but from different positions. </p>

<p>The whole white and black hat BS is just different 1% groups controlling resources and money to retain power. </p>

<p>When it comes to survival liberal or conservative minded people will defend or attack as needed to secure their basic needs and protect their families, friends and neighbors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re thinking too short term.  Think about how Trump supporters feel today.  Look how they think they&#39;re winning.  Look at the extreme stuff that&#39;s happening.  It IS extreme.  Now look at the extreme reaction on the left.</p>

<p>In America the pendulum swings, and it&#39;s swinging with more energy now then it ever has before.  When the pendulum swings back, the left is going to do some really extreme things.  I&#39;ll guarantee it.  What do you think &quot;the side with all the guns&quot; is going to do when the left packs the courts, effectively repeals the second amendment, and starts enacting laws that the right labels &quot;socialist&quot;.</p>

<p>There will be an equal and opposite reaction.  Except, if they pack the courts, there is no &quot;legal&quot; way to have an opposite reaction.</p>
