       I see the main problem with this sub is that real discussion has become impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are always going to have different perspectives on any given subject. This sub used to be able to handle that civilly or at least way more civilly than now.
      </p>
      <p>
       We used to be called/call our selves "truthers" and "truth seeker".  When a post came up the comment section was the community coming together to get to the bottom of the subject. To distill the truth from a source. To comb through evidence and critique it on it's merit.  This made this sub powerful and dangerous to some. The human brain is like a super computer. Get a bunch of them together and focused on a problem and they will get to the bottom of it. Think back to past false flags. Within hours info is brought in that really solidifies questioning the validity of the official narrative. That is why we are dangerous to some. That is why to some it is advantageous to have us divided.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the comment sections are no longer filled with people intellectually debating the subject matter. They are filled with partisan pandering, attacks and insults, circlejerks, and forum sliding.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need a plan to get this sub's discourse back on track. I have a plan. It is not a fully worked out plan, but at least a direction to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the old days the base community of this sub would intellectually debate the subject matter. This was the norm and those that did otherwise stuck out like a sore thumb. We need to get the discussion back on track and reestablish that as the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I propose that through some methods a voluntary system is created. To where if I make a link post or a self post I could ad some kind of flair or other signifier. When the OP of the post voluntarily uses the signifier then all comment discussion is strictly enforced to being debate on the post topic only.  No insults, trolling, forum sliding (whataboutism/changing the subject)... just no off topic comments. This may even require a new rule. And will require attentive mods to enforce. If you aren't intellectually and civilly discussing the topic of the post then your comment gets removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When forced to actually discuss the topic intellectually and debate the truthfulness of subjects you will see many of the disrupters can not hang with that kind of system. Many are basically cliche/MSN quote people at heart and don't have a thinking bone in their body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this will be extra work for the mods. They will have to be involved in the posts and undestand the context to even be able to say someone is off topic.  But with 3000+ users at any given time the mods should be playing a more active role in protecting real discussion anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a perfect world I envision this system of "post topic debate only" to be set up to where you can not vote on the post or comments unless you have made a comment participating in the topic debate. That would be an awesome thing. But I do not think the mods have that kind of tools available to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think getting the discussion back on track is the answer. I do not know the best way to implement a system like this. But after a short period we can get the sub back on track and retrained on how to have civil intellectual debate.

       I get that but what happens when you need a ladder to step over the bullshit comments? I don't know the answers. I just know that the comment sections need to protect real discussion. Even if they are 2  people with totally different views going back and forth on the subject citing this or that.. That is a real discussion. It is everything else that clutters a post and makes people think it isn't even worth it to discuss. All most always the top comment is not even about the subject of the post. At least on one that is controversial or political. .

       I agree. We are always kicking around ideas back there, but we have been traditionally very reluctant to change the rules. Ideally, for the spirit of this forum to remain intact, we need to be moderating as little as humanly possible. But I think most of the mods are kinda at the point where we say
       <em>
        fuck this shit
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Submission statements were the first attempt at curbing the bullshit. And imo it helped a good amount. Don't be surprised if you see more changes in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The state of the sub is definitely on our minds, and if you think we are missing any of the garbage going on...believe me, we aren't. The report queue is the distilled essence ofcancer on the sub, and we probably spend more time there than acting as a user.

       Really it just boils down to the mods taking a more active role in protecting real discussion. I think some subject matter would not need or want the extra subject focused rule. That is the only reason I mention a tag.

       The whole comment sections of some subject matter become completely overran with garbage. You have to go to the bottom downvoted comments to find any real discussion. And because of that most will think it is a waste of time to actually try to have real discussion because the comment section is garbage anyways. So ignoring is what we have been doing and real discussion becomes less and less because of it.

       Anything controversial that people get all emotionally worked up about. Mainly political related subjects. But politics is a large part of conspiracy.  I don't see some one making a general post on UFO really having to worry about real discussion being hindered.

       It would be a lot of work for the mods, but it sounds nice. Most threads related to something controversial get a lot of low quality comments, it's always kind of been like this, but much worse in the past couple years with the political conspiracies being front and center.

       On every legitimate thread, a joke answer/comment is within the top 5 comments. It's a few weeks away from having pun chains.

       I'm a skeptic that comes here to mostly browse and occasionally ask questions to better understand someone's positions. If I see an interesting discussion topic and find the top level comment to be "he ate too much CIA cum," I immediately fuck off somewhere else until I come back a week later to browse again.

       Maybe [Serious] tags or just a general better interest in the user base to actually discuss or answer posts.

       We have tried the No Meta tag a few times and I think it has worked pretty good. Any off topic, trolling, sliding comments are removed from those posts.
      </p>

       It has also been suggested to make the comments default to controversial instead of best, but I’m not sure it that has been tried yet.

       Yeah, it means no "meta" conversation: that is, conversation about the sub, the users, the mods, other subs, etc. Only on-topic conversation germane to the post is allowed. Users can comment on meta-aspects of the thread as a reply to the sticky comment, which is collapsed by default.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe two of those posts were stickied at one point, and from a mod perspective, they were generally easier to moderate and had less off-topic comments to begin with.

      <p>
       I'd like to expand the usage of these [no meta] posts and eventually open them up to users as well as mods.

       Hasn't been tried yet for users. I've been trying to get more of the mods to make their own [no meta] posts first, and a couple have so far. I'd say there's a fair bit of support on the mod team for the idea and not too much open resistance at least; I think it's more inertia at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to have a few more data points before we just open it up to all users, and a bit more clarity on what is and isn't allowed. I think ideally, any [no meta] post should itself be stated in neutral terms rather than taking a side. I.e., rather than "Trump colluded with Putin" or "Russiagate is a DNC smear job", the OP should be more along the lines of
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         "[No meta] discussion on the claims of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign"
        </strong>
        :
       </p>
       <p>
        Person A of institution X claims &lt;...&gt;. Person B of institution Y claims &lt;...&gt;.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       OP can certainly take a position in the comments, but the post being neutral can help prevent the discussion from devolving into personal attacks rather than substantive claims and arguments with sources to back them up.

       If you want to see this happen (or anyone else reading this), I'd suggest you bug the mod team to implement. It's easier to get consensus on the mod team when we have long-time users advocating for something.

        Even if they are 2 people with totally different views going back and forth on the subject citing this or that.. That is a real discussion.

       I've an idea! What if we had a flair tag that was "research and discussion" and defined that as "comments are only to explore the subject". That would allow discussion but also require the contributor to add or question.

       I haven't thought it through much and it is similar to [no meta] but is reinforcing the positive rather than highlighting the restrictions.

       Ideally it could work but considering some of the mods themselves have proved incapable of this sort of discussion I think the deleting of comments wouldn’t always happen in a fair way. Not to mention some already try manipulate discussion with mod powers. I think it’s really upto us to do better and hope that other people join in till it becomes the norm

       Hey, I thought there
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a tool which prevented voting without both a subscription and thread participation... I've definitely arrived at subs from r/all where I just couldn't vote on posts. Or did I just wrongly assume the reasons behind it?

       I think we are doing great. The fact that they are shilling, keeps us relevant.
