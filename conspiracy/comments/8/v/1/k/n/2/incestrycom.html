    <div class="md"><p>They explicitly state the legislation that compells them, which if you look it up will tell you the minimum required information to comply.    </p>

<p>They also mention that they will only comply where it relates to an active court case. That is to say the prosecution have to already have a suspect with enough evidence against them to take them to trial. Try actually reading the link I gave you.       </p>

<p>They&#39;d lose chain of custody if they sent it anywhere, negating the validity of the data in a court of law.

    <div class="md"><p>the bioweapons! THATS WHY IM AFRAID i’m asking questions but apparently i’m just uneducated and making up stories. it’s enthnicity and ancestry. RACE. which ancestral lineage has which types of genes which can do this type of thing in this spot. </p>

<p>i just worry over the current police state, and anything that gives them an edge (facial recognition etc) i’m against. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>DNA is big business. Especially as the biomedical industry is growing (due to a demographically aging population). Places like Ancestry.com and 23andMe are selling data to marketers, who can then pitch medications to you based on your genetic proclivity to, say, heart disease or asthma. </p>

<p>More sinisterly, though, such information could easily be used to frame you for a crime you didn&#39;t commit.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, your DNA was found at this crime scene!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I wasn&#39;t even in the state!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? You think Science lies?&quot;</p>

<p>(Of course it does.)</p>

<p>Just like when fingerprints started being used and the police in Chicago pioneered a way to put a person&#39;s finger on scotch tape, whereupon they took the tape to a scene and rubbed it on any surface they wanted. Presto! Instant fingerprint evidence. </p>

<p>DNA will be a very good way to frame people for crimes they didn&#39;t commit and to hoodwink jurors.</p>

<p>It will also eventually be used (as you suggested) for bioweapons. Gene-specific poisons and toxins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this was just a really good idea by law enforcement. They have DNA, but they have no hits in their database, so they send it to a company whose business is finding relatives. The company takes it in whatever form, and then they figure out their relatives and go from there. I don&#39;t see how that violates anyone&#39;s rights. This isn&#39;t a conspiracy so much as it is a clever use of a publicly-available database. It&#39;s not much different than those cases where the suspect drove a unique car, so they search the registry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i perhaps am conflating “may share with third parties” to ownership but it’s the sample they owned and do with it what they pleased before changing privacy policies. not your dna code as if they owned you specifically. and that’s not even true. supreme court ruled discarded dna admissible in court </p>
