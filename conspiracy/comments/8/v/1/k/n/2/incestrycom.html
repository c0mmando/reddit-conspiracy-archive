       how do police using ancestry and other dna databases submit the dna from crime scenes to compare with the general population who’ve stupidly agreed to give away their dna?

       don’t those companies think it’s weird when they send in samples from semen and not mouth swabs?

       You are mistaken. He is saying;
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The police are using ancestry.com (actually he means 23&amp;me but close enough)
       </li>
       <li>
        That they are sending in sperm and the people at ancestry.com (actually 23&amp;me) apparently don't notice
       </li>
       <li>
        1&amp;2 allow them to check against a DNA database of the general public

        This is all a conspiracy to get our DNA.

       after reading their privacy policy i will admit i was wrong. they state they will not give information to law enforcement unless subpoena’d and you can have your sample discarded after analyzation. i will stubbornly say though, privacy policies change and it wasn’t always opt in. i guess what i’m confused about is i thought that california serial rapist was found using 23 and me, maybe it was a different company.

       If so, they used GEDmatch which is a free, opensource database where individuals voluntarily add their DNA to the database in return for free use of genealogical and DNA analysis tools.

       They explicitly state the legislation that compells them, which if you look it up will tell you the minimum required information to comply.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also mention that they will only comply where it relates to an active court case. That is to say the prosecution have to already have a suspect with enough evidence against them to take them to trial. Try actually reading the link I gave you.

       Look I'm sure that DNA seems very scary to someone who isn't familiar with genetics like yourself but making up random things and spreading them around isn't constructive.

       A privacy policy would never discuss ownership. That isn't what a privacy policy does.
      </p>
      <p>
       No licencing or terms of service agreement could legally claim ownership of another persons DNA. It would be illegal and would not stand up in court.  That simply did not happen, ever. I suggest you have read or heard some false speculation somewhere from another person making wild, unfounded claims.

       i perhaps am conflating “may share with third parties” to ownership but it’s the sample they owned and do with it what they pleased before changing privacy policies. not your dna code as if they owned you specifically. and that’s not even true. supreme court ruled discarded dna admissible in court

       At no stage has any company stated they may share a DNA sample with third parties for commercial benefit. The only way it would be legal to share the same is if they outsourced analysis to a third party lab.
      </p>
      <p>
       At no stage have they owned the sample of DNA in any way, shape or form. That is against international law, and had been upheld by the high court in several landmark cases involving pharmaceutical companies trying to patent gene sets.

       I doubt they're sending it in, they have they're own laboratory that can keep track of the chain of custody.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'd lose chain of custody if they sent it anywhere, negating the validity of the data in a court of law.  They are likely getting/giving the results of the sequence from ancestry.com and the other companies for comparison.  Once their is a hit, they are going and getting current DNA via discarded items by the perpetrator.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is then analyzed to make sure it matches with original sample, giving them enough evidence to make an arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't sending any biological matter to those companies, they likely have access to their database, which is scarier.

       Yep, they're just using that to get a closer hit to the perpetrator.  If you've looked at some of the recent catches, they were people that weren't even thought of as suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have mixed feelings about it, I'm more worried about it being used to tailor biological weapons to specific groups of people based on common vulnerable traits.  Or denying you life insurance because you have a propensity for cancer.

       DNA is big business. Especially as the biomedical industry is growing (due to a demographically aging population). Places like Ancestry.com and 23andMe are selling data to marketers, who can then pitch medications to you based on your genetic proclivity to, say, heart disease or asthma.
      </p>
      <p>
       More sinisterly, though, such information could easily be used to frame you for a crime you didn't commit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hey, your DNA was found at this crime scene!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "But I wasn't even in the state!"
      </p>
      <p>
       "What? You think Science lies?"
      </p>
      <p>
       (Of course it does.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like when fingerprints started being used and the police in Chicago pioneered a way to put a person's finger on scotch tape, whereupon they took the tape to a scene and rubbed it on any surface they wanted. Presto! Instant fingerprint evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       DNA will be a very good way to frame people for crimes they didn't commit and to hoodwink jurors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will also eventually be used (as you suggested) for bioweapons. Gene-specific poisons and toxins.

       I think this was just a really good idea by law enforcement. They have DNA, but they have no hits in their database, so they send it to a company whose business is finding relatives. The company takes it in whatever form, and then they figure out their relatives and go from there. I don't see how that violates anyone's rights. This isn't a conspiracy so much as it is a clever use of a publicly-available database. It's not much different than those cases where the suspect drove a unique car, so they search the registry.
