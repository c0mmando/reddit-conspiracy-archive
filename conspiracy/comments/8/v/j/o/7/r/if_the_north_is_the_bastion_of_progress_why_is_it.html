<p>&quot;In the last month, parents at the $45,485-per-year private school — which counts David Schwimmer, Christy Turlington Burns and Sofia Coppola’s offspring among its pupils — became aware that Director Philip Kassen would place minority middle-school students in the same homerooms come fall.</p>

<p>They also learned that the race-based placement policy had already been in effect for the 2017-18 school year for 7th and 8th graders, and would likely be expanded to the 6th grade in September.</p>

<p>Each grade, which has approximately 40 students, has two homerooms. Students remain with their homeroom groups for 30 percent of the school day.&quot;</p>

<p>If the north is a bastion of &quot;progress&quot; why are we seeing segregated graduation commencement ceremony&#39;s at Harvard? Why are private schools segregating children by race? Why are we seeing urban business&#39;s like Starbucks kicking black men out of their stores for looking wrong. Why is the north south racist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have the same issues here in my town. Charter schools are predominately white. I am not clear on the acceptance processes, but I know they get special funding aka better schools.</p>

<p>Gentrification of older minority neighborhoods are being scooped up by wealthy millennial&#39;s for pennies. They have access to special funding to rehab the homes from the Historical Foundation. Not that the original inhabitants do not have access to this same funding, they just don&#39;t have the means or ability to secure the rest of the funding it takes to rehab the homes. </p>

<p>Once the rehabs are complete, the property values increase, pushing the minorities out of the neighborhood as they can no longer afford the taxes. Multiply this across many minority neighborhoods throughout the city and they are left with no place to live. They are pushed to the outskirts of town, which have no access to public transportation. No transportation leads to not being able to get to work back to the very neighborhoods they once called home. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a terrible situation and I do not know the solution. What I do know is they scream &quot;progress and equality&quot; yet they are pushing out the very people they claim to care about with little regard of the outcome. </p>
