        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live very near Camden NJ. So that means every sort of drug, almost of any kind, is literally minutes from me. It&#39;s part of my life whether I want it or not.</p>

<p>I responded to a comment in r/paranormal about a person&#39;s friend and their behavior. Most commenters were talking about &#39;drugs&#39; being to blame without being specific of which one.</p>

<p>It prompted me to do a bit of research into new drugs, like those bath salts I suppose(which I don&#39;t know much about to be honest).</p>

<p>And I actually found one that&#39;s beginning to grow in the south. It&#39;s called flakka. I have no idea what it is either, had never heard of it and will continue to look into it.</p>

<p>It was coined the &#39;5$ insanity drug&#39;. And the videos are remarkable.</p>

<p>The reason people OD on Heroin is because of the different tolerances between people. 10% could get you high, others need 80%, etc and visually there&#39;s no way to tell what percentage something is. This is one of the biggest reasons people OD. And for active abusers and users, the difference between getting high and ODing is sometimes as small as a 5 or 10 dollar bag, meaning less than a gram.</p>

<p>In Flakka&#39;s case people are dying after their first use. Not because of an OD but because of how it makes you behave.</p>

<p>Is the CIA going full retard with this drug? Anybody know anything more about it?</p>

<p>Hunter Thompson wrote about how you can tell a lot about the overall health and mood of a society by the drugs of choice. From the optimism of LSD in the 60s to the mind numbing era of heroin in many ways reflects where we are now. </p>

<p>Shit like flakka and spice strike me as means to escape so far so fast from one’s life that there isnt much left for the person</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about heroin, but if it&#39;s cut differently(like it is around here, very impure) the differences could shift quite a bit.</p>

<p>If you live anywhere where heroin is more common (East coast, west coast, chicago area, southwest, texas) heroin can be anywhere from 30-120 bucks a gram. Back when I was an addict, I was getting it for 80-100/g</p>

A) a spray of some kind to increase weight on the scale</p>

<p>B) improper cure (people curing via microwaves or paper bags) ultimately leading to botrytis/mould/etc</p>

<p>C) people blasting their flower with butane to extract the cannabinoids+terpenes to make a concentrate (shatter) then reselling the flower minus all the good stuff and a whole lot of solvent left over. </p>

<p>I know a lot of dealers and everything comes from a cost perspective. There’s no reason soak weed in embalming fluid. May as well soak it in 7up and get those “lemon lime” terps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.</p>

<p>My issue with what was being spoke was &#39;drugs did it&#39; when, for one, this is the paranormal subreddit and there was no paranormal discussion taking place.</p>

<p>Not to mention, considering how broad the word &#39;drug&#39; is it was inappropriate and speaking frankly, ignorant and heartless to speak of these things so lightly. &#39;Maybe she was itching for a fix&#39;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not how people itch for fixes by acting possessed. It&#39;s a form of physical and psychological pain in many cases.</p>

<p>And I stand by exactly what I said, it was a dumb thing to say - be specific, which drug because marijuana doesn&#39;t do that, pcp doesn&#39;t do that, heroin, coke, ready rock or E doesn&#39;t either, not as they are intended. These designer drugs are entirely a different animal of course, so it&#39;s possible for somebody to OD on something like E easily and that it could be a &#39;bad batch&#39; of the drug.</p>

<p>And it still doesn&#39;t make people act possessed.</p>

<p>This CIA-driven flakka bullshit is an entirely different animal and I would actually encourage use of a different word to describe it. </p>

<p>Is there another recreational drug on the planet which has the intended purpose of making somebody act insane?</p>

<p>It’s clear you still know nothing about flakka. It’s intended purpose is not to make somebody act insane? </p>

<p>...also, the “paranormal” subreddit is meant for questions to be answered logically. If hundreds of people agree that it’s not paranormal, sorry but it might not be paranormal.. Just because it’s that sub doesn’t mean every response has to be paranormal, the stories and questions are. Who are you to dictate what others respond with? Again, alllll about you. As well, there was paranormal discussion going on. Do you want me to link you back to those comments or do you just want to continue with your fake narrative? </p>
