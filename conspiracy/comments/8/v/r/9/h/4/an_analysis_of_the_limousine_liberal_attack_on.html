       .  At a minimum, it's case study on the anatomy of a political smear and how it propagates.  Maybe more.  I am going to attempt to provide detailed evidence to show that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        There appears to have been a coordinated effort over the last three days to smear Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being a "limousine liberal".
       </li>
       <li>
        The smear originates with Breitbart.com.  It is not a secret that Breitbart has deep ties to the White House.
       </li>
       <li>
        The effort to spread it on reddit looks very much like the tactics used by the

       Background
      </h1>
      <p>
       Sunday morning, I saw a rising post on r/libertarian about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/8vaxq8/all_hail_the_limousine_liberal/">
        "All Hail the Limousine Liberal"
       </a>
       .  WARNING:  It's a cancerous thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially early on in the thread, there were 10x more trolls than normal for r/libertarian.  That sub is totally unmoderated, and trolls, especially alt-right ones, are no new thing, but usually in the minority.  The Ocasio-Cortez attack had an entirely different and Orwellian feel to me.  I got sucked into a frustrating semantic debate with one individual over the factual claims in the meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post slams Ocasio-Cortez for claiming to be from the Bronx, while spending her formative years in "Yorktown heights, one of the wealthiest enclaves in the country - complete with 2 golf courses."  When I went to look for information about Yorktown Heights (I just wanted to see if it was actually "a wealthy enclave"), it got really weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Someone had editted the wikipedia article on Yorktown Heights.
       </em>
       Anonymous users had added an important new section,
       <strong>
        Golf Courses
       </strong>
       , noting, that there are two.  It's a weirdly specific add in an otherwise minimal article.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more, a wikipedian had added a link back to a
       <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-06-29/girl-bronx-ocasio-cortez-called-out-fact-check-actually-grew-wealthy-enclave">
        regurgitation of the smear
       </a>
       on an Alt-Right site ZeroHedge.  Additionally, Ocasio-Cortez had been added to the list of notable people from the town.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yorktown_Heights%2C_New_York&amp;amp;type=revision&amp;amp;diff=848323961&amp;amp;oldid=846321931">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll acknowledge, none of this is terrifically remarkable or even news.  This is hardly the first Brietbart smear.  There's no direct evidence the White House had any connection to the smear, and even if they did, the Trump white house wouldn't be the first to dictate a political attack to favorable media.  People are probably sick of hearing the about the Bannon-Trump-Mercer boogeyman.  It also is possible that the originator of the smear is Joshua Caplan, the author of the Breitbart article, and the whole thing is perfectly organic.
      </p>

       I think there's more to it.

        Newsmax's Cardillo seems to lead the charge there and his comments get a ton of a traction.

       , in his brief time on Reddit since April, and has a different posting strategy.  That account posts almost exclusively to T_D, at lower volume than the others.  BrotherBear has a knack for hitting home runs.  Yet in hundreds and hundreds of submissions with thousands of karma each, Brotherbear hasn't participated in the discussion at all.  They've made only a single comment: "There's No Such Thing As A Law-Abiding "ILLEGAL ALIEN", posted yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that just about all of the discussion of the topic of "Bronx Girl" on reddit was prompted by Russian trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said all of that, there's less nefarious explanations for the activity from these three accounts, I'm sure.  And absolutely, my analysis and evidence doesn't prove they're trolls from Russia.  The best I think one could do without access to more data is show a pattern.  I think the patter is clear enough to warrant a closer look, maybe even from the admins.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Conclusion
      </h1>
      <p>
       You can imagine Ocasio-Cortez reveling in the aftermath of her surprise victory last week.  She's already seen some backlash, and she's prepared for more, I would presume.  But unbeknownst to her, there's a dark tidal wave forming in the alt-right media, on reddit, twitter and 4chan.  By Sunday, the whole thing crashes on top of her when she's forced to respond to people tweeting pictures of her home.  Imagine too, that a week ago, few had heard of her.  A wild ride, I'm sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope at least, the whole thing is maybe case study on how political attacks are spread. I'll acknowledge again, there's no direct link to the White House.  And I haven't at all proven the posts on reddit are coming from Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, I'll speculate somewhat irresonsponsibly on a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It's possible this whole thing starts with communications from the White House, or someone close.
       </em>
       An order goes out to Breitbart - "this is the story we're going with today, write it."  That's a "talking point" and not unprecedented in US politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The second communication is to someone in Russia and is treasonous.
       </em>
       "Put your team on pumping this story up, comrade."  It becomes a tremendous hit, which is a huuuuge win for the White House.  In one fell swoop, they've fired up the base about a new boogeyman, demonized an up-and-comer in the opposition party, and also completely distracted people from the relentlessly negative news that surround the White House.

       It's the same partnership with Russian intel that got Trump to the White House, and it keeps working.  And not just on this smear.  Just look at those post histories for the trolls I mentioned!  There's dozens of specious claims like this each week, and plenty that catch on.  Even as the Mueller investigation rages, the Russian government is still hard at work on Trump's behalf.  Is that implausible?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that's too ambitious of a claim given the limited evidence.  Nonetheless it's fascinating to dive deep on how these smears spread.  What do you all think?

       This is a resubmission from yesterday, with the np.reddit links instead of
       <a href="http://www.reddit">

        it was deleted

       , apologies to those who have seen it twice.

       One thing I want to acknowledge.  Since I

        first posted
       </a>
       this yesterday, I see more comments than normal from at least one of the troll accounts.  It almost looks like they read it and changed tactics.  If you're trying to decide on your own, I would encourage you to read post histories for those accounts past 24 hours ago.

       he's out, and Rebekah Mercer, a billionaire and Trump's most important donor now controls Breitbart.

      <p>
       Having said that, I have a hard time believing he's out in the wilderness.  Bannon knows shit about Trump, I'm certain they're keeping him close.  He might also have an "accident" soon.

       Saying Breitbart wasn't tied to Bannon is like saying Microsoft isn't tied to Bill Gates. He was a co-founder. To imagine that there's no pull there even after he steps down is delusional beyond imagination.

       They never claimed that they care if president is from rich or poor family - thats something Democratic Party supporters do often - they only care about if he supports their issues or not.

       Actually - a lot of Trump supporters are Democrat.  That demographic is upset that the Democratic party has embraced her far left views.   Many of the Sander supporters who have abandoned the DNC view her as a puppet because of her background.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans are cheerful that she has joined the Democratic party because this means the DNC has accepted the far left ideology as their party.   Making a large amount of center left folks #walkway.

       Centrist democrats will win but when it comes down to their own agenda and strategy.  Which I love to hear being a centrist Democrat.  However the Democrat adoption of the radical left will impact the parties future agenda.  Soon we will have more division and candidates will struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       #walkaway movement provided a light to all those who don't speak up about their views because they are usually shamed for having a different opinion.  I don't see conservatives freaking out.  I see the left freaking out daily from SCOTUS ruling on travel ban to having a vacant seat to fill.   We see riots pushing for open borders and Russia Collusion bullshit.  The establishment GOP is most certainly freaking out but not the true conservatives.

       I'm not saying what Russia did is bullshit.  I am saying that investigations linked to Russia were going on prior to Trump and the meddling influence is limited.  The bullshit is the spin effort to connect Russia to Trump as if he worked closely with them to win the election.  As if he is some puppet of Putin.  It's all a big theatrical show that kept democrats from questioning the real massive loss that the DNC has not truly addressed.  The media hasn't shared how all their polls were wrong yet the polls being used by Trump team were accurate.  Basically Russia serves as a distraction.  Everyone who is Democrat that makes a racists or homophobic statement on social media blames Russia.  Any conservative trend on Twitter gets labeled as Russian.  It's a made up boogeyman like ISIS.

       Most of the Trump voting Democrats previously voted for Obama, back when he was pretending to be more progressive than he actually was.  Most of the frequently cited reasons for Trump Democrats are also fairly left wing, such as trade, his campaign trail talk against the forever war, disgust with legalized bribery of politicians, his (broken) promise of major infrastructure spending, and his (broken) promise not to cut medicare/medicaid.  They left the democratic party because it shifted too far to the right, even if the MSM's widespread right-wing bias makes it hard to acknowledge that.

       Democrats went right wing with favoring big corporate and aspects of globalism but the biggest push was social policy.  Dems felt open borders and identity politics was not needed and the effort was too extreme.  In fact most of all voters on both sides wanted stronger immigration.  You cannot be too far to the right when you push for socialist ideas such as globalism, open borders and identity politics.

       A very small faction within the Democratic Party supports open borders, even if it has been growing recently.  Remember how Obama deported record numbers, or how nearly every sitting Democrat who had the chance voted to create ICE and fund a border wall?  Identity politics is something widely practiced by Republicans as well, and what identity politics is used as a euphemism for (acknowledgement that different communities have their own issues and deserve representation) isn't particularly left wing, particularly as the Democratic Party almost universally uses those symbolic appeals to identity to excuse their refusal to do anything material to address the inequality between different groups.  Socialist internationalism is radically different from neoliberal globalism.  Regardless of how right-wing propagandists try to paint it, the "globalism" people are reacting to isn't socialist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And everybody uses identity politics, the GOP especially.

       Small faction? Look at the politician support of the protest.  Name 5 politicians that support Trumps immigration and border wall under the Democratic party.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do recall Obama's claim of deportation and the forming of ICE which is now being promoted by the Democrat to abolish it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many forms of identity politics.  Yes it is played on both sides but the focus of Dems have been on social policy like same sex bathrooms when we had high unemployment and middle class being raked over on taxes, wages and health premiums.

       Joe Manchin supports the wall.  Plenty of Democratic electeds supported walls when it wasn't Trump administering it.  And its absurd that you equate "not supporting Trump's specific proposals" with "open borders."
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama didn't "claim" deportation, he deported millions of undocumented immigrants.  Many Democrats, including the majority of Senate Democrats, voted to create ICE back in 2001, and so far none of them has recanted that position.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your characterization of the Democratic Party's focus is incorrect, but also a prime example of what I talked about in my last post.  Using cultural stances to give Democrats cover with their base to excuse them continuing right-wing economic and foreign policies is exactly the opposite of Democrats moving to the left.  For the record, Democrats did not support same sex bathrooms.  They supported letting trans people use bathrooms, which is both perfectly reasonable and completely minor, and was not at all the focus of Democratic strategy until conservatives decided to make it the centerpiece of their outrage.  The Obama administration did do a lot to address unemployment (bringing it down considerably) and middle class economic issues.  You could argue what they did wasn't effective, but the reasons they didn't do more have nothing to do with trans bathrooms, and instead from a) the republicans prevented or sabotaged most of Obama's economic proposals once they took the house and state governments in 2010, and b) the Obama democratic party was neoliberal af, and thus were happy to leave things to the market, give money to the rich in hope it'd trickle down, that sort of thing: again, the opposite of moving to the left.

       First off, trump doesn’t promote socialism or say capitalism is evil. Making him not a hypocrite.

       Also, this was post was quite a screed. You really busted out the thesaurus in your descriptions of the donald as the dark corners of internet savagery like people discussing a limousine liberal is akin to the orca gathering in Mordor.

       What the op was thin on was actual evidence that this girl is not being deceptive about her backstory.

      <p>
       The socialist in question here went on tv and tried to act like she was the socialist Cardi B, a bronx girl representing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is she is really from Westchester County and lived in York town where the median income is 108,000 for a household
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of interesting that she is a socialist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is she going to be supporting school choice also since her life story is a dramatic example of the need for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is socialist rhetoric going to suddenly transform failing schools?

       Now the funniest thing is that a simple 10 minute google search reveals a much more sinister conspiracy then breitbart or others uncovered about this Alexandria Cortez.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her entire story of being a grassroots candidate funded by only 300,000 is a complete lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is being funded by socialists in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       How? Her entire branding was created by a company called tandemnyc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tandem nycs webpage has zero information on it and their LinkedIn says it is a small company of 5 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting that their happens to be a much larger company called tandem comms who’s “clients in the news” page includes stories about dozens of tech startups all presented in tech news sites as rebel grassroots startups.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is amidst stories about their other small rebel clients...
       <strong>
        such as apple and Samsung

       How can she win an election with “$300,000”?

       I wonder how she won?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be because online ad spending doesn’t have to include disclaimers or be disclosed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting that the tandem comms uk website says the ceo leads a staff of 6500 people.

       Hey, I have no objection to the idea of people doing their own research and drawing their own conclusions, that's what democracy is all about.  Furthermore, from what I understand of her positions, I disagree with every part of her platform except abolishing ICE.

       However, I think how you feel about AOC is immaterial from the point I am trying to make with this post.  The point was to dissect how the Trump propaganda machine operates.  It's quite scary and Orwellian when you break it down.  A story emerges on Breitbart, other pro-Trump sites follow, then there is a coordinated and concerted effort by bots/astroturfers to promulgate the story over social media.

       I think that its more Orwellian that she is getting so much airtime on MSM while at the same time being perceived by general population as someone who beat Establishment.

       If they (Democratic Establishment) were really unhappy with her winning, they would be trying to bury this story as much as possible.

       She is all over the MSM - interviews talk shows, favorable articles .... feel good stories all over the place.

       In the meantime Republican party Media, seeing all this, recognized her as a danger coming from Democratic Party establishment and started attacking her from whatever angle they can come up. Its what they do (its what both Parties do to each other) - so it only makes sense. Nothing unusual here.

       They are, a wide range of sitting Democrats have tried to downplay the significance of her win, distance themselves from her, or attack her platform, ever since she won.  That's been a pretty common theme from the reaction to her win in the media.

       Her victory was a big enough deal that they would have to comment on it, and it should be telling to you that all the comments from Democratic politicians and consultants has been to downplay the significance of her win, but without attacking her or her platform directly, ie to prevent further drama from ensuing that would keep the story going longer.  Much of the attention brought on her has been from the right-wing, too, while the MSM didn't even reference her name in the headlines about her victory until people called them out on it.

       You need something (at least one) strong to run on - thus "Medicare for all" - Ones you win (if you win) you dont really have to deliever, you just have to pretend as if you are trying really hard while pointing finger at other party as a reason why you are not able to deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember how Obama campaigned on closing Guantanamo (among other things) in his first campaign? At that time it was big issue (waterboarding and torture talk was all over the media)
      </p>
      <p>
       He gave up on that promise in like second year. Guantanamo is still running today and nobody even talks about it anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the fact that you are running on some issue that could bring you victory, does not really mean that you intend to deliever on that promise.

       yesterday than it is today.  IIRC, it was sitting at around 45 upvotes an hour in when it got deleted, almost triple where we are now.  Not to mention, redditors are much more active on Mondays, and additionally, it's the day before a holiday today.  If my interests were nefarious in some way, I would've been much better served by leaving the post up.

       They don´t take her seriously because she´s a young, attractive, idealistic woman, in other words not morally or politically corrupted, so they´ll try to corrupt her indirectly by slinging all manner of poison against her through their soulless Internet zombies infesting Twitter and the like. The Internet symbolic death squads are designed to crush her spirit, to poison her idealism, and to send her running in despair, horror, and disgust--essentially what Jarrod Ramos is alleged to have done to the reallife female victim of his demented misogyny.

       Oh please, are we now considering anyone condemning a publicly socialist candidate as a Russian troll under the direct orders of the White House?
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't like her for her policies (which if you
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8vpoc6/republicans_are_terrified_of_what_alexandria/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=politics">
        head over
       </a>
       to r/politics, they can't even think of a problem with them). They don't like seeing the incredibly heavy support for her and her socialists policies coming out of the MSM, and places like reddit. The easiest propaganda to identify is the crazy amount of praise she's getting for her "unthinkable upset" that could represent a "changing of the tides" in the Democratic party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your "analaysis" basically just describes how meme's spread. The only connection you have to the White House, Russia, or Breitbart is 100% pure speculation on your part. No where in here do you prove that the claim of her being a limo liberal is inaccurate, just that it's a "smear campaign". The term isn't new. People have been calling Hillary Clinton and celebrities in Hollywood that for decades.
      </p>

       This entire post is just you trying to justify why this girl is receiving such negative responses from people online and in the right-leaning media.

       Yes I read every word. OP doesn't "fully admit" that until the very last few paragraphs. This post is titled as an "analysis", with an opening paragraph that reads:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I have a conspiracy to share with you all
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        . At a minimum, it's case study on the anatomy of a political smear and how it propagates. Maybe more. I am going to attempt to provide detailed evidence to show that:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         There appears to have been a coordinated effort over the last three days to smear Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for being a "limousine liberal".
        </p>
        <p>
         The smear originates with Breitbart.com. It is not a secret that Breitbart has deep ties to the White House.
        </p>
        <p>
         The effort to spread it on reddit looks very much like the tactics used by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA)
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It isn't until the near the very end that OP, who even
       <em>
        recognizes
       </em>
       , what they are doing, says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       I spent a lot of time writing and editting, and chosing my words in the post very carefully.  You are willfully misrepresenting what I wrote.  No where in the highlights you quoted to I assert that the White House is responsible, or that Russia is involved.  The implication is there, and I have insisted here that the reader draw their own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I acknowledged multiple times in that post that there were other explanations, and the evidence of connection to the White House and Russia was weak.  Some direct quotes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'll acknowledge, none of this is terrifically remarkable or even news. This is hardly the first Brietbart smear. There's no direct evidence the White House had any connection to the smear, and even if they did, the Trump white house wouldn't be the first to dictate a political attack to favorable media. People are probably sick of hearing the about the Bannon-Trump-Mercer boogeyman. It also is possible that the originator of the smear is Joshua Caplan, the author of the Breitbart article, and the whole thing is perfectly organic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having said all of that, there's less nefarious explanations for the activity from these three accounts, I'm sure. And absolutely, my analysis and evidence doesn't prove they're trolls from Russia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll acknowledge again, there's no direct link to the White House. And I haven't at all proven the posts on reddit are coming from Russia.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As you point out, I even characterized speculation on the topic as irresponsible!  You're free to make up your own mind here, but please stop attacking a straw man.

         Socialism is not to blame for the mass casualties that you are referencing, it is more or less a bystander in some of the stories of the dictators who took control by using the economic system as a vehicle to overthrow the social order to give themselves more power.

         Socialism is just an economic system, one where the general public have more control over how their taxes are spent and the liberties that Corporations are granted. The economic system called capitalism, where Corporations dictate which powers they get, can be used and is now being used, in the same way past Dictators in socialist organized economies did, by Trump to gain power.

       LOL yes, because everyone knows Socialism = greater consumer choices. Holy hell. Also, you may want to look up the definition of Capitalism, because whatever bullshit definition you just gave is laughably ignorant. And no, what we currently have is no longer really capitalism, thanks in large part to big government manipulating the shit out of the free market.

We just want to make sure that people who work for a living aren't driven to poverty when catastrophic events happen in their lives, and to do that, working people need to have some fucking Agency in the government AT ALL.

       See that's the problem. What you are describing has NEVER worked, because it always inevitably leads to full blown socialism. I'm not saying it's not possible, but I am saying that anyone who has ever tried it has failed. I'm all for social safety nets, but I don't believe that is a task for the Federal government.

       See Dr Gerald Friedman's (UMASS Amherst, Econ.) work on 'Medicare for All' (as posted via links on Bernie's original campaign page 2016). Dr. Friedman is one of the renown experts on socialized medicine plans, and single payer medicine, economics of - this particular work was analyzed by close to 200 other economists (125 of whom are recognized as top in their field) and all confirmed it was indeed a 'doable' /workable, legitimate plan to provide Medicare for all in the U.S.A.

       So then what is the story? Does she come from money or what? Is this a smear campaign or not? Please do tell!! Is this Yorktown Heights a real place or a dreamy illusion with not one but count em TWO GOLF COURSES!!?

       Here's my take:
      </p>
      <p>
       She does play up the Bronx thing, and play down her connection to Yorktown heights.  Just a little bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it's not nearly as nefarious as the propagandists have made it out to be.  She is not a wealthy trust fund kid who was born with a golden spoon in her mouth and grew up with immense privilege.  She grew up in a middle class home with working class parents.  She was actually born in the Bronx.  Yorktown Heights has a higher median income than average, but also a much higher cost of living.  They do indeed have two golf courses, and one of them is a shitty public one.  By no means is it a "wealthy enclave".
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW, I also think the whole question is pretty trivial and unimportant.  What's more interesting to me is where this smear originated, and how it spread.

       I honestly was just curious about her as I only heard that she worked with Bernie and was from the Bronx. Hey I dont sweat it I am often misunderstood on reddit and have had to learn to shake it off lest I be totally depressed at least two days out of the week. Thanks  though! Peace

       So let me get this straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire post boils down to 'muh Russian bots propaganda smear campaign'.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when directly asked about your own assessment of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezs history your conclusion is;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        She does play up the Bronx thing, and play down her connection to Yorktown heights.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is in complete factual agreement with the alleged 'Russian bots propaganda campaign', though with a less boisterous approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely you must be aware of how you appear to moderates and right-leaners who are tired of the left blaming
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       on Russia?

       I firmly disagree that my assessment is "in complete factual agreement" with the smear campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as I've said elsewhere, her upbringing is a trivial topic and the debate about it is semantic and boring.  I'm not going to engage you on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of this post was to highlight how propaganda is spread and disseminated.

       I'm not sure why you say it sounds like she won't. I've been watching interviews with her; to me she sounds like the progressive real deal. We'll see, of course, but she has an activist background, she's clearly in it for the right reasons, at least.

       And personally, I strongly support taxpayer-funded college, which we used to have in the U.S. Ideas like these should come to fruition. End the War on Drugs, cut the military budget, and there would be plenty of money to actually have good social programs.

       A “democrat socialist” was trolled in a libertarian thread? And by Breitbart? That’s not surprising or weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do think the Democratic establishment is very scared by her. I think the establishment Dems thinks a lurch that far left will make it harder to win elections in swing states that Trump won.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know if that’s the case. I think she has terrible ideas and her policies are naïve and economically illiterate. But Trump won an election based on “Build that wall!” And “Lock her up!” So I really have no clue what voters will do.

       I think what's interesting is that the entire "Bronx Girl" line of attack just doesn't existing on reddit, at all, without the coordinated propaganda effort.  It originates on Brietbart, and the initial dissemination of the attack on reddit is done exclusively by suspicious accounts that appear to be trolls.

       Yea, that line of attack does seem like bullshit and also, not relevant anyways. Plenty of actual reasons to dislike her policies without attacking her character. She does actually seem nice and genuine.

       I kinda thought Breitbart was mostly done since Bannon crossed Trump but your post has me rethinking that thought. I hope they aren’t back leading up to 2020 like they were in 2016. They’re is definitely something bad going on there.

       I think the coordinated propaganda effort, including manipulation on social media by a foreign intelligence agency, is what separates this from politics as usual.

       A quick scan of your posting history shows me that the subs you frequent are all frequent targets by the trolls I mentioned.  Some of those smaller Alt-right subs might be like 50% bots at this point, I am convinced.  I think if it were me, I would want to know that I'm being spoonfed.

       If propaganda is true then why do you have such a problem with it? She pretened that she grew up in the hood when she actually didn't, and people who are worried about an Obama 2.0 are absolutely going to exploit that fact. And you just randomly called people who have posted about it "Russian trolls" without any evidence.
      </p>

       I admit that I thought she grew up in the hood too, until I saw this "propaganda" you are referring to. I'm glad I saw it because now I have a better idea of the truth.

       Why involve Russia in this. The attack on her was mainly from Trumpers, that's all. It's getting ridiculous with these accusations. Russia is a mediocre-powered nation, with an average education level way below what would be required for a coordinated hacking campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear Trump's afraid of the left wing of the democratic party. I'm quite sure he prefers running against a grassroots-less centrist candidate again.

       They did it before, that's why.  Reddit banned 944 accounts, just two months ago, stating that they believed those accounts were created and maintained by the Russian Internet Research Agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's also a whole ongoing investigation into coordination between between Russian and the Trump campaign.

       It's not like I'm injecting Russia out of left field here.  But you're free to examine the evidence and for your own conclusion.  I've acknowledge multiple times the connection to Russia is weak.

       I actually looked at those accounts. First off, you had to scroll super far in the list to actually get to the ones that were at all prolific posters, where there were only a tiny handful. If you actually look at those accounts, they just shut posted bad memes on the Donald that got almost no traction. There was no competent or effective Russian campaign to effect the 2016 election through social media. That shirtless Bernie is all that people can point to is incredibly telling. Second, it’s apparent exactly what’s going on in this case. Hypocritical establishment Democrats are just pearl clutching and smearing because they are afraid. It’s no different than they’ve always done to actual progressives or toward socialists. It’s not some conspiracy

       I don't really think it's a smear campaign per say.  I believe that Ocasio-Cortez absolutely was trying to get empathy and political points by inferring that she grew up in the hard knock Bronx. You can't really say that you grew up in a place if you moved out when you were 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the golf course controversy on Wiki, Westchester county, where she spent the majority of her childhood, is a very wealthy, upper class county in the top 10 wealthiest counties in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say however that it is actually an organized smear campaign by the right. What would be the purpose of doing so?  The district she won the primary in, is very solidly a Democrat district, with almost no chance of a Republican ever winning, regardless of a sophisticated smear campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, a smear campaign by Republicans is going to have the opposite effect, making her that much more popular with her base, so I don't really see what a smear campaign would accomplish.

       This is simply untrue.  It's not even in the

       .  But I also don't want to get sucked into a trivial and semantic debate about this.  I do agree she plays up her Bronx creds, but the topic has been beaten to death.  The more interesting thing is how this meme got started and how it spread.

       It fires up Trumps base.  It weakens a rising star in the opposition.  But I think mostly this is because it's a huge distraction from controversies currently surrounding the Trump admin.

       Could it be that when the alternative media see the mainstream media putting her on a pedestal, they are simply reacting to this and trying to further discredit the mainstream media?

       I do actually see an organized effort by the right to drive a deepening wedge in the Democrat party, between the Democrat socialists and the more moderate Democrats. Perhaps this is why they're doing it?

       They're just terrified of a working-class radical running a successful campaign for Congress. What if more people follow her lead? It might disrupt their good old boys network. So they're spreading lies about her. Lying is wrong, and I don't do it even regarding the other side.

       The Russian Internet Agency isn't linked to the Russian government. It
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       based in Russia, but it's a viral marketing firm which allows individuals to hire a private troll army to advertise a product. This explains why you'd see both pro-Clinton &amp; anti-Clinton, pro-Trump and anti-Trump ads being purchased which I believe is also listed in the Mueller indictment. I don't believe the individuals listed in the indictment have any credible links to the Russian government either.

       the same people who say she isn’t from the bronx because she moved when she was 5 will also tell you a kid who immigrates here from another country as a toddler belongs back in their own country 10 years later lol. the only reason they fight it so hard is because it makes her look ever so slightly positive, and she’s not on their team so that absolutely cannot fly!

       Amazing work. One may disagree with her politics, her socialist leanings, etc., but to smear her with the aid of coordinated efforts smells of desperation. Let me add that it’s misdirected as she’s all but running unopposed.

       Yes. Precisely. They do smear Trump and I'm sorry you got downvoted because you've hit closer to the truth than you probably intended. Outsiders get smeared regardless of political stance. The fact it happens to Trump and AOC here is proof of that.

       I think Bernie was an actual Democratic Socialist in his younger years, but as he got into politics, he became more of a Euro style social democrat.  That's still farther left than most of the Overton window in America, but still nowhere near as left as the notable Democratic Socialists of the past like Eugene V. Debs, or Alice Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since Bernie's run, I think a lot of people have come to define "Democratic Socialist" as basically, the politics of Bernie Sanders.  I don't think that's necessarily bad, but I do recognize the difference.

       As for the white supremacy movement, I agree it's small (though much larger than Antifa which gets far more coverage than its membership warrant) however, as someone who was born in, raised in, and still live in the rural South, racists (who sympathize with, but may or may not be involved with the movement) are legion.

       I don't trust any poster in this forum that supports a socialist.  You can't, on one hand, believe in or even entertain the notion of government conspiracies while simultaneously  supporting a bigger and even more intrusive and powerful government.  Unless you're just a masochist.

       She supports gun control (disarming
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       , not the government) and open borders (exchanging
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       for new voters that give people like her permanent power).  Those two issues alone tell em all I need to know about her.  She could support a "Send GrayManTheory All Your Money Act" and I'd still vote against this statist harpy.

       I don’t support everything she does, including her position of gun control, but she is very explicit in wanting to disarm the government. Open borders is a strawperson that does not represent her position, but it’s important to acknowledge that, unlike the GOP and most outspoken immigration opponents, she is firmly against all the things that force migrants to leave their home countries.

       Characterizing a desire for efficient and effective public services and an end to the police state as “gibs in exchange for constitutional rights” is ridiculous.

       We dislike CNN, MSNBC, NBC etc. just as much as you do. They're all owned by big corporations, whose economic interests largely align with the GOP – which is why their owners have donated plenty of money to said party (and to the center-right branch of Dems).

       you are not propgressive, you are reressive. Far right has no inherent meaning nothing.  Close upwards. means nothing. Your meaning is in your head because someone programmed it for you. Propagnda terms never have meaning.
Regressive is an actual word, it means you are going backwards, perverting the west to the medieval ages. You regressives are always the opposite of what spu claim you are.

       It's funny that even Democrats are pointing out her wealthy background when they do that with no other candidate I know of. Could it be that her stance on Israel is making the D's donors nervous? Is the primary plank of the Democrats to serve the interests of The Lobby (AIPAC) over and above all other considerations and does that explain why the Democrats would rather have ANYONE else join their campaign hustings just so long as it isn't those dirty unwashed Millennials who don't share the Democratic leadership's undying commitment to all things Israel?

       Good investigative work. Have you considered that they needn't be Russian to be paid trolls? Remember that the Russia talking point was started by the Clinton campaign and the DNC to distract and deflect from the content of the WikiLeaks that exposed them for working against the Sanders campaign. While stating that it's obvious Russia had
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       effect on the election, can we acknowledge they aren't the only ones capable of paying trolls – especially when Correct the Record has admitted to paying people to push back online?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr: this definitely seems like an organized troll campaign, but the GOP – or forces wishing to keep the Democratic party in its current hands – could also be behind it.

       Thanks!  Though, I think you oversell it a bit.  It’s been up for a day (2 if you count the earlier post) and hasn’t made much of a stir, hardly historical!

       I think most folks that saw this were like “so what?”

       I'm not surprised that a lot of people automatically and cynically look for the tell-tale signs of hypocrisy or the misrepresentation or failure to disclose any relevant personal facts by any up and coming politicians given just how very common it happens to be among all the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for her political foes, I believe there are more in the Democratic Party's current seat-holders that qualify for that distinction than anyone on the right or alt right that would simply scoff at any avowed "socialist" simply on the basis of that alone. What needs to be said beyond that coming from her own lips from their perspective?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't, however, say the same about all the Dems who've campaigned on the left but generally ruled on right once they were elected much to the ongoing dismay of a steadily increasingly number of disaffected and disenfranchised Dem supporters, especially among all the younger ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones who all rallied behind Bernie simply because he happened to be the only so-called socialist with some definitely left wing principles and policies he's stood by for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better if Bernie had been lot younger, more dynamic, and dare I say it, another
       <em>
        female
       </em>
       in the run-off against Clinton. All of which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez just happens to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       She's a promising future candidate with a strong grass-roots support that's presented and championed what is hoped to be an authentic leftist position. Not only that but she beat one of the "old boys" in the old boys' network that was presumed to be a sure fire winner based on that background of his. Obviously that upsets a whole lot of people among the Dems that thought that they could count on that or perish the thought that it might be the start of a trend of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wouldn't be too quick trying to blame anyone else looking to put her down given that present state of affairs or the tendency of those very people to blame Russians or the so called alt right for failures that the public had very good reasons for visiting upon their heads.

       Could be  Emerdata (was Cambridge A), Dems , Israelis..could be so many groups/ orgs/contractors, etc....  politics is the dirtiest 'business' ... so many operatives, political consultants 'out there'. One thing is a 'for sure'  the ruling elites, MIC, duopoly political parties, corporatists - all of them will be working overtime attempting to discredit anyone with the word 'Socialist' associated with their name. I'm ready to go all in, other than financially.

       If this #walkaway movement is real, why do these special elections tell a different story? Why is Dem voter enthusiasm up? If anything, these Supreme Court decisions motivated Dems to go out and vote.
