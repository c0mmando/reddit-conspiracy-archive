But I can see when a swamp is being drained, and it is loud. First of all, we have indictments surfacing. Finally. Arrests are finally taking place. Yeah. Those mass arrests.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-06-29-trumps-doj-criminally-charges-doctors-pharmacists-nurses-medical-fraud-drugs.html">https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-06-29-trumps-doj-criminally-charges-doctors-pharmacists-nurses-medical-fraud-drugs.html</a></p>

<p>So not only was the biggest healthcare fraud in the history of man brought to light today, many others are being arrested and investigated as I type this, literally. Seems like this administration is getting a lot done FOR the people and not against them. So where is the applause? Oh? Trump? Okay. Well ignoring Trump, this medical fraud case alone is a huge win for humanity... It has it all. And that is just ONE investigation/clearing. We are at 35,000 indictments. You guys act like that is normal. WRONG (fuck, I feel like trump right now) An average for a year is usually around 1,000. We are 35x over capacity (my math sucks) All of this aside, how is your guys popcorn? ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does the swamp involve like everything now? Cause the term originally was about getting the cronies out of politics. But Trump got in there and lined his entire cabinet with establishment cronies, donors, and his own family. The healthcare fraud bust was good. I&#39;ll wait to see what the sealed indictments are all about. I know Sessions has been really been cracking down on drug crimes and immigration, so it&#39;s not a huge surprise that we see a spike in arrests this year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but it’s always about bang for the buck. The option for fine and loss of license is quick and simple. </p>

<p>Things like this get low priority and minimal resources and budget. That’s really the only thing Trump did, he have it priority and attention. If you do the actual cost benefit from a government dollars POV I bet it’s a negative return. That is the cost to investigate, prosecute and enforce will waaaaay out way the funds recovered. </p>

<p>Of course the political returns and the marginal win in the opioid “war” will offset some but that’s it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should have said &quot;If <em>one</em> is a leftist.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m a romantic (in the classical sense, not the entertainment or relationship sense), but I don&#39;t agree that Trump is one of the worst people in the world.  I don&#39;t think you can even come up with a list of &quot;worse people in the world&quot; that would be objectively true to all observers. </p>

<p>While the media pushes to divide an conquer using identity politics, many of his supporters see him do no wrong, and his detractors see him do no right.  They can&#39;t both be correct.  The truth is somewhere in between.</p>

<p>I understand why TheRiseofMindhawk feels that way, and I understand your response, but what just happened there was an example of ideological possession, where your beliefs on a matter are so entrenched that instead of thinking and engaging, you react and respond with responses that shut down discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he is a criminal and one of the worst people in the history of the world
This is hyperbole.  A supporter reading it will dismiss anything TheRiseofMindHawk says following the statement.</p>

<p>What the fuck are you smoking right now cause I dont want any.
This is reactive and aggressive.  Any discussion that follows with be an argument with the goal of each respondent to simply shut down the other person rather than come to an understanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I applaud your attempt to not put yourself in a box, but it&#39;s not as simple as saying &quot;I don&#39;t follow politics.&quot;  That your response was a defense of Trump makes this statement false.  You follow politics enough to at least have a positive opinion of Trump and to the point of having a willingness to defend him.</p>

<p>So, Trump <em>is</em> going after his enemies.  This much is obvious.  The questions that follow should be:
* are his enemies my enemies
* will eliminating his enemies benefit me or my &quot;tribe&quot; (those you care about)
* will eliminating his enemies benefit those outside my tribe to my detriment</p>

<p>If the answers to the first two questions are yes, then you&#39;re probably a Trump supporter, but if the last question is also yes, then are you still going to support Trump?  If the last answer is yes and you become a detractor to your own detriment because hurting your opposition is more important to you than benefitting yourself and those around you, then you suffer some degree of ideological possession.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s like the SJW movement supporting authoritarianism and anti-fa, even though both of those things are antithetical to the progressive movement, but both of those things hurt their opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean if you have to say get straight back to work to feed the kids then yeah but the sad thing is ITS A BUSINESS so very few clinics treat it as a taper or even mention the lengthy process for getting off. They let you go as high as that particular clinic allows with virtually no mention of the plan for the future. They use the whole you arent there yet so best not to get ahead of yourself with that talk just yet. Before you know it you have a few take homes to help you continue in the path and years have passed with still no mention of a taper. I mean if you are on say 150mg and the average taper is 2mgs a week then you are talking nearly a YEAR AND A HALF JUST TO GET OFF! But I guess its better than seeking so long as when you begin you do so with an end time frame in mind as to not go so high on the dosage when they are leveling out your required dosage. That withdrawal makes H seem like a walk in the park in summer. Anyway keep coming back folks!!</p>
