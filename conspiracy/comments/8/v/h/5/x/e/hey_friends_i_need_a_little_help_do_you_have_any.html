    <div class="md"><p>The film Grey State had some freaky deaths halt it&#39;s production and release.</p>

<p>Paul Stamets had a few patents for mycological technologies that have so far been denied regulatory approval after he refused to sell them without a stipulation that they be implemented rather than shelved. I also heard a rumor that he once thwarted what he suspected to be an assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Reich suffered the government intercerference when they bured his books on orgone energies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A rumor I heard once 3 years back. The gist was that Stamets showed up to a workshop he was teaching and at some point revealed he was carrying a pistol and mentioned a suspected attempt on his life that he&#39;d thwarted with a firearm as his reason for carrying, along with his unprovable suspicions that his would be murdered was working for an industrialist of some kind.</p>

<p>I assume my friend didn&#39;t invent the rumor and, having watched Paul&#39;s interview with Joe Rogan, I also assume that Stamets really believes someone had the motivation to have him assassinated. Put that together with the long list of alternative health gurus that have died under suspicious circumstances in the last decade, and the attempts on folks like John McKafee, and folks like Jason Chaffetz resigning over threats against his self and his family and I can only assume there is an active assassination industry in the USA that we shouldn&#39;t ridicule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the greatest ww2 historians to ever live is the englishman David Irving. I cannot say this with certainty but I remember reading that certain people made efforts to buy the rights to his work off of his daughter, who would inherit them after his death (he is already very old and will most likely not live much longer). They are without a doubt doing this in order to have his work dissapear from the face of earth, as his research tears through the post-war lies and propaganda mercylessly. Naturally there&#39;s certain lies that are very valuable to uphold and so his work cannot be allowed to spread any further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though Irving did get some praise early on in his career, the fact that he abandoned objective historical research to push his holocaust denials means he cannot be &quot;one of the greatest ww2 historians to ever live&quot;.</p>

<p>Irving had ample opportunity to defend his work when he sued Deborah Lipstadt and failed utterly. Justice Gray found that, &quot;for his own ideological reasons&quot;, Irving had &quot;persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence&quot;. That is not &quot;tear[ing] through the post-war lies and propaganda mercylessly&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a good article on this sub a while back about a German journalist turned author. His whistleblowing book was allegedly suppressed by the German authorities.</p>

<p>It was turned into a sub of its own, ostensibly to translate the book via crowdsourcing, but sadly now abandoned after the sub creator got cold feet. </p>

<p>The nature of that u-turn is itself interesting given the context of the subject’s story... possibly a result of a post-mortem character assassination, possibly just part of a manufactured drama. Who knows? </p>

<p>If you’re interested, the sub is <a href="/r/JournalistForHire">/r/JournalistForHire</a> and the journalist in question is Udo Ulfkotte. You can find a few videos of him giving interviews too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know about a book, but this is exactly the M.O. that Trump uses to bury stories he doesn’t want to come out. </p>

<p>He has his buddy David Pecker, CEO of the National Enquirer, buy the exclusive rights to a story, and then they never publish it. That’s what Trump did to Stormy Daniels and the other porn stars he cheated on his wife with.  They offer the porn Star an obscene amount of money to give an exclusive interview with the National Enquirer, and then the porn stars can’t tell their stories to anyone else or they’ll be in breach of contract.  The Enquirer has no intention of ever running these stories, so they’re very effectively silenced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not my story, pretty new to comments on Reddit, and I&#39;m on mobile. Posted by my knowledge by perfectionits. &quot;In Sept 2014 this book was published in Germany: Gekaufte Journalisten (GJ) by Dr. Ulfkotte.</p>

<p>Also in Sept 2014, a new publisher was registered in Oakland, USA: Tayen Lane Publishing (<a href="http://www.tayenlane.com/">http://www.tayenlane.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Immediately after its founding, Tayen Lane bought the rights to the English translation of GJ. The English title is: &quot;Journalists for hire. How the CIA buys the news&quot;</p>

<p>2014-2015: GJ sells exceptionally well in Germany, despite having zero promotional budget, and to date has sold hundreds of thousands of copies and for three years remained near the top of several categories on amazon.de.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tayen Lane was holding back the English version.</p>

<p>January 2017 - The author dies of heart failure, at age 56.</p>

<p>May 2017 - Tayen Lane finally publishes the book in the US: <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Journalists_for_Hire.html?id=rrITDAEACAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en">https://books.google.com/books/about/Journalists_for_Hire.html?id=rrITDAEACAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en</a></p>

<p>The only problem was, you still couldn&#39;t buy it. I tried, many times. &quot;Sorry, this book is currently unavailable&quot; was the error message you would get.</p>

<p>To this day, Tayen Lane has refused to sell the book, and has stonewalled any and all attempts to reach them (phone/email/letter). By early 2018 they had removed the book from their web-site. No trace remains.</p>

<p>For completeness, the book was offered on walmart.com for a short period. Walmart actually took my order, but cancelled it 3 months later without delivering. The book was &quot;out of stock&quot; even before it went on sale. Amazing.</p>

<p>Outright censorship is bad, of course, which is why Tayen Lane established &#39;plausible deniability&#39; by making a single hardcopy available on amazon.com. The price is only $996, with no return rights. Enjoy.</p>

<p>The book&#39;s topic is how our intelligence agencies control and shape the stories presented by our main media outlets. As it stands now, Tayen Lane itself serves as further proof of the importance and relevance of Dr. Ulfkotte&#39;s work.</p>

<p>For the record, I don&#39;t recommend buying any conspiracy books about Dr. Ulfkotte&#39;s early death. I see one has just popped up. If anyone has information on what killed him they should share it for free, preferably with the police. No one should make money off his unfortunate end.</p>

<p>My main hope and motivation with this post is to one day be able to read the damn book. Any help with that would be greatly appreciated. Another motivation is to highlight the problem of censorship. How many other &quot;inconvenient&quot; books are we not allowed to see?</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://tragedyandhope.com/which-versions-of-tragedy-and-hope-are-the-uncensored-editions/">Tragedy and Hope</a> outlined the entire banking, new world order conspiracy as laid out by people at the head of finance and journalism and governments. It was supposed to be a heady, sophisticated book for the leaders of the world, not really meant for plebs like us. When the publisher realized what they had published, they destroyed the plates and only reprinted an edited version some years later.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting story.</p>

<p>That&#39;s ridiculous – publishers don&#39;t just publish manuscripts without knowing what&#39;s in them; a reader or editor and a copyeditor would have gone through the text before it was printed, and if there was anything potentially libellous in it, their legal department would have weighed in. The book didn&#39;t sell well, and so the publishers cut their losses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of Hollywood publishing agencies by books to keep them hidden. Usually you only see original movies that they stole from the writer. Because writers give out scripts like candy, and few lawyers work probono, it&#39;s hard to successfully prosecute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes. This is exactly how Hitler&#39;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; got stopped getting distributed. But since the copyright ran out, they now had to let it free. Good thing is though, it now have to include comments so brainlets don&#39;t interpret their own fascist ideas in it.</p>
