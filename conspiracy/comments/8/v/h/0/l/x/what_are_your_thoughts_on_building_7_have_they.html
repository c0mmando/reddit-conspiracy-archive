        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my experience with this subreddit, the average person here has found the free-fall experienced by Building 7 to be extremely suspicious. The general opinion has been that it is quite possibly a sign of controlled demolition, and certainly contrary to the claims of NIST. However, I saw the following two comments today on a thread in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can’t believe people don’t k ow about Building 7</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone does...it was debunked..move on</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The latter of those two comments is currently sitting at 331 upvotes. I am choosing not to link directly to these comments to avoid users potentially being harassed. </p>

<p>The heavy upvoting on this comment represents an extreme departure from the opinions of this community as I have seen them expressed in the past. I am very curious to hear your thoughts on this - not only your opinion on Building 7, but also on this change in the community&#39;s general attitude.</p>

<p>Here is NIST&#39;s David Chandler admitting to free fall acceleration in Building 7&#39;s collapse.</p>

<p>I think I already know what your answer will be, but what&#39;s your opinion on the statement that the symmetrical collapse was due to the robust outer frame of the building and that it essentially started to collapse on the inside first before taking down the frame? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember the morning this happened. I was in school and just before lunch everyone started talking about something that had happened in New York.</p>

<p>It was such a big deal they opened up a lecture hall and played the news on the screen. So I went there to have lunch and watch what was happening on CNN. </p>

<p>The North and South towers had already gone down. That really hit me that they were completely gone. I remember wondering how many people must have been killed... thinking it must have been 10 or 20 thousand dead.</p>

<p>Then they told us that classes were canceled for the rest of the day. So I stuck around and kept on watching. It was a couple of hours later when Building 7 went down. That struck me as really odd. I was like &quot;Oh, they&#39;re still falling down... what&#39;s up with that?&quot;</p>

<p>I knew the 3rd building hadn&#39;t been hit by a plane. There wasn&#39;t any big fire burning there either. It just looked like some rubble (from WTC 1 or 2) might have damaged Number 7 at the bottom.</p>

<p>But damage at one corner or one side of a skyscraper should not give the same result as a professional demolition. (ie. fall straight down into it&#39;s own footprint). I&#39;ve watched enough shows on TV where they cover the demolition of a building. They always say the same thing. </p>

<p>&quot;We have to place the explosives just right and set them off with just the right timing or the building could tip over or fall the wrong way sending debris all over the place.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet somehow, on 9/11, 3 skyscrapers went down demo-perfect. This, without the benefit of any of the careful preparation that demolition experts will tell you is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>If people can&#39;t see this, it&#39;s because they&#39;re afraid to break away from the comfort of group thinking. The downvotes and harassment comes from a desire (by those same people) to protect that same comforting established viewpoint.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for having a real conversation. </p>

<p>I find it odd that the passport was found at all. I will have to read some more of the topic. My understanding is passports are made with stronger materials to prevent damage. Mine looks pristine and I use it all the time.</p>

<p>What I find odd is they found it at all. The plane went into the building with the people in the plane. I assume his passport was in his pocket. So how’d it end up ejected from the plane and his person to be picked up later? </p>

<p>I do find this puzzling. I mean it could happen but does seem unlikely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here we are.</p>

<p>You have asked several users here for proof of free fall. A fact that you have denied many times.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ve been presented with categorical proof of free fall and your response is to assert that free fall is possible in a normal progressive collapse???</p>

<p>Here is the hilarious part.... you&#39;ve asked for proof and you&#39;ve been handed it.</p>

<p>Instead of revising your notions on Building 7 you&#39;ve decided to change your story and say that actually, free fall is possible.</p>

<p>Here is the best part. YOU have zero proof for this. You&#39;ve asked for proof from others but you think you can get away with further idiotic assertions without provided ANY proof yourself.</p>

<p>You are busted.</p>

<p>At NO POINT should free fall collapse be possible in a progressive unaided collapse. How could you possibly even type that horse shit?</p>

<p>What happened during the 2.25 seconds of free fall? ZERO resistance from the underlying structure... how is that possible?</p>

<p>Oh by the way... post some proof of your assumptions... which you and I know you can&#39;t do. </p>

<p>If NIST couldn&#39;t explain it... I doubt you&#39;ll be able to.</p>

<p>LOL. You are fucking busted here dude. You have nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry dude but 2.25 seconds of absolute free fall isn&#39;t a small issue.</p>

<p>There should be NO FREE FALL and nothing even approaching free fall.</p>

<p>But we have it don&#39;t we? We have a free fall period in this collapse.</p>

<p>Here is the funny part though.... NIST denied that free fall took place whatsoever. They were then confronted with high school physics (lol) and they were forced to revise their report.</p>

<p>So NIST accidentally missed this blatant free fall? You think that&#39;s what happened do you?</p>

<p>Free fall should NEVER be a component of an unaided progressive collapse.</p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p>Buuuuuut... not ony do we see free fall, we have NIST lying about it.</p>

<p>Nothing to see here right? lol.</p>

<p>Free fall should NEVER have happened. 2.25 seconds of absolute free fall is an incredible fact.</p>

<p>Here is my favorite part of all of this....</p>

<p>NIST claimed boldly &quot;We found no evidence of explosives in the rubble.&quot;</p>

<p>Which sounds legit right? Wow! No explosives! That wraps that up.</p>

<p>Then they were challenged with &quot;Did you test for explosives?&quot;</p>

<p>NIST had to then concede that &quot;No. We did not test for explosive residue.&quot;</p>

<p>Fucking hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many say the conspiracy is the knowledge of the attacks.  But it was more than what Israel and the US knew.  They abetted and then it seems likely the hijackers were themselves remotely hijacked. </p>

<p>Nano-tec thermitic material was discovered in the rubble, which burned at extreme heats for days despite firefighters and rain.</p>

<p>Anyone can further see all points were overseen by Zionist interest.  Consider:</p>

<p>Urban Moving Systems Mossad Front, &quot;Dancing Israelis&quot; with traces of explosives.  Carl Cameron report on huge U.S. Israeli spy ring (w/ many found living in close proximity to the hijackers).</p>

<p>Menachem Atzmon, of ICTS Internation (security company owned by an Israeli, Ezra Harel) handles 9/11 at departure airports, with lost tapes, and also for 7/7 London bombing (and VERINT).   Criminal in an Israeli political fundraising scandal involving co-treasurer of the Likud. </p>

<p>Rabbi Dov Zakheim, Comptroller September 10th trillions, &amp; SPC remote flight termination (hijacking the hijackers).</p>

<p>Pete Zalewski: Air Traffic Controller handled both towers planes, not following protocol.</p>

<p>Silverstein/Netanyahu(/Murdoch), Frank Lowy... Kroll chosen to handle security over the buildings. Jerome Hauer, Managing Director for Kroll Security at WTC. &#39;Does the media&#39; on 9/11, implicating Bin Laden in the hours after the attack.</p>

<p>&quot;The air is safe to breath&quot; Giuliani handled the city.</p>

<p>Philip Zelikow, co-authored a 1998 article which described a &quot;transforming event&quot; rather like &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, which would &quot;divide our past and future into a before and after&quot;. In another few years, Zelikow went on to become the executive director of the infamously whistleblown &quot;9/11 Commission&quot;.</p>

<p>Director of Homeland Security and co-author of The Patriot Act, Michael Chertoff allowed scores of suspected Israeli terrorists and spies carrying phony passports and ID&#39;s (Many of whom were living in close proximity to the hijackers; many whom served in intelligence, electronic intercept, and explosive ordnance units of the Israeli army) to quietly return to Israel after 9/11.</p>

<p>Israel already had a reputation for staging false-flag terrorism for political ends i.e. USS Liberty...  Mossad was even caught red-handed in the Mexican Parliment one month after 9/11 disguised as press photographers carrying guns and bombs and fake Pakistani passports.</p>

<p>Google what nano thermite is... but you don&#39;t really care do you?</p>

<p>Nano-thermite or super-thermite is a metastable intermolecular composite (MICs) characterized by a particle size of its main constituents, a metal and a metal oxide, under 100 nanometers. <strong><em>This allows for high and customizable reaction rates.</em></strong></p>

<p>Using thermite to bring down the tower makes zero sense. </p>

<p>Zero. </p>

<p>Have you ever used thermite? I doubt it. It doesn’t work the way you seem to think it does. </p>

<p>Also there is zero evidence of its use on 9/11. </p>

<p>Zero.</p>

<p>You are intentionally obfuscating. Nanothermite is MORE POWERFUL and reactive than regular thermite. What part of that is over your head?</p>

<p>Iron microspheres were found in the 9/11 dust. These microspheres are clearly indicative of the thermite reaction.</p>

<p>To me it’s obvious that some occult shit went down on 9/11. Those who hold the strings making BIG moves to assert their dominance over us and those who threaten their power. This is hundreds (thousands?) of years of gamesmanship. People who have infiltrated themselves so deeply into elite positions that most people don’t recognize them for what they are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God it still pisses me off when people cling to the official narrative. </p>

<p>It’s not even debatable anymore, the fact that explosives were used. The conspiracy theory now should be what type of explosives and what is capable of literally disintegrating the WTC’s mid air. Is nano-thermite capable of this? </p>

<p>Would thermite toast so many cars? Why wasn’t the dust hot? What type of technology did they use to pull this off. </p>

<p>I spent two hours today trying to talk some sense into my boomer parents, I was 11 when the towers came down to give a rough idea of their ages. I know for a fact neither of them knew about building 7 so I showed them the video of it’s collapse and asked what they thought brought down the structure without telling them it was a WTC building. </p>

<p><em>Both</em> said it was obviously a controlled demolition, and <em>instantly</em> changed their minds when I gave context. They told me it’s not good to believe everything you see on the internet, which is so ironic because they watch fox and cnn all day and the worst part is we’re fucking Canadian, and they <em>still</em> watch that garbage. I love my parents but god damn, they’re fucking dumb sometimes. </p>

<p>Fuck all you baby boomers reading this for not using your brains in 2001. North Americans should have been rioting in the streets as soon as the original commission report came out. The narrative should have been challenged en masse the day the towers fell. </p>
