       It's clear by now that QAnon is a prosperity scam, making grandiose claims of incredible things about to happen, that never actually happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all of the "MOAB" events Q has forecast as bringing down the cabal that have fizzled out: the sealed indictments, the Nunes memo, the IG report, the Awan scandal. Each has come and gone with nothing happening other than right wing conspiracy predictions failing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the Q cult persists, fed by a steady diet of rhetorical nonsense from Q and delusional dreams of Hillary Clinton and John McCain being shipped off to Gitmo after a field tribunal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosperity scams usually end either with the scammers being arrested, or people drifting away when they realize that what they've been dreaming of is never going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when will the Q cult finally walk away from the never ending can-on-a-string that is QAnon? What will be the final disappointment?

       Iranian protests have been going on since the 80s. Iran pushes a theocracy based government on its citizens that they do not want. For some reason women rights' and free speech advocates want to ignore this part of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent string of protests started over a year ago after the changes in Saudi Arabia. Are you implying that because Q said the 
US and Saudi Arabia were going to reduce  the control of Iranian leaders on their people that he's in the same boat as the Clintons or Bushes?

       Ok. So the people involved in the previous disastrous regimes changes (Afghanistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Grenada, Kuwait, Haiti, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Iran, Syria, Libya, and Yemen) are supporting Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you think that Q being against the US giving them unmarked money, lax regulations, citizenship for 2500 of it people, and allowing them to instigates war in the Middle East is a bad thing?

       I disagree with your first sentence.  The same people involved in those regime changes are pushing for regime change (again) in Iran.  Put it this way:  If regime change, then "same people."
      </p>
      <p>
       So if Q says "regime change in Iran good" then Q announces him/herself as one who engages in regime change as foreign policy, and there is only one group who conducts themselves thusly.

       I very clearly asked if OP was implying that Q was on the same side as the Bushs and Clintons. That's what the first statement is referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to ignore that, you have to acknowledge that actual political and social issues going on in Iran. Iran's current leaders are FACTUALLY more oppressive with their enforcement of Sharia Law on its citizens. Laws that their citizens are currently protesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there you have to decide if it falls into humans rights violations or if its political discourse. We can agree to disagree if thats the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise Q can't be on both teams.

       If Q supports regime change, he is on the same side as Clinton and Bush on the issue of Iran.  Regime change is a tool wielded by a specific set of people.

       Do you think its possible for the current leadership in Iran to willingly give up power on their own if they haven't done it in the past 30 years and have no outside influence pushing them to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe that the US should hold an isolationist stance to human rights violations across the globe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think its ok for the US to not try to undo a coup that they instigated in order to fix the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that the US standing by while another country instigates a regime change is ok?  Where do we draw the line?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think we can hold an absolute stance on anything in this world and these are REAL questions that you have to ask yourself before declaring that someone should or shouldnt be doing something.

       Regime change from the US follows a fairly distinct pattern.  I'm happy to see any info to the contrary, or hear theories on how Q/Trump's version of regime change is going to be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy to discuss Iran separate from Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 - I don't see why they would.  Power does not devolve it's own power, in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 - This question is kinda comical to me.  The US is among the greatest violators of human rights on the planet.  Regime change being one of the tools used to create the conditions where human rights violations occur.  In general, yes, I'd favor an isolationist approach... kinda same as I favor no death penalty.  We cannot be the arbiters of truth and justice.  And spending blood and treasure to do so just reeks of political or personal enrichment cloaked in human rights struggles.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 - Oh for sure.  That would be the height of folly.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 - Ideally we'd halt any regime change and allow for the locals to exert their will.  If the 3rd party insisted on acting I would not favor war to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 - Somewhere fairly close to our borders.  Our porch is too dirty to start sweeping our neighbors.

       it's just common sense. i read the drops from time to time and they read like an edgy teen trying to sound mysterious and knowing. if anyone falls for that..i guess you could call that moronic, too.

       So its clearly impossible that it could be an insider because, in your opinion, some of the posts sound like an edgy teen. Which posts sound that way to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea, I'm gonna say that its definitely still possible that its an insider. Or maybe not, who knows? I see so many people who are so sure of themselves, and yet they are often wrong. I think your confidence in your assessment is unwarranted.

       Sorry, the manner in which you changed your tune speaks volumes.  I read the Q posts an even I have missed a bunch.  Similarly, saying "nothing q promised ever came to pass" is complete bull.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you change it to "prediction that could have only been made with insider knowledge".  How about peace with NK when the media was saying Trump was going to cause a nuclear war?

       Well yea, I think they are supposed to be vague. They could be vague so that they aren't taken seriously by establishment media and are a way of communicating with "followers," or they could be vague in the Nostradamus sort of way. If I had to bet, I would bet its a LARP, then maybe a legitimate insider, then maybe a psyop. But to be honest, I don't see why anti-Q people care so much. Despite their objections, I don't think it does any harm/

       Q presumably works directly with Trump.  To add to your theory, every day that goes by that Trump doesn't disavow, is a proof it's true.  Trump has heard of Q by now.  In the past couple of drops, Q has practically dared someone, anyone in the journalism community to ask Trump about Q.
       <br/>
       Every time he posts, means that he wasn't shut down by the NSA/CIA/FBI/SS, or Trump himself.  Every time he posts is another proof he's real. Of course that only works until Trump tweets: "Fake!  Larper!  Imposter!".

       I've never heard this expression.  I take it means he's a bully

       a narcissistic temper tantrum throwing toddler?

       Armchair presidents, wow, I've never heard that one either.  I'm going to have to think about that for a bit and let it sink in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think, however, the point is made that you think he's some kind of child, as you alluded to a schoolyard of sorts.  If that's the case, I will ask again, do you think this orange man child with baby hands would let Q take some of Trump's credit?
       <br/>
       Before you answer, remember you think he's an impulsive, crazy, fly off the handle at a moments notice, unfit to be president because of his temperment.  If your answer is yes Trump would let that slide, then that's the best I got for now.

       It's an insider alright, they are usually the ones running the psyops. Conditioning you to believe in the state, to believe that someone out there in a position of power is working towards justice. That's laughable if you pay any attention whatsoever to the actions of the sitting government.

       Either way, it's conditioning people to trust in something that just isn't real. There are no moral actors within the government who are in positions to do anything that Q alludes to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how I know? Everything Q's government of choice is doing is pure evil, from supplying the Saudis and UAE with weapons and intel to wage a genocide on Yemen, to helping the Israelis maintain open air prisons in Palestine. A moral government that cared about human trafficking wouldn't support the rebels that allow slave markets in Libya to exist (I understand that Libya was Clinton and Obama's deal, but Trump has does nothing to correct it). Where is White Knight Trump? Q's chosen leader is backing ISIS and Al-Qaeda in Syria and across the Middle East, just like the previous administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't wait for the group of patriots that's behind the last year of our foreign policy to help me some more, while Monsanto and Bayer merge, while media further consolidates, while the government continues to detain American citizens without trial, without charges, spy on us, pursue whistle blowers as treasonous traitors and generally just turn the dial to 11 on all the heinous things the Obama administration got away with because liberals were silent when their guy was on the throne.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't get out ahead of the Q phenomenon, you've been spending too much time on 4-chan and not enough time laying attention to the real world all around you.

       I disagree, I think its certainly possible. The Trump administration has done lots of good, and you can't expect him to fix every problem in the world instantly. There will always be some injustice you could point out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think its clear that Trump has aligned himself with the Zionist faction of Jewry, against the Marxist faction. The Zionist faction is by no means good, but it is better than the Marxist faction and the only way to really fix things is to exploit the divide between the factions. I'd prefer an ethnonationalist Israel to a international cabal. I think that's exactly what Trump is doing, and its brilliant.

       That would be one well researched and insanely smart edgy teen to keep this LARP going for nearly 2 years without any major slip ups giving the whole thing away. Take into account the amount of Q bashing articles in the MSM...all for a LARP? I think not.

       Qanon's first appearance was end of October last year, so not a 2 year ride. FBI Anon was about 2 years ago at this point though and the claims in his drops about the foundation being the key are pretty similar to the crumbs dropped by qanon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it does turn out to be a LARP it will have been the most elaborate and well thought out LARP in history and I will feel well and truly duped.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is true, it basically shows that all the skeptics were right and that promise of vindication is what pulls so many into it. People call LARP because nothing huge has happened, but if you look close, all the pieces are lining up.
      </p>
      <p>
       July is supposed to be when the truth comes out, so if it is a LARP then we don't have much longer to find out.

       Thing is, it’s not remotely well thought out or planned. His posts are like what a ten year old doing an impression of a super secret spy would post. Not to mention even when he is vague to the point of farce he still hasn’t had a single prediction come true. He came from 4chan ffs, that’s all you really need to know.

       You can't fool 4chan and 8chan people for very long. The skepticism around Q is warranted and I am glad it is there, but you have to admit that the questions they ask have led people down some very interesting rabbit holes.
      </p>

       Based on the recent drops and the implication that it is coming to a head soon (truth comes out in July), I think we will all have our answers before the mid terms.

       q’s posts started with Clinton/sorts type conspiracy that has been around for decades and then tied in a little deep state stuff for good measure. Topped off with a ridiculous story of trump as some kind of god like freedom fighter. There’s nothing interesting, believable or original there at all.

       Fair enough.  I don't have an answer to the HRC and Huma arrests in November.  You got me there.  Maybe that's why he doesn't do predictions?
       <br/>
       But the story as a whole is quite intriguing.  And if you follow the news (all sources, not just CNN/FOX), then there are some pretty interesting things coming down the pipeline, that Q has alluded to.

       There is proof it was photoshopped. The comment literally above you proves it was photoshopped. You can keep believing in Q if you want, but you're just denying reality if you look at that proof and say "nuh uh!"

       “Future Proves Past” and all you have to do is “Trust the Plan”.

       Nah I’m joking. But I do think a lot of people will back off the Q Train once they start killing people. The whole sub is basically a pizzagate sub x10 and is trying to raise the tension and the suspense everyday. When actual legal things begin happening to the admin, I feel the Q crowd will find a way to “Follow the Plan” violently.

       Yep. Whenever something fizzles out or goes bust, it's just "the plan." They're already moving the goalposts with the Awan thing, even though it's months of wishful thinking down the drain.

       I heard that, but not a lot was said in the press about it, which I'm sure only fed the Qult fanaticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scary part is even if someone not related to the WH came out and said "I'm Q and this was all a LARP or a put on" a good part of the qult would not believe it.  They'd either call the guy a fake, or say he was a patsy to protect the "Real Q".
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the FBI did identify Q as some low level state department staffer then busted down his door and charged him with (idk what even), something stupid and marginally illegal based on his Q activities, they'd hold that poor sap up as a martyr or call it a fake by the Deep State to Silence Q and someone else would take his place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of frightening how serious some of these people seem to take Q and his messages.  After the Dam incident I don't put it past one of them to initiate a violent event in an effort to fulfill one of these so-called "prophecies."

       Am I the only one who doesn't care if he's an insider or not? The more people who are receptive to alternative and conspiratorial information and are wise to the social engineering that has gone on is a good thing. Go over to the q sub and talk about fringe stuff then go over to r/politics and do the same and see who is most receptive.

       Shouldn't that make their posts much more significant? and shouldn't this community be much more receptive to what they say? Even if it is a psyop against is, that is very significant, and very relevant!

       Trump supports Israel more so than the previous administration as well. It wouldn't surprise me if this was a mossad PSYOP, but I tend to think it could be US military intelligence also.

       This isn't about the credibility of the poster, but rather the argument they present. It shouldn't matter if it was hitler that brought it up, it's a good point. r/greatawakening isn't receptive of any skepticism, regardless of who is skeptical.

       Edit: Besides, to extrapolate that the OP leaves their children at criminal daycares based on their post is an over exaggeration, since they didn't explicitly say that they did. Also, this sort of division is what TPTB want. Just because they are "softer" on illegal immagration doesn't make them a sick fuck. Unity is what the world needs, or else we all fall under the control of TPTB

       Yeah the human brain is capable of being both smart and believing ridiculous shit. There are brain surgeons who believe the story of Noah's ark is literally true. My only point here that simply believing in some crazy shit doesnt open your mind more than other people by definition. In fact I would say flat earthers and Q followers are more close minded than others. Because theyve started with a belief and refuse to believe the barrage of evidence that anyone throws at them. They will always start with the belief and end with the belief. There is no room for change through learning.

       I've been following this stuff for like 6 months now dude. I'm extremely intrigued by all of it. I've listened to the "we the people" live stream basically every day. I've followed every drop for months and checked what the followers had to say. To this day, all I see is a guy throwing out vague hope to gullible conservatives who want to believe they are fighting for something. I guarantee you, the day I see Q make an actual prediction that comes true, I'll reconsider. Not some vague reference he made 3 months ago. I want to see something actually happen and I'd be happy to talk to you again about all of this.

       The whole thing isnt based on evidence. Its based on hope, emotion and belief, so theoretically it could just keep on going forever. It's like asking when is christianity going to fizzle out. As we've seen many times at this point, every time the movement takes a disappointing blow, they tell themselves that the reality everyone else sees isnt the real one. Even when Trump leaves office, Q could just pass the mantle to the next trumpiest guy still in government and pretend hes working with that person now. And his followers would continue believing. So it's I dont see any of this fizzling out anytime soon.

       Has anything that "Q" posted ever come to fruition? All I see are people posting "Q Drops" and then a whole lot of speculation and conjecture yet I don't see anything coming from it. I think the most outlandish one I saw of "Q's" posting is that Hillary Clinton was going to be arrested on a specific date and nothing has happened. People still believe it?

       Q's first posts were very specific claims about HRC, Podesta, etc, already having been indicted. Since that was all obviously bullshit, Q has since posted mostly rhetorical questions and cryptic clues about past and future events connecting, but rarely in a way that can be read as a specific prediction.

       There aren't. There are more sealed court documents now than a report found in 2006. This can be attributed to more district courts being on the PACER filing system, and more prosecutions for immigration and drug offenses.

      <p>
       First, are you saying there are or aren't 40k sealed indictments? Your statements contradict each other. Either they're shown in PACER or they arent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, what do you think these indictments would be going after? Immigration and drug trafficking are huge in the US and politicians could easily be indicted for their involvement/negligence. To immediately say you know one way or the other is improbable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, if these were in fact standard sealed indictments, why have this many accumulated without processing? My understanding is that sealed indictments are for bigger cases and instances that involve numerous people, that would have to be handled at the same time in order to prosecute correctly. Why do you think that these would be reserved for minor crimes?

         There are (or to be more accurate were, since many of the documents have been unsealed) that many sealed documents. Some are likely indictments, most likely are not. It's impossible to tell. Since they're, you know, sealed.
        </p>

         It's more likely these documents represent prosecutions for immigration/drug/gang offenses than some massive, earth-shaking pedo conspiracy. Occam's razor and all that.

         Some have been processed. The spreadsheet document even acknowledges that, without actually removing from the count. So it will only go upward, and become less accurate.

         While you are correct about some being indictments and some being documents, indictments arent 1 to 1 in terms of the numbers of people involved. It wouldn't be uncommon for that to be as high as 30 and there literally isnt a cap.

Not sure why that needed here because you keep admitting that immigration/drug/gang offenses are the likely culprits. Trump is going after human trafficking, most of which involve children and illegal immigration. Gang networks and drugs all find their roots in the shadiest parts of the world, which doesn't exclude DC. I guess you could put politicians on a pedestal, but I would say they are more susceptible to bribery and illegal behavior BECAUSE of their positions of power.

         Yes, some are naturally occurring during this process, but it's silly to ignore the manpower to sustain that level of accrual without prosecution.

      </ol>

       Regardless you seem to imply that these documents are reserved for a massive  network of illegals, drug smugglers, gang members, and crime organizations. I have a hard time believing that no one of significant is going to get pulled up in this.   Especially considering the documents recovered from the DNC, the Weiner laptop, and the faults of the previous administration.

       I think the tipping-point will be when Q tries to leverage his following into real-life action of some kind. I would put money on this outcome taking place, and even though I cannot foresee what form that action might take I would also bet that the results will be ugly and hilarious in equal measure.

       The theme is pretty consistent on not asking followers to do anything except spread the message, help comfort and explain to those who were not following once 'it happens', not to fall for the calls for civil war, and to trust that everything will work out without violent uprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they all of a sudden switched to telling their followers to march with guns in the streets, it would go counter to everything so far.

       I will say it again, Assange was the true "Q" until his internet was cut off. I think he, Bannon and Roger Stone created him. They took the data from the election, Cambridge Analytica and Breitbart to see what really got the base and some outsiders going. Now that whoever it is has taken it over, it is not nearly as well put together. That one guy came out saying it was a group of ppl and he wanted to come clean on it. Told how they got Trumps tweets before they came out and all of that. It seems completely different than how it used to be. So many articles and so many posts.

       Believing something just because people are talking against it is, IMO, a poor way to decide a conspiracy or anything is 'true'. I would suggest you do more research before you decide -anything-, one way or the other.

       It will just fizzle away. Qtards remind me of people who get caught up in ponzi schemes or mlm or bad ICOs. They have invested too much emotion, time, money into it they can't accept any evidence contrary to their beliefs. Hillary was supposed to be locked up and tortured in gitmo 6 months ago! My god they got conned by some 8chan trolls lol.

       Maybe it's Jack Ryan? But, Q is seriously this the kind of stuff that gets thrown out here deceive and throw people off the trail of actual info. It is quite literally the definition of a wild goose chase. Except I think it maybe unintentionally getting out of hand, I dont know whether this was meant to start a new religion but it inadvertently and hilariously doing so.

       I think a lot of the followers are just fake astroturf anyway. I'd say it's as fizzled as it's ever gonna be already, but they'll keep propping it up as long as they think it's helping. Maybe they'll drop it after the midterms in November? Seems like a part of the plan to this thing is keeping "conspiracy theorists" out of electoral politics. They could be encouraging us to advocate for and vote for good representatives, they could be encouraging political organization around specific policy. That's not what Q Anon is for though. They want us lulled into complacency.

       Q's first posts were very specific claims about HRC, Podesta, etc, already having been indicted. Since that was all obviously bullshit, Q has since posted mostly rhetorical questions and cryptic clues about past and future events connecting, but rarely in a way that can be read as a specific prediction.

       It's how mediums and psychics work. Throw vague, random stuff out and get the mark to confirm it for them.

       There aren't. There are more sealed court documents now than a report found in 2006. This can be attributed to more district courts being on the PACER filing system, and more prosecutions for immigration and drug offenses.

       And then whoever is behind Q will simply slip off into the night. And like every other mob, the rest of the people who remain will pretend they weren't REALLY part of it.

       Look, I also find it unlikely that Q is legit. I'm just saying that stranger things have happened, and that it is possible.

       Also Q doesn't give specific dates for events. You'd know that if you read the drops. But you won't.
