       I recently met a couple from texas that took 5 years to get an Aussie visa It isn't very easy for people from the US. I moved to Perth from the UK and it was a ball ache but well worth it. Would rather have settled on the east coast but Perth was easier.

       Unless there is some corresponding threat of imminent harm, it does need to be tolerated. At least that's what the founders of the US believed, and I agree with them.

       Just because you say it doesn't make it so. The 1st amendment isn't the ONLY way to handle free speech in a society. The Canadian Charter was adopted in the 80s and its worked great, in fact more countries model their constitutions after the Canadian Charter than the US Constitution

       I just think you have a mischaracterization with how those laws operate. It also definitely is free speech, just again not as liberal as the US is with the law. You won't go to jail for saying things that offend people

       You need to look up the hate speech laws because you literally can. I can give you countless examples depending on the country. You're not causing any actual harm, only hurting feelings. That doesn't happen when you have legitimate free speech.

       Hate Speech is Free Speech.

       I should be able to say, "I hate Purple People. Purple People are lazy and have low IQs." Yes, it is hateful, but I should be allowed to say it and voice my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>

       Yes, it's pretty easy to get a gun. About 30% of households own a firearm. Sure I guess you can "say hates speech", no idea why hate speech specifically is so important. Hate crimes exsist but those are tacked onto an initial crime, like assault can become a hate crime given the right circumstances but its not common

       That said, I’m not sure where you think you’re gonna go that’s much better. Most of Europe is further into the abyss than we are. If you have the means and ingenuity to self-sustain, there are places to go totally off the grid. But outside that, good luck running...

       People can't see the leftist fascism until they try doing something...renting, aborting, getting an establishment education, filing a 1040ez, or breaking the law doesn't count. "Doing things" (at least from what I have experienced in the deep blue states) like starting a business, building a house, having a legit employee, teaching your kids, or farming will give you a crash course in the fascism we live in...I will grant that many to all of the system has good intentions initially, but take into account that the system grants some protected classes your hard earned money and grants to them a laissez faire relationship to our laws...like the Adam Carolla story of getting a jay walking ticket within spitting distance of a swarm of illegal immigrants charging into stopped traffic to sell flowers from their unregistered uninspected illegally parked trucks.

       You won’t find me arguing with any of this, except that I think you’re using the term fascism to cover a wide range of traits that don’t really fit with its true definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Minorities being given protected class status is in fact the exact opposite of fascism. We are closer to soviet communism, but at the same time what we’re experiencing is unprecedented in a lot of ways (especially the foreign, ethnic component of the “ruling class”), and therefore defies these catch-all terms.

       When you start hearing rumbles of liberating the sudaten land you can legitimately be worried. Turn off your TV.

       Exactly. You have to flee to some US independent Country. Obvious 5 eye Countries like Canada, NZ, UK, AUS, are a absolute NG. Smaller European or Asian countries are a better choice. Especially since you come from a "richer" country you have a really well start. But when the US goes full retard with it's military, there is no chance anyway.

       you can either stay and wait for someone else to clean up the mess, or you can put down roots and help your neighbours and yourself clean up the mess (ideally by gaining food and shelter self sufficiency).   if you do the former there's no guarantee the people who fix things will be particularly incentivized to take in those who left the ship to sink.  and i wouldn't blame them.  the fix involves people helping each other gain strength, and this is counter to the current system which tells people how to be (weak).

       personally wifey and i, and our soon to be newborn, are doing the rv thing (#vanlife) for a few years.  we plan on networking with other nomads, finding and establishing edible food forests, locating land and putting up some greenhouses.  one step at a time.

       depends i guess.  i've thought about this subject for years.  there's no easy answer.  all i know is that people run and the brokenness doesn't change.  so maybe running is not the thing to do.  and i want a better world for my son, not one where problems accumulate to the point nobody feels they can be fixed.

       Sure. I guess if he had phrased it like this:

       "Say Trump got rid of the Central Bank and foreign Jewish influence in government, media, and the press. What you you do?"

       You mean like if they knew about the Allied bombs that were to be targeted at civilian populations would they have fled Germany?  If they had known about the years of oppression that awaited them at the hands of Jewish Communists after the war would they have abandoned their families and countrymen?

       Probably not.  Germans are known historically for their valuing honor as the ultimate virtue.

       this is a great question.  the main prerequisite was finding a partner who a) was "woke" b) had preppy skills c) was physically capable d) wouldn't take the money and run e) wanted the same degree of self-sufficiency as i did f) had good values.  this took years to make progress on, btw.
      </p>
      <p>
       the other thing is that i think the nature of the broken design we're under will become apparent eventually.  i reckon it's a complexity problem that manifests inevitably, and that's what seems to be happen in the real world.  and once the problem has a threshold of eyeballs on it, it will be addressed.  public awareness is one of our most capable herd defenses.

       Stay and fight for the Republic of seek greener pastures. The choice is yours. Some of us can't, and won't, leave. This country is too deeply ingrained in our blood- both that of ourselves but especially of our ancestors. How can one turn their back on 400 years of family history? I sink or swim with the Republic. My family helped build it. I can not abandon my birthright.

       That you consider standing for the Republic and the potential of what it could be as fanaticism, is a charge I'm willing to live with. That you dare compare me to the worst of the SS atrocities against Humanity is one I wholeheartedly mock. Like I said- I know where I come from. I know what my forefathers sacrificed. And I am not willing to simply let it go for nothing- I too will fight and sacrifice. And I genuinely don't care what shortsighted people have to say about that.

       Umm...  It was a star wars reference.  It sounded like the makings of another shit star wars prequel.  Young stormtrooper, before the white helmet, loves his republic. Thinks it's just the best.  Signs up like a good Patriot, then travels around the galaxy slaughtering hordes of people who think otherwise.

       Well Storm trooper was the name for German WW1 specialists and then WW2 SS members. It was used by George Lucas for exactly those connotations, so I apologize for taking it in the political sense.

      <p>
       Either way- In Star Wars the Republic was long dead by the time the Emperor took control. Likewise- my loyalty to this country is to its Republic, which exists independently of the Nation itself. The Republic is the ideal of the Constitution, and the imperfect implementation of this ideal. If you think I support Trump or any foreign policy of the last 40 years, you would be dead wrong.

       I'd hoped the emperor line would show that I wasn't trying to play the "natzi" card, or such ridiculousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more seriously...  The transition from republic to empire won't be stopped by a handful of good citizens.  Most of the people who support the republic will be carried right along into the empire.  The shit rolls downhill, and all the citizens can do is catch it as it rolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if we had a good old fashioned power outage or food shortage for a month, that'd be a whole different story.  But angry citizens without their internet wouldn't even know which enemy to lash out against, and they would do just as much/more harm than good.

       Republics can rule Empire's. The Roman Republic ruled and Empire for at least a century, arguably more.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Republic, or specifically a Democratic Republic, is one in which its representatives rule with the consent and majority of the governed, and in their interests. That Nation itself could very well, however, rule an empire. Not that that would be Just.

       Man, in my opinion the ONLY half way decent Star Wars movie in the last twenty years was "Rogue One".  I can't even bring myself to watch the new Solo movie.  I've been offered free tickets to go with family etc but I just can't do it.  It sucks to see something ruined that was such a staple of your childhood.  Hopefully things will turn around but probably not before they have another bunch of shitty attempts.

       I didn't see Solo because TLJ left such a bad taste in my mouth. I will see Episode 9 simply to finish the trilogy, and so that I can bitch about it (as I figure I will) without getting the bs about not having watched it. But, sadly, I fear it will be the last Star Wars film I ever watch in Theaters.

       I wish, but I doubt it. Disney brought JJ back to fix it but it's too late. Force Awakens was a retread of Ep 4. yes, but it was a solid 7/10 movie. It was what the fans wanted and it allowed a base of operations for more lore. JJ had 3 scripts for 7/8/9 written along with a storyboard. Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy said fuck all that, and completely, 100% rewrote Episode 8. As a result, nothing JJ set up in 7 can be fulfilled, in fact it was all fucking retconned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Johnson and Kennedy helped destroy one of the oldest and most powerful franchises in American history. I will never forgive them for the horrific character genocide they've committed concerning Han, Leia, and especially Luke.
