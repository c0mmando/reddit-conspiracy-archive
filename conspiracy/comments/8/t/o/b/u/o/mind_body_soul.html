       One day at work Mind, Body, and Soul popped in my head and I applied that to the history of us humans being on earth. When we were first put here we didn't know anything about the earth. Just moving rocks around and living. Basically the cavemen. It was this time period where we were in the Body phase of life. After awhile, civilizations like the Egyptians and plenty of others started to realize that's theirs more to life than just building monoliths. There's an afterlife after death and that was when we were in the Soul phase. The Soul phase ended after the Romans (I think that's who it was) saw Jesus Christ walk on water and started preforming these miracles. The Romans saw them and felt that wasn't possible, it wasn't logical for a human being to be able to perform such stunts. So they killed them. If it were the Egyptians they would have worshiped him. After his death is when we moved into being in the era of Mind. Of logic. We have been in this phase of Mind til the year 2012. 2012 was the end of our little 'test'. We have nothing left on this world anymore. We are now in the age of Nothingness.

       Please feel free to add on and correct me on anything. I thought of this around in 2016 and wanted to post it here for years but never have. Any thoughts is much appreciated.

       I think it has to do with us moving from the Age of Pisces into the Age of Aquarius. The Age of Aquarius is also called the Age of Awakening.

       I think the Bible has hidden meanings and wasn't meant to be taken literally. Bill Donahue on Youtube has some great videos about this.

       I was an atheist for some time as well. I woke up to conspiracies and spirituality on the same day about 5:5 years ago, and I see the spiritual community growing lots! Still very few people I know in real life tho.

       Thank you. I like the idea of being able to chose our next path. I feel if its the age of Nothingness or the age of all three of them. I only say nothingness because life in the early 2000's and life for our parents in the 70's and 80's had meaning behind them. Life felt worth living for. Now it feels redundant and there's no meaning unless like you said we chose our own path and then put meaning behind it ourselves.

       I agree its almost impossible to find meaning these days working within the system. I also think many of us are evolving beyond being satisfied with the "American Dream".

       I have a lot of synchronicity with the number. It started when I first woke up to conspiracy through David McGowans Pedophocracy and the Greenbaum speech on deprogramming ritual abuse survivors. I looked at the clock and it was 11:33. Later I learned that the number has been following me around my whole life, both current and childhood addresses are 333, ACT score 33, as a couple major examples. One time I opened my phone, and spotify was playing Peng!33 by Iron and Wine, I had never listened to them on spotify, and I had no idea the song existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't really understand the deeper levels of significance but I hope to some day.

       Gr8 thanks.  I only asked because 33 is a Masonic number and “love and light” is also satanic... but thanks for clearing that up.

       I’m sure you know who John Lennon is, he had the same experience as you, the number 9 followed him round his whole life.  He was obsessed.  Numerology is interesting to me, I’d love to see more of it on this sub.

       Gotcha, I understand its controversial. I have a theory that occult groups have tried to own the number because they haven't been able to grasp its significance, due to always having to repeat cycles and never reaching true freedom. Love and Light has been coopted by some dark energies but to me at least, they just represent the two principles of creativity and creation, based in a desire to share these traits with others.

       Harvest time. You can choose to think and be free of this place or to be a fish and get captured into Jesus’ slavery.

       Each astrological age lasts approx. 2,000 years. This is not made up. This has to do with the March equinox. Here is the wikipedia about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, some people don't think the astrological ages have an impact on us as humans, but I think it does.

       I've had an interesting conversation a few months ago. Me and my friend had discussion on history truths and falses, and about progress, all time being in presence of his grandmother that is 94 years old. We simultaniously came to realization that from when she was born, mostly "everything" happened. Most people born in 1920's mostly lead the same life as if they were born in 1500's, 1000's , or in 400 BC ... They had no education, no information, and lived mostly in smaller communities, unaffected by grander scale happenings. Apart from wars, which none of them knew reasons for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, compare this to our everyday life, the constant bombardement of information, accessibility of education, and scientific breakthroughs.

       Much of what you said appears to be historically wrong, e.g. Aristotle (who was "before" the Romans, to simplify things) is a towering figure in the history of logic, indeed, a seminal and also one of the greatest logicians of all time.

       I have a lot of synchronicity with the number. It started when I first woke up to conspiracy through David McGowans Pedophocracy and the Greenbaum speech on deprogramming ritual abuse survivors. I looked at the clock and it was 11:33. Later I learned that the number has been following me around my whole life, both current and childhood addresses are 333, ACT score 33, as a couple major examples. One time I opened my phone, and spotify was playing Peng!33 by Iron and Wine, I had never listened to them on spotify, and I had no idea the song existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't really understand the deeper levels of significance but I hope to some day.
