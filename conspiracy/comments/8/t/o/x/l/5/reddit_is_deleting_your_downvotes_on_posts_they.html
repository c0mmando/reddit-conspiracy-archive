       x3 times since last night 2 posts I have downvoted have had my downvote erased so they can continue their dominance of thr front page. SS; Reddit is removing your downvote to certain posts they want to promote.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another topic, has anyone noticed when opening certain posts in r/conspiracy the whole page flicks at you like a camera shutter would? I have not noticed this with any other subs, just here, like your mobile is taking a picture of you when opening specific posts. Could be to build a facial recognition database or building a database of users who are active in this sub..
      </p>
      <p>
       It may sound paranoid but I'd rather be vigilant than willingly accept  anything that seems out of the ordinary.

       Reddit is weird. I've often found that a majority of my posts are at "1". (meaning no updown votes), but then a small percentage of them go to the moon (50+ votes)

       No, I've observed it enough times over multiple years to know that it is targeted. It only happens to me on certain subs, mostly this one, and only on threads that are being severely astroturfed.

       I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying, or I wasn't being clear. I'm not talking about
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       threads and comments being downvoted. I'm talking about other threads and comments I have upvoted (and not even participated in) where my upvote disappears, as if I never upvoted it at all. And no, its not just a page refresh problem or hitting back without loading the page, because I assumed thats what it was at first so I made a point to be sure my vote actually stuck. There will be threads where I will upvote many comments, and then I will return half an hour later and see that a lot of my upvotes are missing. There will always be gap of time where my upvote stayed before it was deleted. And often, the comments missing upvotes would be for popular/high profle users who are saying something controversial. This doesn't happen in other subs like r/aww my hometown sub or any other fun/hobby/entertainment sub. It only happens to me in conspiratorial or political threads and subs. I know, because I've been paying attention to this for years. I know what I've seen.

       Giving you the quickest history comb over, I can see you post and comment on a lot of conspiracy threads. It happens to me to, so are they out for every subreddit? Or just the ones that fit your narrow view? I experience the same problems while posting and commenting in many subreddits. Again, sounds like you're looking for this to be a bigger problem than is.

       Every sub has an agenda and a narrative they want to steer. I find that some compelling things I post will start to get traction on to be downvoted back to obscurity quickly and never into the negative unless itâ€™s a legit controversial opinion.

       Imagine a subreddit had moderators that went and made their own private sub (called something like, just using this one as an example, r/conspiracy_conclave) where only they and a few privileged posters can go. And then they began using this private sub to conspire to steer the discussion of the main sub in a direction that agrees with their politics. And then they begin banning anybody whose politics they don't agree with.

       That sub is filled with people of different political ideologies. It was simply created as a place to discuss the attempted takeover of this sub (seemingly with the help of reddit admins), and ways to try and help stop the constant political brigading and bickering that many users here can clearly recognize occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no one gets banned for not agreeing on politics. Everyone that gets banned is almost always from being an asshole and very clearly violating the rules. The modlogs are public. I'd love to see a single example of someone respectfully arguing a political view and getting banned for it.

       Dude you can get banned for not agreeing about anything with a mod. I just got banned from a sub on Reddit three days ago just for stating an opinion. This is the downfall of the Internet were seeing. Moderators and adminâ€˜s are just self policing citizens that think they have power but are really just destroying everybodyâ€™s free speech at every turn. When you give somebody power to edit what people see/read, thatâ€™s some powerful shit. I donâ€™t like some ass hat deciding what I can and cannot read.

       I completely agree with everything you just wrote. But what does any of that have to do with r/conspiracy? I'd argue that the mods here are far more accountable than nearly all other subreddits, because there are representatives from both sides of the isle on the mod team.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone has an example of getting banned for simply disagreeing, I'm open to seeing it. But the only people making that claim are TMOR users, who are not typically known for their politeness or civility.

       Yeah but sometimes I feel like there are just topics that are so big itâ€™s very hard to be polite or civil at times. I donâ€™t think that deleting the personâ€™s comments though are away to go about making a better world. Imagine watching some sort of a court movie or something and all you got to see was the verdict at the end. You never got to watch the trial or anything. Wouldnâ€™t you want to know what led up to the decision? I know I would but the fact that I donâ€™t even get the option to see what the fuck happened or who dropped the bomb or why it is very concerning to me. I understand that itâ€™s redditâ€™s platform their tools yady yada but in every facet of the Internet they always rely on free users and free info so in a sense we built the Internet not them. Itâ€™s One of those things where they wonâ€™t exist without us and we wonâ€™t exist without it.

       There's a difference between not being polite or civil, and not attacking/insulting/being an all around douche bag to people that disagree with you politically. The ones who get banned exhibit the latter.

       Why would they do it like that though? It's just inviting you to vote again. I do believe that some votes simply aren't counted but they don't
       <em>
        tell

       you, it's like shadowbanning a person. If your vote disappears it's more likely there was a connection issue and it just wasn't logged properly.

       User Agreement? lol, do you think when the Shizz hits the fan that a user agreement is going to matter? They sold r/politics for 2.8 mill or the like and that was the start of the avalanche. They are found out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, they don't appear to be taking down bots, they might be running them. They have the analytics to take care of it, after all, users here have made it be known.

       Giving you the quickest history comb over, I can see you post and comment on a lot of conspiracy threads. It happens to me to, so are they out for every subreddit? Or just the ones that fit your narrow view? I experience the same problems while posting and commenting in many subreddits. Again, sounds like you're looking for this to be a bigger problem than is.
