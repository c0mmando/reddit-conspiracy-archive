        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>DISCLAIMER: This post is not intended in any way to villify or defame people who identify as homosexual, love whoever you want.</p>

<p>Okay, so I have a question. While I was scrolling through some gay rights article that popped up on my feed, I noticed an interesting trend. Many LGBTQ+ activists seem to be advocating for the end of a society that presses what they call heterosexual norms on our youth. This includes stuff such as forbidding male/female sleepovers for dear of heterosexual sexual relations between the children, and the usage of language like &quot;your future wife&quot; or &quot;future husband&quot;. I think this is interesting, because at the surface it seems like a fairly normal thing to push for, so that LGBTQ+ kids growing up don&#39;t feel so outside the norm, especially with new data showing that the majority of young people nowadays don&#39;t self-identify as straight. But I think there may be some other motives. Almost 3 decade ago the world seemed to be gripped in a widespread fear of overpopulation. There were several books on the topic, and the idea was that it was such a threat to our society that references to the dangers posed by overpopulation worked their way into the public conscience. However, much of the science and data that circulated during that time have been rendered obsolete by the widespread use of genetically modified crops. They solved the problem of feeding the hoardes of people that were supposed to be around by the end of the 21st century. So the reason why I think there may be a connection is partly because many liberals are opposed to GMOs and because the gay rights movement is predominantly liberal. I think that it might not be too far fetched of an idea for a group of people to come up with the idea that if they were able to make a large percentage of the population open to the idea of having sexual relations in a way that does not produce children, they could slow down the effects of overpopulation. Now, the evidence for this is shaky at best and has no likelihood of ever being proved correct, I think there is a few compelling arguments to be made here. One, there have been a few studies that show that being gay is often heavily influenced by the environment that you grew up in, I think this article sums it up ok:
 <a href="http://www.bu.edu/today/2010/nature-vs-nurture-the-biology-of-sexuality/">http://www.bu.edu/today/2010/nature-vs-nurture-the-biology-of-sexuality/</a>
The reason this is important is because if being gay depends on you having exposure to the idea of homosexual relationships, then the widespread acceptance of non straight people nowadays could account for the huge numbers of young people who are identifying as homosexual. It could also be because of the desire to be a part of a community, or a marginalised group, giving more power to the individual because of intersectionality, but that&#39;s a theory for another day. The second piece of evidence for my theory is that in the 1970s, the book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; by Paul Erichle was causing a worldwide fear of population. That book is often credited for starting the idea of overpopulation, and it caused widespread panic. The book was published in 1968. Just one year later was the Stonewall Riots, the event that is often credited as starting the modern gay rights movement. It could be a coincidence, but we don&#39;t really do that here. So yeah, that&#39;s my thing. Sorry about spelling and grammar errors, sort of a late night thought. Lemme know if you see any flaws in my reasoning or more evidence or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s multifaceted. The main reason is merely perversion as a norm. You will always see this when an empire was in decline and the west very much is. I highly suggest the stages of an empire. You can find it on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think many of these groups, ie the gay and lesbian groups, the feminists, the right wing etc have been infiltrated and now push agendas which are alienating and destructive in order to create artificial conflicts between groups. Apparently feminists insist women want to occupy combat positions in the military, which makes all feminists look extreme despite the fact the majority of feminists might not agree. Of course you can’t find anything online suggesting many feminists think this is nuts. </p>

<p>The same goes with anti immigration, according to the media you can’t be in favor of border control without being a Nazi, and if you are in favor of border control, then you are lead to believe that you are fighting a legion of angry blue haired women who want to open our borders to the world. In reality both extremes are media creations. </p>

<p>It’s the same in the example provided above, most homosexual people want to go to work, fall in love and lay in bed on Sunday mornings, but anyone reading the ideas above about suppressing heterosexuality as a norm will start to feel gay people are are threat seeking to undermine families and thus anti gay feelings are fueled.</p>

<p>So after my essay, my belief is they are not using this tactic to slow reproduction, they are using it to trigger needless conflict between straight and gay folk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is correct they do it by supporting random people who are doing these vicious court cases. For example there were two bakeries on the same street and one was gay. Gay people came to the other one just in order to start litigation and said &quot;we need x amount of these cakes that all say &#39;[really gay stuff about the gay wedding they were getting the wedding cake/cakes for]&#39;. So then the shopowner was like &quot;Why don&#39;t you just simply ask the bakery down the street they are already your friends so why don&#39;t you support their business?&quot; And then they got sued for like millions of dollars.</p>

<p>If we weren&#39;t kind by nature mammals would have died out hundreds of millions of years ago. We have courts to support the criminals. Churches are where we go to make sure the Arabs and Jews genealogies are still wealthy. Police cars are driven by members of those gangs. Hospitals are where people die. And scientific research is animal cruelty and imprisonment to further soon-to-be obsolete products that go out of style as fast as dry sand disperses when you try to make it into a castle (Except synthetic biology). University is where we go to learn only things that have been derived from Pythagorean Theorem. And work is what we do so that robots wont need to.</p>
