<hr/>

<p>“…it was the theory of the ancient magicians that any living being
is a storehouse of energy varying in quantity according to the size
and health of the animal , and in quality according to its mental and
moral character. At the death of the animal this energy is liberated
suddenly. The animal should therefore be killed within the Circle, or
Triangle, as the case may be, so that its energy cannot escape…For
the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that victim
which contains the greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect
innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory and suitable
victim.” (Magick, by Master Therion, published in 1929 by the Lecram
Press, Paris, France)</p>

<p>A footnote on p. 95 says: “(4) It appears from the Magical Records of
Frater Perdurabo that he made this particular sacrifice on an average
about 150 times every year between 1912 and 1928.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sacrificing 150 male children a year thing was referring to masturbation. The censors in England would allow him to talk about killing children but not masturbation. He clearly explained this somewhere but I doubt you would believe it if I took the time to find the exact quotation. </p>

<p>AC wasn’t a satanist. He did play into the media rumor that he was the “most wickedest man in the world” thing tho. He wasn’t a satanist. He wasn’t perfect but he wasn’t that. </p>

<p>If you dig a little deeper I think you will clearly find that </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He asked people to call him the beast and refer to him by the number 666. He routinely said his goal was to destroy Christianity.</p>

<p>He wrote about animal and human sacrifice here and in other places. On numerous occasions he tried to use black magic to summon demons. He killed animals in sacrifices.</p>

<p>He left his wife and kid without remorse. He left climbers he was with to die after an avalanche. He gave people drugs without their permission and watched multiple people he fucked with go insane. He got people hooked on drugs. </p>

<p>On top of all of this the motto of his philosophy was &quot;fuck you, I&#39;ll do what I want&quot;</p>

<p>And no... Sorry... &quot;sacrificing a male child of high intelligence and perfect innocence is the most satisfactory&quot; is not about masturbation. The sentence is in a paragraph specifically about animal sacrifice and you don&#39;t sacrifice individual sperm of only the male sex and high intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crowley’s mother used to call him the beast bc he was a bad kid, he embraced the name. He clearly writes about it and explains it.  He was into gnostic Christianity and felt mainstream Christianity was perverted. In his biography he implies he was sexually abused as a kid at a Christian school he went too. His parents were in some very strict religious sect. </p>

<p>Do what tho wilt shall be the whole of the law, Love is the law, love under will is not a license to do whatever you want. </p>

<p>He clearly explained this philosophy but again, you seem to have made up your mind he was a satanist. I can provide you with quotes if you are open to possibly changing your opinion. </p>

<p>The proof in this is the second part of do what thou wilt.... which is love is the law, love under will. What evil satanist talks about love and has love featured so prominently in their philosophy? </p>

<p>Yes he summoned all manner of spirits, was addicted to drugs and had questionable morals. They were akin to those of a rock star. But he was not a satanist. This is simply not true. </p>

<p>Yes there was some Animal sacrifice but many religions have those. </p>

<p>He clearly stated that he was referring to masturbation... if he was into human sacrifice how come there is no mention or even rumor he ever did this. There is however a record of all of his other misdeeds you reference. </p>

<p>Crowley was a a lot of things but he wasn’t into human sacrifice or “devil worship”. Dig a little deeper. You will see </p>

<p>Should I have better phrased it as.. I once engaged in a talk show Maury and saw an episode not one but thrice that had me speculate on the genetics of the children in question the samples if you will not once but a total of three times. I said Yes the paternity would be correct and alas I was incorrect. The double helix was not a match.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is exactly what the Jesus of the Bible taught that God alone is God as a complete and separate entity.</p>

<p>Not once did Jesus claim to be God or even a part of God and of the nearly two dozen references to heaven as Jesus was asked every single time he said love the father, follow the father, and worship the father.</p>

<p>However starting with Paul onward and along the way that message became twisted into Christianity&#39;s claim that Jesus is God and that the father should be almost completely ignored.</p>

<p>This along with the three engrained lies of Christianity are sacrilege carried out and into the satanic traditions of Luciferferian worship in this thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly you have not studied the bible.</p>

<p>John 10:30-33 - Jesus answered them, “I and My Father are one.” Then the Jews took up stones again to stone Him. Jesus answered them, “Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?” The Jews answered Him, saying, “For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God.”</p>

<p>John 8:58 Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.” 
In Revelation, an angel instructed the apostle John to only worship God (Revelation 19:10). Several times in Scripture Jesus receives worship (Matthew 2:11; 14:33; 28:9, 17; Luke 24:52; John 9:38). He never rebukes people for worshiping Him. If Jesus were not God, He would have told people to not worship Him, just as the angel in Revelation did. There are many other passages of Scripture that argue for Jesus’ deity.</p>

<p>Thomas the disciple declared concerning Jesus, “My Lord and my God” (John 20:28). Jesus does not correct him.</p>

<p>Paul says the father should be ignored? No he doesn&#39;t? Paul says God instead of father because Jesus is the son after all, Get it?</p>

<p>Where does Paul proclaim Jesus is God and the father should be ignored? Spoiler he doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know what your talking about.</p>

<p>You say Christian in public but luciferian in private , yes I would agree with you if your talking about the presidents, politicians, celebrities and the &quot;elites&quot; Not actual followers of Christ.</p>

<p>Question: &quot;Why are both Jesus and Satan referred to as the morning star?&quot;</p>

<p>Answer: The first reference to the morning star as an individual is in Isaiah 14:12: “How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!” (NIV). The KJV and NKJV both translate “morning star” as “Lucifer, son of the morning.” It is clear from the rest of the passage that Isaiah is referring to Satan’s fall from heaven (Luke 10:18). So in this case, the morning star refers to Satan. In Revelation 22:16, Jesus unmistakably identifies Himself as the morning star. Why are both Jesus and Satan described as the “morning star”?</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the concept of the “morning star” is not the only concept that is applied to both Jesus and Satan. In Revelation 5:5, Jesus is referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah. In 1 Peter 5:8, Satan is compared to a lion, seeking someone to devour. The point is this, both Jesus and Satan, to a certain extent, have similarities to lions. Jesus is similar to a lion in that He is the King, He is royal and majestic. Satan is similar to a lion in that he seeks to devour other creatures. That is where the similarities between Jesus, Satan, and lions end, however. Jesus and Satan are like lions in very different ways.</p>

<p>The idea of a “bright morning star” is a star that outshines all the others, and Jesus is the One who is called “bright.” </p>

<p>Satan was a morning star. Jesus, as God incarnate, the Lord of the universe, is the BRIGHT and morning star. Jesus is the most holy and powerful “light” in all the universe. So, while both Jesus and Satan can be described as “morning stars,” in no sense is this equating Jesus and Satan. </p>

<p>Satan is a created being. His light only exists to the extent that God created it. </p>

<p>Jesus is the light of the world (John 9:5). Only Jesus’ light is “bright” and self-existent. Satan may be a morning star, but he is only a poor imitation of the one true bright morning star, Jesus Christ, the light of the world.</p>

If this was what it’s all really about the rest of everything wouldn’t be veiled attempts at explaining sex when you couldn’t print such things. It would all be about killing children. The foot note is to show how ludicrous the claim itself was. 150. 
There’s literally a chapter 69 called how to succeed and suck eggs in the book of lies. It’s just dark humor. Dude was a top notch asshole but a smart one.
Stop being scared and just read the actual works you’re afraid of, not a blurb that 10 seconds of googling could’ve explained to you ad Infinitum.</p>

<p>Not once did Jesus claim to be God or even a part of God and of the nearly two dozen references to heaven as Jesus was asked every single time he said love the father, follow the father, and worship the father.</p>

<p>However starting with Paul onward and along the way that message became twisted into Christianity&#39;s claim that Jesus is God and that the father should be almost completely ignored.</p>

<p>This along with the three engrained lies of Christianity are sacrilege carried out and into the satanic traditions of Luciferferian worship in this thread.</p>
