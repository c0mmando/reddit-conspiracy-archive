    <div class="md"><p>Austrian school of economics, aka LUDWIG VON MISES, predicted the great depression: </p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Austrian_predictions">https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/Austrian_predictions</a></p>

<p><a href="https://mises.org/library/prophet-great-depression">https://mises.org/library/prophet-great-depression</a></p>

<p>Peter Schiff, anarcho capitalist, predicted 2008 ACCURATELY in 2006: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgRGBNekFIw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgRGBNekFIw</a></p>

<p>Pro-Tip: 
Usually people who foresee bad things support policies which prevent them. </p>

<p>Pro-Tip 2: Government suppression of competition and options for investors and consumers causes these crashes.. they make it harder or impossible to HEDGE against a crash.. AND they obfuscate and condition investors to think anything that is legal or listed is a safe investment. Investors need to be CAREFUL and suspicious of anyone offering an investment and do their own research... but the FED wants to coddle investors so they can be fed bunk ass whack ass bonds and shitty green FIAT that&#39;s guaranteed to lose value no matter what. </p>

<p>Pro-Tip 3: Don&#39;t quit your day job anytime soon.</p>

<p>Pro-Tip 4: Keynes just looked at what the Austrian school was saying and twisted the narrative so he could pretend to have &quot;predicted&quot; the depression.. His ideas and logic are literally self contradictory.. the hallmark of WRONG. </p>

<p>Pro-Tip 5: When you dislodge your tongue from the ass of neo-liberal establishment make sure you take note of state enterprise and artificial monopolies in Europe.. the false idol you worship. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that going against your pro tip 2?</p>

<p>If you can show me how and why I&#39;m wrong I&#39;d appreciate it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I provided links man.. mises.org has EVERYTHING you want to know and Peter Schiff has a really in depth podcast. I personally TRIPLE DOG DARE you to do your own investigation before making up your mind and buying into the neoliberal conditioning that you just parroted like the good lil boy that you are. </p>

<p>Some banks in sweden did good to but they&#39;ve been stagnate as fuck also. Yeah of course freedom is a double edged sword because people are literally free to make mistakes and it&#39;s hard because individuals HAVE TO LEARN from mistakes, but it&#39;s way better to have a robost decentralized network that isn&#39;t vulnerable to any single fault where people live and learn and get better than a vast bureaucracy that can be brought to it&#39;s knees by the human error of just a handful of individuals. </p>

<p>That last part was my opinion btw... Peter Schiff and Mises.org are the two of the best resources though. </p>

<p>Btw 2: I disagree with Schiff about Bitcoin and crypto.. He sometimes mistakenly says they have no real value but then admits other times they do because they give people options in a statist hell that we are in. Bitcoin forced the regulators to allow people to use different currency and now you can even get a gold account debit card so you can spend gold like cash. You can go to goldmoney.com </p>

<p>And you see how being able to own gold and spend it hedges against the incoming dollar/debt crisis?? </p>

<p>Just google &quot;Peter Schiff Dollar crisis&quot; or follow these links:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LRmzXLezZuk">https://youtu.be/LRmzXLezZuk</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8V19Ar3LqYc">https://youtu.be/8V19Ar3LqYc</a></p>

<p>Btw if you know any friends or family that have their money stupidly in banks or 401ks Peter Schiff has a company <a href="http://www.europac.com/">http://www.europac.com/</a> that will help them protect them against the upcoming crisis.. There is no way they can put it off forever and the best possible scenario is a slightly slower decline but the thing is that investors like to get out of an asset if they see it&#39;s clearly going to decline.. that&#39;s not an argument for socialism btw because economic Darwinism is much better than rewarding losers... which is exactly what quantitative easing and the bailouts did! </p>

<p><strong>Just ask yourself? What happens when the interest rates go up to historic levels like 5 percent and the US government has to start making yearly payments in the hundreds of billions of dollars on their public debt??</strong> You realize the FED is printing money like mad for this specific reason???? Printing money lowers interest as people have too much cash and are trying to get it into investments that don&#39;t depreciate. But you have to pay the piper at some point.. </p>

<p>Bonus: </p>

<p>Catherine Austin Fitts about all the missing money.. she was one of the top financial advisors for Bush Sr. and she has been doing foresenic accounting on the gov for like 20 years now.. She says AT LEAST 20 TRILLION is missing and the pentagon admits to 8 TRILLION of it anyway. The whole system is BEYOND FUCKED.. IT&#39;s fucking FUBAR at this point and just an example of HUMAN FOLLY and how HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS when people try to manipulate markets this is what happens inevitably:

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a clear indicator that we live in a time where corporations are more powerful than government, especially local government. </p>

<p>My city can barely fix a road and when they do it takes a long time. But the other day I drove past a large office that was getting a bunch of road work done just outside the office. That job was completed in a few days. It pisses me off. </p>

<p>The common man works hard and pays taxes but gets nothing back from the government. The rich do nothing but are given everything paid for by the common man&#39;s hard labor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be better to allow successful businesses to do infrastructural work on behalf of Uncle Sam. Government agencies and government-ran jobs are known to be wasteful, sloppy, poorly managed, etc. Everyone knows how painful a trip to the DOL or the DMV is. Those offices are lazy, trashy, and slow. To think of all the tax dollars we pay only to get such shitty low-effort operations just grinds my gears.</p>
