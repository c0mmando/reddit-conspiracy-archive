        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here we have two very distinct and very obvious signs from the Universe about Donald Trump and what he is and what he&#39;s come to do. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicted-ingersoll-lockwood-adventures-barron-melania-last-644284">http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-predicted-ingersoll-lockwood-adventures-barron-melania-last-644284</a> </p>

<p>The first sign involves 3 books. 2 are children&#39;s books that follow a boy named Baron Trump (Donald Trump had a fake name he use to use for press named John Baron or John Barron. His last child is also named Barron Trump). Baron Trump is very wealthy and lives in Castle Trump. He becomes bored with his luxurious lifestyle and ends up in Russia on an adventure that shapes the rest of his life. He is guided by a &quot;master of all masters&quot; named Don. He&#39;s on a quest to find a &quot;world within a world&quot; and the way to find it is told to him in a phrase that he keeps repeating to himself &quot;The people will tell thee&quot; He is repeatedly called &quot;the little Baron&quot;. He has a such a great brain that he&#39;ll get so focused on things, he won&#39;t notice his entire house is up flames before it&#39;s cool. He&#39;s quick to anger and show his poiwer. He claims no Trump had ever surrendered and he never would either!</p>

<p>The last book of the 3 is called &quot;The Last President&quot; From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The story begins with a scene from a panicked New York City in early November, describing a &quot;state of uproar&quot; after the election of an enormously opposed outsider candidate.  </p>

<p>&quot;The entire East Side is in a state of uproar,&quot; police officers shouted through the streets, warning city folk to stay indoors for the night. &quot;Mobs of vast size are organizing under the lead of anarchists and socialists, and threaten to plunder and despoil the houses of the rich who have wronged and oppressed them for so many years.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;The Fifth Avenue Hotel will be the first to feel the fury of the mob,&quot; the novel continues, citing an address in New York City where Trump Tower now stands. &quot;Would the troops be in time to save it?  </p>

<p>The Last President doesn’t follow the same fictional narrative of Lockwood’s previous novels, though the links to Trump are once again abundantly clear. The president’s hometown of New York City is fearing the collapse of the republic in this book, also titled 1900, immediately following the transition of presidential power. Some Americans begin forming a resistance, protesting what was seen as a corrupt and unethical election process.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strangely, he is an outsider candidate said to represent the “common man,” amid claims he will liberate the people from the bankers - an anti-establishment candidate as Mr Trump was billed as being. </p>

<p><a href="https://411mania.com/movies/the-trump-era-films-trackdown-the-end-of-the-world/">https://411mania.com/movies/the-trump-era-films-trackdown-the-end-of-the-world/</a> </p>

<p>The name of this specific episode is called THE END OF THE WORLD.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a fifties Western television series (Trackdown) that had an episode called, “The End of the World.” In this episode, the series’ main character, Hoby Gilman (played by Robert Culp), visits a town that has been left shook.  </p>

<p>Why has this town been left in such a state of despair? The end of the world is coming of course.  </p>

<p>Why does this town believe this? A man actually named Walter Trump (played by Lawrence Dobkin) rose up out of nowhere and claimed that the world was going to end and that only HE had the power stop it.  </p>

<p>The people immediately fall in line and believe every word that he said. The outsider, Hoby, is the only one to call Trump out on his lies. How does Trump respond when Hoby calls him out?  </p>

<p>Trump actually threatens to sue him.  </p>

<p>The cops of course rally behind Trump. One of them (who is proven to be in on the scheme) asks Hoby rhetorically, “Can you prove he’s wrong?” He then says to Hoby, “It’s a lot safer to go his way than yours.”  </p>

<p>Hoby tries his luck with the local judge who meekly stands by and says there is nothing that can be done. He warns Hoby, “Anyone who tries to change their minds might get hurt. They’re not going to believe you.”  </p>

<p>The judge uses an apt metaphor though to at least shed some light on the situation.   </p>

<p>Judge: &quot;Can you prove that&#39;s what he really has in mind?&quot;  </p>

<p>Hoby: &quot;It&#39;s obvious.&quot;  </p>

<p>Judge: &quot;But can you prove it?&quot;  </p>

<p>Hoby: &quot;What if I take him?&quot;  </p>

<p>Judge: &quot;On what charge?&quot;  </p>

<p>Hoby: &quot;Fraud&quot;  </p>

<p>Judge: &quot;Don&#39;t you see, he&#39;s not exactly guilty of fraud.&quot;  </p>

<p>Judge: &quot;I live here, I know these people pretty well. And right now, there&#39;s nothing in the world that can change their minds. And anyone who tries to is gonna end up getting hurt. They&#39;re not gonna listen.&quot;  </p>

<p>Hoby: &quot;Well what if he starts a panic, it could happen.&quot;  </p>

<p>Judge: &quot;Sure, you might as well try to spit out a forest fire.&quot;  </p>

<p>Hoby: &quot;There&#39;s got to be some way to stop him.&quot;  </p>

<p>Judge: &quot;If there is, I don&#39;t know it. It&#39;s a funny thing. When we were kids, we were all afraid of the dark. And we grew up, and we weren&#39;t afraid anymore but it&#39;s funny how a big lie can make us all kids again.&quot;   </p>

<p>The story does not stop getting weirder from there. Walter Trump actually calls his device (which is simply a parasol) a “Wall” that will protect everyone from the outside danger.  </p>

<p>As soon as Trump gets a bit of power, he punished people monetarily for there being a single vocal doubter (Hoby). That frightened people into mob violence. Hoby is attacked for providing any resistance.  </p>

<p>When Hoby finally corners Trump, it’s revealed that our snake-oil salesman’s instincts are to buy people off. The idea clearly conveyed is that most people have been content to just sit back and take his payment in exchange for keeping quiet.  </p>

<p>Hoby continued to resist though and recognized that proving one lie was not enough. Everything had to be a lie for people to stop believing Trump.  </p>

<p>There’s not much in the way of analysis required here. There’s not much in the way of practical advice for people looking to resist Trump. Watching and breaking down this artifact was more just about appreciating the absolute bizarre coincidences. Enjoy? </p>

<p>Some more relevant quotes from the episode:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Walter Trump: &quot;A message I ALONE was able to read in the fires of the universe.&quot; (25 secs)  </p>

<p>Donald Trump: &quot;I alone can fix it!&quot; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGenVcak5nI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGenVcak5nI</a>  </p>

<p>Random: &quot;What are you selling Mr, SNAKE oil?&quot; (57 secs)  </p>

<p>Narrator: The people were ready to believe. Like sheep they ran to the slaughterhouse. And waiting for them was the High Priest of Fraud.  </p>

<p>Walter Trump: &quot;I am the only one. Trust me. I can build a wall around your homes that nothing will penetrate.&quot;  </p>

<p>Townperson: &quot;What do we do? How can we save ourselves?&quot;  </p>

<p>Walter Trump: &quot;You ask how do you BUILD THAT WALL.&quot; (9:46)  </p>

<p>Hoby: &quot;You&#39;re a liar Trump.&quot; (11:02)  </p>

<p>Walter Trump then starts pointing to the sky and saying &quot;Look there it is!&quot; Then other people start saying they see things too when they really don&#39;t. They become under Trump&#39;s delusion.  </p>

<p>Hoby: &quot;You&#39;re seeing what you want to see. There&#39;s nothing up there!&quot;  </p>

<p>Then Walter Trump, who the narrator calls the High Priest of Fraud, seems to make fire come down from the sky.  </p>

<p>Revelations 13:13<br/>
And it performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people. 14 Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived the inhabitants of the earth.  </p>

<p>That beast is also known as the False Prophet  </p>

<p>Someone threatens to kill the one guy telling them the truth while Trump takes all their money.  </p>

<p>Judge: &quot;Trump is sure having his way. When the town doesn&#39;t burn down, who&#39;s gonna get the credit?&quot;  </p>

<p>The one part that totally doesn&#39;t jive is they say that Trump doesn&#39;t want the credit, he just wants the money. Donald Trump would definitely want both, probably the credit evermore so.   </p>

<p>Hoby: &quot;You&#39;re under arrest Trump.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;What charge?&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;You write it any way you like. Grand theft, fraud, I think a jury will find it stealing.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;How do you expect to prove it?&quot;  </p>

<p>*Cue Trump trying to bribe him*  </p>

<p>Sheriff is revealed to be in on it with Trump and accuses him of trying to split with the money.  </p>

<p>Walter Trump: &quot;You don&#39;t think I&#39;d lie do you?&quot;  </p>

<p>Sheriff: &quot;You don&#39;t want an answer to that.&quot;  </p>

<p>He then kills Trump because he doesn&#39;t want to get exposed due to Trump&#39;s arrest and Trump flipping on him.  </p>

<p>Hoby then brings the Sheriff in front of the town to tell them the truth.  </p>

<p>Narrator: &quot;They wanted to believe him, but they still weren&#39;t over the hump. He had to find one crack in their fear. Until the crowd knew that everything Trump said was a lie, there was no hope for him. The con man would always get the credit for saving the town. As long as the parasols (The Wall) were up, Trump was still believed.  </p>

<p>One last odd thing, the first name that pops up during the credits at the end, the first name of the director: Donald </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Walter Trump in the TV show also makes reference to technology he has the deflect meteorites from space. With the announcement of the space force from Donald Trump, the prevailing idea is that it will be used to keep asteroids away from Earth.</p>

<p>So with all of this laid out, what are these very specific signs telling us? In my opinion, it&#39;s telling is that Trump is the Antichrist. That doesn&#39;t mean the Bible is 100&amp;#37; true or that things will happen exactly how it says it will happen in the Bible, just that we know the nature of which Trump is and it&#39;s not good.</p>

<p>Referring to Trump as &quot;the little Barron&quot; can only mean one thing in my mind. Trump is the little horn from the Book of Daniel. The last king who is not like the others, speaks boastfully and goes to war with the world. The last king of the last kingdom that is made of iron with clay mixed at the feet because it is divided and it has a mixture of people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 2</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>31</strong> “Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. <strong>32</strong> The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, <strong>33</strong> its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. <strong>34</strong> While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. <strong>35</strong> Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.  </p>

<p><strong>36</strong> “This was the dream, and now we will interpret it to the king. <strong>37</strong> Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory; <strong>38</strong> in your hands he has placed all mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds in the sky. Wherever they live, he has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.  </p>

<p><strong>39</strong> “After you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Next, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth. <strong>40</strong> Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron breaks things to pieces, so it will crush and break all the others. <strong>41</strong> Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay. <strong>42</strong> As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle. <strong>43</strong> And just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.  </p>

<p><strong>44</strong> “In the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. <strong>45</strong> This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that last kingdom sounds a lot like America doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 7</strong>  </p>

<p>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream, and visions passed through his mind as he was lying in bed. He wrotedown the substance of his dream.  </p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Daniel said: “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea. <strong>3</strong> Four great beasts,each different from the others, came up out of the sea.  </p>

<p><strong>4</strong> “The first was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a human being, and the mind of a human was given to it.  </p>

<p><strong>5</strong> “And there before me was a second beast, which looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat your fill of flesh!’  </p>

<p><strong>6</strong> “After that, I looked, and there before me was another beast, one that looked like a leopard. And on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. This beast had four heads, and it was given authority to rule.  </p>

<p><strong>7</strong> “After that, in my vision at night I looked, and there before me was a fourth beast—terrifying and frightening and very powerful. It had large iron teeth; it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. It was different from all the former beasts, and it had ten horns.  </p>

<p><strong>8</strong> “While I was thinking about the horns, there before me was another horn, a little one, which came up among them; and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like the eyes of a human being and a mouth that spoke boastfully.  </p>

<p><strong>11</strong> “Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. </p>

<p>“So he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things: <strong>17</strong> ‘The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth. <strong>18</strong> But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes, for ever and ever.’  </p>

<p><strong>19</strong> “Then I wanted to know the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and most terrifying, with its iron teeth and bronze claws—the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left. <strong>20</strong> I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three of them fell—the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully. <strong>21</strong> As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them, <strong>22</strong> until the Ancient of Days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the holy people of the Most High, and the time came when they possessed the kingdom.  </p>

<p><strong>23</strong> “He gave me this explanation: ‘The fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.<strong>24</strong> The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom. After them another king will arise, different from the earlier ones; he will subdue three kings. <strong>25</strong> He will speak against the Most High and oppress his holy people and try to change the set times and the laws. The holy people will be delivered into his hands for a time, times and half a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The little horn is the last king of the last kingdom. The Last President. Ram horns were turned into trumpets in those days, Trump-Pence. </p>

<p>The Bible even explains why so many people are completely delusional in their support for Trump, especially Christians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>2 Thessalonians 2</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>The Man of Lawlessness</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>2</strong> Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, <strong>2</strong> not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come. <strong>3</strong> Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+2&amp;amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-29665a">a</a>] is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. <strong>4</strong> He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God.  </p>

<p><strong>5</strong> Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? <strong>6</strong> And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. <strong>7</strong> For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. <strong>8</strong> And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. <strong>9</strong> The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie,<strong>10</strong> and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.<strong>11</strong> For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie <strong>12</strong> and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just want to reiterate this specific verse to make the point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, where is all of this going? The Bible says he will try to make us all take a mark so that we cannot buy or sell with out it. It will be a number of a man. Well each of us has our own number assigned to us at birth, our Social Security Number. With the recent Equifax hack, Trump&#39;s White House has concluded that SSN is out of date and we need to figure out new technology. The prevailing idea so far has been using blockchain, the same tech used for Bitcoin.</p>

<p><a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/11/blockchain-technology-social-security-number-cybersecurity-identity-theft/">http://fortune.com/2018/01/11/blockchain-technology-social-security-number-cybersecurity-identity-theft/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-09/want-to-ditch-social-security-numbers-try-blockchain">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-09/want-to-ditch-social-security-numbers-try-blockchain</a></p>

<p><a href="http://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-technology-replace-social-security-numbers/">http://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-technology-replace-social-security-numbers/</a></p>

<p>So the problem they are trying to figure out here is where do they store this information on a person? A card can be easily lost or stolen and a phone can be hacked. Well take a look at what this Israeli company has been doing.</p>

<p>This article is from 2014</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DNAtix has completed the first Proof Of Concept (POC) test by transferring the complete genome sequence of a virus over the Ethereum Blockchain. This test is a key milestone and the company believes that it is the first time that anyone has successfully transferred a DNA sequence over a blockchain. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, they say they are doing this for the purpose of sharing genetic information anonymously and maybe they are. But all technology that starts out for good purposes will get subverted for evil if it can be. Imagine from the time you are born, you are genetically tied to a governmental financial system for life. It&#39;s the enslavement of the entire human population sourced into our very own DNA.</p>

<p>Now how is Trump or anyone going to convince people to do this? Well it&#39;s been pretty obvious the economy we&#39;re in right now is about to burst in the next few years at the most. The global financial collapse will be the catalyst to it but something else will happen to. Trump&#39;s Space Force isn&#39;t just some dumb idea he has. Someone is in his ear, just like with Reagan. 25 scientists mysteriously died working on Reagan&#39;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; program. No, there&#39;s a reason to be building this. Well take a look at this video from 2001 where a woman warns us about building space weapons and what would happen.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eix9mMrPPmE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eix9mMrPPmE</a></p>

<p>So this is all to bring about the fake alien invasion right/ So what happens then and what does this have to do with the mark of the beast? Did you ever wonder what the whole &quot;Drain the Swamp&quot; thing was about? It was to psychologically prepare for the NESARA act, which these supposed benevolent aliens will bring about.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESARA">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESARA</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Harvey Francis Barnard, a Louisiana graduate in systems philosophy, and an engineering consultant and teacher, created the NESARA proposal during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He printed 1000 copies of his proposal, titled Draining the Swamp: Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform (1996), and sent copies to members of Congress, believing it would pass quickly on its merits. Based on a theory that debt is the number one economic factor inhibiting the growth of the economy, and compound interest the number one &quot;moral evil&quot; and reason for debt, Barnard made several other attempts during the 1990s to draw political attention to the problems he saw in the US economy, and his suggested economic recovery proposal based on the root causes he determined. After these did not succeed, he decided in 2000 to release the proposal to the public domain and publish it on the internet. Barnard established the NESARA Institute in 2001, and published the 2nd edition of his book in 2005, retitling it Draining the Swamp: The NESARA Story – Monetary and Fiscal Policy Reform.  </p>

<p>After Goodwin began commenting on NESARA, other internet-based conspiracy theorists latched onto it. One supporter, Sheldan Nidle, ties the imminent NESARA announcement into his years-old prophecy of an imminent large scale UFO visitation by benevolent aliens (occasionally on his website reports, but more prominently in his videos, seminars and public appearances). Jennifer Lee, who used to publish internet NESARA status reports almost daily on her now defunct site, discussed a host of other-worldly and &quot;interdimensional&quot; beings who are helping behind the scenes to get NESARA announced. Internet evangelist Sherry Shriner, who operates many websites, sees NESARA as linked to malevolent reptiloid aliens she feels have long controlled the U.S. Government.</p>

<p>Trump is a malignant narcissist. He is literally a hollow shell that is fueled by narcissistic supply in pursuit of having his grandiose false self reflected back to him. This is why he watches so much tv. Mostly news about himself. The only way he knows he exists is if he sees an image of himself reflected back to him like a mirror. He has to see the image of how he sees himself, his grandiose false self, reflected back to him or he chastises the mirror and tries to smash it. Since that is the case, manipulating him is very easy. Flattery is one way, especially if you are a dictator because that&#39;s who Trump respects. He looks up to them like Father figures. He thinks anyone who isn&#39;t dictator-like, is weak and stupid. Which is why he doesn&#39;t like Canada and Europe and they have become our enemies now while our former enemies have become our allies. All of the elites, the wealthy, the secret societies, the Deep State, they are just pawns that were used to set up all the laws and the globalization of the world. They are also the recognized enemy of the people aware of the NWO plot and they have used their awareness of them against them. Q has people convinced Trump is the great hero taking down the evil deep state. This is just pro wrestling to bring about the next stage of the plan. Hegelian dialectic manipulation of political events. This has all been set up so Trump can take it over in one fell swoop.</p>

<p>Trump has been groomed for this for decades and he was set up to be against Obama. If you look back at his earlier tweets, he actually praises Obama and then someone gave him the information about Obama not being born in America. He first talked about this at a conservative event that he was asked to speak at. After the event, he talked about how amazing the response of the crowd was. The narcissistic supply he got from that, he got addicted to and being the leader of the birthers became his new thing. This set him up to be against Obama and allowed the people who have a pathological hate for Obama (future delusional Trump supporters) to psychologically attach themselves to him long before he ever ran for President. Then they put a pseudo fake Reagan costume on him that checked off every single box of beliefs that a certain type of conservative has (mostly the Fox News watching type). They made him seem like an outsider even though he&#39;s been friends with the Clintons for decades, to even further psychologically attach conservatives to him.</p>

<p>Trump is just a slave to his grandiose false self and he has to obtain narcissistic supply to fuel it. If you know how to manipulate that, you can get him to do whatever you want. His supporters are literally what is fueling him. If they stop cheering him and coming to his events, he would literally change all of his beliefs in order to get that back. Why do you think he constantly talks about the size of his crowds and his ratings? Without that reaction, he has no idea who he is, he doesn&#39;t even exist.</p>

<p>Trump will undoubtedly incite all of his supporters to violence once his Presidency is legitimately threatened from the Mueller investigation or he might do it if the midterms don&#39;t go his way. He&#39;ll claim election rigging or something. What happens next will largely depend on how much the military and police support him but with all the immigrants they are keeping in camps, they are doing that on purpose so there is maximum chaos when the shit hits the fan. An extra 100,000 or so non-white people so the racial aspect ramps up the violence. Cue our power grid and internet being cut off and martial law will be implemented for sure. Whoever emerges the leader after the dust has settled from all of this, they will have complete control of America and it will be willingly given to them by the citizens who are left. If it isn&#39;t Trump, I&#39;m guessing people will be clamoring for Obama to take a 3rd term.</p>

<p>At that point, everything associated with Trump will be demonized. Conservatism and the Republican party might as well be dead, Christianity will probably be hated because of all the nut bags that believed Trump was from God. Everyone will willingly give up their guns because the 2nd amendment was the only reason the Trump supporters were able to cause that much chaos to begin with. Plus, the tide was already shifting due to using the kids from the Parkland shooting as anti-gun spokespeople. Trump and his supporters were really the last road block to instigating a far left agenda. Trump might just be a way to get them all to show their faces and then lead them to their deaths. With them out of the way, there&#39;s nothing left to stop the leftists and the implementation of socialism. In comes hate speech laws, open borders, facial recognition software for all police, more control over the internet due to the &quot;hack&quot; of our power grid and systems, a larger nanny state due to influx of immigrants leading to the global financial collapse.</p>

<p>Just on a side note. A few years back I was doing a job and the customer was an elderly, almost bed ridden man, I got to talking with them and he told me about his books that he goes to opportunity shops to trade in ones meant for sharing. </p>

<p>There is without a doubt a subculture of people who seek these books that are listed with information about the origins of man, secrets from the past and predictions of the future. He showed me his collection of books, About the size of a small library. The books appeared to be mundane and bland looking, Although on the inside , truths Have been woven into fictional based stories and yes they were very political and very acute details, something you would not suspect or generally pick up from the shops. The job was about 40 minutes of work but I stayed to talk with the guy about two hours, I never manage to get back to finish talking to him and I don’t even know if he’s alive but the stuff he’d be telling me was mind blowing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I had a penny for every time over the last 2000 years some Christian has said that these are definitely the end times, and a nickle for every time someone has said &quot;this asshole&quot; is definately &quot;THE ASSHOLE&quot;...</p>

<p>I&#39;m writing a book on Nero (seriously). I have Christians all the time tell me with a straight face that Nero was the Anti-Christ (his name being the numerical equivalent of 666) AND that the Anti-Christ has not come yet, but will at any moment. None say Nero is coming back. The Anti-Christ to come is someone else entirely. They also have no explanation as to how, if Nero was the Anti-Christ, Christianity took off after he died, nor as to why the world didn&#39;t cease to exsist while he was still alive or shortly thereafter or even 2000 years thereafter.</p>

<p>FWIW Nero&#39;s name does not equal 666. The 666 can only be derived by a vowel-less transliteration of a Greek version of a mis-spelled Latin name. And because Nero&#39;s name wasn&#39;t really Nero. It was Lucus. When he died and they denied him burial in the Augustan tomb and interned him into his father&#39;s family&#39;s tomb, he returned to simply being Lucus Domitus Ahenobarbus, as opposed to Nero Claudius Ceasar Augustus Germanicus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the way, I&#39;m not a Christian. I think there is truth to all religions and I think the purpose for that was to divide us and lie to us. I think the 666 is a misdirect maybe. See, what they do is they&#39;ll let you know the truth, but then they attach it to a lie to confuse you and make other people not believe it. If you can point out one lie in every religion then they&#39;re all full of shit right? Well what if you could take the truth from every religion and combine it into one? I boiled down Jesus&#39;s message to &quot;seek truth and love each other&quot;. God is love and love comes from God so that is a given to me. What if by Jesus telling his followers that they would end up being persecuted and dying for him, especially in the end times, he meant they would be dying for love and truth. Truth is the enemy of Trump. Love is what is trying to stop these kids being separated from their parents. These cannot exist for Trump to succeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible itself. And the understanding I got from my use of psychedelics. I can expand further on this but I&#39;ll show you this first.</p>

<p>The Bible constantly says God is love and the New Testament describes love like this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 13</strong>  </p>

<p>&quot;4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 8 Love never fails&quot; </p>

<p><strong>1 John 4</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>18</strong> There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I don&#39;t know how much you know about the Old Testament God, Yahweh, but he is the complete OPPOSITE of this description of love. He is literally a psychopathic narcissist in every sense of the word. He uses all of the same abuse tactics and calls it love, just like a narcissist parent. Just look at the story of Job. Here is a little write up I did about it a few months ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God arrogantly brags about having a very loyal follower so Satan uses his arrogance to goad him into a bet. This only exposes Yahweh for the narcissistic, unloving, psychopath that he is. He takes the most righteous man on Earth and takes everything away from him, kills his family and gives him disease, all just so he can prove to Satan that Job will worship him no matter what. And then in Jobs lowest moment, and in his confusion about how God treats his righteous followers, he dares to question God&#39;s treatment of him. In the most extreme example of narcissistic rage that I&#39;ve ever seen, God then precedes to shame him for 10 pages while telling him how little and insignificant he is compared to God. Basically, &quot;I made you so I can do whatever I want to you, simply because I can and don&#39;t you ever question me&quot;. Its almost like his tirade was in response to feeling some kind of shame for abusing a righteous man simply to win a bet. Then once Job apologizes in shame, God rewards him with everything that he lost and more to solidify his Stockholm syndrome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If everything Jesus and the New Testament says about love is true and God is love, then Yahweh is not God. There is no love in this story for Job from Yahweh. There is only abuse and control tactics to prove a point and bend Job to his will. Job is nothing more than a tool to show God&#39;s righteousness and his power. But in reality, in his own arrogance, he exposes himself for the abusive narcissistic psychopath that he is. Reminds me of those parents that abuse their children in front of people in an effort to prove how powerful they are. They don&#39;t realize how sick and twisted they look to normal people. The fact that anyone can look at this story as some sort of lesson in God&#39;s love is frightening. </p>

<p>I can expand even further on this but this is the single best example in the Bible to show you Yahweh&#39;s psychopathic narcissistic abuse that he calls love.</p>

I think it&#39;s one of the biggest deceptions the evil forces of the world have played on Mankind. &quot;Eye for an eye. Tooth for a tooth&quot;. We all know the dangers of that philosophy and yet this all knowing God told his people to follow it? It was all meant to cause violence and division. That&#39;s what the evil forces do.</p>

<p>If you read the Gospels and strip away the attachments to Judaism, I think it becomes pretty clear that Jesus is talking about a different God than Yahweh. I also think people got the wrong idea about what he came to do also. This is just my own theory as far as I know. But Jesus didn&#39;t come to die for our sins and be resurrected in 3 days (which happens in 2 days according to the timeline set out in the Bible, a huge contradiction). He died for the message he was sent to give us. &quot;God is love and love comes from God. Seek truth and love each other through love of God&quot;. That is the boiled down version of Jesus&#39;s message in my opinion. He also demonstrated these 2 things at the highest level. He told us truth and then, in an act of love, he was killed for giving us this message like so many died after him for essentially giving the same message. Jesus was just the perfect representation of it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything I&#39;ve read specifically but it just seems to be a common theme of God being a consciousness of love, wisdom and creativity. I think we are ALL God. A consciousness separated into human bodies experiencing itself subjectively through each other. I hurt you, I really only hurt myself.</p>

<p>jesus&#39; teachings are almost exactly in line with the Buddha&#39;s.</p>

<p>they have nothing to do with Judaism at all.</p>

<p>but he was born and raised as a jew and so were the people he preached to so he had to wrap his teachings in some kind of judaistic wrapping for people to accept them, so that&#39;s what he did.</p>

<p>if he came out and started preaching some brand new religion that was not Judaism he knew he would have been killed, which he was eventually but he was able to prevent it for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mecca oh duh. Yea I knew that but my brain went to Judaism because the post you replied to was about Yahweh. Never heard of kaaba I don&#39;t think though. I have a kind of theory about the Jews and the Muslims. Since Yahweh was a narcissist, he even has golden children and scapegoat children. Abraham&#39;s two sons Isaac and Ishmael. The Jews and the Arabs. The Jews are obviously his golden children and those usually grow up to be narcissists themselves. The scapegoats usually grow up to have a victim mentality and be very bitter and angry at the world. Even the way Yahweh describes Ishmael says something to the effect of &quot;he will be a wild donkey of a man and his hand will be against the world and the world will be against him&quot;. Seems like there are eternally angry that god rejected them. Sort of like Satan. Which brings me back to Yahweh. Since Yahweh is a narcissist, that means he has extreme Mother issues. Is it any wonder he gets really mad about the Asherah poles? The poles representing trees and nature. Yahweh is from the Canaanite gods, he&#39;s a son of El. Asherah was El&#39;s consort and Yahweh&#39;s mother. In the story of the Garden of Eden, God casts out Adam and Eve and curses all women. Sending man into the Neolithic age, separating us from nature and the Tree of Life. This is said to be a curse. We&#39;ve been at odds with &quot;mother nature&quot; ever since we went from hunter-gatherers to the Neolithic Revolution and we keep separating ourselves from it more and more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m well aware of what people believe. Doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the truth and I can prove it using the Bible itself.  Here is something I wrote up a while a ago for a taste of what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The god of the Old Testament is what keeps a lot of people way from believing in Christianity. I know it was one of my main road blocks. What better way for Satan to deceive people then by pretending to be God? And I&#39;m not saying that the whole Old Testament is the work of Satan, just that there was no differentiation between the two. Satan is hardly even mentioned in the Old Testament and Satan actually means adversary or accuser in Hebrew. The Jews don&#39;t even believe in Satan as his own entity. Jesus even accused the Pharisees of being the children of Satan. Job is the only time of the Old Testament that Satan is mentioned as his own entity but the whole story is kind of out of line with God and Satan supposedly work. Although it is a perfect example of Yahweh&#39;s crazy abuse strategy. God arrogantly brags about having a very loyal follower so Satan uses his arrogance to goad him into a bet. This only exposes Yahweh for the narcissistic, unloving, psychopath that he is. He takes the most righteous man on Earth and takes everything away from him, kills his family and gives him disease, all just so he can prove to Satan that Job will worship him no matter what. And then in Jobs lowest moment, and in his confusion about how God treats his righteous followers, he dares to question God&#39;s treatment of him. In the most extreme example of narcissistic rage that I&#39;ve ever seen, God then precedes to shame him for 10 pages while telling him how little and insignificant he is compared to God. Basically, I made you so I can do whatever I want to you, simply because I can and don&#39;t you ever question me. Its almost like his tirade was in response to feeling some kind of shame for abusing a righteous man simply to win a bet. Then once Job apologizes in shame, God rewards him with everything that he lost and more to solidify his Stockholm syndrome.  </p>

<p>If everything Jesus and the New Testament says about love is true and God is love, then Yahweh is not God. There is no love in this story for Job from Yahweh. There is only abuse and control tactics to prove a point and bend Job to his will. Job is nothing more than a tool to show God&#39;s righteousness and his power. But in reality, in his own arrogance, he exposes himself for the abusive narcissistic psychopath that he is. Reminds me of those parents that abuse their children in front of people in an effort to prove how powerful they are. They don&#39;t realize how sick and twisted they look to normal people. The fact that anyone can look at this story as some sort of lesson in God&#39;s love is frightening. In my view, it&#39;s all apart of the great deception to distort what God and love are. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea that God is love is all over the Bible and the New Testament describes love like this:<br/>
&quot;4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. 8 Love never fails&quot;</p>

<p>Yahweh repeatedly speaks about being jealous, boastful, self-seeking, proud and full of wrath. Yahweh cannot be God if God is love and the New Testament is correct about how it describes love. Something is contradicting itself here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because scholars of both religions agree there is only one God and that said God is being discussed in the Bible. I don&#39;t know where you get this notion that they are multiple gods.</p>

<p>And the Bible isn&#39;t proof of anything in real life, but when discussing the mythology then obviously the Bible is relevant. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Transhumanism</strong> is an international, cultural and intellectual movement with an eventual goal of fundamentally transforming the human condition, by making available technologies that greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities. <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Transhumanism#cite_note-1">[1]</a>Many transhumanists believe in the compatibility between the human mind and computer hardware, with the implication that human consciousness can be transferred to alternative media, known as mind uploading. Since the Science of the <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Soul">Soul</a> and the <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Consciousness">Consciousness</a>functions of the spiritual bodies, have not yet been discovered by scientists, this has potentially extremely destructive consequences to human consciousness and the electromagnetic functions of the Lightbody. Posthumans (the result of applied transhumanist technologies) could be completely synthetic artificial intelligences, or a symbiosis of human and artificial intelligence, or uploaded consciousness, or the result of making profound technological augmentations to a biological human.  </p>

<p><strong>Transhumanism</strong> is a school of thought that seeks to guide us towards a posthuman condition. Essentially, this is about creating artificially intelligent hybrids or cyborgs to replace the organic spiritual consciousness of humans. Some examples are redesigning the human organism using advanced nanotechnology or radical technological enhancements. Some of the proposed biological enhancements are using some combination of technologies such as genetic engineering, psychopharmacology, life extension therapies, neural interfaces, brain mapping, wearable or implanted computers, and entrainment of cognitive techniques. Most of these options are designed to disconnect the human soul from the human body, and prepare the body to be used as a shell for a new host. Effectively, this is integrating technological and pharmaceutical hybridization to damage human <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/DNA">DNA</a>, as preparation for body snatching.  </p>

<p>The fundamental basis of the Transhumanism concept is the A.I. downloaded into the scientific human mind from the <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Negative_Aliens">Negative Aliens</a> and <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Satanic">Satanic</a> Forces, in their quest to survive and achieve immortality by hijacking human consciousness and ultimately possessing the human host body. They do not have flesh and bone bodies and covet ours. Most academics are filled with a variety of mind control and alien implants to be a cog in the wheel to steadily enforce alien control systems. Most early transhumanism concepts were developed by geneticists interested in eugenics and sustaining life forms in synthetic environments. (Like the eugenic experiments similar to those of the Black Sun Nazis). A common feature of promoting transhumanism is the future vision of creating a new intelligent species, into which humanity will evolve and eventually, either supplement it or supersede it. This distraction on the surface is a scheme, while the underlying motivation is intending species extinction of what we know as humans today. Transhumanism stresses the evolutionary perspective, yet it completely ignores the electromagnetic function of human DNA and the consciousness reality of the multidimensional human soul-spirit. They claim to want to stop human suffering but have no idea of the alien machinery and mind control implants used to imprison human consciousness. They know nothing about the afterlife, what happens during the death of the body or even how the human body or Universe really works, yet they want to control every aspect of the human body with artificial technology.  </p>

<p>A primary goal of many transhumanists is to convince the public that embracing radical technology and science is in the human species best interest. With the <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/False_Gods">False God</a> Alien Religions used to spread the rhetoric of fear and mindless obedience on one end, and the primarily atheistic science used to mock all things religious without any comprehension of true spiritual understanding on the other, they have the bases covered. Consciousness and spiritual groups are quickly labeled <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Conspiracy_theorist">Conspiracy theorists</a> by scientists to intimidate, discredit and shut us up. Obviously, until people have personal consciousness experiences outside of their body, have the ability to communicate with assorted lifeforms, such as deceased humans and travel to other dimensions, they have zero information about consciousness and are totally uninformed and ignorant about the nature of reality. None of these transhumanist people, are remotely qualified to be put in charge of scientifically directing the future evolution of the human species. Propping up <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Negative_Ego">egomaniacs</a> and <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Psychopathy">Psychopaths</a>, and giving them power and control over world affairs and influence over public perception is the game of the <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/NAA">NAA</a> Controllers.  </p>

<p>The true knowledge of the Sacred Sciences of the <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Soul">Soul</a> and <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Ascension">mechanics of human multidimensional consciousness</a> have been obliterated from record and conveniently mind controlled out from the majority of sciences. If scientists integrate theories of the soul or consciousness outside of the consensus of the mind control standard, they risk ridicule and losing their funding and careers. Unfortunately, the controlled mainstream sciences do not recognize multiple dimensions of consciousness inherent in the functions of activated human <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/DNA">DNA</a>, or know that biological life and multidimensional human consciousness does not end on this earth. The quest for biological immortality on a prison planet is ludicrous when experiencing the capability of human multidimensional consciousness. After the human body expires, if the undeveloped and disembodied consciousness is merged and assimilated into artificial intelligence, the remnants of that human soul will not have a human body to incarnate into any longer. Hence, that person will lose their connection to organic spiritual biology and cease to be human. <strong>Transhumanism</strong> is a <a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Consciousness_Traps">Consciousness Trap</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you see, it&#39;s all a trick to make you think he is good. Trump is not a good person under ANY person&#39;s definition, especially not a religious or spiritual one. We&#39;re talking about a man who has repeatedly made &quot;jokes&quot; about fucking his own daughter. Him &quot;breaking open the Illuminati&quot; is just pro wrestling. Trump doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s being used for, he&#39;s just a mindless slave to his grandiose false self. These will NOT be benevolent ET&#39;s, they will be pretending to be benevolent. Why would you trust beings much more intelligent than us? What&#39;s in it for them? They&#39;ve been guiding us to this point since the Neolithic Revolution. Separating us from nature and the feminine divine, all under the guise that they are really helping us. Obsessively advancing technology at the cost of true human happiness and the health of the planet itself. Why do you think we are so over prescribed medications and our suicide rates are sky high? The way we live is completely out of tune with our biology and our souls. And some force is separating us from nature and each other, further and further until we&#39;re just a brain plugged into a computer so it can enslave us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wants to help in the sense that it reflects his grandiose false self back to him. He is a slave to it but it is not real, it&#39;s just an image. Which is why he doesn&#39;t care about REALLY helping. He only cares about propping up the image. It could be held up with Elmer&#39;s glue, scotch tape and lies and it wouldn&#39;t matter to him as long as the image holds. The North Korea deal is the perfect example of this, same with the tax bill. Both things look good on the surface (if you only looked on the very top of the surface anyways) but if you dig deeper and look at the long term effects, this is going to come back and bite us all in the ass in ways we can&#39;t see coming. Once Trump&#39;s idealization phase for Kim wears off due to time and the constant reflection of the shitty deal he made looking back at him, he&#39;ll drop a nuke on North Korea due to his humiliation and shame to try and destroy the mirror. Everyone needs to understand that Trump is a malignant narcissist and everything about him will make a lot more sense.</p>

<p>I can prove this is what he&#39;s going to do to North Korea using the most powerful prediction tool of Trump&#39;s future actions in existence, his own Twitter feed. Due to the concept of psychological projection, which all narcissists compulsively do, we can observe Trump&#39;s tweets about Obama during his presidency and ascertain as to how Trump will act under the same circumstances.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I predict that President Obama will at some point attack Iran in order to save face!&quot; 16 Sep 2013  </p>

<p>&quot;President Obama seems so fawning and desperate to make a deal with Iran that lots of bad results can occur. Be cool and be careful!&quot; 9:47 PM - 19 Sep 2013  </p>

<p>&quot;Remember what I previously said--Obama will someday attack Iran in order to show how tough he is&quot; 25 Sep 2013  </p>

<p>&quot;Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!&quot; 10 Nov 2013</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says this FOUR TIMES in the span of about 4 months. He was so sure that Obama would do this because it&#39;s exactly what he would do in his shoes. That&#39;s what projection is all about. Just replace Iran with North Korea and he is in his shoes. We just have to wait for him to realize it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;To be sure, 38 North noted that continued work at the Yongbyon facility should not be seen as having any significant impact to North Korea’s pledge to denuclearize. Instead, the report says the country can be expected to proceed with “business as usual” until specific orders are issued from Pyongyang&quot;</p>

<p>so it appears its operations as normal until further orders come from kim</p>

<p>however their tunnels have been destroyed... so how can nuclear weaponry be made? regardless i am optimistic with kim and trump but we still need to see the whole site shut down. however, a water cooling building and some other buildings really is nothing compared to actual nuclear weapons development...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo just revealed how much time the United States will give North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program: an indefinite amount.</p>

<p>That’s right: According to President Donald Trump’s top foreign policy aide on Monday, North Korea doesn’t have a deadline for giving up its nuclear bombs and missiles — contradicting his administration’s stance from just one day earlier.</p>

<p>“I am not going to put a timeline on it, whether that’s two months, six months, we are committed to moving forward in an expeditious moment to see if we can achieve what both leaders set out to do,” he told CNN.</p>

<p>i find it interesting all the USA propoganda has dissapeared from the US. Which asks more questions. Also, my eyes are open, stop throwing cliche phrases at me...</p>

<p>I am still here talking to you, i could have stopped 4 replies back and easily blocked you but i havent.

    <div class="md"><p>He said a plan would be agreed upon at the Summit for total denuclearization up until he pulled out of the meeting because he was scared he was going to get played. Then, after the meeting was back on, it&#39;s &quot;It might take 5 summits to really get this deal done&quot;. North Korea literally didn&#39;t give up ANYTHING. They already supposedly agreed to denuclearization with South Korea, why this media circus just to sign another piece of paper that says the same thing? Those remains Trump acts like we got, we havn&#39;t gotten them. This man who respects the military so much is using dead soliders as pawns to make himself look good.</p>

<p>Well, yes, Trump’s method for discrediting the news media is quite similar to North Korea’s method of discrediting the United States. How unusually insightful of Trump to recognize the parallels, which would normally discomfit a democratically elected official. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Trump and Kim don&#39;t have a plan. Trump doesn&#39;t plan. He even says so himself. There&#39;s something you need to understand about Trump, he is a malignant narcissist. There is literally nothing inside of him. He is a black hole that is fueled by narcissistic supply. All of this great 5D genius people think he has? It&#39;s literally fly by the seat of his pants impulse and instinct. Since he is ruled by his grandiose false self, he is easily manipulated if you know how. Trump is simply a force, push him in the right direction while making him think it was all his idea and watch the wrecking ball go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry it took me so long to get back to you, and sorry if I&#39;m coming off like an asshole. Childhood issues... </p>

<p>Anyways, theoretically yes. He could be used for something good. But Trump doesn&#39;t follow good. He looks up to dictators. They remind him of his father. He looks up to them and tried to emulate them and gain their acceptance. He sees good as weakness. He admires absolute control, power and authority. That&#39;s why he speaks so highly of Putin, Xi and Kim. It&#39;s also why he has attacked leaders in Europe and Canada. He sees them as weak. Russia and China know this, they know exactly what he is and how to manipulate him. Kim did this perfectly in the summit. That&#39;s why nothing really happened. Look at this article that just came out.</p>

<p><strong>North Korea has increased nuclear production at secret sites, say U.S. officials</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-has-increased-nuclear-production-secret-sites-say-u-n887926">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-has-increased-nuclear-production-secret-sites-say-u-n887926</a></p>

<p>So I&#39;ve been predicting this whole thing since Trump agreed to meet with Kim without even talking to anyone about it first. Not all at once mind you, but as it went along, I managed to fit the pieces together. I am on a local forum and I can prove that I made these predictions with the correlating dates on the posts and I&#39;ll post screenshots if you want. Well I made this prediction to start it all off on March 29th</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call me paranoid but I think Russia, North Korea and China are making some serious moves and Trump is the perfect oblivious buffoon to fall for their trap. They&#39;ll use his arrogance, compulsive need for praise and admiration and his need to be seen as a strong leader against him to blind him to what&#39;s really happening. The fact that Trump thinks Putin is his friend and his aggressive reluctance to put sanctions on Russia and Trump accepting a meeting with Kim without seeking counsel first just shows this tactic at work. And anyone who thinks that North Korea really wants to talk to Trump with full intention of getting rid of their nukes, well I have a bridge to sell you. Putin knows Trump is a fraud and he knows an opportunity when he sees one, especially with how divided we are as a country right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this was met with people making fun of me. Those same people talking about Nobel Prizes as the process went on. Well unfortunately since I was aware of how that whole thing played out, I am also aware of whats going to happen next. Narcissists do this thing with important people in their lives (usually romantic relationships but this seems to apply here apparently), its called Idealization &gt; Devaluation &gt; Discard. You can read more about that here.</p>

<p><a href="https://neuroinstincts.com/neuroscience-behind-idealize-devalue-and-discard-rhonda-freeman/">https://neuroinstincts.com/neuroscience-behind-idealize-devalue-and-discard-rhonda-freeman/</a></p>

<p>So obviously, Trump is in the Idealization phase with Kim to a completely ridiculous degree, claiming they have &quot;good chemistry&quot;. Like wtf? Who says that about another world leader? Especially the most oppressive dictator on the planet. What does that say about Trump if that statement is even true. He has good chemistry with a murderous dictator.... The implications of that went over so many people&#39;s heads. Anyways, once he has to face the reality that Kim is making nukes, thus making him look like a complete fool, Trump will move into the devaluation phase and then discard. He will probably be the angriest he has ever been in his life. This will be an utter and complete humiliation to him (as it should be) and this is a narcissists worst nightmare. Being embarrassed and thought to be made a fool of in front of the world? Even a healthy person would have a hard time with that.</p>

<p>Now, something else needs to be explained about narcissists. They do something called psychological projection. It&#39;s when you attribute all of your negative qualities, actions and feelings about yourself to other people or groups. So the anti-gay politician who secretly sucks dick is an example of this. A guy cheating on his wife might accuse her of cheating. A racist might call black people lazy when really he is the lazy one. All sorts of people do this but narcissists do it almost every time they point their finger at someone. It might as well be pointed back at themselves. You remember The Snake poem Trump would read on the campaign trail and how he would relate it to illegal immigration? He did that because he read it (someone must have shown it to him) and you can tell he connected with it in some way but since he lacks the ability for introspection his &quot;ah ha!&quot; moment was him projecting it onto a perceived enemy group, &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;. &quot;You knew I was a snake before you let me in!&quot; Tell me who that really sounds like.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s next? What does Trump do to &quot;discard&quot; Kim? We only need to look at the most powerful prediction tool of Trump&#39;s future actions in existence, his own Twitter feed. Due to the concept of psychological projection, which all narcissists compulsively do, we can observe Trump&#39;s tweets about Obama during his presidency and ascertain as to how Trump will act under the same circumstances. We can see this will ALL sorts of things (I can send you a list I made if you want but you only have to go on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump">r/TrumpCriticizesTrump</a> to see it in action) he has said negatively about Obama that he end up doing the exact same or worse. Well, look at these tweets in regards to the Iran Deal Obama made to get a glimpse into Trump&#39;s mind for whenever he makes a nuclear deal, especially one that is perceived as a failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I predict that President Obama will at some point attack Iran in order to save face!&quot; 16 Sep 2013<br/>
&quot;President Obama seems so fawning and desperate to make a deal with Iran that lots of bad results can occur. Be cool and be careful!&quot; 9:47 PM - 19 Sep 2013<br/>
&quot;Remember what I previously said--Obama will someday attack Iran in order to show how tough he is&quot; 25 Sep 2013<br/>
&quot;Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!&quot; 10 Nov 2013</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says this FOUR TIMES in the span of about 4 months. He was so sure that Obama would do this because it&#39;s exactly what he would do in his shoes. That&#39;s what projection is all about. Just replace Iran with North Korea and he is in his shoes. We just have to wait for him to realize it.</p>

<p>With them out of the way, there&#39;s nothing left to stop the leftists and the implementation of socialism. In comes hate speech laws, open borders, facial recognition software for all police, more control over the internet due to the &quot;hack&quot; of our power grid and systems, a larger nanny state due to influx of immigrants leading to the global financial collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP, I assure you that socialism is a very broad list of ideologies and also SJW garbage like
fake hate speech laws (censoring free speech rather than actually stopping real hate speech) is nothing to do with real leftism and libertarian socialism (non-authoritarian true socialist ideologies).</p>

<p>China is mostly a state capitalist dictatorship (some may argue &quot;authoritarian socialism&quot; or a mix of the two)
but it is nothing like what libertarian socialists like myself want. Facial recognition, spy state, totalitarianism, controlling the internet,
artificial mass immigration.....this stuff is authoritarian garbage. Democratic socialist George Orwell warned us about totalitarianism of all types. Reasonable people like libertarian socialists don&#39;t like dictatorships. The SJW culture is a modern manufactured thing pushed by
the extreme right corporatist elites.....intended to try to discredit leftist economics (like protecting workers from corporate oppression)
divide and conquer and to try to remove free speech. Real leftists are pro-free speech (as long as no one is saying &quot;hurt/kill group X&quot;).</p>

<p>Interesting post though. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re legit (there are anti-Trump and pro-Trump shills alike just like modern Dem/Repub are both puppet parties) 
But at this point I do not trust Trump or even give him the benefit of the doubt anymore. He&#39;s blown it, multiple times. 
As far as I&#39;m concerned he&#39;s Obama/Bush 2.0. Business as usual.
NEOliberalism/Corporatism:</p>

<p>If we stay away from extreme authoritarianism and corporatism, we should be fine but
that requires getting rid of money from politics (among other steps but money in politics is obstacle number 1). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>By the way everyone. This is just one part of this of many. I still need to write up why Trump supporters are so attached to him and how this deception got to this point, mainly using Christianity as a weapon against itself. The major culmination of this was the combining of the Republicans with Christianity in the 80s with Reagan. Please keep this alive with discussion while I write more and I will continue to respond to EVERYONE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. There is so much more to this though. I&#39;m just awful at organizing my thoughts and deciding on what is more important to focus on then something else. I have the next two weeks off of work starting Saturday so I think I&#39;m going to go into overdrive mode and write some stuff up. Did I share with you my theory that the Neolithic Revolution was the first major step 2 the control of the world and Humanity by the evil forces? Sorry if the text looks weird I&#39;m using speak to text. If you want to research it on your own, just look up all the myths surrounding how each one of those groups got the knowledge and technology for agriculture. And then look up the effects that agriculture on the Earth and on Humanity itself in our need to create governments, male-dominated where women were seen as just property, social divisions, the never-ending thirst for new technology and advancement of it. This technology that is separating us further and further from nature the cosmos and the divine until we are basically just brains plugged into a computer all isolated by ourselves in a box. All while telling us that we&#39;re really actually connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it won&#39;t let me add more to my post and save it so I&#39;ll post the little bit of extra information here. It&#39;s not much but just adds to the overall body of work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 8</strong> 9 Out of one of them came another horn, which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the Beautiful Land. 10 It grew until it reached the host of the heavens, and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them. 11 It set itself up to be as great as the commander of the army of the Lord; it took away the daily sacrifice from the Lord, and his sanctuary was thrown down. 12 Because of rebellion, the Lord’s people and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.    </p>

<p>23 “In the latter part of their reign, when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue, will arise. 24 He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy people. 25 He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and take his stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;<strong>It prospered in everything it did, and truth was thrown to the ground.&quot;</strong>  Definitely sounds like a certain someone in the White House.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 9</strong> I, Daniel, understood from the Scriptures, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting that from the time Israel became a nation again to the time the embassy was moved was 70 years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 11</strong> 36 “The king will do as he pleases. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place. 37 He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all. 38 Instead of them, he will honor a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts. 39 He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a theory among Christian circles that this God of Fortresses are aliens (but are really Satan and his demons) and that there will be a &quot;fake&quot; alien invasion to get people to worship the Antichrist. This does correlate with the Ascension communities and what they say is going to happen although they claim these alien forces will be the good ones, not the evil ones.  </p>

<p>Trump’s New Deal for the Middle East</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-26/mideast-peace-trump-tells-palestinians-to-go-for-greed">https://www.bloomberg.com/view/artic...o-go-for-greed</a><br/>
Trump has been talking about this peace deal in the Middle East for decades. Called it his Ultimate Deal.<br/>
<a href="https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/donald-trump-william-coupon.jpg?quality=85">https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/donald-trump-william-coupon.jpg?quality=85</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>William Coupon, portrait photographer, who shot Trump in New York City for Manhattan,inc. in 1983: “I shot Donald Trump twice. This is my favorite. Trump was offering his services as a ‘peace negotiator’ between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We thought: get the bird, which proceeded to leave droppings behind. Trump was amenable enough, but not at all happy. But ultimately, it was that something in his eyes. His eyes. Not the bird’s.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like Trump&#39;s &quot;Ultimate Deal&quot; might be coming to fruition. Could it be a 7 year deal?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daniel 9</strong> 27 He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’[h] In the middle of the ‘seven’[i] he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple[j] he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Oblique9043.html">Oblique9043</a> 2018-06-25</p>
    <div class="md"><p>So I&#39;m going to write up what I believe is going to happen next with North Korea. . I&#39;ll just start out with the latest news that Kim is not only not denuclearizing, he is increasing production. Obviously, this Summit was a complete joke and a failure.</p>

<p><strong>North Korea has increased nuclear production at secret sites, say U.S. officials</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-has-increased-nuclear-production-secret-sites-say-u-n887926">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-has-increased-nuclear-production-secret-sites-say-u-n887926</a></p>

<p>So I&#39;ve been predicting this whole thing since Trump agreed to meet with Kim without even talking to anyone about it first. Not all at once mind you, but as it went along, I managed to fit the pieces together. I am on a local forum and I can prove that I made these predictions with the correlating dates on the posts and I&#39;ll post screenshots if you want. Well I made this prediction to start it all off on March 29th</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Call me paranoid but I think Russia, North Korea and China are making some serious moves and Trump is the perfect oblivious buffoon to fall for their trap. They&#39;ll use his arrogance, compulsive need for praise and admiration and his need to be seen as a strong leader against him to blind him to what&#39;s really happening. The fact that Trump thinks Putin is his friend and his aggressive reluctance to put sanctions on Russia and Trump accepting a meeting with Kim without seeking counsel first just shows this tactic at work. And anyone who thinks that North Korea really wants to talk to Trump with full intention of getting rid of their nukes, well I have a bridge to sell you. Putin knows Trump is a fraud and he knows an opportunity when he sees one, especially with how divided we are as a country right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course this was met with people mocking me. Those same people talking about Nobel Prizes as the process went on. Well unfortunately since I was aware of how that whole thing played out, I am also aware of whats going to happen next. Narcissists do this thing with important people in their lives (usually romantic relationships but this seems to apply here apparently), its called Idealization &gt; Devaluation &gt; Discard. You can read more about that here.</p>

<p><a href="https://neuroinstincts.com/neuroscience-behind-idealize-devalue-and-discard-rhonda-freeman/">https://neuroinstincts.com/neuroscience-behind-idealize-devalue-and-discard-rhonda-freeman/</a></p>

<p>So obviously, Trump is in the Idealization phase with Kim to a completely ridiculous degree, claiming they have &quot;good chemistry&quot;. Like wtf? Who says that about another world leader? Especially the most oppressive dictator on the planet. What does that say about Trump if that statement is even true. He has good chemistry with a murderous dictator.... The implications of that went over so many people&#39;s heads. Anyways, once he has to face the reality that Kim is making nukes, thus making him look like a complete fool, Trump will move into the devaluation phase and then discard. He will probably be the angriest he has ever been in his life. This will be an utter and complete humiliation to him (as it should be) and this is a narcissists worst nightmare. Being embarrassed and thought to be made a fool of in front of the world? Even a healthy person would have a hard time with that.</p>

<p>Now, something else needs to be explained about narcissists. They do something called psychological projection. It&#39;s when you attribute all of your negative qualities, actions and feelings about yourself to other people or groups. So the anti-gay politician who secretly sucks dick is an example of this. A guy cheating on his wife might accuse her of cheating. A racist might call black people lazy when really he is the lazy one. All sorts of people do this but narcissists do it almost every time they point their finger at someone. It might as well be pointed back at themselves. You remember The Snake poem Trump would read on the campaign trail and how he would relate it to illegal immigration? He did that because he read it (someone must have shown it to him) and you can tell he connected with it in some way but since he lacks the ability for introspection his &quot;ah ha!&quot; moment was him projecting it onto a perceived enemy group, &quot;illegal immigrants&quot;. &quot;You knew I was a snake before you let me in!&quot; Tell me who that really sounds like.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s next? What does Trump do to &quot;discard&quot; Kim? We only need to look at the most powerful prediction tool of Trump&#39;s future actions in existence, his own Twitter feed. Due to the concept of psychological projection, which all narcissists compulsively do, we can observe Trump&#39;s tweets about Obama during his presidency and ascertain as to how Trump will act under the same circumstances. We can see this will ALL sorts of things (I can send you a list I made if you want but you only have to go on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump">r/TrumpCriticizesTrump</a> to see it in action) he has said negatively about Obama that he end up doing the exact same or worse. Well, look at these tweets in regards to the Iran Deal Obama made to get a glimpse into Trump&#39;s mind for whenever he makes a nuclear deal, especially one that is perceived as a failure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I predict that President Obama will at some point attack Iran in order to save face!&quot; 16 Sep 2013  </p>

<p>&quot;President Obama seems so fawning and desperate to make a deal with Iran that lots of bad results can occur. Be cool and be careful!&quot; 9:47 PM - 19 Sep 2013  </p>

<p>&quot;Remember what I previously said--Obama will someday attack Iran in order to show how tough he is&quot; 25 Sep 2013  </p>

<p>&quot;Remember that I predicted a long time ago that President Obama will attack Iran because of his inability to negotiate properly-not skilled!&quot; 10 Nov 2013</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says this FOUR TIMES in the span of about 4 months. He was so sure that Obama would do this because it&#39;s exactly what he would do in his shoes. That&#39;s what projection is all about. Just replace Iran with North Korea and he is in his shoes. We just have to wait for him to realize it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you see, it&#39;s all a trick to make you think he is good. Trump is not a good person under ANY person&#39;s definition, especially not a religious or spiritual one. We&#39;re talking about a man who has repeatedly made &quot;jokes&quot; about fucking his own daughter. Him &quot;breaking open the Illuminati&quot; is just pro wrestling. Trump doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s being used for, he&#39;s just a mindless slave to his grandiose false self. These will NOT be benevolent ET&#39;s, they will be pretending to be benevolent. Why would you trust beings much more intelligent than us? What&#39;s in it for them? They&#39;ve been guiding us to this point since the Neolithic Revolution. Separating us from nature and the feminine divine, all under the guise that they are really helping us. Obsessively advancing technology at the cost of true human happiness and the health of the planet itself. Why do you think we are so over prescribed medications and our suicide rates are sky high? The way we live is completely out of tune with our biology and our souls. And some force is separating us from nature and each other, further and further until we&#39;re just a brain plugged into a computer so it can enslave us all.</p>
