       What is the public debate today? This week? This month?
      </p>
      <p>
       From one issue to another like the last one never happened, our society takes the bite everytime. We are told what to talk about and why its important to engage in a public debate about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the issue is... It always fails to compare with truly important issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do people honestly think that the issue of the day being kids/parents/illegal immigration is of utmost importance over other issues?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's been going on for awhile now is textbook manufacturing of peoples thoughts and reality. TBTB know a large portion of Americans and all people in general are gullible and depend on mainstream media for their daily "what's going on in the world" updates.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're on this subreddit then you've already explored the truth way more than the people who believe in pop culture politics and beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay diligent in knowing that the national and local media nationwide are the true oppressors. Stay virtuous in your continued journey for the truth and knowledge. And always remember Love will prevail through the darkness of deceit and manipulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stayed tuned for tomorrows mainstream  media's BIG story selected by a handful of people behind a curtain.

       I was just thinking earlier aout how much I despise the media and news networks and reality TV and all that other Hollywood garbage. It's all fake nonsense and worst of all it's advanced propaganda. It's divide and conquer. It's almost always composed of deception and lies, and fabricated controversy.

       Catch and elease only bennefitts detension center owners. Waste of time and money to even capture illegals if all we are going to do is release them. The ultimat answer has several parts but it primarily includes building a 30 foot wall on the border. This, combined with severe financial penalties levied  against employers of illegal aliens is a must for any border control. I mean literally shutting down businesses that have been caught 3 times hiring illegal aliens. The physical deterrant of a wall limits points of crossing as well as helps with a consistant roadway for border control vehicles. Herd the illegals into choke points being the only crossings. These two actions alone would reduce the illegal alien desire to come here to begin with a tenfold. Next would be strwight out death penalties for all coyotes and large scale dealers caught. Yes, we have to.step down a few moralities to get their attention.

       The inept Admin is at least trying to enforce the law and have been asking congress to draft a new immigration law since day 1. 
The left will never vote for immigration reform unless its open borders for free roamers. 
The whole thing is dumb. The inept previous admin and ones before are the reason for all of this. 
So is the media and Elite.. The whole thing is a insult to our nations intelligence and rather a play on our emotions.

       And remember, the stories here are often just the same type of bait, and the same for stories on the 'alt-media'. Don't believe something just because the mainstream media pushes it and don't not believe it because it's in the mainstream. Same for replacing mainstream with 'alt' media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes people forget to think critically and evaluate the facts. It seems that which 'side' a story supports is the main factor in whether to believe something, on all sides.

       Exploited stories/people. Saturation coverage. Commentary and opinion becoming stories themselves. Along with what someone did not say ie their opinion. Lack of virtue signaling considered a no no.

       I do think ripping families apart at the border for months or more is wrong. But I was saying that when it started not when democrats told me to be upset about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we are arguing over who pisses in what bathroom (something no one ever noticed or cared about until we were told to) we are ignoring the bigger economic issues that people on the right and left could unite over.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we cant unite on any issues because people are so blindly partisan they dlnt think for themselves and they dont understand compromise and dont listen to ideas from the other side.

       We are on a downward spiral in many ways.  Nothing will "prevail".  I haven't seen love stopping any of these wars we keep starting, I am not seeing love when countries are toppled, dictators installed, war for almost 20 years with virtually no one in the media even questioning it.  They are keeping people busy with manufactured outrage, but also wishful thinking.

       Why are some people so ready to dismiss this whole thing? Do you not care about the global elite pedo conspiracy? You are talking about this issue as if people are arguing about who won American idol. This is a pretty big deal.
