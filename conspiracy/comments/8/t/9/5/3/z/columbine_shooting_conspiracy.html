       So I have a question about the columbine shooting. Nowadays you hear about a shooting or bombing and there is always some kind of conspiracy that pops up surrounding it, were or are there any similar events surrounding columbine? I never heard of any and am interested if you guys have. Thanks!

       Yeah I know the backstory but thought someone had to come up with a conspiracy by now, but yeah I think the story is the legit one and no conspiracies involved but was still curious

       That's not true. Dave Cullen wrote a good book about how, despite the press story at the time, the boys were not bullied. According to interviews with students, they were more likely to bully others than be the victim of it.

       His book "Columbine" dispels a lot of mistruths and media myths. If you're into the topic, it's a good read.

       There was so much evidence available to the public. Videos of them shooting targets, just chilling, their diaries and other online shit, CCTV footage of them literally throwing pipe bombs in the cantene, helicopter footage of 100s of kids running and climbing out of Windows and so much blood,  everywhere.
      </p>

       If they faked that shit in the 90's they really went to town and they just cannot be arsed to put that effort in today.

       There seem to be images of blood when I search “Columbine blood.” Sometimes you get bogus results with things like that or it’s a photo of some other bloody mess and because someone mentioned Columbine in a comment or description it shows up under that search.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it seems like there was a “blood-like substance” present. I think there’s something fishy about Columbine but haven’t seen anything convincing or detailed one way or the other.

       I will say there USED to be a lot more footage that was easy to find. One of the most standout parts of the Columbine shooting was that there were dead kids broadcast live on the news. It was the first time that blood was clearly visible in a crime scene of the sort. It's quite interesting to look through this

       And again, as I searched for that video on YouTube for the first time in a long time, I just saw that while there used to be many forms of it this was the only one I could find now and it was partially buried under a lot of other search results when I searched “Columbine dummy.” It’s being subjected to the same censorship that videos exposing staged terror events are subject to now.

       I said posts, not comments. You have zero (0) conspiracy posts. I didn't say "comment" did I? It's not the same, at all, despite your attempt to deflect this you're not an active member here and it's unclear which, if any, conspiracy theories you subscribe to.

       I don't have to prove it's a dummy. That's what it looks like. That's what it's being treated like. That's what it most likely is.

       Okay, fine. I don’t have to post shit to contribute to a subreddit. You can be an active member without posting shit. What conspiracy theories do I subscribe to? The government’s role in 9/11, JFK assassination, and UFO coverups.

       You know. Actual theories. Not ones about fake mass shootings because you have a hard on for protecting the second amendment.

       So you think that 20 children got shot at Sandy Hook, for example? That man landed on the moon, 19 Arab Muslims flew planes into buildings, and there's little green space aliens sitting in a government tank somewhere. And you are qualified to designate which are "actual theories."

       Doesn't seem weird to me. Those dummies aren't a weird thing to have around an ambulance or fire truck. They had it thrown out on the ground, kids ran by, then they drug it off to the side. If they were trying to act like it was a victim you'd think they would have at least acted like they were treating her and not just left her there, nonchalantly walking off. The only person who suggests or even acts like it's not a dummy is the dumbass newscaster who suggests it's a victim even as they just kind of leave it on the ground and walk off.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I remember hearing about a 3rd kid being involved. He was either a dropout or had already graduated and several students reported seeing him at school that day. Iirc a few even said they had seen him shooting them.

       Scroll back through my comments. Just looking through my last 30 or so like 25 have been on here. So I don't create new topics here. Is that a requirement to join the discussion now? Or is possible someone just disagrees with you on something and rather than consider it might just be a dumbass reporter you instantly just have to go with,"nope, I'm right, must be a shill."

        Here's a video with context. The shooters spent around 50 minutes from the initial gunfire until they killed themselves, including shooting out at police in the parking lot, so this was still an active scene at the time. At 12:51 in this video, we can see the fire truck being pulled up to be used as a bullet shield. Richard explains what was happening, as he was mostly conscious during the events.

        Richard played dead till law enforcement came to pull him off the grass roughly 20 minutes later. He was hit eight times in his left arm, right arm, chest, back, and abdomen. His lungs, kidney, and spleen were damaged and one of his vertebrae was fractured between the shoulders, leaving him Richard Castaldo in Bowling for Columbine, along with Michael Moore, Mark Taylor, and Brooks Brownparalyzed from the chest down. He was moved from the Swedish Medical Center June 1, 1999 to Craig Hospital for spinal cord rehabilitation.

       No. Also the photos of Kliebold and Harris are rather graphic. Everything else looks like nothing that could be easily and cheaply staged. The problem with that video is the obvious question of why they wouldn’t simply walk up the stairs and get that guy rather than having him clumsily flop out of a window and risk breaking his neck.

       The two fake shooters were high achieving students that were very heavily involved in their schools film program.  Both were weeks away from graduating high school.  When you see them wearing leather jackets acting like weirdos, its bc they were acting for a film they were working on
 The film was their senior project.  Their senior project was the fake shooting.  They were not trench coat mafia.  The were Jewish film students. They aren't dead, they are living in Israel. The video you see from inside the cafeteria is a MOVIE. Watch closely and you'll notice that the cafeteria students are staged. They are acting. Nobody died. The suicide picture is impossible.  One of the fake shooters is laying on top of the other fake shooter but the fake suicide blood doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, police dragged a dummy across the lawn in front of the police helicopter for maximum effect. Look up columbine dummy.  It was not a body of a victim or a shooter. The way the police were handling the fake body would have been considered mutilation of a corpse, or something similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The school shootings are fake just like Muslim terrorism is fake.  At first it is somewhat refreshing realizing that you won't get shot at school or blown up at a sporting event. Then you realize that America actually does have a terrorism problem. All made possible by the deep state and its Jewish media

       I don't recall a specific video. If you research the fake shooters it becomes clear they weren't burn out losers. They were popular smart students.  They had no motive to end their own lives weeks before graduation.  Why would they work as hard as they did at school just to kill themselves right before graduation

       There's not really any conspiracy theories about Columbine, because there's so much evidence proving that it happened. Basement tapes, Autopsy reports, video evidence of the shooters in the school, etc.

       A user named /donttreadonme16 made this post
      </p>
      <p>
       "Holy hell, so after just a few minutes of looking more into the Lobotomized by Drugs story. Aparently it's a theory involving the Columbine shooters, and how they were raped by the police months before the shooting, and they tried desperately to cover it up? And then some guy named Mark Taylor tried to blow the whistle about it, and was arrested on BS charges and institutionalized. Even the county Sheriff was arrested and convicted for a sex-for-meth sting operation??? WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a metabunk article about it that I'm just diving into now, with something about hand drawings that match google maps pictures, idk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whole new rabbit hole to me, and I've only just started looking deeper into it. Just thought I'd share with everyone else, see if other people have some sources or more information about this conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure would love to see that Youtube video documentary they talk about...
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Favorite line from the article about the county Sheriff:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Sullivan had a storied law enforcement career and was named Sheriff of the Year by the National Sheriffs’ Association in 2001.

In 1989, the sheriff drove a Jeep through the fence of an Arapahoe County home to rescue two deputies and a wounded 17-year-old boy who had been taken hostage by a rape and murder suspect armed with a machine gun.

Sullivan was a nationally expert on cyberterrorism and other law enforcement issues. He participated in a statewide meth task force in 2000.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       ...seriously? Rather than call stories like these into question, you bring them up as an excuse to praise this psychopath for his past "work" in "law enforcement"? The guy who smoked meth was put in charge of a meth task force, and was accused of raping young teenage boys also helped "rescue" 17 year old rape hostages? Are you shitting me?!"
