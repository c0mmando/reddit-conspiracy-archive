        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a centuries-long battle waged against individual spirituality and moral absolutism that only favors the powerful. Especially in developed nations there is a huge drop in church attendance and corresponding increase in atheism. This is a result of a systematic campaign waged by secular elites on many fronts (from wealthy oligarch families like the Rockefeller’s and ideologies like Marxism) to legitimize their morally bankrupt profit making schemes. The most important concept that every peasant (you and me) needs to know is that moral relativism ultimately favors the plutocrats because of Nietzsche’s phrase “will to power” where the most powerful rule because they have the strength to enforce it and morality should have nothing to do with rationalizing their actions. The only tool the “weak” in a society has to counter the social Darwinism ideology of the elite is morality. I fear the oligarchs have hijacked the progressive Civil rights PC culture and socialism that is very popular today in our youth and in effect get them to “rebel” against Christian values. </p>

<p>A familiar argument from atheists is that religions have caused many wars/deaths/suffering and therefore should be avoided. I agree that religion if it is used as system of control and a justification to harm ppl then it must be avoided. However this argument does not apply to Jesus Christ or his teachings and only applies to demagogues who used Christianity’s name/authority to gather support to harm other people. This also ignores the many atheistic ideologies like communism in the 20th century that carried out countless murders. My point is that many ignorant people attack the Bible without any context or historical knowledge. Just because someone calls themselves a Christian doesn’t mean they act in accordance with Christ’s teachings. </p>

<p>A modern political attack on the moral significance of Jesus Christ is Zionism. Zionists quote a single line in Genesis about how Israel is blessed by God to fund their colonial/imperialist agenda. They completely ignore the New Testament where Jesus is killed by a conniving Jewish elite to silence his moral code. Christian Zionists are embarrassingly ignorant of Jesus Christ’s doctrine and work to undermine it. </p>

<p>Some Solutions:
Individuals should study the Bible and Jesus Christ’s moral code that is still relevant to this day. 
Create a personal connection and interpretation of God based on classical teachings. 
Go to a local church or participate in other communities with similar values. 
Be aware of any other schemes the plutocrats come up with to scam/trick the poor. </p>

<p>This is obviously a complex topic that reaches many different areas and cannot be expressed in a single post. And it’s sure to offend the many atheists who hate Christianity and this post will be labeled as a “right wing takeover of this sub”. My response to them is to fully comprehend the historical significance of the New Testament, Jesus Christ and to spread the Gospel. People have to believe in something. Christianity &gt; Nihilism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean CURRENTLY SPEAKING, Religion (you&#39;ll notice in my original comment while I did say &quot;fuck Christianity&quot; I did specifically say RELIGION is the worst thing humans ever invented) does have a higher &quot;body-count&quot; than &quot;Love Island&quot; so for RIGHT NOW Religion is the worst thing humans have ever invented </p>

<p>HOWEVER, who knows? maybe one day Love Island grows to have an equally impressive body count next to its name!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha yeah dude I got the Idea.</p>

<p>The interesting distinction between Religion and Love Island</p>

<p>Religion - Created to control stupid people </p>

<p>Love Island - Created to Promote and entertain stupid people</p>

<p>So while most would thing they have nothing in common they do have that little link!</p>

<p>Or the Inquisition.. group of institutions within the judicial system of the Catholic Church whose aim was to combat heresy who executed an estimated 3000-5000 people... that promoted &quot;doing good&quot; </p>

<p>Are you telling me that when a Christian Aid worker in Africa (where aids and HIV is EVERYWHERE) tells those people &quot;you can&#39;t use a condom because god said so&quot; and thus helps SPREAD AIDS and HIV that promotes &quot;doing good&quot;</p>

<p>If I sanctioned it, If i condoned it then yeah It would be my fault and we would both be liable. The Crusades and Inquisitions were sanctioned and condoned and were done with the full backing of the Church. </p>

<p>Does this answer your question?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I recommend reading the 6th commandment: thou shall not kill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice, 10 commandments, Thank you for bringing up The Old Testament.. and my reply to that..</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 21:18-21 King James Version (KJV)</p>

<p>18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:</p>

<p>19 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;</p>

<p>20 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.</p>

<p>21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 21:18-21 English Standard Version (ESV)</p>

<p>A Rebellious Son</p>

<p>18 “If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and, though they discipline him, will not listen to them, 19 then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gate of the place where he lives, 20 and they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ 21 Then all the men of the city shall stone him to death with stones. So you shall purge the evil from your midst, and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</p>

<p>Leviticus 20:9 English Standard Version (ESV)</p>

<p>For anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood is upon him.</p>

<p>So while the 6th commandment says you shouldn&#39;t kill, the Bible tells you that you can get the elders of your town to kill your child if they are being unruly. Bit of a contradiction don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>History is written by the victor. If Hitler would have won, his side of the story would be touted as the &quot;good&quot; side. True? </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying that Hitler was good (my personal opinion is that he is pure filth) I&#39;m just saying from HIS side, he (and all those who followed them) believed they were doing &quot;good&quot; </p>

<p>So Good and Evil are just a point of view. </p>

<p>Morality is rooted in the golden rule for all human civilization - treat others as you want to be treated.  Combine the golden rule with a bit of common sense and you get both ancient and modern moral values.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well some branches of Buddhism believe that women are impure and monks are defiled by even sitting next to them on a bus, they also believe that if you are born poor it’s because of what you did in your past life, so in the country I lived in there was not exactly a rush of monks helping the poor and sick.
Looking at Islam, a religious leader in my current country described women not wearing the veil as uncovered meat around stray dogs, and apparently some Islamic institutions still teach the religious requirements of slave ownership.
We also know there are religions that slaughter albino children to use their body parts in Africa, and religions in India where women have to live in huts away from the village either during their period or after giving birth because they are unclean.
So this morality of treating everyone equally with respect and love is most likely a Christian thing and categorically not universal. Whether Christian cultures live up to this morality is another thing, but we at least use the principle as a yardstick </p>

<p>Matthew 22:37-9
Jesus replied: &quot;&#39;Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.&#39; This is the first and greatest commandment 
And the second is like it: &#39;Love your neighbor as yourself.&#39;</p>

<p>While atheists like yourself might live a &quot;good&quot; lifestyle it&#39;s clear you don&#39;t love God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But why would you? The concept of God and Heaven is very logical and productive. The Christian idea of God loving all of humanity and especially loving those who follow his moral code and bringing heaven closer to Earth was an unparalleled contribution of Greek rationality and influence on the New Testament. 
I guess it all boils down to what does God mean to you? To me it means a perfect and wonderful representation of an ideal man personified as Jesus Christ and an all seeing-planning-powerful force </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain your POV please. In my POV the concept of heaven is logical because God as an all seeing force would reward people for doing good deeds and punish bad ppl in the next life. On this mortal plane good ppl can suffer injustices and bad ppl can live very fruitful lives. But an all powerful Judge will decide on every persons life at the end if they acted according to his moral teachings. Morality has everything to do with the concept of heaven and hell. Did you help ppl or harm them overall as a result of your life. Seems very logical to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll agree with that somewhat. </p>

<p>I believe &#39;god&#39; as a concept was used to explain personal responsibility to people with a lesser understanding of it. </p>

<p>You could call that a supplantation, or if feeling generous you could call it teaching. </p>

<p>If however you look at the more knowledgeable people of the time, they were mostly not worshiping a singular deity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that a polytheistic approach is correct either but it does point out that the monotheistic idea was not the forerunner of belief systems and therefore, the possibility of truth contained within is long eroded. </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s where i may confuse you a touch (given my obvious dislike of &#39;god&#39;)...  I believe there is a power at work in the world. I believe in energy. I work in my career with frequency waves and I understand energy and I understand how it can influence. </p>

<p>We create energy and project them out to the world and we receive it in return (hopefully with a measure of equality) , which brings me neatly back to what I aid earlier -  &#39;You are god&#39;.</p>

<p>I have 1 singular &#39;commandant&#39; in my life. Treat people the way they deserve to be treated. That excludes reasons based on race, religion, social standing, class etc. If you&#39;re a rich person that tries to do good, then you have my support. If you&#39;re a poor person that tries to do good, then you also have my support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who&#39;s throwing away the biggest conspiracy planet Earth has ever known? </p>

<p>A 54- Supreme Court recently permitted the Ten Commandments to stand on the governor&#39;s mansion land.</p>

<p>A 5-4 Supreme Court recently gave rights to property owners and employers to use religion to keep women from getting so-called &quot;reproductive services&quot; in their health plan. </p>

<p>And most recently, a 7-2 Supreme Court let a baker refuse to serve gay people based upon his religion.</p>

<p>The original conspiracy is alive and well, and even expanding these days. It is funny to see a post in r/conspiracy to try to claim that the conspiracy of book religion is really a conspiracy against it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. I disagree, but that&#39;s a civil reply. </p>

<p>I can understand why people get disillusioned with religion because people are flawed and powerful assholes who like to control other people can be drawn to it. </p>

<p>But there is also a spiritual element to it, the next world. If you don&#39;t think that exists, I promise you that it does and would suggest you pray and ask with sincere devotion that it connects with you. </p>

<p>Best wishes and best of luck. </p>

<p>My point is that many ignorant people attack the Bible without any context or historical knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ll see posts and comments asking &quot;why are people so religious here?&quot; and &quot;Why would you care about the bible?&quot; Why attack diversity in this community? As if the bible and religion aren&#39;t an important part of examining this grand conspiracy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>demagogues who used Christianity’s name/authority to gather support to harm other people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps this skews peoples concept of religion. Instead of having a personal relationship with spirituality, people have an institutional relationship with authority,.</p>

<p>Just because someone calls themselves a Christian doesn’t mean they act in accordance with Christ’s teachings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow. This is... something else. Christianity, just like every other Abrahamic religion, is nothing but a control and unification method, in its case set in place by Constantine in 313AD, ripping off its symbolism from pagan, canaanite, babilonian and sumerian civilizations. </p>

<p>It is very likely that Jesus, and all the other messianic figures that precede him by centuries, yet have the exact same tale (born of a virgin, travelled with 12 companions performing deeds of good, died for our sins, resurected after three days), wasn&#39;t even an actual person but nothing more than an allegory to the Sun and its movements through the 12 houses of the zodiac. This is conspiracy 101 friend.</p>

<p>If you want to know why we are so spiritually disconnected and on a constant search for meaning its because we have been lied to on a cosmic fucking level. Our spirituality was hijacked ever since they had us pray to false, empty idols. </p>

<p>You are worshipping symbols, words and ideas whose real meaning and message has been usurped and corrupted. Learning the origin of things is the first step to reconnecting with our ancestral past, our Golden Age so to speak.</p>

<p>You also don&#39;t understand why Christian Zionists are the way they are.  They aren&#39;t that way because of a passage in Genesis.  They&#39;re much more concerned with Revelations, my man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should look up star seeds. I believe the star seed conspiracy is very similar to what you are saying. I grew up atheist and in high school studied wicca, gave it up and recently took it up again. I like it because it reminds me of what TRUE christianity was supposed to be, not what humans are told it is. I feel like science has taken a tole on religion and if more people realized science needs religion (vice versa) then we would all be on a better path to consciousness </p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha yeah dude I got the Idea.</p>

<p>The interesting distinction between Religion and Love Island</p>

<p>Religion - Created to control stupid people </p>

<p>Love Island - Created to Promote and entertain stupid people</p>

<p>So while most would thing they have nothing in common they do have that little link!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;ll agree with that somewhat. </p>

<p>I believe &#39;god&#39; as a concept was used to explain personal responsibility to people with a lesser understanding of it. </p>

<p>You could call that a supplantation, or if feeling generous you could call it teaching. </p>

<p>If however you look at the more knowledgeable people of the time, they were mostly not worshiping a singular deity.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that a polytheistic approach is correct either but it does point out that the monotheistic idea was not the forerunner of belief systems and therefore, the possibility of truth contained within is long eroded. </p>

<p>Now here&#39;s where i may confuse you a touch (given my obvious dislike of &#39;god&#39;)...  I believe there is a power at work in the world. I believe in energy. I work in my career with frequency waves and I understand energy and I understand how it can influence. </p>

<p>We create energy and project them out to the world and we receive it in return (hopefully with a measure of equality) , which brings me neatly back to what I aid earlier -  &#39;You are god&#39;.</p>
