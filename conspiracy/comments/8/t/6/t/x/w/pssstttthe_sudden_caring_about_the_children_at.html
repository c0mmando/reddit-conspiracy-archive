        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Remember how the IG report was recently released. It was 500+ pages. Within it, mentioned that there were crimes committed against children that were discovered on weiners laptop. </p>

<p>The Democrats know that the IG have found all those missing emails with crimes against kids. Guess where the kids were coming from? Yup, the Mexican border. So, while it looks as if the Media is trying to change the attention from the IG report was the cause of the sudden outrage. No. It&#39;s because they want to distance themselves from all the trafficking that was happening on the border.  So they scream &quot;FOUL!&quot; To lead people to think they really care about the kids. NO. They want to distance themselves from all the crimes that they are so aware of that is happening there.</p>

<p>That justice might be right around the corner for the corrupt!! Let&#39;s see. </p>

<p>Take a moment to read the Flores settlement, which they will be in violation of due to the changes made by executive action. </p>

<p>If the migrant claims asylum, then they are following the law and taking them through the vetting process to see if they qualify for it. This takes time, and there are a lot of people to go through the process with.</p>

<p>If the migrant is detained and does not declare asylum they are not held, and sent back across the border the crossed illegally with no separation.</p>

<p>Get mad at 8 years of the admin branch not doing it&#39;s job, which has set some improper standards to the nation, or at the legislative branch playing games with these people&#39;s lives to score points on Trump instead of doing their fucking job and fixing the law.

<ol>
<li>Not a policy to separate children and families</li>
<li>Separated children from people who are <em>not</em> their families, i.e. traffickers.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason it made news, is because it was used as a political ploy.</p>

<p>The immigrant children being detained, last year or even, two months ago, were UNACCOMPANIED minors entering on there own.</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do but detain them, Obama was doing this and the practice was continued by Trump.</p>

<p>Sessions changed to a zero tolerance policy detaining even the ones entering with their parents, and those claiming asylum.</p>

<p>This change caused a dramatic spike in how many children were being detained.</p>

<p>They changed to policy for a few reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A deterrant for those who are trying to come across the border.  If you know you&#39;re going to lose your kids, then you may not cross.</p></li>
<li><p>To force the parties to the table to pass immigration reform.   Trump wants his wall, and he wants taxpayer $$$ to pay for his wall.  This is a hard NO from the Dems.</p></li>

And the recent uproar about this is not about immigrant children being put into concentration camps. It is the new practice of separating children from their parents in ways that could likely mean they never see each other again. This part of it is what has gotten everyones panties in a bunch. Its not law and it hasnt always been happening the way its happening. Thats part of the reason people are making such a big deal about it, but also because it was Trumps admin that decided to start this, as if he needed another thing for people to hate him for. </p>

<p>In all accounts, where is the outrage at irresponsible parents taking or sending their kid to committ an illegal crime? They weighed out the situation and deemed life in US illegally and possible detention is the viable alternative for them..</p>

<p>In any account, these children are being housed, clothed, and feed. Not forced to break rocks or construct weapons of war. They are not detained imdefinitely. They have committed a crime in illegally immigrating, not being prosecuted over race or religion.</p>

<p>We are a nation founded on the rule of law. The administrative branch is intended to ensure that the law is enforced. We had 8 years of the branch not doing it&#39;s job, and now it is. The legislative branch holds the duty of making and changing the law, and could fix this. The judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the law, and has yet to call this out as extra-legal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy is just shilling for Q anon&#39;s bullshit theories. This whole thing is just meant to cause more division. The Democrats are using these children just as much as Trump is. They&#39;re using these kids to try to oust Trump. You can tell because they seem to not give a shit about all the abuses that are reported under the Obama Administration. Just look at the articles in the politics section. A lot of those articles are talking about abuses during the Obama Administration, and they only talk about Trump in the comment section. And anytime you bring this up, you get downvoted into hell. I&#39;m totally against this policy of holding the children, Trump is only using them for leverage to get his stupid fucking wall. He lied over and over again about how it was the law and he couldn&#39;t do anything about it and had his dipshit supporters saying the same thing. And then all of a sudden, he signed a piece of paper and it disappears. And yet his supporters arent mad at him or upset that they look like morons for repeating his bullshit and defending him. They&#39;ll just go on and repeat the next lie tomorrow. God damn I hate this allegiance to political parties and presidents. The truth has my only Allegiance. Fuck political parties and fuck presidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you are saying is don&#39;t think logically and question why we are hearing this news? What if the people writing this are using children to manipulate you emotionally to create a sense of outrage and division? Your sense of moral superiority for being outraged is all find and dandy, but the people telling you this information are using you. You are thinking exactly what they want you to think. </p>

<p>Are you really thinking for yourself? Or are you being herded?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really bothers me that people want to liken this to a concentration camp.</p>

<p>In all accounts, where is the outrage at irresponsible parents taking or sending their kid to committ an illegal crime? They weighed out the situation and deemed life in US illegally and possible detention is the viable alternative for them..</p>

<p>In any account, these children are being housed, clothed, and feed. Not forced to break rocks or construct weapons of war. They are not detained imdefinitely. They have committed a crime in illegally immigrating, not being prosecuted over race or religion.</p>

<p>In other words, fuck you, if you think this is remotely similar to some Nazi concentration camp, because thats the implication you are spreading.</p>

<p>How many of these children were shot or gassed?</p>
