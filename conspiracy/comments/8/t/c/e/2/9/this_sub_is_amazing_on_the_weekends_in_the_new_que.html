       idk what I am. I dont if I can define myself by a label. I believe 100% in Enlightenment and Union with God traditions, as well as NDE's/OBE's and I've had 1 NDE and over 30 OBE's (all spontaneous) and have seen shit that would make people shit themselves in the spirit realm

       demons, hells, purgatory, heavens, angels, false beings getting worshipped by recently deceased souls, traps, tricks, prisons, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do lean towards the god of the jews/muslims being a fake false being, or possibly an alien-esque type being that told the jews and muslims a false dualistic dichotomy desgined to sow discord

        Central elements in the western traditions are Neo-Platonism, which had a strong influence on Christian contemplation c.q. mysticism, and it's accompanying apophatic theology; and Western esotericism, which also incorporated Neo-Platonism and Gnostic elements including Hermeticism. Western traditions are, among others, the idea of a Perennial Philosophy, Swedenborgianism, Unitarianism, Orientalism, Transcendentalism, Theosophy, and New Age.[213]

       Out of body experiences are an illusion. Everyone has had them at some point and I've had a ton of them. It's like being in a living dream and you can see or do anything your imagination wants. Maybe you wanted to see demons and hell. Usually when I had of body experiences I just like to float around and have fun with it and in all honesty have some x rated fun. Probably mostly the latter lol. Fun times.

       what do you call in when the body is dead and you are out of it and existing in the spirit realm as pure consciousness? Is that also  being in a living and vivid dream state while awake if the body is dead?

       That's called being dead. People who have died and came back and claim to have experienced a super natural experience probably have much for going on in their mind that it's easier to just say it's a super natural than anything else.

       Hell is basically a place where deceivers exploit us for emotional energy after tricking us into consenting to it. They use truth, our failures and sins, to sell a plausible consequences, torment in a hell, and/or a poor life situation when we return. Depending on how well their programming from religions worked on us, they can succeed and get loosh, like a thief getting money. Then, after we express our dysfunctions in sinful ways, they can repeat the process. They farm us alive and dead. They feed on mind by taxing it with negative emotions. They are the evolved product of some of the people we meet, who enjoy schadenfreude more than the joy in others.

       Too many political posts.. kinda separates the shills from the researchers.

       R/conspiracy really does need to sticky the definition of what a shill is. Might as well change the definition while we're at it. People here incorrectly use the term so often that it's beginning to become a blanket term to mean anything they want it to.

       This really is a great sub. I have been meaning to post a r/con appreciation thread. You learn so much from so many different perspectives especially in the comments. People are actually very well informed here and back up their opinions with thoughtful analysis. Groupthink and bandwagoning are minimal here. People here are quite respectful to eachother. You dont see a lot of trolling or vindictive shit like other subs. Partisanship gets called out and you get a lot of different perspectives from all sides of the spectrum. The sub is honestly much much better than I expected. I though it would be a lot of paranoid crazy jaded angry people, but its not that at all. People claim its racist and right wing, but I have seen more overtly racist shit in the comments on TIL than I have here. I have found this sub to be unexpectedly great and it has quickly become my personal favorite on reddit.  I hope it stays this way.

       Why not just have a second shift that only works weekends. Hell, they could get away with keeping everyone part time, just hire more people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn’t this all a given? Anyone who’s worked has surely encountered this situation before. They don’t pay overtime, they don’t offer benefits, and they keep everyone at part time.

       These people are running paid propaganda. I think they can afford a weekend shift, which by the way means they would avoid paying overtime. Budgets though, yeah. But they’re already paying for 5/7 of the week, why not run it on the weekend? It would take 3 people each working 8 hour shifts Saturday and Sunday to cover the weekend.

       People getting paid to browse comment on reddit is a fantasy. In reality there are just a ton of biased people. I think that graveyard hours and week ends have a higher concentration of people more serious about discussions than having immature slug fests and seeing who can tell their opinion louder. I coukd be wrong though. Maybe more introverts are browsing during these hours and having an effect as well.

       It's definitely not a fantasy... Even in my small eastern european country, it has been discovered (prior to elections) that parties have cyber units, that had a task to comment on e-news articles, swinging public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had tools where they could register their comments, prepared templates for comments, and were payed by the comment. All this was uncovered. Software included.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what makes you think it couldn't happened in any bigger, and more technologically advanced country, if it could happen in mine?
