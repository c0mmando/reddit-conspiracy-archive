        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Dazzlerocks.html">Dazzlerocks</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A user here (cannot say name due to rules) has discussed with me the potential for the Pyramid to be a ram pump. This is a paraphrase of what he/she said:</p>

<p>Pyramid= big ram pump allowing the generation of an extremely low frequency ELF connecting to the Schumann resonances. This is what I learned about Schumann resonances:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lightning discharges are considered to be the primary natural source of Schumann resonance excitation; lightning channels behave like huge antennas that radiate electromagnetic energy at frequencies below about 100 kHz. These signals are very weak at large distances from the lightning source, but the Earth–ionosphere waveguide behaves like a resonator at ELF frequencies and amplifies the spectral signals from lightning at the resonance frequencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The person think that those resonances can offer some expansion of consciousness for all living beings on the planet (At least that&#39;s what I got from it).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Schumann resonances are oscillating magnetic frequencies that happen in the Earth’s electromagnetic spectrum. They are said to be generated by electromagnetic changes that happen within the earth’s core, that then affect the earth’s surface, and ionosphere, including the sentient beings living upon it. This resonance has been about the same for hundreds, if not thousands of years, but it seems to be changing. Why?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Person compares it to a cloud system where data is stored and transferred eventually to conscious beings? Person mentioned &#39;dark energy&#39; and how it can be transferred across galaxies.</p>

<p>This is what I could gather about dark energy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then one version of Einstein&#39;s gravity theory, the version that contains a cosmological constant, makes a second prediction: &quot;empty space&quot; can possess its own energy. Because this energy is a property of space itself, it would not be diluted as space expands. As more space comes into existence, more of this energy-of-space would appear. As a result, this form of energy would cause the universe to expand faster and faster. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I&#39;m not too sure I could interpret what the user said, but a TLDR is that the pyramid acts as an amplifier to raise consciousness across the globe and work as a communication device across galaxies if it is pointed to a specific spot. Kind of like operating a radio and picking up a station. I&#39;m probably wrong. It&#39;s hard to put this into a simplified version and I don&#39;t understand it perfectly well.</p>

<p>Now I see people stating Sirius and Anubis are part of the Ancient Atlantean past and they may sometimes introduce aliens into this theory. I think this is part of a conspiracy that is in fact distracting us from the true history.</p>

<p>When people talk about Sirius, they are indirectly referring back to Sumer. Sumer is <strong>not</strong> the birthplace of civilization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since Sirius is the Dog Star, let us turn to the dog-headed Sumerian goddess Bau. According to Thorkild Jacobsen,1 &#39;Bau seems originally to have been goddess of the dog and her name, Bau, to have constituted an imitation of the dog&#39;s bark, as English &quot;bowwow&quot;.* Bau was also the daughter of An. So here the dog-goddess is the daughter of An, whereas in Egypt the dog-god was himself An-pu (Anubis).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might think, oh but Sirius is not connected to Sumer. Think again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the fifty Anunnaki were children of An, and Bau is a daughter of An, it is not far-fetched to see in Bau a survival (for she is an old goddess who faded into obscurity in later times) of the concept of a dog-star goddess equivalent to his as Sothis. And it is interesting that she was dog-headed. For Anubis was not entirely a jackal or dog, he was merely jackal- or dog-headed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is very interesting as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Sumerian Bau, as a daughter of An, is a sister of the fifty great gods (Anunnaki) who are also children of An. Since Bau may be a goddess of the Dog Star Sirius, the fact that she is the sister of &#39;the fifty&#39; is significant, as Sirius B has an orbital period of fifty years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think people are trying to bring it all back to Sumer, to Gilgamesh, and to Babylon. And these are lies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is thus yet another dog-motif connected with fifty (Sirius being the Dog Star), and linked to Sirius in various ways, such as through the goddess Hekate as an underworld version of Sirius. (The fifty Sumerian Anunnaki also had their counterparts in the underworld. Fifty in the underworld as &#39;death-counterparts&#39; or shadows to fifty in heaven makes one hundred - the very meaning of Hekate.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth lies in the Denisovans.</p>

<p>They seem to be the blonde, white, and blue-eyed giants that were seen and talked about all over the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We do not know how the Denisova hominines looked but as mentioned: A tooth found in the cave was very large, so they might have been very tall. We know that people in the area surrounding the Altai Mountains in the 6th to 3rd centuries BC had a very advanced technology; a race of white skinned, blond, blue eyed and very tall people with Caucasian features and long skulls. </p>

<p>The divine kings, the &quot;Gods&quot;, of Egypt were often depicted as white skinned, blond, blue eyed and very tall people with Caucasian features and a long skull. Were the &quot;Gods&quot; of the ancient Egyptian king-lists in fact Denisovans? Not us homo sapien sapien but our archaic cousins the Denisova Hominins?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are the missing link to learning the true history, the ancient history (30,000+ years), and the Atlantis mystery. To understand their origins, their technology, is to resurrect a golden age and an end to this hell. </p>

<p>Last thought: I hypothesize that the Atlanteans were a Denisovan-human hybrid because Denisovans if they were giants, could only thrive in cold climates. A user provided a theory of Square Cube Law and human height. Saying that the colder it is, the better off a form will be if it is taller. The hotter it is, the easier it is to cool down being short. As we know, the world got warmer at the end of the last Ice Age. What if in order for the Denisovans to survive, they had to breed with humans? Thus a hybrid species existed. Melanesians have the highest percentage of Denisovan DNA and they have blonde hair and blue eyes.</p>

<p>Another potential avenue for you to research is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutrean_hypothesis">Solutrean Hypothesis</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similar to the controversy surrounding Kennewick Man, the Solutrean hypothesis has also been politicized in the 2010s. Reports claimed that it had attracted the support of white supremacy groups,[who?] interpreting the theory to the effect that the &quot;original inhabitants of the Americas&quot; were &quot;white Europeans&quot;, &quot;the Solutreans&quot;, and that the present-day Native Americans (Indians) are the descendants of &quot;later immigrants&quot; from Asia.[35] A Canadian Broadcasting Company documentary in January 2018 was widely criticized by scientists and Native Americans for its uncritical presentation of the Solutrean hypothesis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Native-American/Prehistory">like this quote from Britannica</a> regarding the North American Mound Builders:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These erroneous and overtly racist beliefs were often used to rationalize the destruction or displacement of indigenous Americans. Such beliefs were not dispelled until the 1890s, when Cyrus Thomas, a pioneering archaeologist employed by the Smithsonian Institution, demonstrated conclusively that the great effigy mounds, burial mounds, and temple mounds of the Northeast and Southeast culture areas had been built by Native Americans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tells you all you need to know about these two subjects and how they are trying to shut down any conversation about them with &quot;muh racism&quot;. That&#39;s what they do when they are literally shitting their pants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some have blonde hair and blue eyes. They have dark skin, but their blonde hair and blue eyes are not attributed to Europeans. It&#39;s their own trait.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They compared the entire genetic makeup of 43 blond and 42 dark-haired islanders. The two groups, they found, had different versions of a crucial gene, one that coded for a protein involved in pigmentation. Switching one &quot;letter&quot; of genetic code-replacing a &quot;C&quot; with a &quot;T&quot;-meant the difference between dark hair and blond hair. A similar mutation creates blond mice by reducing the melanin content in their fur.</p>

<p>Blond Solomon Islanders carry two copies of this mutant gene, which is present in 26% of the islands&#39; population, the team will report in tomorrow&#39;s issue of Science. The gene is recessive, which means that blonds inherit it from both parents. The researchers did not find the mutation in DNA samples of 941 individuals from 52 other populations around the world, including European countries. &quot;It&#39;s a great example of convergent evolution, where the same outcome is brought about by completely different means,&quot; says Myles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there were Denisovans and Denisovan hybrids. The Melensians and Aborigines didn&#39;t have outside influence for potentially 10,000 to 40,000 years. Maybe a few denisovans left their mark their and their genes remained through isolation.</p>

<p>The Denisovan hybrids on the other hand, may have had mixture of neanderthal and cromagnon. The neanderthal may have existed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/02/why-did-neanderthals-die-out">28,000</a> years ago.</p>

<p>They may have hung on in pockets – including caves in Gibraltar – until 28,000 years ago, it was believed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have denisovan and neanderthal dna is us as a species. It&#39;s a small percentage which shows the cross-breeding may have happened a long time ago. This is an area that is grey, but may help explain some things. More research is needed.</p>

<p>so the denisovan admixture in any other population would be less then is in their case since isolation equals to preservation in genetics, and probably particular phenotipic caracteristics could be better explained by more recent admixtures in the gene poll of those populations than by the denisovan admixture.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean? It&#39;s all connected. The large stoneworks of Baalbek, Egypt, Peru, Siberia. The giants or &#39;nephilim&#39;, the blonde/red hair and blue eyes, the pyramids, the &#39;flying&#39; vimanas, the Great Flood, Atlantis. It&#39;s all pointing to our beginnings, to our origins. Gilgamesh was the first one to destroy what we had in terms of our history, he replaced what was in Baalbek and put forth a new god, Moloch. </p>

<p>This Moloch and ancient Sumer/Babylon is the false god. The one that destroys us through inverted beliefs. When we figure out the truth, we destroy this belief system and we gain back our future!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah there partner. We are NOT lowlifes. Maybe the Sumerians were a slave race and maybe the Atlanteans had a dark age too where they disregarded human life. There&#39;s not much to collect from our ancient, ancient past and I&#39;m not expert. But I suggest that Denisovans mated with humans and produced hybrids. These hybrids eventually died out with only small traces in us today. </p>

<p>But we can see it as I mentioned in my other thread, through ancient stonework, giants, and the red haired, blonde haired mummies of ancient Egypt and Asia. There&#39;s a lot we don&#39;t know, but bit by bit, the picture is forming. </p>

<p>why would you atribute those things to these especific gene admixture, since what is said to us today is that <strong>wa all have the dna</strong>? what makes you think that those people are &quot;giants, and the red haired, blonde haired mummies of ancient Egypt and Asia&quot; and not anithing else? how can you be so sure about this if what you have is just the conviction that these people made all that and have withe skin and blue eyes? why the people that have the largest amount of denisovan dna did not resemble the people that you picture?</p>

<p>[...] &gt;in order for the Denisovans to survive, <strong>they had to breed with humans?</strong> Thus a hybrid species existed. <em>Melanesians have the highest percentage of Denisovan DNA</em> and <strong>they have blonde hair.</strong></p>

<p>unfortunately as pointed by someone:<br/>
<strong>researchers did not find the mutation in DNA samples of 941 individuals from 52 other populations around the world</strong>, including European countries.</p>

<p>these caracteristicis can&#39;t be account, by any means, as a measure of genetic relationship betwen the populations citated, there are no genetic relationship betwen the puported denisovan dna and the apearence of those people in the altai.<br/>
and why in those models is <strong>ALWAYS</strong> the intelligent ones that die out and our purportedly less advanced ancestrals do not.</p>
