       Hicks' comedy was not only critical of the ruling class and the elite power structure, but his message was also one of unity and promoting peace. Today, his work is online for all to see, and standup comedians are traditionally targeted by TPTB. Their unique blend of philosophy, criticism of the ruling class, and disarming comedy is very effective at reaching and enlightening the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, I think the disinformation agents came up with a way to tie him to Alex Jones, somebody who seems to be universally hated by the people on this sub, rightfully so. In my opinion it's just a clever way to deflect from any good Bill Hicks content and start a big argument that deflects from the actual content. Thus, the "Bill Hicks is Alex Jones!" meme was born.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hicks was laid back, an advocate for peace and the protection of our civil liberties. He advocated the use of psychedelic drugs as a means of self exploration and therapy, and divorced himself from partisan politics. Jones is a hyperactive right wing extremist who supports the current establishment. Their mannerisms and appearances alone are so vastly different, it's not even remotely close.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every rabbit hole is harmless folks. Sometimes theres a sinister intention behind these seemingly "fun and silly" Pandora's box type conspiracies, as seems to be the case with the Alex Jones/Hicks theory.

       Lots of these clowns play many roles during their life.  Like all the different people who have played Charles Manson including whoever plays George W. Bush:

      <p>
       That's the thing.  Neither Bill Hicks nor Alex Jones are real people.  They are both characters played by an actor who is incredibly talented.

       How are they baseless?  Based on pictures of Manson he's clearly been played by many different people and that one iteration matches George Bush's face using facial recognition software.  The voice also matches up.  There is also a ton of evidence for Hicks = Jones:

       As am I, but the idea that he turned into Jones actually isn't tarnishing at all to people that really understand Hicks and his methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would Alex Jones receive a lifetime achievement award for the sales of "Arizona Bay" and "Sane Man" on the Ten year anniversary of Hicks death?

       I'm a fan of bill hicks, and I'm not of jones, but after looking into it, I can't honestly say without a shadow of doubt that they're not the same person.

       That being said, if they were, I don't think it would necessarily tarnish what hicks stood for. Would Kaufman things up a bit sure, but then we're back at whether or not they put a man on the moon. Man on the moon.

       You would think that Bill/Alex would have had his dentist change his teeth a bit, which would have been much easier and cheaper than having a plastic surgeon change his ear key, which he undoubtably did since their ears are different.

       Paul McCartney’s replacement double has the same ear key and teeth as pre 1966 McCartney. Amazing how they were able to get a double with the same ears, teeth, singing voice and musical talent as the original. 🤔

       There’s a pic comparing profiles somewhere in the video posted four or five times above, clearly showing different ears. Their teeth don’t look much alike either. Compare the two front teeth of each. Different shape, Hick’s have the little bumps on the end (don’t know the name for them, some people have them) Alex’s widen out but Bill’s are more straight.

       Having said that, there could certainly be more posts regarding logic, observation and general semantics. Commenters on Reddit need know how to ask their brains the proper questions.

       The bill hicks as alex jones theory is in the same bin as flat earth and fake moon landing for me.

      <p>
       Not only does it make Alex Jones, often an idiotic circus act imho, susceptible to criticism. But it also tarnishes Bill Hicks, who was a brilliant comedian conspiracy theorist, just by association.

       Oh well, not firing on all cylinders today. Thank you for bringing this up though. Seems like every time valid conspiracy stuff hits the mainstream, we get plastered with bullshit conspiracies to make us look retarded.

       Yes I am, and I have been here a long time,  and managed to choke my way through everything I could find on the theory. And it is a psyop, a
       <em>

       financed psyop that reaks of COINTELPRO, that has waylaid many minds better spent elsewhere, it brings much sadness.

       Well, it infected conspiracy communities like a wave a decade ago. You would have had to been there. The tangible and empirical evidence that we went there is freely available. You guys are making the claim that it was a hoax, burden of proof is on you. I am voicing the opinion that it is a psyop. This is just a possible explanation for why this ludicrous theory exists, it could be wrong, but that doesn't make the theory any less artificial.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here, try this...go google anything related to the moon landing as a hoax being a psyop. You will find nothing but the moon landing is a hoax articles. Now google (a CIA funded/guided project), who is well known for burying any truly subversive information it sees fit, to just let this
       <em>
        information
       </em>
       that totally undermines a huge part of science, and our national identity...they just let that shit roll right out.

       No... Lol actually that's what you're doing with your sayitism. You brought it up. This is a thread about Bill Hicks=Alex Jones and in reality has little to do with either. Its mute. Not important. What is important is for a mod you do a biased job. You can have your opinions, but with just saying others are dumb for their beliefs, you bring nothing new to the table.

Rockets were really built and flown in the air, they just never went to space. Astronauts are real people you can meet, they just don't go to space. Their artists are always busy making pictures from missions, but they're just artist's renditions.

       I'm not some rando that only comes out for moon landing threads (which this isnt, and unfortunately have inadvertently slid to all hell).
      </p>
      <p>
       I live here. Have my hands in basically every topic, and if you don't know the difference between contributing members of this community, and rando dicks that just come here to trash topics, let me tell you how I made my experience here 1000x better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I learned all the regular usernames. I made a point to talk to nearly all of them. Several of them have turned into the best friends I've ever had. When a new guy shows up with bullshit, it sticks out like a sore thumb. Hell, the lunatics here even voted me in to be a mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think my opinions should weigh more for any reason than anyone else's to someone trying to work this shit out, but I sure hope it stimulates them to consider. And to compare me to a sandy hook shill just because I think your theory is shit is just fuxking ridiculous.

       My family worked for NASA, I have photos from their missions. Believe me, you're not the only one who doesn't want to look at the evidence for some degree of manipulation in the Apollo program, because it is really rather painful to consider, and subconsciously we want to avoid that pain. A few thought experiments:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Neil Armstrong become depressed and retreat from the world after returning from what should have been an profoundly personally rewarding mission?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does NASA now consider it impossible to land humans on the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       On topic...it is interesting that this Hicks/Jones fracas does tend to overshadow the Hicks message. This isn't entirely incompatible with the premises of the theory - both Hicks/Jones characters being acts and therefore both discardable for the actor, and - more in the speculative realm - Jones as mouthpiece.

       I did continue to read the rest, but I still have the same issue that we end up speculating on speculations if we posit that the moon landing happened as stated, and then wild thing X happened as a result.

       Phobos, though, we fully agree on the weirdness there.

       I'm not saying you shouldn't air your opinion. I'm saying that if you refuse to speak to the evidence, then that is exactly what you are doing. You are doing nothing more than asserting your opinion. And argument from assertions is easily refuted by an argument from assertion from the opposite side.

       I saw an episode of "the big Bang Theory" where they did the Lunar Laser ranging experiment to prove that NASA left behind a mirror. So that's just proof that humans went to the moon right? Or is that also somehow proof that "we found something on the moon, and were told not to come back."

       And everyone forgets, the Russians, during the hot and furious beginning of the cold war, had their own competing moon landing program. They were pouring vast resources into this endeavor, the same as the US. Were they actually not ready to nuke us? Were the Russians actually
       <em>
        collaborating
       </em>
       with this massive conspiracy...to ahh, pretend the moon is real? Like why the fuck would they do that? What is the goal in the 1960's of convincing the world that the moon is real, and we landed on it? It is utterly retarded, and hides the REAL questions to me:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did we stop
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did the Russians scrap the most expensive endeavor in history at the time?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Because we went there, and we met something that told us "don't come back". That is my pet theory anyhow. What happened to the 2 probes Russia sent to check out Phobos for that matter? Maybe the moon landing hoax theory is running cover for
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       conspiracies?

       I've always believe the latter half of the 20th Century was roughly hammered out at Yalta - the Cold War was a Hegelian ruse of both powers, for money [&amp; loosh] and world domination. I still think think the same premise is
       <a href="http://www.texemarrs.com/images/bush_putin_hu.jpg">
        at play

       , with China, Rockefeller's jewel, coming into play as the next economic powerhouse/frontier.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was heartbroken when Apollo never amounted to anything, and Skylab turned out to be a joke. By then, it was obvious it was just a show. By the time the Vikings produced 'no results' for life on Mars, I was 100% convinced it had all been a lie. I didn't get into the histories of the earlier, and later, US and Russian Mars missions until the '90's. What? 72 failures? Something like that. Mars holds the key for the foundation of life on Earth - and the Moon points straight to Mars. That's why both places are out of reach. [I'm open to the reality of being warned off, but I don't have any info on that that you, or anybody, doesn't.]
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a believer in early NACA/USAF missions throughout the solar system &amp; beyond during the Ike years. I think that program specifically had a lot to do with Ike's MIC speech.

       Have you checked out Phobos' orbit, composition, artificial surface features? And the last pic that their 2nd probe got of a black craft(?) right before it "malfunctioned"? Wild shit. Moon landing as a hoax is downright boring by comparison.

        Have you checked out Phobos' orbit, composition, artificial surface features? And the last pic that their 2nd probe got of a black craft(?) right before it "malfunctioned"? Wild shit. Moon landing as a hoax is downright boring by comparison.

       It was a super big deal watching the capsules float down &amp; splash in the ocean. I remember the tail end of Gemini [Gemini Glen&amp; the Apollo 1 fire. Gus Grissom was my favorite astronaut, then Glen, then Bean, then Shepard.

       Alex looks way older than he actually is today (not enough Super Male Vitality I guess) but looked very young when he first started in the mid 90's. Bill Hicks died when he was well into his 30's.

       Unless there was so serious plastic surgery going on, the ages don't really match up.

       There was plastic surgery definitely. He's got visible scars behind his ears indicating plastic surgery. Alex is much older than he claims. And finally while not impossible, it is highly unlikely to die if pancreatic cancer in your 30s. Its incredibly slow developing, usually affecting those in their 70s-80s.

       That's the whole point. AJ looks older than his reported age because his reported age is false. His real age is the age of Bill Hicks. Bill Hick would be in his 50's. AJ looks like he is in his 50's.

       No legitimacy huh? Other than the fact that they look strikingly similar, have the same teeth, Jones has had at least two guests on his show call him "Bill" by mistake, Alex Jones looks about 12 years older than he actually claims to be in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       photos, there's no photos of them together despite being involved with the same people, Hicks's cancer diagnosis came about 40 years before the national average, and about a dozen other things that I'm sure are just coincidences....

       The theory seems likely to me. The association between the two just means that Hicks' name will be anchored in your mind along with Jones any time you hear it, and that any conspiracy discussion of Hicks will have a built-in handlebar already prepared for forum-sliding shills to easily take control. This casts a slight shadow, but one strong enough to weaken a unifying symbol of real resistance. Each psyop and piece of propaganda does not need to be nor ever is a decisive checkmate.

       Its not a meme at all. We all love Bill Hicks, and if more people understood that Jones, while being C.O is still a naughty boy to the nwo. I'm almost certain its all a big joke. I think your logic that it is deflection is proven wrong by the fact that believers of this theory are aware he is owned by TWC and stratfor.

       It bugs me too because I'm a big fan of Hicks, and hate that he's been associated with that sensationalist Alex Jones in any way. Hicks would probably have a whole stand up bit about AJ if he were alive today.

       How much more proof do you need? Alex Jones could come right out and admit it and you still wouldn't believe it. Oh wait, he has! Several times.

       Hicks towards the end hated stand up. He couldn't wait to quit performing on stage. Hicks perfectly timed his retirement shows then died. Maybe he did just die but he very well could be Jones.

       There's no proof of any of that. I guess you could call it "circumstantial evidence", but even that is a stretch.

       The AJ/Bill hicks "conspiracy" is pointless anyway. There's actual conspiracies with real evidence to support their existence we could and should be focusing on, not this phony as fucking circus of a theory.

       And there is also circumstantial evidence galore...
Alex Jones lies about his age, he always looked more Bill Hicks age
Bill Hicks and Kevin Booth discussed a change to the Shock Jock format on record.
       <br/>
       Alex and Bill share a production company and same best friend at  Sacred Cow - presumably some kind of Jesuit shop.
       <br/>
       Alex Jones admits a few times on his show now that he was Bill Hicks.

       There was once another Alex Jones, but there isn't now. Now can you explain all the exact matches on their teeth, moles, same best friend, same production company, Hicks saying he wanted to create a Rush Limbaugh type character, pancreatic cancer being statstically impossible to get at 32?

Alex Jones would have (allegedly) been 25 back in 1999 when this image was taken,  and he never significantly lost weight after this photo was taken.  The only way that picture could be Alex would be if he was one of the most jacked high schoolers of all time, and then somehow lost all his muscle and gained dozens of pounds in his early 20s...

       Well the one above seems pretty good to me, ie a picture of him!!
As a side note I was once told that Alex Jones parents were tripping on LSD when he was conceived, by someone close to him (and Hicks)... at the same meeting I explained that Jones seemed to have taken off where Bill left, just without the humour, the person in question then went on to explain how much he missed his friend Bill.
Seriously, anyone who considers Jones as Hicks is not using sound logic and I can only assume is a paid shill or naive beyond belief... and for the poor shill who keeps wanting proof that Jones is NOT Hicks, dude, its impossible to prove a negative.

       Are you serious? It’s totally possible to prove Jones isn’t Hicks. The family of Hicks could have published and verified his death certificate. We could have seen their separate brith certificates. We could have seen unearthed photos of them together. You have all this evidence that they are the same guy and NONE that they are not. I can prove that George Bush and John Kerry aren’t the same person, obviously. Would you still say it’s impossible to prove a negative? Think.

       Work for the same tiny company (sacred cow productions), have the same friends, Hicks dies about a year before Jones shows up in the same city of Austin,  Hicks reported on Waco, Jones helped rebuild Waco, Jones accepts a plaque of Bill Hicks' from Kevin Booth at the 10 year anniversary of Hicks' death, they have the same face (

       I wouldn't insist that they are the same person, but I would insist that there are many highly improbably coincidences, and that's not even including the time Jones literally said 'I'm your host Bill Hicks and we'll be right back' on air.  No shit.

       I see the resemblance, but i dont buy it. But let's talk hypothetically, say Hicks became Jones, how would TPTB even go about making that transformation? Threaten to whack Hicks if he didnt comply? i'm genuinely curious. And also, do you know of any other cases similar to Hicks/Jones?

       It's a far out theory, but both Hicks and Jones are far-out individuals.  Out of their god damn minds.  I'm not entirely convinced either.  I think synchronicity has a greater likelihood of being at play here than conspiracy (I've seen weird coincidences happen without explanation) but it's just weird.  Possible, incredibly unlikely, but weird.

       The OP argument makes no sense to me.  Saying that Alex Jones is Bill Hicks does nothing to delegitimize criticism of Alex, virtually any criticism of Alex is just as valid regardless of whether or not he was once known as Bill Hicks.  Conversely, commenting on Bill Hicks videos that he is now Alex Jones doesn't delegitimize any point he may have made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Alex and Bill are the same person is ultimately irrelevant when evaluating their words and opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I really enjoy Bill Hicks and dislike Alex Jones, but I think when you look at the evidence it's impossible to completely dismiss it.  I went down this rabbit hole about a year ago, and while I was extremely skeptical at first, after looking at all the evidence I would say there is above 50% chance that Alex is Bill.  What are the chances of having identical teeth, identical hairline, same best friend, same production company, same interests, similar mannerisms, similar body-type, similar anti-establishment views... etc.

       Even if you multiply the odds that they are both from Austin, both worked with Kevin Jones, have identical teeth, never be photographed together, and that Jones was (completely and obviously by accident) called "Bill" by
       <em>
        not one, but two
       </em>
       of his guests, you already have overwhelming odds that can't be ignored. And that's not taking into account Jones's CIA connections and all the other "coincidences." In other words I respectfully would say there's way above a 50% chance.

       I agree 100%.  Perhaps I should have been more specific when I said "above 50 percent chance",  I think its overwhelmingly likely that they are the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its mind boggling to me that (allegedly) during the same time period they lived in the same area,  had the same best friend,  worked for the same tiny company, and performed stand-up at the same clubs... yet according to Alex they never met eachother (and as you say there is no photo of them together).  My best friend and I are both comedy enthusiasts and we have both performed at local open mics in the past,  and if my best friend had another close friend who was a big into stand-up I DEFINITELY would have met this person at one point or another.

       I just realized Jones is said to have graduated high school one year before Hicks’s death. So that vitiates all the claims people are making about how they were both public figures at the same time.

       Alex looks way older than he actually is today (not enough Super Male Vitality I guess) but looked very young when he first started in the mid 90's. Bill Hicks died when he was well into his 30's.

       This is reminiscent of the Sandy threads when there's always someone whose brother's roommate's nephew was there and saw everything so it must have been real. Rockets were really built and flown in the air, they just never went to space. Astronauts are real people you can meet, they just don't go to space. Their artists are always busy making pictures from missions, but they're just artist's renditions.

       No... Lol actually that's what you're doing with your sayitism. You brought it up. This is a thread about Bill Hicks=Alex Jones and in reality has little to do with either. Its mute. Not important. What is important is for a mod you do a biased job. You can have your opinions, but with just saying others are dumb for their beliefs, you bring nothing new to the table. Especially without sources.

       My family worked for NASA, I have photos from their missions. Believe me, you're not the only one who doesn't want to look at the evidence for some degree of manipulation in the Apollo program, because it is really rather painful to consider, and subconsciously we want to avoid that pain. A few thought experiments:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Neil Armstrong become depressed and retreat from the world after returning from what should have been an profoundly personally rewarding mission?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does NASA now consider it impossible to land humans on the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       On topic...it is interesting that this Hicks/Jones fracas does tend to overshadow the Hicks message. This isn't entirely incompatible with the premises of the theory - both Hicks/Jones characters being acts and therefore both discardable for the actor, and - more in the speculative realm - Jones as mouthpiece.
