        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bring a bunch of public attention to these <a href="https://www.theridgefieldpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2016/02/t_PR-P1-Cell-tower-close.jpg">microwave transponders</a> which they purport to be cell towers but are actually not. This microwave transponders are not always hoisted together like in the picture, they are sometimes drilled individually onto tall buildings. These are not cell towers because cell towers don’t even exist! Yes there are antennas but those are located at actual telecommunication buildings. When you complain to your cell provider that you have no service in whatever area all they do is setup a repeater which is just one tiny antenna not this scary looking boxes. To prove my point next time you see <a href="https://www.theridgefieldpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2016/02/t_PR-P1-Cell-tower-close.jpg">these</a> beam boxes, check your cell service. I promise you it will be the same regardless of how close you are to it. It’s not a cell tower it’s a microwave emitter. </p>

<p>How can you help? Bring attention to them, stand by them, take obvious video clips, engage people nearby and inform them that these things are not cell towers but part of a weaponized system against citizens. Now to be clear, I’m not promoting vandalism but I’m sure morally you would be in the clear as these things are weapons and you would merely be defending yourself. When you engage people make sure to tell the people to check their cell service by things to see for themselves that they are not cell towers. Also show them a picture of this <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1855/6777/products/JEFA-XR-PLUS-01_large.jpg?v=1518727632">repeater</a> reminding them that this is how cell service antennas look like. Show them that these microwave boxes are always discussed at town hall meetings by concerned citizens yet they are never given a straight answer as to their exact nature. Bring as much attention as you can to these things, subconsciously people are already aware that they look dangerous as fuck so all it takes is some simple convincing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahhh just being facetious, thank you for pointing that out. I usually give extraordinary consideration to wild ideas on this sub, so I only tend to call b/s on what I know definitively to be untrue. After all, conspiracies true and untrue are easily dismissed by the powers that be due to their unbelievable nature - therefore it is a feature of most conspiracies on this sub that they sound crazy and outlandish... a feature that often keeps them from being considered/investigated. Thus the suspension of disbelieve towards outlandish claims is helpful to avoid prematurely dismissing those which are in fact true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t hear voices but I’m sure this system is also capable of this. This patent is important to me as its the patent office(gov) acknowledging the existence and function of a system that turns info (speech) into beamable microwaves. It’s exgremely tough finding any direct evidence of this system but I believe this patent at least demonstrates the ability transfer info (or mind/body manipulation) through invisible microwaves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are not microwave antennas/emitters. They are cellular antennas that transmit data via radio frequency (RF) waves. There is a certain type of radiation emitted from them. Look up RF radiation to educate yourself on possible harmful effects. There are some microwave antennas on some cellular communications towers, but they don&#39;t look anything like the ones pictured, and they have a much narrower &quot;beam&quot; that is directly pointed at another receiving/transmitting microwave antenna in another location. They are generally round and transmit such data as TV signals. The pictured antennas can be mounted almost anywhere, from naked towers to water towers to building walls to the inside of an enormous fiberglass Christian cross on top of a megachurch. You may not pick up a cell signal standing directly underneath one of these antennae because they transmit cellular signals in a roughly triangular spread from top to bottom. You may have to be at a distance from the tower to be within its service area. Also, you may not get a signal at all from the tower because the only antennas mounted up there belong to Verizon, and you have AT&amp;T service. Some towers have equipment from all service providers, and some don&#39;t. I&#39;m not saying any of this to discount the possible dangers of RF (or microwave) radiation or anything, but knowledge of how these systems work can help us all more accurately direct our study of what may actually be harmful in the system. Having worked on these towers and received RF exposure safety training, I can tell you I would NEVER stand directly in front of one of these things while it&#39;s powered on at a close range. I And that leads me to wonder how safe they are even at a distance. </p>
