<p>That&#39;s right. Ideally don&#39;t hit anybody of any gender. </p>

<p>Mo&#39;fuckers are glad he&#39;s dead on the grounds that he beat up a women. Like there&#39;s nothing she could of done that warranted a 20 year old, who probs wasn&#39;t in complete control of his emotions, loosing his shit and beating her.</p>

<p>And you think people shouldn&#39;t take interest in his death on the grounds that he beat up a women. It&#39;s like we cry for all genders to be treated equally but not really.</p>

<p>If a dude did something and another dude fucked him up. Y&#39;all will be like </p>

<p>&quot;Well, he shouldn&#39;t have been talking shit.&quot;</p>

<p>If a guy beats up his girlfriend, he serves to die or we shouldn&#39;t care that he&#39;s dead. </p>

<p>Come on yo!?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why he did what he did or even if what we think he did was true, I&#39;m well aware that we think what we&#39;re told to think. Think Tupac and Michael Jackson.</p>

<p>Without a doubt. However, you aren&#39;t a rapper  in the lime light and are not surrounded by other xanax and purple drank drinking rappers and haven&#39;t shared his experiences. So what you&#39;ve done who who you are isn&#39;t really relevant is it?</p>

<p>According to US law he isn&#39;t mature enough to drink at 20 but he&#39;s mature enough to deserve to die for this shit he says at 20?</p>

<p>And for the record, I&#39;d never heard of him until he died and it was days after that I learned how to say his name.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m wondering is why do these kids who appear to have everything need to take anti depressants all day? Somethings not right. </p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t care about his death or be interested in the conspiracy side of it because he beat up his girlfriend and laughed at the idea of people dying on fentynal?</p>

<p>That&#39;s fucking ridiculous. Baring in mind he was only 20 years old. Anything you do at 20 man, surely you should be able to redeem yourself? Well he can&#39;t but you get the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this is all new information. </p>

<p>My point is, it&#39;s very easy for people to believe what they are told to believe. I do not believe Michael Jackson was a paedophile nor do I believe Tupac raped that women. But the general public believe he was and did.</p>

<p>The fact that each comment and thread I see someone says xxxtenacion did something different, leads me to believe y&#39;all don&#39;t know what the fuck happened.</p>

<p>And regardless of what a 20 year old in a dark place does. He should be given the chance to change and looking at the way he expressed himself compared to his friends, I have no doubt he would have.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t think a 20 year should be able to do something that defines him forever. We all as humans should be able to change and work at being a better person and be given a chance to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I don’t believe that his death was faked but there is definitely something going on in broward. As I have said in other posts, basically all of this new “soundcloud rap” scene that all comes from broward. Seeing as how they just had a giant “shooting”, which just so happens to be the one that really starts this whole gun control push with the students, there has to be something to this area. XXX himself even posted a picture to his Snapchat which I have posted talking about something being “put in the air” in broward that’s making everyone sick. Whether it’s spraying or something else I’m not sure, but seeing who is in charge of the area raises an even bigger red flag. Broward county = the new laurel canyon??</p>
