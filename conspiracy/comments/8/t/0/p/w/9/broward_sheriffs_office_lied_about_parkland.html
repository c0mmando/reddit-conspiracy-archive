       They faked the deaths in the Parkland school shooting hoax. So it is very likely they also faked the death of xxxtantacion. Especially Sheriff Scott
       <strong>
        Israel
       </strong>
       is a liar.

       There are numerous possible reasons. Here one: xxxtentacious is part of a satanic cult and the boss there has higher plans for the young man and didn't want him to go to jail for the numerous crimes he was accused of.

       I find it fascinating people are concerned about the death of someone who:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Actively raped and abused their pregnant girlfriend
       </li>
       <li>
        Laughed at the idea of people dying from fentanyl laced drugs
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I'm sure there was quite the queue for this kids' death.  Maybe he would have turned his life around, but he was a piece of shit on Earth for the first 20
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how these posts never came out when lil peep died.

       I find it fascinating people think a 20 year old dude deserved to die as consequence for his actions, them being that he battered his girlfriend.

       With that being said, is it not possible she deserved getting battered?

      <p>
       That's right. Ideally don't hit anybody of any gender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mo'fuckers are glad he's dead on the grounds that he beat up a women. Like there's nothing she could of done that warranted a 20 year old, who probs wasn't in complete control of his emotions, loosing his shit and beating her.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you think people shouldn't take interest in his death on the grounds that he beat up a women. It's like we cry for all genders to be treated equally but not really.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a dude did something and another dude fucked him up. Y'all will be like
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well, he shouldn't have been talking shit."
      </p>
      <p>
       If a guy beats up his girlfriend, he serves to die or we shouldn't care that he's dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on yo!?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why he did what he did or even if what we think he did was true, I'm well aware that we think what we're told to think. Think Tupac and Michael Jackson.

       Without a doubt. However, you aren't a rapper  in the lime light and are not surrounded by other xanax and purple drank drinking rappers and haven't shared his experiences. So what you've done who who you are isn't really relevant is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       According to US law he isn't mature enough to drink at 20 but he's mature enough to deserve to die for this shit he says at 20?
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record, I'd never heard of him until he died and it was days after that I learned how to say his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm wondering is why do these kids who appear to have everything need to take anti depressants all day? Somethings not right.

       What do you mean I'm changing my argument? I dont really have an argument. I'm just chatting shit on Reddit, in response to your nonsense.

       We shouldn't care about his death or be interested in the conspiracy side of it because he beat up his girlfriend and laughed at the idea of people dying on fentynal?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's fucking ridiculous. Baring in mind he was only 20 years old. Anything you do at 20 man, surely you should be able to redeem yourself? Well he can't but you get the point.

       Dude, my roommate was telling me the guy was accused of shoving a fork into his girl’s vageen against her will obviously...come on. That’s sick and twisted. Not something a normal, not ass hole person would do.

       He beat the shot out of her for singing one of his songs, and when someone else in the collab came on she didn't stop.  He tried drowning her multiple times. He would fill the bathtub, make her get in and threaten to drop microwaves in on her. He kept her locked in a room she couldn't get out of.

       He was a piece of shit.

       Well this is all new information.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, it's very easy for people to believe what they are told to believe. I do not believe Michael Jackson was a paedophile nor do I believe Tupac raped that women. But the general public believe he was and did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that each comment and thread I see someone says xxxtenacion did something different, leads me to believe y'all don't know what the fuck happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regardless of what a 20 year old in a dark place does. He should be given the chance to change and looking at the way he expressed himself compared to his friends, I have no doubt he would have.

       Just look into her allegations. Look at some of his interviews. He had no shame about it.

       So because hes young and depressed he gets a free ride?

       Why? Tupac was 24 when he died. Tentacion was 20. Both were rappers who supposedly did some pretty bad stuff. They have a lot in common.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying I don't think a 20 year should be able to do something that defines him forever. We all as humans should be able to change and work at being a better person and be given a chance to do so.

       For starters x was just a kid. Still learning like the rest of us. Not to mention he made some really good music. Might not of been your flavor or taste but understand alot of ppl identified with and connected with x through his music.wether its all hoax or not is kinda irelavent. Bottom line we lost sombody we loved.

       Personally I don’t believe that his death was faked but there is definitely something going on in broward. As I have said in other posts, basically all of this new “soundcloud rap” scene that all comes from broward. Seeing as how they just had a giant “shooting”, which just so happens to be the one that really starts this whole gun control push with the students, there has to be something to this area. XXX himself even posted a picture to his Snapchat which I have posted talking about something being “put in the air” in broward that’s making everyone sick. Whether it’s spraying or something else I’m not sure, but seeing who is in charge of the area raises an even bigger red flag. Broward county = the new laurel canyon??
