        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Very limited discussion on this topic, most if not all is shilled/ridiculed and linked to TMOR. Even tiny posts like this will be likely be linked and thus brigaded with inane comments. Have to ask yourself...why? Why put the energy into it? Why the mass geoengineering? The orange hue that is growing larger everyday on the horizon? The long after glow when sun goes down, noticeably longer than before? How the fuck does noone notice? Phones? Have we forgotten what the sky really used to look like, or does nobody even look up? Limited correlation between sky phenomena, volcanic and EQ activity despite noticeable increases since 2012 and definitely no signs of any decrease. Are we experiencing the effects of another planetary system? Does Mandela Effect and Schumann resonance tie into all of it?</p>

<p>What limited focus there is on the internet(reddit) is focused on Q anon at the moment, whether it is a LARP or not etc etc. It IS most definitely an intelligence operation (distraction).. but to what end? To keep us hanging on every word? Q has never mentioned chemtrails or geoengineering..why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about the destroyer. The Kolbrin has a good description. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chapter Five – The Destroyer - Part 3<br/>
MAN:5:1 The Doomshape, called the Destroyer, in Egypt, was seen in all the lands thereabouts. In colour, it was bright and fiery; in appearance, changing and unstable. It twisted about itself like a coil, like water bubbling into a pool from an underground supply, and all men agree it was a most fearsome sight. It was not a great comet or a loosened star, being more like a fiery body of flame.<br/>
MAN:5:2 Its movements on high were slow; below it swirled in the manner of smoke and it remained close to the sun, whose face it hid. There was a bloody redness about it, which changed as it passed along its course. It caused death and destruction in its rising and setting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, again late to the party on this one. You said &quot;Q has never mentioned chemtrails or geoengineering..why?&quot; and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve felt ever since Q&#39;s beginning last year. I&#39;ll get to this, but first...<em>[warning: at the end I get all Christian]</em></p>

<p>There are a myriad of evil reasons for geoengineering which is ongoing. In addition to infusing the human population with heavy metals, thus increasing the chance of illness and sickness, there are even more nefarious uses, such as spreading actual pathogens and poisons into the air, if they haven&#39;t already done that before. Then there is the dimming of the sun, to wreak havoc on agriculture and human need for sunlight in order to be healthy. Then there is weather control/warfare, combined with HAARP. Think devastating hurricanes/typhoons and torrential rains. And finally there is the future combination of spraying, 5G, and super-powerful D-Wave computers, which will enable the powers that be to know and control, and thus enslave, the human population. </p>

<p>Chemtrails/Geoengineering/Solar Radiation Management is definitely something that affects us all negatively. All fingers point to the <strong><em>military industrial complex</em></strong> as being the culprit of this global problem, which is something that Q has not addressed. Don&#39;t get me wrong-- I am a total fan of and believer in Qanon, and I&#39;m a patriot who cares about his country. I think the Q phenomenon has helped along the patriotic movement around the globe. Q has helped show us that Trump &amp; Co. are taking down the Deep State, starting with Saudi Arabia, more recently North Korea, and now currently in the trenches versus the Deep State at home in the U.S. Next hopefully is booting the Deep State out of Iran. In the future, Israel? The Vatican? England? Whatever. I firmly believe that justice will be brought to many perpetrators of evil. Trump will be vindicated of any and all collusion with Russia. The public will (if not the media/entertainment world) be exposed to many truths. BUT until Q exposes the evil-doings of a <strong><em>limited part</em></strong> (see above bold italic words) of the very thing that is helping him win, then we are stuck with un-Godly skies. Sad to say.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the Lord knows and sees all. He wants all of us to pray for the souls that need saving. And that&#39;s <strong>ALL</strong> of us. For we are all sinners, whether our sins are small or big. And BTW how are we to be saved? Believe in the one God, who created heaven and earth. Believe in the God who sent His only son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins so that we can have a chance to live with Him forever after this life, instead of having this be our lone existence and being destined for the Lake of Fire. We are also called upon to love God above all others, and to also love our neighbors (and not all of our neighbors are nice!). We are all His children, good and naughty. I&#39;m sure He would be overjoyed if we can, in all of our own little ways, bring light to darkness.</p>

<p>Well, at least Q does mention God very often. And that&#39; s why I cross my fingers and pray!</p>
