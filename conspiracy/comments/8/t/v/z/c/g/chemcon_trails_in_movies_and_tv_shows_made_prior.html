        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If these Contrails are natural then how come they don’t appear in the skies of any tv show or movie older than 1990?</p>

<p>I see them all the time in movies, tv shows and even commercials now but I also watch a lot of older shows and I never see them in the skies.</p>

<p>Newer tv shows and movies based in the past have to digitally remove them but I doubt that they’ve gone back and removed them from CHiPs or any of the other shows based in LA.</p>

<p>See for yourself. If anyone has a link to a show filmed before 1990 showing contrails, please share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is such a thing as local microclimates, where a particular place gets noticeably different weather to the general area. It&#39;s why Brighton, England gets sunny weather in summer. Wet winds come in from the sea and pass over the town before rising over the hills behind, and forming a thick band of cloud. The town also has one particular black spot for vehicle pollution in a valley, while the rest is usually clean air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link.</p>

<p>I looked at all of the pictures and while they show contrails, usually one or two, none show the criss crossing grids and skies full of these patterns like we see today.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed. Same jet engines have been in use since the 60’s. I’m sure air traffic has increased somewhat but not enough to account for the dramatic increase.</p>

<p>I also read the comments and all of the links they posted.</p>

<p>Mick West is a piece of shit but I’m not going to attack the source here because at least the pics show something. I just don’t like the guy. His interview on Rogan was infuriating.</p>

<p>Really? Air traffic is increasing at up to 10 percent year on year. There are many times more aircraft in the sky than there were 30 years ago. Of course things have changed. Here is a graph showing the increase: <a href="https://imgur.com/9nbzZeb">https://imgur.com/9nbzZeb</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does it make sense that with the increase in air miles flown and the increase in efficiency of the modern jet engine we should be seeing more contrails? Having more planes in the air burning fuel, which produces water vapor during the process, means it makes sense to me to have more contrails. Also, more of the fuel put into the engines is combusted now a days so more water vapor should be produced per unit of fuel burned. </p>

<p>I get it, the airplanes get better fuel mileage now so they should be burning less fuel per airplane. But the fuel that is burned more effectively should be producing more water vapor and better contrails. We&#39;d need an aircraft engine engineer to answer the question I believe.</p>

<p>On the idea of showing or not showing contrails in movies, isn&#39;t that an artistic choice? If the scene calls for clear blue skies then we can&#39;t be having contrails now can we? If the scene is more industrial or oppressive, I feel contrails could add to the atmosphere of the scene.</p>
