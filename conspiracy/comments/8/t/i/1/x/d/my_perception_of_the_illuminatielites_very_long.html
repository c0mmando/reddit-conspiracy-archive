    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I agree with your perceptions of the Elites on many levels. Anyone who truly starts digging into it will end up around the same ballpark.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been interested in Sci-Fi, UFOs, and aliens. That&#39;s how I started my journey into the world of conspiracies. From there, it was easy to get into what David Icke presents. He touches on the Reptilian/Vampirism aspect of the Ruling Class while interweaving the pedophilia/human sacrifice. So, I went deeper and deeper into this stuff. But at some point, it reverts all back to being some kind of fantasy. Nibiru and the Annunaki would make for a great TV series, but it&#39;s not grounded in reality. Those feel like tales. The Tall Whites, Nordics, Pleadians and Draco Reptilians also sound like some Star Wars fan-fiction. It&#39;s not realistic.</p>

<p>So, I asked myself, what is real? Things I can observe, things I can experience, things that I know personally or have a high level of corroboration. Here&#39;s some of my thought process and conclusions:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Elite clearly believe and worship &quot;Satan&quot; (for a lack of a better word). There is a spiritual aspect to this, and as you&#39;ve mentionned, there is a real battle for our souls. On one hand, they belive in magick rituals and worship demonic entities. On the other, they tell the sheeple that God is a lie and religion/spirituality is bullshit. That tells me God exists and global Atheism is part of their plan.</li>
<li>Atheism and Science are now inseparable, forming the newest religion called Scientism. They&#39;re beliefs are dogmatic and anyone who questions any part of it is branded a heretic-nutjob-conspiracy-theorist-retard. They&#39;re shoving literal Science-Fiction down our throats and passing it off as real science. The Elites are pushing this crap, especially when it comes to space exploration and the universe beyond Earth. Those are not things you and I can verify. We have to take their word for it.</li>
<li>I&#39;m sorry it has to come down to this, but there is no measurable curvature or measurable rotation of the Earth. This long-ass journey down the Conspiracy rabbit hole has led me here. That is the ultimate truth that unlocks everything else. The Earth is flat. Once again, I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s the only remaining option for everything else to make sense.</li>
</ol>

<p>Why are the Elite worshipping demons? Because demons exist.</p>

<p>Why are the Elite performing magick rituals and sacrifices? Because our universe works with the power of intent.</p>

<p>Why are the Elite poisoning us and distracting us? Because they don&#39;t want us to discover these things.</p>

<p>Why is known pedophile John Podesta the Molesta pushing for UFOs disclosure? Because aliens are demons.</p>

<p>Why did Kimmel ask Bush, Obama, Bill and Hillary about Aliens on his show? Because aliens are demons.</p>

<p>Why does the Vatican have a telescope named Lucifer? Because they are secretely demon worshippers.</p>

<p>Why does the Vatican now say that we should accept Alien beings and baptise them? Because aliens are demons.</p>

<p>Why are the Elite visiting Antarctica ever since the 1950s-60s? Because that&#39;s where the demons come from.</p>

<p>Why has NASA not been back to the Moon for the last 40-50 years? Because they never went in the first place.</p>

<p>Why has NASA lied about going to the Moon? Because it sells the idea of space and the globe Earth.</p>

<p>Why has the Antarctic Treaty never been broken, regardless of wars and &quot;rivalries&quot; between countries? Because it&#39;s all a scripted show.</p>

<p>Why are the Elites leaving hints and symbolisms about their cruel acts? Because we give our consent by subconsiously knowing and doing nothing about it. We are basically all willing participants in their rituals.</p>

<p>Why are people so adamant in protecting their Globe Earth? Because they&#39;ve been brainwashed by it since birth.</p>

<p>Why are sheeple protect Agent Smith? Because they&#39;d rather live a comfortable lie and to know the hard truth.</p>

<p>Why is Flat Earth important? Because it sets you free and teaches you about the reality of God.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll end with this... I have an Athiest, Sci-Fi nerd, wanting nothing more than to leave this shitty place and explore new planets and races out there in space. I was lost in fantasies, oblivious to what was really happening here on Earth, where it actually matters. I now belive in God, because there is no other choice. This place, and us, have been created. This is an enclosed system. They only have power over us if we keep cooperating and being ignorant. Demons are real. Your soul is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just the about the shape, but the whole model and theoretical concepts behind it. The Globe Earth isn&#39;t just about its shape, it&#39;s also about Heliocentrism, dark matter, dark holes, the Big Bang, etc. The same applies to the Flat Earth. It&#39;s more than just its shape. It implies a complete shift of paradigm, not just a flat disk floating through outspace in the same Solar System with other spherical bodies.</p>

<p>A stationary, non-rotating, enclosed system under some sort of dome requires a creator. Its inteligently designed. Thus, God (or whatever you want to call it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, your model of the universe can still have a creator. It&#39;s my personal opinion that the &#39;Big Bang Creator&#39;, if you will, is at odds with the &#39;Bible Creator&#39;.</p>

<p>As for the Electric Universe, I completely support it as a better model of reality than the current one. I know of it thanks to Ben from Suspicious0bservers on Youtube. A lot of the theories and concepts of the Electric Universe can be applied to the Flat Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think that the Big Bang Creator and the Biblical Creator are two separate things? Is it due to the notion wherein the Earth was created in seven days? Is this something that should be taken literally? I ask due to the significance of the number Seven in most religions. </p>

<p>I have heard that Yahweh governs this planet, whilst the Higher Logos i.e. the Infinite Creator created this universe. So they are two separate entities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is my opinion that there is enough proof all around us, and even moreso due to Flat Earth, for the reality of the Biblical Creator. I can certainly entertain the idea of a greater Big Bang Creator, or a hierarchy of Creator-gods beyond... but to me, there is no proof of that (yet).</p>

<p>The creation in genesis could be taken literally, yes. Our Flat Earth enclosure (or petri dish) is located under the firmament (a physical dome; look up Operation Fishbowl) which separates the waters above from the waters below. We are literally in a solid &quot;bubble&quot; surrounded by water (check out the symbolism in the &quot;Hennessy Commercial 2016 The Piccards Advert&quot;).</p>

<p>Check out Pastor Tyler J. Doka on Youtube for more info related to the Bible in relation to Flat Earth. The guy preaches to read the bible literally, as it is writen</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much believe that some demonic entities are in Antarctica. It&#39;s a mysterious place, even moreso when viewing through the lens of the Flat Earth model. It doesn&#39;t help that Satanic Elite are making lots of visit to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Truth shall set you free&quot;</p>

<p>Which begs the question, what is Truth? Where does it come from? What is the real source of it?</p>

<p>You mention you believe in God, that&#39;s great. But WHICH God? You have many to choose from... You must be very specific about this, for there is only One True God. The King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>

<p>&quot;You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.&quot; - James 2:19</p>

<p>&quot;If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.” - Romans 10:9‭-‬11</p>
