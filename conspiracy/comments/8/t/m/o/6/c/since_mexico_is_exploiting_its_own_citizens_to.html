The Mexican government is totally corrupted.  They do nothing for their own citizens &amp; the citizens would rather be American.  So lets make it the next state but send the military in first to clean it up.  Would be dumb as fuck to let them be a state without first imprisoning those that have caused millions to seek asylum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fuck are you on about? The land we &quot;took&quot; was gained because Texas fought for independence. Texas was filled with mexican and Americans that both came together to claim independance from Mexico and Texas or the Lone Star State was annexed to America because Texas agreed.</p>

<p>My ancestors are natively from America so i dont know about you but im far from immigrant.</p>

<p>Ya i know about that. Thats old. This is why illegal immigration will never work. The millions that come here are the millions that cpuld have stayed and made their country better but figured its better to work as slaves in America where theyre abused and neglected then deported. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m not sure a wall would be effective, desperate ppl can be very resourceful.  Maybe some military budget should be used to fund it. I think Trump thought he could strong arm Mexico to pay for it by holding immigrant’s $ from being sent back to their country. </p>

<p>But also, incoherent immigration policies are a big problem.  Having an underclass of exploitable workers with no rights seems to be tolerated bec it makes bigger profits.  Why are employers, the real enablers, not held accountable?  </p>
