        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, if you look at China, they have 100’s of millions of CCTV cameras everywhere to constantly spy on all of their citizens. So their citizens know they’re constantly being watched.</p>

<p>Well, obviously here in the United States it’s the same way, accept instead of having the cameras placed all around us, we walk around with them all day. And they even have microphones too. </p>

<p>Whether it’s corporations or the government, we are probably constantly being spied on or listened in by some entity. They’ve out done China when it comes to mass surveillance because most people don’t realize that they’re carrying around their personal surveyor on them. Totally blows my mind. </p>

They don’t care if your opinion is right or wrong just as long as you give one about yourself. All of these comments that we leave everywhere aren’t useless. I’m sure they collect it all somewhere. I’m just not quite as worried yet because I know they don’t have the means yet to sift through all the data that’s produced every second. Or maybe they do?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>5G operates at 60GHz. 60GHz is close to the frequency of microwave ovens. 60Ghz is also the resonant frequency of O2.</p>

<p>the theory is that, since 5G networks have short range and practically no through-put, there will be 5G transmitters on every streetlight pole. due to the plethora of 60GHz transmitters, it will effectively irradiate the oxygen molecules in the lower atmosphere, which will lead to pulmonary disease and also could possibly affect the hemoglobin in red blood cells. the radiation could also affect the reproductive eggs in females.</p>

<p>Robert Fullerton has tons of videos about it. here&#39;s one: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i0qugOdCtBc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=i0qugOdCtBc</a></p>

<p>personally i don&#39;t know where i stand on it. i haven&#39;t seen enough compelling info to make a stance for or against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is the exact reason why some of the US&#39;s early politicians tried to make it a law to re-write the constitution &amp; the bill of rights every 100 years. so it could stay up-to-date with the current concerns of the citizens.</p>

<p>in retrospect though, if that law was actually passed, it would be the corporate oligarchy, not the citizens, writing the constitution. in that regard, i am thankful that that hasn&#39;t happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we are being watched at nearly all hours of the day, and in many cases through our own choice, but I dont think its really much of a threat to the common person, so it isnt an issue right now. It can be abused by the wrong people at some point, but as of now its just not a big deal. What has to be remembered is that even with as far as AI has come, surveillance still has to be interpreted by humans. And there are limited people to apply this scrutiny at all times. </p>

<p>Not only does it not bother me, but I&#39;ll go a step further and play devil&#39;s advocate and argue how its actually perhaps a good thing.</p>

<p>This is probably going to sound like bootlicking and get mass downvoted, but I for one am kind of glad in a way, that there is a multitude of information given up freely by people, in case they decide to do something really stupid. There is an increasing deficit of rational behavior in America today, and even with the clear threat of surveillance, individual people are still engaging in ever more ignorant and even downright egregious malicious predatory shit. Elements of the public have proven that they need to be watched at all times like children. You would think the fact you can be seen on camera would deter certain behavior, but it doesnt even phase them, and just because you are caught on camera, doesnt mean you are caught. They still have to identify you. They still have to find you.</p>

<p>A good example that captures both of these concepts was a murder that happened in fort lauderdale back in march.</p>

<p>There was a wealthy man in his 40&#39;s who had a nice vacation condo down there. He was down there alone. He went and courted 3 young attractive colombian ladies (most likely hookers) and brought them back to his room in his bentley at about 3am. At 6 am one of the ladies went down to the lobby, and intentionally left his room door opened, so two men could run into the room and cowardly rob and murder this man. Classic setup.</p>

<p>All of this was caught on chrystal clear HD surveillance cameras, from the victim walking down the street with these ladies, to them all in the elevator, to them walking down the hall to his room. It also showed the two men running into the room, and then all five of them fleeing after the shooting, with one of the ladies laughing and smiling as she ran.  All of their faces were very clearly visible and were plastered all over the local news.</p>

<p>Even with clear closeups of their faces plastered on the news, police still had NO IDEA who any of these people were for several months. People think there are these super advanced facial recognition databases, and there are, but they dont have everyones image uploaded. A human still has to interact with the software to put the information in, and in most cases interpret it as well. (btw, China is much further along than we are. They have actually recently used this technology to catch wanted suspects who came to a very popular concert.)</p>

<p>Well it turns out, one of the male suspects fancied himself as a singer, and had a moderate presence on youtube. Police eventually stumbled on this, and FINALLY after 3 months, they had a name for the shooter. They were able to then, through facebook, trace him to 3 of the other suspects and 4 of the 5 were positively identified. They still havent determined who the 5th woman was, the woman who actually left the door opened and laughed callously after the man was killed and she ran down the hallway with the others. Even after identifying these people, they STILL havent been caught, although they are being seen on yet more surveillance cameras apparently as far away as texas and california.</p>

<p>If you ask me, this is a good thing. I&#39;m glad that this wannabe youtube star&#39;s narcissism led to him being identified after cowardly and brazenly taking a man&#39;s life. </p>

<p>Surveillance isnt necessarily bad. It can work to your advantage too. If someone tragically kills your girlfriend, and police want to blame you because her parents heard you two arguing, you can show them your location history on facebook or your image on cctv at the car wash. It reduces the chances of people being framed. Dashcams and bodycams lead to just a little bit more restraint and transparency on the part of police. </p>

<p>I get captured on the cctv camera in my apartment complex parking garage everyday. It doesnt bother me. Im not smashing peoples windows in to take their Ipods. People were doing that, so they put up cameras. I have no problem with that. In fact I&#39;m happy they are there.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also on the camera at the grocery store. When I use the self checkout at walmart, there is a closeup of my face displayed for me to see. Who cares? I just dont see the threat.</p>

<p>It basically comes down to the fact if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to worry about. I like to smoke weed. I live in a non legal state. Here I am freely admitting this over the internet. Are the police going to track my IP and use a lot of time and resources to come kick in my door and arrest me for a misdemeanor? Not likely. Are they going to link my IP to my cars plate number, and use my gps to locate me and hit my car with an electro-magnetic pulse causing me to crash into a ball of fire while some evil genius in a control room laughs and says &quot;one less pothead conspircay theorist&quot;?</p>

<p>They dont care that you smoke weed, visit 9/11 truth sites, watch some lesbian porn from time to time. I hope I ended up on a watchlist sometimes, and that they are following my every move because it would be an enormously boring massive waste of their time. &quot;what do we got on this guy today captain? Well he went to his job again, the he went walk his dog and smoke a joint in the woods again, then he went to the gym again, then he went to publix again, then he drove into the city again, and theres a hand to hand exhange of money for pot, again, then he went to his girlfriends for some netfix and chill, again, then he went to bed. -Great we&#39;re getting there, keep an eye on this one- he&#39;ll slip up soon!&quot; I just find the whole thing kind of laughable personally.</p>

<p>I dont use the facebook location picture feature, but even if I did, oh they know where I like to vacation or that I visit my cousin in Ohio- big fuckin deal.</p>

<p>Even the corporate marketing profiling from facebook doesnt bother me. Its nothing personal. I&#39;m just a random number that is fed ads through an algorhythm. They do it, because it works and it makes them money- tons of people click through and buy their shit. Oh he likes reggae, lets send him this link on this reggae cruise, or this negril vacation package. Big deal. No one is holding a gun to my head forcing me to buy their shit, or to respond to their ads. But it turns out, most people do, so they continue to do it. If it harms your delicate sensibilities that much, use adblocker and dont click through.</p>

<p>And I know this is a conspiracy site, and these are very unpopular opinions here. I probably sound like a surveillance shill. Most of you will probably argue its the sheer principle and we have a right to privacy. But unfortunately people have abused that right and used it to do nefarious shit behind the scenes. If you are dealing in child porn, I&#39;m glad you got caught. If you have a manifesto to kill innocent people for no reason and are looking up bomb making instructions, Im glad you got caught. If you have a trunk full of meth or 1000 fentanyl laced xanex pills, Im glad you got caught.</p>

<p>This isnt the old east germany or soviet russia. You cant be killed for opinions or critical thinking. The government isnt going to target you unless you are a genuine threat. Dont get me wrong, journalists and people with mass influence are targeted and sometimes even killed, and thats wrong. But you dont end up on some secret list for your reddit posts, I assure you.</p>

<p>Addressing the narcissism angle again, I personally think thats where a lot of the paranoia derives from. People watch the borne supremacy or enemy of the state or james bond and fantasize they are involved in high level espionage and are riding around with a briefcase full of state secrets because they made a controversial reddit post. &quot;He&#39;s connecting the dots, he&#39;s getting too close to the truth, we gotta take him out.&quot; I assure you, you arent that important.</p>

<p>The NSA has to keep track of more people than they ever have before, and they like to portray the idea of iron fist control, but they couldnt lock 350 million people down if they wanted to, and they dont. The main way they control is through commerce and money- thats by far the MOST important factor and is becoming more so every day, and they arent going to stifle freedom to the point that they compromise that. It all relies on the free movement of goods and services. You are just a face in the crowd, and as controversial and potentially damaging as your opinions might be, they arent going to truly target you just for that.</p>

<p>And if you do get truly targeted, odds are you are doing something where you deserve to be caught, or you hacked into a bank or compromised someones revenue stream. The vast majority of the surveillance in the US is private and that exists for one reason- to protect their money. They dont give a fuck about you as a person unless you fuck with their money.</p>

<p>If you make your living through criminal enterprise, you better be damn good at it, and if your dumb enough to leave a social media trial when you make a living through illicit activities I cant help but to only laugh if that is your downfall.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something, and I would love to hear some compelling arguments to the contrary. I understand the slippery slope concept, and the potential for abuse, and the constitutional implications, but as far I&#39;m concerned, as an average person, I have no fear of surveillance and will laugh and smile at the cameras when I see them, because personally, I feel I have nothing to hide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why I downvote you.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>History teaches us that governments, corporations, and institutions in general do NOT have the best interests of people or the planet at heart, even if most people within them do/are good.  Here you assume that mostly benevolent activities will take place while assuming abuse of such powers won&#39;t happen to you or people like you.  That&#39;s a dangerous assumption.</p></li>
<li><p>Freedom to do as we please without the consent of the always watching eyes means there WILL be opportunity for the malevolent among us to do harm.  That first part is more important, mind you, since authorities historically overreach in their efforts to control what is and is not acceptable behavior.  For instance, protests.  No authority/institution wants to be protested, but we&#39;ve seen ample valid reasons for protest throughout the last 50-60 years and the authorities have responded in a forceful and often tragic manner.  </p></li>
<li><p>Your comments on you being &quot;average person&quot; vs others making a living through criminal enterprise are deeply concerning to me.  How have you learned nothing about the tendency for criminal activity to flourish within power centers and institutions?  How have you learned nothing about lawful &quot;average persons&quot; simply exercising their rights only to see their freedoms eliminated by an overreaching oppressive authority?  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>TL:DR, 1984 wasn&#39;t an instruction manual, and you seem to be arguing that that kind of dystopia isn&#39;t dystopian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this is the exact reason why some of the US&#39;s early politicians tried to make it a law to re-write the constitution &amp; the bill of rights every 100 years. so it could stay up-to-date with the current concerns of the citizens.</p>

<p>in retrospect though, if that law was actually passed, it would be the corporate oligarchy, not the citizens, writing the constitution. in that regard, i am thankful that that hasn&#39;t happened.</p>
