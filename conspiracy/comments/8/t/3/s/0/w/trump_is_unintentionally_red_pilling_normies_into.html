       Nothing new is happening under Trump that hasn't happened under any other President. They're beholden to the same interests and act as figureheads or spokesmen for international corporations and the military-industrial complex. He's filling his cabinet with swamp people, making backwards deals/legislation for the super-wealthy that hurt the lower/middle classes, he's working with foreign actors to strengthen his own gains for power, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mega-loathe Trump but this may actually be a good thing because the widespread view of how corrupt everything is can awaken people from their indifferent slumber. The only problem left is people assuming it's Republicans vs. Democrats. Still is two wings of the same bird with the same agenda; staying in power, making money.

       I've seen this argument a lot, "he's so ignorant and corrupt the veil is being lifted." My problem is that real people are already being hurt by his policies and that's a tough pill to swallow/locate silver linings. Making the best of a bad situation is always a good idea though.

       REAL people have always been hurt by the policies in place. show me a govt head that hasnt caused mortal harm. the difference with trump, (not a fan) is that this time, the atrocities that have happened for decades on our soil are being shed light upon. if the trump administration is enacting legislation openly that was written into law by the obama administration, what was the obama administration doing? and seeing as how the laws were supposed to be a reform of the "broken system," wtf were the bushes and the clintons pulling beforehand?

       the world thinks that all the worlds sexual deviancy sticks to countries where it is allowed. pattaya. berlin. just pick a random 'no reservations' episode... probably there... and yet, who can afford to travel to these places? (people on company cards, and the affluent.)

       I think he is doing it very intentionally. He knows that the Jewish Press is full of lies, and has even called them the greatest enemy of the American people, for example.

       It will only be successful if real emoluments laws are passed that force politicians to divest or move to blind trusts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only if it dismantles citizens united and gets rid of campaign finance laws as they currently are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only if politicians are not allowed to run or sit on non profits (or family members) to funnel bribes ‘legally’ i.e. just declaring and reporting payments is not enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only if insider trading is outlawed for politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only if nepotism laws are enforced.
      </p>

       I am sure there are many more requirements...

       I am not against it mostly because it’s almost required to understand complex legislation but the separation between lobbying groups and politicians must be permanent. For that matter outsourcing ‘law’ generation should be more controlled.

       Im not saying im a trump supporter or i like the guy but this sub overlooks the fact that he indeed is red pilling citizens to things they would not have payed attention to or noticed in the past. I wont go so far as to saying he's playing 4D chess but almost everything he does seems to be undoing the work TPTB have had set up.
I think people chose to overlook them or say its coincidence because they want to hate him, because he says arrogant remarks or things people want to cry rascist. This society is soft now anything they dont like they try to remove or find faults with.

       If you dare to claim that he might be doing it intentionally, you will get attacked and downvoted by our relatively new members of this sub. But it seems obvious to me that he is doing this intentionally, and that is why TPTB hate him so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were TPTB, I would have shills come onto subs like this to try to make sure nobody ever says anything nice about Trump, and to keep people divided as much as possible.

       Personally, I just think that propaganda is very effective. These people don't want to believe that their thoughts and opinions are the byproduct of propaganda in the mainstream media, but that is what it is. I was that way once, too, so I realize how potent it can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you control the press, you can control what a huge portion of the population thinks and believes, and you can manipulate them to serve your interests. I think that is exactly what has been happening for a long time now, and it is probably the biggest flaw in Democracy.

       I don’t really care what your position is on any of them. I’m not here to argue about them. I’m here to point out, that these are all regular r/conspiracy topics and now we have a president that has “normalized” them.

       I would agree with everything you said, except that there have been A LOT more human trafficking/sex trafficking arrests under Trump so far than I think Obama's 8 years.  Don't quote me on that, at the very least, it's on pace to beat that figure by many times the # as under Obama.

       Here's a blog showing how it's actually not the case, but if you google "human trafficking busts" and add them up together from 2017 and 2018, they add up to more than 2000 under Obama.  I'm sure you could find other articles.  Just do the math.

       So... your "source" is an article that proves your claim wrong, and a suggestion to google and add up Trump and Obama's arrests?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, you could have just said "I don't have a source because this claim is BS" and saved us both time.

       Yes, I knowingly posted a source that claims my claim is incorrect.  Because a)I'm too lazy to go off finding a proper source, and b)that's how confident I am in this claim, that I even gave you a link debunking it.  lol.  Weird I know.

       Alright, I found a pretty well sourced document.  So we take the 2000 for Obama that was verified with the last article I sent you from the Department of Homeland Security.  Here's the arrests in 2017 and 2018.  Each incident has it's proper sourcing (via the web addresses).  Most recentl Operation Broken Heart, which arrested 2300 people already beats Obama's 2000 figure as reported by DHS.

       Didn't mean to pull the Trump supporters out of their hole. This is an anti-Trump post. There's nothing good about this presidency so far except his killing of the trade agreement when he first entered office and his negotiations with NK.
