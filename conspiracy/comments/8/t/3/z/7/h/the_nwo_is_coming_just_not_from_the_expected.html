        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, here’s a conspiracy theory for you:</p>

<p>Trump is a plant by the global oligarchy to push the US into ceding power to the UN and allow the rise of the long-anticipated New World Order. Trump has been a long time friend of the powers that be, but he’s also desperate to be a true power broker – he wants the Trump family to be a dynastic group like the Rockefellers, or the Rothschilds. His current aims are twofold – enrich his own companies, and those of his associates, as greatly as possible with the levers of power available to him as POTUS – and to create enough social strife in the US to make a majority of citizens so fearful and angry that they willingly accept the UN coming in as a savior from the rise of fascism. If the US government is guilty of human rights abuses, obviously the International Criminal Court needs to step in, and the US military is far too great a power to have in the hands of a “madman”. The arguments for enlisting a “sane” UN leadership to help guide the US back into being a good global citizen just fall into place, and will be argued for by a plethora of otherwise totally reasonable US citizens.</p>

<p>In fact, Trump may actually be planning to sacrifice himself in a trial to ensure that the transition can happen, and that his children are set up as true power brokers. The fact that he had his doctor fabricate his health records, and that according to White House staffers, he spends a ton of time “watching TV” in the residence may actually indicate that he has an illness of some sort. If he’s terminally ill (maybe with a few years left?) he could be planning on taking the responsibility onto himself, and ensuring that his family can be well positioned in the globalist regime.</p>

<p>It would explain a lot of the administration’s actions, and why Trump went from “super cozy with the Neolibs” to “hated outsider” just in time for his presidential run.</p>

<p>This one actually really worries me - I was having a really hard time understanding why administration officials (and Melania) would be doing things that are so likely to outrage so many people, and then this idea occurred to me and I got a chill. What if we were wrong the whole time about Trump&#39;s goals? If he&#39;s working with the global elite (Bilgerbergers, Bohemian Club) to undermine the US government in favor of the NWO, we&#39;re really fucked.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, I enjoyed the read. If there were any evidence of this being the case (which there very well could be), I would believe it. Personally, I don&#39;t see Trump being the sacrificial lamb for the NWO, all evidence supports him being very egotistical (ostensibly)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See - I&#39;d bet that might be a backup plan. It looks to me like there&#39;s been a slow escalation of human rights issues that are floated in each presidency to see if the US population will get outraged.</p>

<ul>
<li>Abu Ghraib</li>
<li>Extraordinary  Rendition</li>
<li>Invading Iraq</li>
<li>Drone Strikes</li>
<li>Guantanamo</li>
<li>Torture of enemy combatants</li>
<li>Child Separation for immigrant criminals</li>
<li>Leaving the Human Rights Council</li>
<li>Immigrant Concentration Camps</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the goal would be to find the minimum bar that would make the general US population feel justified in going to the UN for help.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that all of our presidents for about the last 70 years have been NWO plants.</p>

<p>JFK was one of the last to stand up to the international banking cartels. He wanted to get rid of the federal reserve and wanted the US treasury department to start printing money again. This is part of the reason he was killed.</p>

I&#39;m not excusing Trump, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s a really old problem.  Before we really understood what we were doing with industrial wastes the disposal process was usually something akin to, &quot;just dump it out in the back 40 &#39;cuz no-one goes back there anyway&quot;- most of our bases are toxic because of it.  Travis AFB in California is a super find clean up site.  I haven&#39;t consumed water from the water system on any base in a long, long time because of this- and I advocate the same to my military friends.  Water service for the family and bottled water is the way to go where military bases are concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is nonsense.  Now the NWO is certainly out there, but they are the ones working really hard to get rid of Trump.  I think your idea is not correct because Trump was such an unlikely winner in the election.  No one would have picked him for such a task.  The other thing is that you might be someone&#39;s puppet, but if you are, you are not going to do the work with the passion that Trump shows.  Obama -- kind of laid back and disengaged -- now he would be a more credible pick from the NWO.  Trump is his own guy.  He is on the outside now because no one expect him to run for President and win.  He was not a NWO guy when he challenged Obama on the birth certificate.  There are too many things you can point to that do not make sense if Trump is NWO.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I do not think that is obvious at all. What international power brokers helped him?  If international agencies were wanting to control the US Presidency, they would have chosen a far more likely winner -- like Hillary Clinton (oops.)
Trump has recently put in a 25+hour day.  He has amazing energy for someone who is 70+.  That was obvious in the campaign.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is a malignant narcissist. He is literally a hollow shell that is fueled by narcissistic supply in pursuit of having his grandiose false self reflected back to him. Since that is the case, manipulating him is very easy. Flattery is one way, especially if you are a dictator because that&#39;s who Trump respects. He looks up to them like Father figures. He thinks anyone who isn&#39;t dictator-like, is weak and stupid. Which is why he doesn&#39;t like Canada and Europe and they have become our enemies now while our former enemies have become our allies. All of the elites, the wealthy, the secret societies, the Deep State, they are just pawns that were used to set up all the laws and the globalization of the world. They are also the recognized enemy of the people aware of the NWO plot and they have used their awareness of them against them. Q has people convinced Trump is the great hero taking down the evil deep state. This is just pro wrestling to bring about the next stage of the plan. Hegelian dialectic manipulation of political events. This has all been set up so Trump can take it over in one fell swoop. Can you believe that Christians think this man is sent from God? He is literally the Antichrist in the sense that he is everything Jesus stood against. Trump is actually the manifestation of their real beliefs. Evangelicals don&#39;t really believe in Jesus, that&#39;s all just a projection to hide their own inner hatred and ugliness. They&#39;re raging hypocrites pointing their fingers at everyone but themselves. If they actually read their Bibles, they&#39;d know that Jesus said to not listen to anyone who claims that the Messiah has come because there will be many false Messiahs and prophets in the end times. What the Bible does say though, in regards to the coming of the Man of Lawlessness, the Man Doomed to Destruction, is that those who refuse to love the truth, God will send them a strong delusion so they will believe the lie because they have delighted in wickedness.</p>

<p>Trump has been groomed for this for decades and he was set up to be against Obama. If you look back at his earlier tweets, he actually praises Obama and then someone gave him the information about Obama not being born in America. He first talked about this at a conservative event that he was asked to speak at. After the event, he talked about how amazing the response of the crowd was. The narcissistic supply he got from that, he got addicted to and being the leader of the birthers became his new thing. This set him up to be against Obama and allowed the people who have a pathological hate for Obama (future delusional Trump supporters) to psychologically attach themselves to him long before he ever ran for President. Then they put a pseudo fake Reagan costume on him that checked off every single box of beliefs that a certain type of conservative has (mostly the Fox News watching type). They made him seem like an outsider even though he&#39;s been friends with the Clintons for decades, to even further psychologically attach conservatives to him.</p>

<p>Trump is just a slave to his grandiose false self and he has to obtain narcissistic supply to fuel it. If you know how to manipulate that, you can get him to do whatever you want. His supporters are literally what is fueling him. If they stop cheering him and coming to his events, he would literally change all of his beliefs in order to get that back. Why do you think he constantly talks about the size of his crowds and his ratings? Without that reaction, he has no idea who he is, he doesn&#39;t even exist.</p>

<p>Draining the Swamp was given to him to psychologically attach people to the NESARA act that the aliens/spiritual beings will suggest after the fake invasion that happens after the space military is implemented and we have a global financial collapse. To implement NESARA, they will require everyone to get their DNA injected with block chain that will hold all of our information and verify all of our transactions. Trump&#39;s White House is already talking about getting rid of social security numbers due to the Equifax hack and they&#39;ve been discussing ways to replace it. One of those that&#39;s been talked about is blockchain but the problem they&#39;re having is where do they store the information so that a person can&#39;t lose it and it isn&#39;t hacked?</p>

<p>This is an Israeli company that is figuring out a way to inject blockchain into DNA. This article is from 2014.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama is a narcissist, he&#39;s just a covert one. And I think he might be the back up plan. He&#39;s being set up as the hero who will rescue us from Trump. Trump will undoubtedly incite all of his supporters to violence once his Presidency is legitimately threatened from the Mueller investigation or he might do it if the midterms don&#39;t go his way. He&#39;ll claim election rigging or something. What happens next will largely depend on how much the military and police support him but with all the immigrants they are keeping in camps, they are doing that on purpose so there is maximum chaos when the shit hits the fan. An extra 100,000 or so non-white people so the racial aspect ramps up the violence. Cue our power grid and internet being cut off and martial law will be implemented for sure. Whoever emerges the leader after the dust has settled from all of this, they will have complete control of America and it will be willingly given to them by the citizens who are left. If it isn&#39;t Trump, I&#39;m guessing people will be clamoring for Obama to take a 3rd term. At that point, everything associated with Trump will be demonized. Conservatism and the Republican party might as well be dead, Christianity will probably be hated because of all the nut bags that believed Trump was from God. Everyone will willingly give up their guns because the 2nd amendment was the only reason the Trump supporters were able to cause that much chaos to begin with. Plus, the tide was already shifting due to using the kids from the Parkland shooting as anti-gun spokespeople. In comes hate speech laws, open borders, facial recognition software for all police, more control over the internet due to the &quot;hack&quot; of our power grid and systems, a larger nanny state due to influx of immigrants leading to the global financial collapse.</p>

<p>Oh btw, the fact that you really think we have peace with North Korea means you&#39;re delusional as fuck. Trump doesn&#39;t even agree with his own bullshit anymore. You should catch up on what your daddy&#39;s current thoughts are so you know what lie to repeat next.</p>
