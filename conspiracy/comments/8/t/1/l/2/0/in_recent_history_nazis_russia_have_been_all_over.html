       This is why US citizens have no moral obligation to help immigrants from these countries.  They need to take their countries back from the crooked politicians.  Tell the US government to fuck off as well instead of begging for its help &amp; intervention in your countries problems.

       Also bullshit argument.  If a drug addict wont stop making bad choices despite me reccomending they make some lifestyle changes i have no moral obligation to help them financially.  I recommend these people take their country back.  If they do not want to do that it is their problem.

       If someone wants to end there life you could argue that it may be the most compassionate option &amp; its morally irresponsible not to help them do it.  Sometimes prolonging life is forcing that person to have a more painful death.  I’ll bet you are pro-abortion as well &amp; dont consider that ending life?

       Don't change the subject.  There's a difference between suicide and euthanasia.  I just hope nobody close to you commits suicide, because it's a really shit thing to go through. And we all know now that you'd just stand by and cheer them on.

       There is no moral obligation for anyone to help someone that wishes to end their own life.  It’s absurd to suggest otherwise.  Abortion, suicide, euthanasia all has the same end result.

       Suicide is a person choosing to take they their own life.  It’s not the same thing as me murdering someone.  I have a moral obligation not to murder.  I do not have a moral obligation to prevent someone from killing themselves.  Why are you pretending i have a moral obligation to help someone that wants to kill themselves?  Just admit you used a terrible example here.

       Do you know anything about sociopaths? Now I'm not calling you one or trying to be a dick im just trying to see what you think about this subject. A significant percentage of the population are sociopaths who for the most part live normal lives. Sociopaths are not psychopaths. Sheen people hear the term sociopath they automatically assume that person is evil. It's not so.

       Is someone a sociopath because they feel they have no moral obligation to help someone who wishes to end their own life?  I’m more interested in why people think that could possibly make someone a sociopath?  We are debating morals here.  We dont all live by the same moral code.  I dont hope &amp; pray for bad things to happen i acknowledge that bad things will happen regardless.  Sometimes when people think they are doing what is right they make bigger problems.

       Nice fallacy buddy. But I'll still try to explain it to you.. just because other countries do something doesn't mean that other countries who also do it are completely innocent. The United states has fucked Latin America up so much and in so many different ways that it's no wonder they are still having a hard time recovering. There are tons of books and docs out about all the bullshit we pulled too if your ever curious about it. Like how we fucked El Salvador.. or how we fucked Honduras.. or how we fucked Venezuela.. this list of countries that we've royally fucked in more ways than one goes on and on.

       Back in ‘65 the US (military) invaded the country I was born in to overthrow the democratically elected president because they perceived him to be sympathetic to “communists”. His winning the election came after a 30 year dictatorship by a US puppet and his cronies. They then installed one of the dictator’s apprentices who ruled for 12 years with an iron fist of murder, fear and control, same as his teacher before him. Secret police “disappearing” people in the middle of the night,  torture, fear of assembly, neighbors ratting on each other journalists violently killed for publishing articles critical of the rulers. This happened time and time again in Latin American countries. It still happens today, only now it’s in the Middle East.

       Russia is also in the middle east meddling.  Many latin american countries were russian puppets in the 60’s.

       Why don't any of these nations and their people step up to their own responsibility for their countries being in such exploitable chaos all of the time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have outside nations enabled bad actors?  Of course.  It has always been that way.  It's true even in the United States.

      <p>
       However, those bad actors don't spontaneously materialize.

       If someone wants to end there life you could argue that it may be the most compassionate option &amp; its morally irresponsible not to help them do it.  Sometimes prolonging life is forcing that person to have a more painful death.  I’ll bet you are pro-abortion as well &amp; dont consider that ending life?

       There is no moral obligation for anyone to help someone that wishes to end their own life.  It’s absurd to suggest otherwise.  Abortion, suicide, euthanasia all has the same end result.
