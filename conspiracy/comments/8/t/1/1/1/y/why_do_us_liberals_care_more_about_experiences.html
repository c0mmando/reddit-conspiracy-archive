       virtue signaling. deport some and make the repubs happy. Let the rest in secretly by having lax border security, call the children "Dreamers" and make sure the Dem controlled cities are "Sanctuary cities" that fund and take care of all the future Dem voters

       Cause numerous indictments mean nothing. All the intel agencies and US departments have admitted Russia had meddled in the election to the benefit of Trump.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Also Mattis said that DPRK hasn't done anything to dismantle its weapons program. Also Trump has kept lying about the success of the DPRK issue, so far all we've done is give them concessions for nothing.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And Trump confirmed that he had stormy daniels paid off and it is established that he definitely fucked her. How has none of this been working.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also that "democrats need illegals for votes" has never been proven and is consistently been debunked. What evidence shows any illegals voted in the 2016 election?

       Well, Mueller is executing the scope of his investigation. Regardless his investigation continues to uncover more and more threads connecting dozens of high level Trump campaign officials to Russian Oligarchs or the Russian state.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think about the infamous Trump Tower meeting between Jr. and that Russian lawyer who has been confirmed to have been acting as a representative for the Russian Federation?
Is it not damning that the President's own son responded to an email explaining that the Russian State would provide dirt on Hillary with "If its what you say it is I love it!"

       Uh-huh ok. Why did the President need to dictate a response for Jr. then after new of this broke and why did he lie about it. Why did he and does he keep saying his campaign never had any Russian contacts when in reality they had dozens of contacts with Russian officials during the campaign.

       No I don't. There are many evident links of massive corruption and coordination between Russian Oligarchs and Vlad's government. Why should those be ignored? Shitbirds of a feather flock together.

       It was coming from DJT Jrs business partners and friends. They had a relationship (Miss Universe) before this meeting. They were included because Comey and Lynch knew he wouldn’t take the meeting with just a FBI lawyer plant.

       Both "Russian meetings" were Shadow Gov Setups. Roger Stone even admitted that he new it was Feds playing games so he turned down the Greenburg meeting, and Mueller won't question either of the informants.

       Because they understand that most Americans are too busy with their actual lives to fact check them on this shit, and outrage is easy to capitalize on for political points. 
I see it as either they know they are lying and don't care about their dishonesty because they feel the ends justify their means, or they have swum in the smell of their own shit so long they don't know it for what it is anymore.

       If you really want to go there, the US is responsible for the vast majority. Aside from wars for oil look at those from central and South America, where we've been supporting oppressive regimes when we haven't been aiding the creation and spread of cartels via the CIA (this is well documented). But I guess we can forget about all that cause MAGA Build the Wall OUT OUT OUT

       Sure less illegal immigrants could help, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem with crime that's obvious to any educated person: economic inequality.  What actually will solve  is not trying trickle-down economics for the 10th time and actually taxing businesses &amp; top earners, you know like very single country that's kicking our ass in quality of life and crime rates does?

       It does nothing of the sort, and in fact in supports the argument:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As 
noted in the 
demographic

profile 
summary, counties 
experiencing 
demographic, social, 
and 
economic 
decline 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be found 
in 
Central 
Appalachia 
and 
are 
also more 
likely 
to 
be 
rural 
and not 
adjacent 
to 
metropolitan 
areas. 
These same counties 
are also experiencing the largest percentage increases 
in both violent 
and 
property crime. 
Thus, 
there 
does 
appear 
to be 
a strong link between social

economic decline 
and growing crime 
rates, 
especially 
for 
violent 
crime.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While crime 
in 
Appalachia is low compared 
to 
national 
averages (see 
Exhibit 
l), 
part

this is 
due

Crime

       Poor black urban areas are going to have higher rates of crime than poor rural areas, either white or black.

       "But we can get even more specific about the impact of the 1981 cut in rates. A Treasury Department study on the impact of tax bills since 1940, first released in 2006 and later updated, found that the 1981 tax cut reduced revenues by $208 billion in its first four years. (These figures are rendered in constant 2012 dollars.) The tax reform act of 1986, which was designed to be revenue neutral, reduced revenues by less than $1 billion four years after enactment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Reagan’s tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987 boosted revenue by $137 billion. Overall, that’s a revenue loss from Reagan’s various tax bills, but it also shows that Moore is crediting to Reagan’s tax cuts revenues generated by Reagan’s tax increases."

       Oh, spare us the holy rolling.  I hate when people try to exploit a religion that they don't follow, or even understand, to try to shame people into giving them what they want.

       Here,  from Romans, since you've clearly never actually cracked a bible:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        13 Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.
       </p>
       <p>
        2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended.
       </p>
       <p>
        4 For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
       </p>
       <p>
        5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.
       </p>

        Justice being taken away, then, what are kingdoms but great robberies? For what are robberies themselves, but little kingdoms? The band itself is made up of men; it is ruled by the authority of a prince, it is knit together by the pact of the confederacy; the booty is divided by the law agreed on. If, by the admittance of abandoned men, this evil increases to such a degree that it holds places, fixes abodes, takes possession of cities, and subdues peoples, it assumes the more plainly the name of a kingdom, because the reality is now manifestly conferred on it, not by the removal of covetousness, but by the addition of impunity. Indeed, that was an apt and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who had been seized. For when that king had asked the man what he meant by keeping hostile possession of the sea, he answered with bold pride, “What thou meanest by seizing the whole earth; but because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who doest it with a great fleet art styled an emperor.”

       Well actually it is not, and this understanding is a fairly late newcomer to the scene, and is usually subscribed to by fundamentalist Protestants.

       Here, let's repeat these texts again.  When you find an actual scripture that refutes these and lays out requirement that Christians enable lawlessness,  let me know.

        Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.

        2 Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.

       The Bible is an anthology of literature.  It is literally a library of works.  It contains plenty of false and the odios, and it should be obviously rejected.

       Let us actually articulate what the problem is.  The adherents of divine command theory of ethics have injunctions where foreigners are not to be abused, and taken care of.   That is a fact.  Therefore there is a moral responsibility towards non-citizens, which the OP denied.  You do not dispute this fact.  Rather, you wanted to re-frame it, as an obedience to authority, thereby justifying wretched treatment of immigrants on a basis that they violate governmental authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       You privileged  an alleged writing of Paul over the injunction in the Gospels and the numerous other places in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it was pointed out to you, that Christianity has a long tradition, of being critical of legalism you espouse, you double down on the Paul passage.

      <p>
       Well, it actually served a twofold purpose.  The first was for you to notice the actual name, and see it framed in a positive way, and the second for you to pay attention to the scholars who argued about the fact that it was Jesus Barabbas, and that actually this is a story about Jesus Christ.  Who scholars view as a leader of an insurrection against the Romans...you know the governmental authority back in the day.  There is no embarrassment on my part.

       Second of all it is not a 'Gish-Gallop', named after a fundamentalist like yourself, it consist of given many arguments in a timed setting which are often wrong.

       Of course it does nothing of the kind, especially the Old Testament which if filled with rulers providing injunctions which are constantly violated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or when Peter and the apostles explicitly said not to do that.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, 28 saying, “We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.” 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men.

       Except it is exactly what Paul is doing here, as he is undermining not only religious law, but also law of institutions, which in the Jewish faith was one the same.   You are familiar with the halakha?

       Paul is advocating lawlessness in a literal sense.  What do you think is the consequence of this in a territory ruled by Jewish law?

       That is only what you are told.  Treatment of immigrants is a human rights issue.  I am a liberal and Democrat and I am strongly opposed to the illegal immigrant labor.  I think the employers should be penalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you ever  hear Republicans talking about sanctions against the companies who use large numbers of illegal immigrant workers and the legal H1 and H2 B workers?  They keep increasing the numbers of visa workers and never propose anything to stop the hiring of illegal immigrants.

       Most people only care about what the MSM tell them to care about.  Headlines are all they read.  They get most of their info from titles on frontpages of reddit or facebook feeds or twitter retweets.  They have no knowledge of the real world outside their homogeneous neighbourhood and don't deal with the crime, moral degeneracy and destruction of neighbourhoods and towns and cities by illegal immigrants.   The media does not mention crime and the government censors data by lumping Hispanics in with white crime stats.   A quick search of any police wanted list or suspects and youll see entire pages of "white" people that are clearly Hispanics and sometimes even arab/muslims.

       It's similar to black crime stats or gun stats - they don't tell people about them.  20+ people were shot at last week in a drive by in a black city.  No mass shooting or 24/7 news coverage.  No gun control calls.  Chicago has strictest gun laws in America and has thousands of shootings every year.  Not unusual for double digit kill counts on any given day.   No mass media coverage, no questioning gun laws or the violence and destruction of the city as the gangs take over more and more territory.   Literal no go zones at night if you are not in the gang for that area.   Almost all gun crime comes from like 20 counties - all in black dominated cities like Baltimore, Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, etc.  Not a peep.  No one cares because the media didn't tell them to.   But a single white shooter is a week long event.

       Liberals are far more concerned with how virtuous they appear to everyone else.  Social justice is about upvotes and "being on the right side of history", which is whatever the media tells them is right.   They didn't care about the border for the past 20 years, but they were told this week a holocaust was happening and Trump is hitler, so they magically care now.

       Perhaps because murder, in the instances you are referring to, are an individuals behaviour against another particular individual, though still abhorrent. What is going on is collectivist behavior against a certain group, just because they fall into a label of “illegal immigrant.” No human is illegal. A behaviour can be illegal but a human cannot be illegal and treating them as illegal (an inhumanely for that matter) for simply being is disgusting.

       One of your points judges the treatment of people as people individually. The other is a point trying to equate the crimes of anyone from a certain group with the entirety of that group.
The second point is just not one that  anyone who sits down and actually thinks about cause and effect for 10 seconds would ever take seriously. 
Would you like to be judged for everyone who looks like you, thinks like you, comes from where you’re from?

       As the population increases, whether it be by illegals or natural citizens as my 3 sources show, 'more' laws get broken.  So if OP is concerned about 'more' crime, is he also for a 1- or 2-child policy and against for-profit prisons?

       That's the listed tax rates, not the effective tax rate.  Back when our corporate tax was listed at 38%, it turns out

       Keep in mind 'higher taxes on the wealthy' is a part of it.  How we pay for it is increasing taxes, drug decriminalization, public healthcare, and several other things that most conspiracy theorists favor and r/TheDonald subscribers hate

        Literally the only thing that proves is the long tradition (the one you carry on today) of people trying to pick and choose which pieces of the Bible make them feel good while rejecting the pieces that don't.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Bible is an anthology of literature.  It is literally a library of works.  It contains plenty of false and the odios, and it should be obviously rejected.  It also contains many arguments over ethical and philosophical issues.  Some of them are good, some of them are bad.  Only fundamentalists think it is a unified whole... it isn't, nor is is some kind of intellectual virtue to defend it is a unified whole, it isn't.  Moving on.

       Right like:

      <p>
       I really have no interest in discussing how one should approach religion, because it is a non-sequitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let us actually articulate what the problem is.  The adherents of divine command theory of ethics have injunctions where foreigners are not to be abused, and taken care of.   That is a fact.  Therefore there is a moral responsibility towards non-citizens, which the OP denied.  You do not dispute this fact.  Rather, you wanted to re-frame it, as an obedience to authority, thereby justifying wretched treatment of immigrants on a basis that they violate governmental authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       You privileged  an alleged writing of Paul over the injunction in the Gospels and the numerous other places in the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it was pointed out to you, that Christianity has a long tradition, of being critical of legalism you espouse, you double down on the Paul passage.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Posting wiki links about Barabbas is a pretty embarrassing (but not your first example) and blatant example of a gish gallop.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, it actually served a twofold purpose.  The first was for you to notice the actual name, and see it framed in a positive way, and the second for you to pay attention to the scholars who argued about the fact that it was Jesus Barabbas, and that actually this is a story about Jesus Christ.  Who scholars view as a leader of an insurrection against the Romans...you know the governmental authority back in the day.  There is no embarrassment on my part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all it is not a 'Gish-Gallop', named after a fundamentalist like yourself, it consist of given many arguments in a timed setting which are often wrong.  The disadvantage is to the opponent who DOES NOT have time to answer all of them in the time allotted.  Now, I have not given you many arguments, nor is there a formal time limit.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bible, New Testament and Old make clear a Christian's requirement to obey the laws of governing authority.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Of course it does nothing of the kind, especially the Old Testament which if filled with rulers providing injunctions which are constantly violated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or when Peter and the apostles explicitly said not to do that.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, 28 saying, “We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.” 29 But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Acts 5
      </p>
      <p>
       Which of course brings up the point that you ignored. One can find any position reflected in the Bible, and quote it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sure, you can find examples of troublesome authorities, but you will not find "ignore the laws you don't like" anywhere in the good book.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And here is where my good Christian friend commits the trick.  It is not a question of not following laws one does not like, it is a question of not following laws WHICH ARE UNJUST.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the bible provides injunctions to take care of foreigners.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Except it is exactly what Paul is doing here, as he is undermining not only religious law, but also law of institutions, which in the Jewish faith was one the same.   You are familiar with the halakha?

       Paul is advocating lawlessness in a literal sense.  What do you think is the consequence of this in a territory ruled by Jewish law?

       "But we can get even more specific about the impact of the 1981 cut in rates. A Treasury Department study on the impact of tax bills since 1940, first released in 2006 and later updated, found that the 1981 tax cut reduced revenues by $208 billion in its first four years. (These figures are rendered in constant 2012 dollars.) The tax reform act of 1986, which was designed to be revenue neutral, reduced revenues by less than $1 billion four years after enactment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Reagan’s tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1987 boosted revenue by $137 billion. Overall, that’s a revenue loss from Reagan’s various tax bills, but it also shows that Moore is crediting to Reagan’s tax cuts revenues generated by Reagan’s tax increases."

       hmmm... look at that... Trickle down economics not working again.  Hold this L kiddo, stay in school, and enjoy those tax cuts that don't benefit you!
