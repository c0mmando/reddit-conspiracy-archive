    <div class="md"><p>That was all the rage for 50 years, be hired on merit from tests and history, if not experience your scholastic record and a personal references. I have never obtained a job because of an inside friend.</p>

<p>At companies that I worked for, those were generally the poorest performers, hired because of a family or personal relationship and I hated working at companies who enganged in that practice and went job looking as soon as I discovered that was the dynamic.  </p>
