    <div class="md"><p>It is my opinion. I have been banned at other reddit sites for expressing and documenting it. There is physical evidence of nukes on 9/11 from isotopes found in the dust the USGS collected [analyzed at UC Davis], some Russian guy who said he knew about the nukes ahead of time, plus the testimony of a nurse who treated people on 9/11 for nuke related injuries. </p>

<p>Small underground nukes do all of their &#39;flashing&#39; underground, where nobody much will see it and those who do probably would not live to talk about it. The only thing that I have ever seen that looked like the vaporized dust rising from New York after 9/11, was when the Fukushima nuclear power plant melted down and blew up. Look at the pictures carefully and you will see that I am correct. It takes a LOT of energy to turn metal and concrete into nano sized gas, the kind of energy you can only get from nukes, IMO. </p>

<p>I have NO interest in arguing about this. You are under ZERO obligation to agree with me. It is my opinion that this is the MOST covered up aspect of the entire 9/11 event. Which just makes my wonder why? Whose nukes were they, the US or Israel? But like I said, I DON&#39;T want to argue about it. Been there, done that.</p>

<p>He&#39;s done 2 videos regarding the flight paths (the 2nd is an update of the first) and made 3D animations himself. </p>

<p>Anyway, in one of those videos I&#39;m pretty sure he references the one you&#39;re after.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The passport of one of the hijackers, Satam_al-Suqami was found a few blocks from the tower he impacted. Also, the passports of hijackers Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi were found at the crash site of United Flight 93. It&#39;s quite convenient that the evidence needed to identify the hijackers and Al Qaeda as the perpetrator of the attack, was found at the scene of the terrorist attacks themselves. Some of the hijackers were identified by other means, but some of them were exclusively identified by the miraculous finding of their passports near the rubble of the tower before it collapsed, Satam al-Suqami being one of those hijackers. Paper can survive an explosion, there&#39;s no doubt about that. There was plenty of paper found after the impact, but it was all loose paper, because only loose paper can survive an impact and explosion. If paper is bound to some extent, the paper will not survive the explosion, or if it does, the force will cause the paper to be forced from however it is bound to whatever it is bound to, whether a notebook, or the spine of a bound book, like for example, <strong>a passport</strong>. Satam al-Suqami&#39;s passport was found in nearly perfect condition, which the papers still intact, bound to the passport&#39;s covers and spine, not singed or burnt in any way. <strong>It is truly a miracle</strong>. Given that Satam al-Suqami was not identified by any other means, it makes the case that his &quot;passport&quot; was planted very likely, as the survival of his passport is highly unlikely, if not miraculous. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all you need to know, to know it was an inside job. The passport&#39;s existence was reported to law enforcement by an unknown, unidentified passerby. Quite convenient indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scope of the fraud was international, and many of the participants have dual citizenship.  It was an inside job in the sense that the technology used that day was developed and owned by the intelligence agencies of America, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, Germany and Saudi Arabia. 
9-11 was activated to hide the massive network of bank fraud and gold bullion theft that had been started in the 1940s. The elite not only took Nazi gold, but they dismantled the entire Soviet banking system and drained their wealth and brought the bankers to America. The Hammer operation was financed by a trillion dollars of loot stolen from Asian banks in the 1950s. </p>
