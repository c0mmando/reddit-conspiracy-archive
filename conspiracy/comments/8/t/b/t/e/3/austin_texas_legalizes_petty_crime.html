       One of the new city resolutions requires officers who question immigrants about status to also say that their questions about immigration need not be answered. The other resolution directs police to avoid arrests for misdemeanors, including those for smoking marijuana, having drug paraphernalia, and taking part in petty theft — crimes that city data shows frequently end in arrests of black and Latino residents.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Austin is among the country’s first so-called freedom cities, it’s part of a wider movement around decriminalizing low-level offenses and decreasing arrests. According to Local Progress, a national network of progressive city officials, some council members in El Paso and Dallas are also considering “freedom city” proposals.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Poor people of color in our city are over-punished and over-incarcerated,” said Greg Casar, an Austin City Councilman who pushed for the resolutions. “If people are being arrested less, we can also prevent people from being put in the deportation pipeline.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “We found that black and Latino residents comprised 75% of discretionary arrests for driving with licenses invalid in the city even though they are 45% of the population of the city,” Casar said. “Black residents are seven times more likely to be arrested for low-level marijuana violations despite having comparable rates of usage of marijuana to white residents.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Casar said the new rules could prevent up to 1,000 low-level arrests each year. Austin police arrest around 30,000 people a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Austin’s new rules passed Friday after more than 100 residents spoke about them at a City Council meeting. While support was wide, groups differed on the need for the “freedom city” title, and what effect it will have.
      </p>
      <p>
       S.s. People of color cannot commit crime in a white supremacist society I.e. Texas. They are not committing crime when they steal or do drugs in public, no. Those actions are in fact self defense against institutionalized racism in our country. To arrest someone for a misdemeanor only helps to enforce racist stereotypes. Finally the police in Austin are showing some progress.

       You really need a law to tell you murder is wrong?  Why do you worship government? Why do you worship law?  Why can't you find your own path and your own moral code? Why must you seek to control others for the sake of your comfort?

       That's more than semantics.  Those are two words that have distinct legal definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana used to be illegal in Colorado.  If you were caught possessing it you would be arrested and could be incarcerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Colorado
       <strong>
        decriminalized
       </strong>
       marijuana in the 70's.  During the period of decriminalization if you were caught with a bag of weed that was for personal use, the cops would take the bag and write you a ticket.  The ticket was for a civil, not criminal, infraction.  You could pay it by mail.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago Colorado
       <strong>
        legalized
       </strong>
       marijuana.  If I were to get arrested for some unrelated offense and had a bag of weed in my pocket, the cops would give it back when they released me.

       Why are we debating the meaning of words here instead of the crux of the matter. Definitions are important so as not to mislead ourselves but the issue at hand is the reason for the change in the first place. We shouldn't change our laws based on who violates those laws the most. I'm not pro-legalization of cannabis because black people are the majority of those who get in trouble for it. I'm pro-legalization because it's a dumb law.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any demographic violates a law more than others we shouldn't change a law just because of that. We should change laws based on whether it should be a law at all. If a certain group violates that law and the law is just maybe that group should stop violating the law in disproportionate numbers. We aren't discussing a victimless crime here. The victims of a crime should be taken more into consideration than the perpetrator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you be in favor of lowered penalties for homicide because one demographic disproportionately contributes to our homicide rate? Just take the question at face value without considering which demographic is in question or any of the theories behind WHY that demographic is overrepresented.

       I mean logic dictates that if criminals know cops won't do shit about theft, then theft would go up. The only question is by what %.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are saying 12% in that example, but as word spreads that they are free to steal in this manner, I would also predict that % will go up rapidly by year 2.

       Did you read what I said? Allocation of resources. I’d have to research and see what happens if the police focus on preventing certain types of crimes and ignore others. And again, these people aren’t getting off without consequences. They just aren’t being sent to jail prior to trial as frequently. But:

       Has criminalizing it de-incentivized it?  We spend billions of dollars investigating, prosecuting and punishing drug addicts every year.  It's a huge waste of money and we have more addicts per capita than ever.  Check out what Portugal did with drugs.

       Aren't local jails more likely to representative of the demographics of their particular area than a picture of a larger area comprised of multiple jails as a whole? If your jail has 100 white prisoners and 1 minority, there might two jails in areas with different demographics that have 100 "minority" prisoners and 1 white prisoner.

       I feel very strongly that  no such lieniency should by applied to illegal aliens. The very same black citizens imprisoned at rates quite disproportionate to white citizens are having their neighborhood and their quality of life negatively impacted by the very people who entered as felons, dont belong here dont abide by our laws-ie get a license and car insurance, have no way to support themselves, so they deal drugs or commit identity theft. Meanwhile for a black person sent to jail or prison, even if they were innocent, they have to put up w/gang warfare crap by the Latinos. This is a similar problem faced by Native Americans in the system, having to deal with very culturally different Latinos-gang warfare on the inside, and people can die during riots. It's very much a disservice to real Americans of all colors not to differentiate when they are illegals, also including Russians and Indians as they are some of the top offenders as well. People are just people is a naive attitude held by people who don't appreciate that its the illegals who take from citizens, don't assimilate and don't respect the American people, nor the laws protecting society. None of my above comments apply to any people here legally, except for-one. There are legal immigrants who don't assimilate.
