    <div class="md"><p>Yeah its probably best just to ride clean. And it may be your rights, but the reality as you have pointed out yourself, is that they are going to search your car either way. So why waste your time and the officers time and piss off someone who can take your freedom even more? It may not be right but thats just the reality. Why not just let em search and be on your way if you have nothing to hide? I get flexing your rights and all that, but it just seems like all your doing is poking the bear and leading to more unnecessary shit for yourself. It just puts you on their radar and leads to more stops and reduces your actual freedom even more. You can oppose them, but sometimes its better to be clever, pick your battles and do it quietly. You&#39;ll find you have a lot more actual freedom if you dont try to wear your emotions and your rights on your sleeve.</p>

<p>Can you hear yourself? Do you actually realize what you are saying?
If everyone acted like you through the decades past, we&#39;d have no rights whatsoever. Thank goodness they had the balls to fight for our rights. And you just want to totally give them away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. I just recognize the reality of the situation on the ground and know when I&#39;m beat. I hear this advice given all the time &quot;always refuse a search&quot; I think is the worst advice possible in a situation like this. If I&#39;m walking through the woods and there a tree in my way I can get mad and say I have a right to walk here this tree is infringing on my rights. And I can keep ramming my head into the tree in protest, or I can go around it. You have to negotiate the landscape as it truly exist, not based on how it should be. Read the art of war. If the enemy has a thousand and I have 200, I better not engage him in open warfare on the battle field, I better have my guys hide behind a rock and fire from a concealed position. If I want to win, I have to conceal my intentions. Its just basic strategy. Strategy beats emotion every time. </p>

<p>You can scream and shout and protest, but the infringement on your 4th ammendment rights wont just retreat and disappear. Now, YOU may care, and I may care, but a vast majority of the public has proven they dont give a fuck (or even know) about your 4th ammendment rights, and the police certainly dont either. Its a material reality on the ground that you must properly and strategically negotiate. If you truly value living free and your objective is to be free, then you have to do it strategically, not stupidly.</p>

<p>You can refuse a search and piss off the guy who controls your freedom at that moment (again, maybe not morally right, but a reality nonetheless, and not a strategically smart decision) and possibly have your car even further damaged as a dog rips your seats, and subject your car to impound, and possibly endure a body cavity search, and possibly sit in a cell up to 48 hours, but why? What will that accomplish? Do you think you will a lawsuit against the city for violating your 4th ammendment rights? Do you think you will earn the cop&#39;s respect, or teach him a lesson, or change his ways? Do you think you will be celebrated by the public or inspire others to do the same like some kind of search refusing Ghandi or MLK? Do you think your name will be in the paper and you will be celebrated as a hero? Do you think you will start revolutionary war part II and inspire people to take up arms so you dont have your car searched? I just dont see how its productive in any way.</p>

<p>You can record the whole thing on video and it will be posted to youtube under &quot;Sovereign citizen refuses search, gets PWND&quot; and people will laugh histerically at your mishap.</p>

<p>You can do all of those things and flex your rights, and waste hours of your time on the roadside while your car is destroyed and I will drive by merrily puffing a joint unencumbered on my way to whatever destination I please, truly enjoying my freedom, because I never was put on a cop&#39;s radar. And I will gently wave to you as the cops slap on a latex glove and proceed to anally violate you all because you wanted to flex your rights. Good luck with that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with you to a certain degree, but I simplify it thusly:</p>

<p>The side of the road is not a court. </p>

<p>You will get absolutely nowhere arguing with a cop even if the cop is breaking the rules. They are enforcers of rules, not judges. Often they are ignorant of the laws. You may know more about the law than them, but it doesn&#39;t matter. You aren&#39;t going to get anywhere on the side of the road.</p>

<p>Document what is happening, show compliance and courtesy, and save the arguments for the court.</p>

<p>Even that may not do any good, but arguing with a cop and being non-compliant just gives them an actually valid reason to arrest you. And if you give them a valid reason to arrest you, you are going to have a hard time fighting in court.</p>

<p>Keep yourself free and battle it in the courts.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve seen videos where the handler makes a little signal to get the dog to &quot;hit&quot; if he wants it to. It&#39;s just an ass backwards way for them to get around the fifth amendment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>where i live the police started walking the light rail platforms with dogs and randomly walking up to people just standing and waiting for the train and sniffing them down. the cops started fucking with this one guy after he moved away from one of the dogs, and he&quot; said keep that dog away from me im allergic to dog hair dander&quot; and the handler said the dog was &quot;signalling&quot; he told the cop i dont give a fuck get the fucking dog away from me. i did not give you permission to search me. the cop said he wasnt  doing a search. well then get the dog away from me. the cop called back up and two more squads showed up and they forcibly searched the guy.  he had NOTHING on him. the cop said well you might have used drugs earlier and he can smell it. they arrested him booked him and released him. the guy went immediately and got an attorney, who had him do a drug test. totally clean. the guy has never done drugs. they sued and won hands down. the judge ruled illegal search. and passed a motion prohibiting police from entering public space with dogs other than for investigation of a crime. you can not walk around looking for a crime on your own much less with a dog.  and they still try. i was walking down town walking my bike in a shopping area and there were several cop/dog teams just walking around and sniffing people walking bye. a bunch of people called on them and complained. its illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I wasn&#39;t ever arrested for anything, as I had been doing nothing wrong. Pulled over by traffic patrol for various things, then the claim that they can smell marijuana in my car (which is impossible as I&#39;ve never smoked in my car, and do not travel with things like that). At which point they ask to search, and I deny access so they make me wait (usually 30 minutes to an hour) for a dog. occasionally they&#39;ll cuff me and sit me on the curb while I wait. Again though, I got a new car and work in a different area so I haven&#39;t had this problem in a few years.</p>

<p>Here is a perfect example.  Man refuses to comply with unconstitutional DUI checkpoint, so the police use a dog to gain access to the car. The car has never had any illegal substance in it, but it did have a camera that caught the moment the officer instructed his dog to scratch/signal </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the thing is, even though DUI checkpoints are illegal and the guy didn&#39;t actually have to roll down his window any more, arguing with the police about it makes him stick out and makes the police want to fuck with him.  Practically speaking, he should have rolled the window down all the way and showed the cop his drivers license, because then the cop would say, &quot;okay, thank you sir,&quot; and he could leave right then.  Either way he&#39;s going to end up being released, except that when he gives the cops a hard time, he ends up being harassed, gets scratches all over his car, has his car rifled through, is detained for an hour, and gets stressed the fuck out.  That isn&#39;t the hill you want to die on.  For example, the last time I was pulled over for speeding, I had an open container in the car and I had been drinking, but I was nice to the cop and I didn&#39;t try to pull any sovereign citizen shit, and I drove away with a speeding ticket instead of being arrested for DUI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, to each their own.  In retrospect, the guy probably wanted to be asked out of his car and have his car searched so he could get the signalling on film.  But I&#39;d say the situation the guy ended up in is more akin to buttfucking than rolling the window down and showing an id.  There are more effective ways to fuck with the police, and besides, they like that shit.  </p>

<p>But, I also see this leading into some crazy comments/thoughts... Like, so what? Is there some kind do crazy dog conspiracy? Does man&#39;s best friend not really have highten sense of smell?  Are these woofers really pulling the wool over our eyes with the dominance we exert over them? I mean man did domesticate the hound... We train it, so it does as we please in order to be rewarded. </p>

<p>Also, is it only typically one specific breed of pooch making the busts? Are there others? Are the German Shepherds trained in the German language, being spoken to/given command in English? Do they actually understand or do they just comply with what they know and how to get rewarded? </p>

<p>I have so many off-the-wall questions now. Sorry lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah its important to distinguish fact from hyperbole here. It;s important to point out that dogs can indeed be well trained in drug recognition. Dogs can sniff a thousand suitcases at the airport and accurately find the coke in 1. SO lets not pretend it&#39;s all based on a lie. But what happens is the fact the supreme court has ruled that your car can be searched based on a dog&#39;s nose is something that has been abused by cops who can train dogs to falsely alert on command. Doesnt mean that dogs smelling and alerting to drugs is bullshit science, it just means it can be, and is, easily abused by the dog&#39;s handler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Police dogs are trained for many different things and can be cross trained. You have bomb dogs that just smell for explosives, you have bite dogs which are trained to chase suspects, you have drug dogs which are your typical drug search dogs, there are dogs that are able to smell drugs and track it through a crowd of people, and you have tracking dogs which are used for suspect location and even body/remain location. </p>

<p>What the dog smells and how the dog reacts are going to depend on their training location (they are trained all around the world). They can be trained to bark, sit, lay down, dig, and several other ways. The dogs handler is the one who knows how his dog will react and a single department can have several different ways their dogs react. </p>

<p>The handler will also know how to communicate with his K-9 because they are not trained in English (at least in the US). A lot are trained in German or Dutch. </p>

<p>Authority – &quot;the power to enforce laws, exact obedience, command, determine or judge&quot;</p>

<p>Tyranny – &quot;arbitrary use of authority&quot;</p>

<p>Corruption – &quot;anonymous tyranny&quot;</p>

<p>The police have the authority to stop and search you as long as it&#39;s not arbitrary i.e. if there&#39;s reasonable suspicion.</p>

<p>&quot;Moon is in Virgo&quot; is not good enough reason, neither is &quot;I felt like it&quot;. Any cop stopping you without a good reason is a (petty) tyrant and, if refusing to identify himself, also corrupt.</p>

<p>Remain polite. Ask for a reason. Ask for a name and some form of ID. If denied, do as told and file a formal (written) complaint afterwards. You will be told your complaints are worthless. Persist and complain anyway. Do not back down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We know that both of your questions are true.  While many people are correct, drug dogs are very good at identifying substances, but it is also a big problem in how the dogs are trained.  They are rewarded for detecting drugs, and are trained with different cues in how the officer communicates with the k9.  It has been proven innumerous times that k9 dogs are not accurate much of the time because they are eager to please their handler and thus will false signal if their handler wants to or provides a false cue.  The dogs can be easily manipulated.  Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but i believe you can not be forced to a k-9 inspection unless the k-9 unit is able to respond in the time it would have taken to write the original infraction.  Informing the officers respectfully that you know your rights might prevent some of these.  Cops might not plant drugs as frequently as thought but narcotics officers use confidential informants in most locations indirectly in what the ACLU once estimated to be as high as 80&amp;#37; of drug convictions.  These are by definition criminals, who have a vested interest in making sure someone else gets charged with a crime.  Does that system make it seem improbable?</p>
