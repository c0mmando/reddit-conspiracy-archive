       Personally I've dedicated a good part of my time trying to develop a healthy personality. I'm a military brat so I grew up appreciating 
male characteristics like courage, patriotism and determination. Yet when it comes to actually acting in such ways around other people, I find it kind of hard. When I face a problem at work, I think about showing confidence in the face of adversity yet even adults won't tolerate such behaviour. I can't speak for females, but I was wondering if it was the same for you when trying to show off your feminity? It's almost like many of the things that a person could call an "identity" or "persona" are being attacked. Humour is used in a lot of the media people are exposed to in order to normalize psychological abuse and eventually, people become too scared like to try out different things out of fear of being ridiculed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just gender identities. Even moral, religious, cultural and national identities are being attacked through ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a lot of men can't act the way our brains are wired to work, they end up becoming frustrated and cynical towards society and stop trying to fix it. The constant violence people are exposed to
surely makes things worse since they are also likely to become mentally unstable. Personally, after trying out many types, I chose a stoic personality since it allows me to keep myself and others under control. I'm not the type of person who can trust someone right away, I need to know what their motivations are first. But since creating that kind of bond is difficult in the modern, accelerated age, I rather keep distance from others. The constant attacks on the "personas" surely doesn't help either, so by being stoic I can both keep people away and yet have power over them at the same time. By practicism healthy amounts of stoicism I can act "manly" and have power over others this way. I think that because of the isolation people are exposed to in the modern age, this kind of role model is needed for people to develop healthy personalities instead of so much attention being given to politicians and celebrities.

       What you’re describing — like many other things — is symptomatic of Jewish influence on society. Ridiculing and eliminating these identities not only insulates them as the “other,” but it neutralizes any and all opposition to their destructive handiwork.

       Knowing a lot of vets, that shit comes with a lot of demons man. All my dad will say is he was in Vietnam. I asked him about it when he was shitfaced drunk one night and he just started sobbing. Have a bunch of marine buddies now that were in Afghanistan, and there is just a silent agreement not to ask. Sometimes they offer stories. Our government damages our young men, and then hangs them out to dry. I try to respect their boundaries, but I totally understand the curiosity.

       Men are the most subjugated class in history. Circumcision, the mark of a slave in ancient times, is proof of this.

       There is definitely an attack on testosterone and manly men, at least in the US. It's a combination of promoting gays and the trans movement and telling kids that they can be whatever gender they want to be! What the fuck kind of brain washing, manipulation is that!? I hear kids taking about "going to the doctor to be a boy but you can still keep your boobs." I was flabbergasted to hear a 6 year old discussing this. I believe TPTB want to make us all more docile and they know that real men will stand up to them so they are fucking with us intentionally to breed the testosterone and "fight" out of us.

       For reals, girl, I feel ya! I've got my guy but if I had to be in the dating game, I'd just end up single because I can't even tell what a man is from a woman these days! I'm so disgusted by what they're doing to us at a cellular level, just making us weak, along with their social engineering of us to just look at phones and go buy shit. We're becoming a useless society and just in time for AI/robots to take over! It's all going hand in hand.

       One of the most popular movie franchises in the world., the MCU, includes tons of characters you could say are manly men. In other forms of media like TV and I can see actors like John Krasinski that has enjoyed praise for his new movie, but also for his new look which includes more muscles and a beard
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see it, if there was a huge attack on masculinity then these forms of media wouldn't be displaying them and enjoying success

       But have you looked our your window at society? Have you seen how young children are talking about gender and being whatever you want to be? Have you seen the feminization of men and difficulty in determining what gender a person is as you walk by them? I have and it's increasing. They are also being incorporated into tv shows and movies at a rate of almost one lgbt person in every show or movie. Why put them into so many viewable places if they supposedly constitute such a small percentage of the populace? It's conditioning us to normalize it. I don't know what MCU is so I can't comment on that.

       And because having LGBT characters in your show help have gay viewers identify with those characters. It's a way to boost viewership

       We don't even have black or Asian people in our entertainment, which constitute a larger demographic than the lgbt community, so why not identify with them, I'd that's really their intention?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for that type of movie franchise, you can say that they are showing masculinity through super heroes, which are fictional. This allows for those boys who still have some "fight" left in them to get that energy out in a safe, non threatening way, same for sports and other physical and or violent sports, like MMA or WWE. Also letting them get their aggressions out while playing video games which are masculine and violent in nature will help to ease their impulses in real life. But we're told the opposite, that violent entertainment makes us more violent, but it doesn't, it's an outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I work with kids who aren't old enough for fortnite, thank god. But they do talk about being able to change your gender at the doctor, no shit. I just think we're being made to be this way, not that I'm anti lgbt, it's a deeper issue as to why we are being made to be that way and why our media, government, and entertainment want us to think it's normal and promote it.

       I think it's possible to be a man, even a "manly" man, without desiring to manipulate or hold power over other people. I think that such a desire is often not a healthy one; I suspect that it tends to be part of a personality type that sees power over others as being a "strength" but a true leader understands that it is better to lead by example, in such a way that others want to follow; not by the implicit threat of "power", even if it is veiled by a reserved or stoic personality.

       I do understand and empathize with how it may feel that maleness is under attack, and I have experienced similar feelings. I have also had great difficulty understanding whether trans was a form of mental illness, or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       An old friend of mine, who I grew up with, recently came out as trans in his (now her) 40s and had begun the transition. As soon as my friend told me, it became completely clear: my friend is a good person, struggling with this problem and this secret their entire lives. They said it felt like a great weight had been lifted off their shoulders; their physical health improved, they did not exhibit any overt signs of mental illness previously, but their mental outlook improved; the issues they have now are not a result of their own problems; it is the result of people who do not understand. This is my friend; if they are my friend, I must love them; they are still the same person. The only response can be to support them in their decision; if I respond without love, then I never loved them; that would make me a bad friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trans people are people who are no different than you or I, except that they have this one terrible problem. Imagine for a moment, that if you told people who you really were, and people responded with hate; you know that some of them will threaten to kill you. You have had a very very insignificantly tiny taste of how that feels, when you point out that it feels like there is a war on maleness; if you have the ability to empathize, you can see how being trans would create so much mental pressure that it would increase the likelihood of mental issues. There, but for pure chance, goes you or I. These individuals are simply people who are doing the best they can with the cards they are dealt; i think it likely that due to the nature of the situation, they have a higher chance of mental illness, but again this is probably just as much as result of how society responds to them, as anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT BEING SAID
      </p>
      <p>
       there is an extremely vocal minority, almost a militant minority of very loud and aggressive people on the left who are so far left that they think violence is justice; they will shout you down, create a hateful environment toward men, and are generally not helpful in de-escalating but rather promote conflict as a way to achieve their goals whatever that may be. I believe that we have not recognized gender fluidity as a society with the respect it deserves; now we are trying to find the right way forward; as part of this problem solving, we may sometimes swing a bit too far in the other direction. This is a process; mistakes will be made; sometimes, there will be two steps forward, one step back.

       On one side, it is good to have emotions. On the other side, they've bred like 3 generations of emotionally insecure 'pussies'. Myself included.

       Men are much larger consumers nowadays. The war on the ego and people's self esteem has been going on since advertising first started but it was mostly limited to women in past eras. In our modern society, men are becoming bigger consumers and falling for the same types of ego killing ads.

       The more transgender people there are the faster the human population will be reduced and the more likely the possibility that the earth might yet be saved. Don´t be a selfish straight human, do your part to promote transgenderism. Its the most important civil rights movement in history, because no one will have rights if there´s no earth left to set right.

      <p>
       Nuclear war would be the easiest, but if they wanted to be humane pushing every third world country to industrialize quickly and embrace contraceptions and sex education would stabilize the birth rates. Wouldn't reduce the population rn, but it would stop the heavy growth

       Manly men are very satisfying to women, but I have to add, I don’t like Neanderthal behavior like cussing up a storm or hitting/throwing things bec something doesn’t go right. That’s just beneath us. Kindness from strength and being a stand up guy is what impresses me.  Doors being opened and heavy things carried bec it’s a courtesy, a way to acknowledge you are a lady, not bec women can’t physically do it. Taking the lead and bringing up the rear in groups, that’s almost a surprise to see men take on lately.  Making sure ppl are comfortable and safe.  I’m thinking, when did boys and men forget to remind us we are women?  —in a good way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we as women have learned to take on these tasks. But, it’s a loss to our complimentary roles that brought grace to our stressful lives.  When did the older generation stop modeling these behaviors for the next one?
      </p>
      <p>
       Meeting  some of the young men my daughter had been dating makes me question what’s up with the male gender anymore.  I don’t even know how to explain it. It’s like, I am more of a risk taker and go-getter than they are.  But they are still men and hopefully will free themselves into their role at some point.

       Betas and lgbt can be masculine.  It’s. about propaganda to weaken and divide society. Easier to manipulate weaker families, communities, countries.

       Not sure where your definitions are from. Not all men (or women) are Type A personalities. And that’s a good thing.  Each personality type has pros and cons. You are making a caricature of the concept of masculinity. What makes a man put on a dress may have a lot more to do with masculinity than the fact he may be wearing one.  Being physically aggressive or overbearing can be a sign of weakness, not strength.  You can’t make generalizations on such superficial appearances.  Frankly, there are too many alphas in the world anyway. It takes s lot more character to actually care about ppl and do what’s necessary.

       I'm ftm, allowing me to experiance how both genders are treated first-hand. Men are definitely treated far worse and held to much higher standards than women, all while being ridiculed for things that hardly even matter. Men cant show emotions without being called a sissy, they cant be slightly feminine without being called a fag, and they cant even call someone attractive anymore without someone chewing their ass over it. It's absolute madness.

       I'm always hearing about toxic masculinity and how it causes rape culture and male priviledge and the evil patriarchy and all that. But then they say nothing of positive masculinity, or they relate positive masculinity only to what the man
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       do. As in, he doesn't rape, he doesn't abuse, assault, ect. And if someone suggests that positive masculine traits are things like bravery, protectiveness, strength (of any kind), being a provider for family, problem-solving or whatever...they're then told that it is sexist and unfair to consider those traits masculine because women can be those things too (which I absolutely do not deny). So men, what does that leave you with? It feels like there is no "right" way to be a man, but there sure are a lot of wrong ways.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The big statistics I'm going to be referencing are real wage growth and wealth inequality between whites and blacks. The data shows a few key points:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Black men’s average hourly wages were 22.2 percent lower than those of white men in 1979 and declined to 31.0 percent lower by 2015. With an average hourly wage gap of 6.0 percent, black women were near parity with white women in 1979, but by 2015 this gap had grown to 19.0 percent.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         More than one in four black households have zero or negative net worth, compared to less than one in ten white families without wealth
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The racial differences in net worth actually increased following the Great Recession, as non-white families experienced proportionally larger losses in net worth.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         White families have nearly 10 times the net worth of black families. And the gap is growing
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Basically, what I'm suggesting is that happiness, or 'ease of life' is heavily impacted by financial strength and stability. For white men to have the hardest time out of any group in America: wouldn't it imply that they should be losing ground in wages or wealth to blacks and Hispanics? What do you think?

       These are not male characteristics. Either gender can exemplify either. Pigeon hole yourself and you're just going to be miserable.

       There is definitely an attack on women wanting to occupy traditional female roles coupled with a drive to herd them into traditionally male occupations that we don’t even know if women are interested in. The script goes that if you chose a female dominant profession it’s because STEM streams were denied to you, if you say you actually weren’t that interested, they argue that if you stop buying girls pink fluffy things they would totally be into car mechanics.
I don’t see why we can’t value all professions equally rather than denigrate female dominated ones and convince women if they want genuine professional respect it has to be in a previously masculine field. 
On top of that no one is honest to young women about how motherhood can conflict with your career. You might have been incredibly passionate about your job, but once a child comes along you you care more about your kid than your organizations mission statement.
And to sum up my rant I believe masculinity is being attacked on purpose to leave our community more open to manipulation and attack. When men lose confidence in their ability to take a leading role or call out bullshit when they see it we become easier to herd into pens.

       I can understand what you are saying, and I experienced something relevant the other night. For the record I'm a chick and yes I think we are dealing with the same pressures to deny nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I went to a dinner party at a friends house who is going through a separation with his wife. He hosted a pizza party. He can cook well but I think hosting a few extra people stresses him out. His two sisters were also coming with their partners. The sisters are both hardcore feminists, experienced the movement firsthand etc. Much older than I am and much more happy to give their opinion even if it is confrontational and rude.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I had baked a cake and brought it along, and when we got their I was happy to get the toppings ready for the pizzas too, since my friend was busy being a good host. I was nearly done chopping when the sisters arrived. The mood instantly changed, suddendly the air was not so light. These women feel ominous to be around. No light heartedness, no feminine gentleness and humour. Very little positivity about any topic. Super negative. They got straight into berating my friend about why he was in the situation he was in, how it was all his fault, even attacked his faith. Just blah blah blah. Just yelling at him in front of his guests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I was drinking wine and doing my thing, and was later told that one of them, the more yelly one, had made comments about why was I in the kitchen doing all the work for the men? I didn't complain, I like to tease but we all have a good sense of humor. I'm more than happy to cook the food while the blokes put more wood on the fire and pour me more wine. But her saying it was wrong and pointing it out means I have to feel self conscious about doing something I am good at and enjoy doing. They are just so bitter and unhappy it's horrible to be around.

       I know what you mean, if women take pleasure in doing things like baking I don’t see why this can’t be a source of pride. If men like doing it too that’s great, but everyone’s contribution is important. I used to be quite a strong feminist back in the day when it was more straight forward and less combative but now it strives to make men and women indistinguishable regardless of how utterly miserable it makes everyone

       I recommend you check out "Turd Flinging Monkey" on YouTube. His content will provide you with some insight on the post-modernist's rush to destroy men and what your options as a man are in today's gyno-centric society.
