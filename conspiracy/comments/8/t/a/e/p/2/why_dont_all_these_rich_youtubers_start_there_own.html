<p>I had hope when people were making an outrage about the advertising, but no, they just shut up and move on.</p>

<p>I could understand them being scared, but if you check these people’s twitters/Facebook/instgram they have enough of a following on those platforms (who all compete with google and I’m sure would be on board with this, not silencing them) to convince their fans to abandon youtube. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>people dont understand how mad complex the backend of YouTube is and how crazy expensive it is to have massive server/cloud/storage farms in order to hold all the uploads and allow all the streaming.</p>

<p>You&#39;d need 100 million or more just to make it happen and to keep operations smooth. The only one right now who can F*ck with going up against YouTube in a war is PornHub, because they already do have all that backend up and running, and they have discussed the possibility of doing something like this</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It has nothing to do with brain cells. If I was already popular on YouTube and making loads of cash why would I want to screw with that? The enormity of the time and money involved in building a site that would compete with YouTube at even 5% is difficult to even fathom. </p>

<p>By way of example think of Microsoft. They have been trying to topple Google for over 2 decades and have lost billions doing it only to achieve 13.9% of the total search market across all of their properties. Hell, at one point they were so desperate they were willing to pay $45 billion to acquire Yahoo in order to catch up. Of course, that didn&#39;t happen but it speaks to the amount of money one might need to even make a dent in such an incumbent player like YouTube.</p>

</ol>

<p>Alright I will admit that there may not be a ton but there is enough higher paid people with tons of subscribers altogether that could start crowdfunding/fundraise enough to get something started, fuck if they had enough people on board it could totally happen. It could be done. </p>

<p><a href="https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/5000/mostsubscribed">https://socialblade.com/youtube/top/5000/mostsubscribed</a></p>

<p>This site claims that “about” 5000 users have 1mil+ subscribers.  I’m sure you would not even need a 100 of them to be on board with this. </p>

<p>If they were serious about it, they couldn’t completely stop posting on YouTube, post on other platforms about the crowdfunding until they’ve reached there goal. It would have to be an actual effort.  </p>

<p>Lol I’m not an expert in any of this and I’m sure there are other stipulations but it doesn’t seem too hard to me. </p>

<p>And if google went after anyone, all they would have to do is tell their subscribers to boycott google as much as they can, hopefully causing stocks to drop. I mean if a decentralized platform got big enough it would put a hole in google and I’m all for it. </p>

The time and money to even establish a platform which has the capability, manpower, and streaming power would be extremely difficult. Then there is the problem of switching everyone from the same site they have used for 10+ years to a totally new site which would be the exact same site with a different name would be even more challenging. I couldn&#39;t imagine an incentive to get people to switch sites, especially since the new site would have more ads than YouTube.</p>
