    <div class="md"><p>Dude you have no Idea how difficult this is to explain. Essentially from what I&#39;ve seen the earth and EVERY physical object compounds upon itself through the of vibration. The waveform that inevitably condenses into physical matter starts as a single disturbance in the server. One vibration. One dimension
Then that waveform is itself set to vibrating. A wave within. And a second dimension. Each new waveform condensing into a subsequent dimension. Upon reaching around the 11th dimension is when shit gets triply. Realities present themselves as lobes and they press together in ways that are akin to left and right lobes of a brain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he was describing is that the Earth bulges around the equator due to forces exerted by it&#39;s rotation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very simple - you can go to the coast and watch ships disappear over the horizon as they travel away from you, or better still, take a ride on a boat or ship and go out to see, watching the land sink down over the horizon. </p>

<p>Now, some cynics will say that if you had a powerful enough telescope you could still the ship/land, because they&#39;re just lost in the haze or too far away for you to see, but there&#39;s one small problem with that - it&#39;s bollocks. If you go out into the middle of a large body of water, like the Atlantic Ocean, you will see nothing, because it&#39;s all over the horizon, due to the curvature of the Earth.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example that&#39;s an area of interest to me; U-Boats used to patrol the seas looking for targets, but because they were relatively low down they could only see a few miles. The Germans came up with a manned helicopter kite that could be towed behind a u-boat, being towed several hundred feet above the u-boat and thereby increasing the range of the horizon. The Germans where known for producing superior optics, so if it was a matter of just having better binoculars to see further, why didn&#39;t they? Because if you want to see further over the horizon, further over the curvature of the Earth, you have to go higher.</p>

<p>There are multiple videos of people using the resolution limitations of cameras to make it appear that ships disappear when they are not even over the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some atheists (and agnostics) are just using logic and reason but are completely deceived so the information they are working with brings them to false conclusions.  Those ones (like me) come around to God as soon as this truth is revealed.  Other atheists just purely have a hatred of God.  When that hatred is the source of their atheism I don&#39;t think anything would change their mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actual flat earther here - I have already been stalked and harassed all over reddit for my views and opinions so that&#39;s not really something I&#39;m afraid of.</p>

<p>The entire field of astronomy is pseudo-science - they will you tell they know the exact distance to all the stars and planets etc, but they merely lights in the sky.  So all the astronomy professionals gain their entire field of study.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a huge piece of the materialist evolutionist paradigm.  Without the spinning ball earth hurtling through space, it&#39;s unlikely anyone would fall for evolution as a reasonable explanation for our existence.</p>

<p>If people understood the flat earth and true cosmology, they would naturally see things in a more spiritual light - we are all here on the material plane having our material experience.  People would naturally have better understanding of one another and probably more respect as well.</p>

<p>More people would probably become religious, as religious scriptures are some of the only books left that talk about flat earth cosmology - though of course there are numerous experiments anyone can do or even reference to prove to themselves that the earth is flat and motionless.</p>

<p>They also directly gain the entire budget of NASA and huge amounts of military budget, plus gov&#39;t money for things like SpaceX etc.  Lots of money as well.</p>
