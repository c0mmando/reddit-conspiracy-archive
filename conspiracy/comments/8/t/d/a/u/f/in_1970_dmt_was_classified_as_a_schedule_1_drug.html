       Although never commonly available, DMT was made illegal in the United States in 1966, along with LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin. (The four compounds mentioned in the general introduction to ‘The Psychedelic Experience’ by Leary/Metzner/Alpert).
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson created the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs by executive order, transferring enforcement of all drug laws from the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, to the Department of Justice. Drug use was now a law-enforcement issue, rather than a public health one.

       In 1970, N,N-DMT was classified as a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1971, N,N-DMT was found to be endogenous to the human body, So, ironically, it is illegal to possess a compound which is in fact naturally inside of all of us.

       Welcome to the Discussion. Let's talk about DMT and Psychedelics. A lot of us are familiar with DMT, magic mushrooms, and the like, however, what many people do not know is that DMT naturally occurs and is found within the human body and throughout the animal and plant kingdoms as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now why would something that is naturally made within us, be outlawed? Is that a law on consciousness? Or is it a profitable control mechanism?  Why not both? Divide and conquer? You choose! The real truth is, it is total bull shit that DMT, a naturally occuring compound, is a schedule 1 "drug", by that measure, they see our bodies as a serious threat to our own safety. WHAT. Sounds more like our liberated consciousness is more of a threat than DMT is itself. DMT has the potential to liberate you from the chains of social conditioning and mass brain washed consumerism mindset most are trapped in. We have been MKUltra'd on a large scale and on top of that divided against each other and painted all different labels, boxes, and shapes. Magic mushrooms alone and DMT have the ability to transform the way you see and intrepid reality. That in itself is a different thread, but I really wanted to highlight the total BS that is making a naturally occurring compound found within the human body a schedule 1 "drug".
      </p>
      <p>
       Some examples of the drugs that are on each schedule:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&gt;Schedule 1: marijuana, heroin, LSD, ecstasy, and magic mushrooms
&gt;Schedule 2: cocaine, meth, oxycodone, Adderall, Ritalin, and Vicodin
&gt;Schedule 3: Tylenol with codeine, ketamine, anabolic steroids, and testosterone
&gt;Schedule 4: Xanax, Soma, Darvocet, Valium, and Ambien
&gt;Schedule 5: Robitussin AC, Lomotil, Motofen, Lyrica, and Parepectolin
</code></pre>
      <p>
       In general, schedule 1 and 2 drugs have the most regulatory restrictions on research, supply, and access, and schedule 5 drugs have the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6842187/drug-schedule-list-marijuana">
        https://www.vox.com/2014/9/25/6842187/drug-schedule-list-marijuana
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an easier time doing research and studying the effects of tylenol with codeine than you could marijuana, DMT, or magic mushrooms. The body even has a endocrine system for cannibinoids! Yet these are all schedule 1, meaning the most regulatory restrictions on research, supply, and access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see the picture I am painting?
      </p>
      <p>
       Our bodies have been outlawed, and profited off of, and then thrown in jail and made to be a slave. This is an extreme example but it truly tells a story of what laws and legislation has done to us at a global and national level. It is 2018. And we are only just now reversing the fuck up of the war on drugs through the legalization of cannabis. What a slow fucking roll. Humanity is a slow species in my opinion and it kind of pisses me off at times. We have so much potential yet continue to bog ourselves down with unneeded bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can really drag this post out but I want to stop there, and let you all start off. Let's discuss these ridiculous laws and policies and why such things could be in place. Let's share links, articles, discussion, good vibes of good times spent talking about a bull shit system. This is what
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       is, so let's discuss it. Thank you for your time and I look forward to your participation.

       DMT is unlike any other “drug” known to man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: Have done many, many different types of drugs. DMT is a spiritual experience that most folks don’t have the opportunity to try, as it is so heavily restricted (as OP said) - There is a reason for this, I believe, the main being the forces that be are so afraid of an expansion of consciousness. If more people were able to have a DMT trip, the whole fabric of our society would unravel, and people would start to see a completely different perspective of life and existence.

       Even magic mushrooms alone offer you some pretty valuable insights and bring you more into alignment with nature and a balance of being. You can see and feel most people today, how anxious they are, trembling and anxious to go do their next thing and rush off into traffic in their car. So much anxiety, fear, and concern is present in society and I can't even imagine what it is like to be living in an active war zone while you are trying to survive. This is what our planet has become. We have the means and abilities and even the money to literally change the world over night, but select greedy fucks are interested in keeping their little control empire afloat. It is sick. And it pisses me off and has for years. You are spot on regarding the fabric of our society unraveling. It would not even have to be that many people either.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also is why "new age" ideas have been attacked when in reality, meditation and other avenues of self exploration are highly beneficial to not only yourself but mankind. So many things have been targeted and smeared and en grained in the collective consciousness as "weird" or whatever term people want to lazily throw at something they are too hesitant to fully explore. Usually referred to the hundredth monkey effect, or the tipping point/reaching point or even meme magic, this potential lies within us all and can easily reverberate out through the collective consciousness. Even mass meditations have been scientifically proven to change society at large, I will include some links below for anyone else that is curious. Truth is, there has been a war on consciousness and we need to break through the veil as a species if we want to survive and avoid a total nightmare scenario of total control of mankind.

       Not that this matters to much but just kinda paints the picture.  Me and my friends are  blue collar republicans and all went down to the beach.  My buddies cousin came down to and mentioned he brought some mushrooms that he grew.  All of us were like fuck that I’m not doing those We rarely even smoke weed anymore just trying to go to the beach get drunk and have fun.  After the bar we came back pretty drunk and for whatever reason fuck it we’ll-try them.  We went to the beach and everyone else had a similar experience to me too.  I had some serious self revelations about my life that night and watching the sunrise while getting beat up by the waves it was beautiful and am a better person for it because  I realized while I have a great life there were people I wasn’t treating right and stuff I needed to improve on.  I don’t think ppl should do them on the reg but am totally pro shrooms because there’s something there as far as getting into your inner conscience for the better of yourself and it’s bs their illegal because it grows completely natural

       I completely agree. Doing DMT the first time (and each subsequent time) only cements that thought for me. It 100% changes your frame of reference and what you think is important. Suddenly, arbitrary laws that protect business interests or working in a cubicle to pay for all your "stuff" seems very unimportant. What becomes important is connecting with yourself and your loved ones and the world around you, but the government can't really regulate or profit off that.

       Actually it is pretty popular and easy to get on the jam band music festival scene, it is also pretty easy to synthesize with a plethora of information and instructions online, all the precursors are legal, and 5MEO DMT is also legal.

       If a person wants to try it
       <strong>
        and puts in a bit of effort
       </strong>
       it is far from impossible.

       I've never taken anything in my life bar prescriptions and over the counter meds, I even gave up alcohol almost a decade ago in hopes of improving my health so please excuse my stupid questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last couple of years I've listened to a lot of podcasts which mention DMT, ayhuahasca (sp?) and other things for expanding your conscience and helping to work through mental issues. One thing confused me is that I was told DMT is basically ectasy and you don't see many ravers talking about how it helped them spirituality. Is there a difference and just how dangerous is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've steered clear of anything like it my whole life as I have such terrible nightmares and have had waking ones too that God knows what would happen to me.

       DMT is absolutely NOT like ecstacy. I recommend watching a netflix documentary called DMT: The Spirit Molecule. It will give you a pretty good understanding of it.

       If it was legal and was used in a sort of coming of age ritual (as in you've turned 21, time to become a real man) the world would be so god damn entirely different.

       They've really caused a problem creating such a stigma around it, i can't see how they could ever take it of the schedule 1 list now. The deeper one is entrenched in our system of lies the more rattling a DMT trip would be, if they were to remove it as a schedule 1 and the usage rose we would see mental instability of epic proportions.

       I am a very open minded individual and in my live there has never, ever been a time when i have been as shaken to the core as i was when i first tried DMT.

       Regardless of drug, I have no idea why people accept government having the authority of telling us what we can or cannot do with our bodies. My generation figured it out, the government should not be able to do so. WTF is wrong with baby boomers where they are such nanny state supporters?

       I was say space age mind control is probably a pretty good word for whats taking place lol. We're all here talking about consciousness, well you have to think about your sub conscious too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're being exposed to information almost 24/7. Tv, music, pictures, etc. Your sub conscious is picking up on everything, that your conscious self might not even realize.

       Same, I haven't voted since I turned 18 ten years ago. There's always something that comes up but they make it really easy now. Old people always vote and that's why were getting fucked.

       And say what you will about Dems, and lord knows this board has, but heavy red districts in California don't have a problem voting in a timely manner, and entire swaths aren't randomly purged from the voting rolls every year.

       It's a security and health risk. It's also linked to a lot of international crime. I think some drugs are misclassified but I get why it's regulated.

       There would be no international crime or drug mafia if drugs was legal and regulated. California and Colorado legalizing weed was a giant blow to the cartels. This is literally basic understanding of the drug war guy

       The legal weed in Colorado did no such thing as “deal a major blow” to the cartels and in fact only made them switch from cheap Mexican weed to homegrown weed still sold heavily on the black market and then straight to heroin deals.

       Meth?  Those are snapshots.  Time is the real equalizer.  Some things have to run their course.  People aren’t as stupid as the government wants you to think.  After a generation, maybe two tops, you’ll see steady drug use like meth sharply decline.

       DMT is a dissociative at high doses. It completely removes the concept of being a human. It removes all environment. Closest comparison i can make would be augmented reality versus virtual reality.

       L is AR, Deems is VR.  Meaning you are in a completely separate environent from where your body is.  The visuals are quite distinct and unique I would say.  Altogether different from L but imo the trip is much lighter pf a  'mental load' than an LSD trip - your thinking is very clear - and it's much shorter.  It's quite distinct from Lucy.  Worth trying for sure.

       Okay yeah, I kind of compared my LSD trip to E+shrooms x 3, I felt a come up, multiple peaks (different from E as it’s normally 1 peak unless you redose)  very intense put peaceful, dependent on environments. Time was fucked for me lol 10 minutes sometimes was 1 hour in my head (albeit I was stressed out about appearing normal in public) but it seems to warp. Yeah Lucy makes you go through each step individually in your mind haha. Yeah I tripped for 12 hours almost (probably from the interval dose?) and it seemed like such a long time to where I’m really holding onto my other tabs due to a little reservation. But I just want a good environment for the next time.

       DMT is not a dissociative at high doses, it is thoroughly a psychedelic at all doses

       Psychedelia just rips reality away, that's not dissociation.

       It is much stronger but the trip is much shorter, however when you're in the DMT-verse time dilates a lot. The only time I managed to break through, time stopped existing for me while the entities on the other side were teaching me lessons and showing me snippets from other lives I've lived.

       I was going through a really difficult time because my entire life has basically been one bad event after another and I've never really gotten a break from it and at the time I was considering suicide. They showed me my past few previous lives where I did kill myself, and said that I'd keep reincarnating into similar circumstances until I finally decided to live through it because my life purpose requires me to suffer for a while so that I would be more willing to help humanity. Ever since then, I've been on a spiritual path and while my life still isn't where I want it to be, I'm getting breaks more and more often and just have a gut feeling that soon my life will stop being so difficult all the time. They also made sure I learned the lesson that thoughts create reality and the sooner I started having a positive mindset throughout the difficult times, the sooner my life would turn around.

       Think of a rock polisher, one of those drums, goes round and round, rolls twenty-four/seven, full of water and rocks and gravel. Grinding it all up. Round and round. Polishing those ugly rocks into gemstones. That’s the earth. Why it goes around. We’re the rocks. And what happens to us—the drama and pain and joy and war and sickness and victory and abuse—why, that’s just the water and sand to 
erode us. Grind us down. To polish us up, nice and bright."

       Thanks for the post! The answer is: It's a war on consciousness. But we're fighting back from the grassroots. The psychedelic movement is on a *roll.* We're about to legalize MDMA for therapy, and the truth about DMT is getting out faster than the bad guys can contain it. The truth is that DMT breakthroughs involve an encounter with a separate higher intelligence. I've had the experience myself. Nothing will truly convince anyone short of the experience itself. However, you can get a taste of it by reading stories and reading about the phenomenon generally. I can't too strongly recommend the book "The Cosmic Serpent" for anyone interested in this subject. There's a free PDF online. And I've been collecting DMT stories, including a lot of reddit threads, which I'll post separately (so that they all fit).

       A full-blow DMT alien breakthrough is something that everyone should experience at least once in your lifetime.

       Speaking of fighting against the government's war on consciousness, you might be interested in subliminals. If you use the right ones you will actually experience sensations and I can say I've actually managed to make visible physical changes to myself. They work even better with psychedelics, too. Psychedelics were made illegal after MK Ultra experiments had been going on for several years so the government definitely knew about these things and did it so that humans wouldn't learn about their true power. They want us to think "reality" is always as we know it right now, but the lessons I learn every time I trip boil down to: we're just minds inside of a body and reality is formed based on our subconscious beliefs. If you change how you think about reality, reality will change to match your beliefs. I know that this sounds pretty crazy but it truly is something you need to experience firsthand to know its not a load of BS. There truly is no better way to fight the government than by defying them and using our inner power to manifest the reality we want rather than the one they've been forcing on us in order to control us.

       Thats not even the most crazy thing about DMT not talking about the drug it self but the facts around the drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scottish Rite Foundation, a branch of the Freemasons actually funded rick strassman research about dmt where you can read about it in dmt the spirit molecule.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might ask yourself why would the freemason fund rick strassman work well in Freemasons have a history with acacia tree and so do the jewish people and the Egyptians.

       I swear the more you start looking at things the more appearences that show themselves to you...
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for giving me some additional things to look into. The free masons are a consistent theme throughout history and I am beginning to think I need to look into their achievments. With so many lodges and different members it is hard to point to one thing and say that is what free masons are/do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I am saying is, I had a direct experience with a master mason I believe, one time at an airforce base. He had come around a few times and was a really friendly guy. I asked him about free masonry because he had a hat on with a bunch of free mason emblems on it, i was pretty excited i got the chance to talk to him. I asked him if free masonry is a means of expanding enlightenment or if it is a brotherhood and he beamed and said both! I got his card and everything and still have it... Years later.. I look at it and wonder if it would be a good outlet to pursue. Sometimes I think there are answers i cant explain or get on my own.

       I'm not a freemason but I believe the whole deal with them climbing b into the coffin is basically them acting out taking DMT without taking DMT. Hence the reenactment of ego death.

       Dmt pretty much removed all of my ptsd symptoms except nightmares. But I went from roughly every other night to weekly. Its still fucning torture but at least its more spread out. I still get anxiety in crowded areas. But I dont live in a constant state of alertness which has dramatically lowered my overall anxiety combined with a better diet and more regular exercise.

       Its not an end all be all treatment. It jist makes it a little more manageable.

       It makes me wonder, why is whiskey legal? ... Weed and shrooms cause you to just relax and think. But pounding whiskey causes you to black out, get in fights, text your ex-girlfriend, lose your wallet, crash your car, and wake up in jail.

       In their defence, it would probably be possible to isolate a cocaine or meth analog from human tissue -- it wouldn't be economically or ethically viable, but you could do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That it exists in the human body or nature is not a strong enough argument to argue for legality or lack of controls.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I've heard rumblings DMT is coming to market, due to all this vapour tech making delivery less crackpipey. It's a potent drug, which makes it unattractive to some.

       I said analog. The drugs aren't special, they get certain pathways to perform with certain qualities: there are other chemical pathways that would have the same effect, but these are still cheaper.

       Dmt has taught me many invaluable lessons.  I've partaken 100+ times and I still havent figured it out!  I do have some ideas tho.  For one I think our nervous system and brain has the ability to process a mind boggling amount of stimuli, like everything everywhere all at once.  But you can't function as a person when you are one with the universe so your body down regulates this information to give you the world you see around you.  I think among many things dmt blast away that information barrier so your nervous system can take in info at full capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is evidence to support this because recently there was research done where they hooked people up to EEG machines and gave them dmt.  The result is a certain frequency band in the brain drops to nothing for the extent of the trip, basically dissolving the self-immposed barrier between you and the rest of the universal energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the grand conspiracy IMO, hiding the true potential of our highly advanced nervous system and consciousness.  And when they can't hide the evidence completely they twist it to make people go astray, look what happened during the psychedelic revolution, these substances can be used to deceive rather than enlighten so beware!

       No i actually have done alot of it. I probably came off as bragging but I was just being factual.  It kind of happened on accident, I had a handful of friends who all wanted a gram of dmt (so they thought) so I acquired 8 grams total to divvy out to everyone. Then one by one as I tried to give each person the dmt they backed out! So I was left with 8 solid grams to myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do the math there are 20 50mg doses per gram and most of my trips were not full on breakthrough so they were much less than 50mg.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am in good mental health and have come along way. I can't say it was all good as I did go thru a period of over use and was subsequently shut out for a period of time. That is crazy in itself because you can smoke a Huge amount and only have slight visual disturbances it's like the dmt decided not to let you in. Very odd.

       I called it, you aren't doing it right.  You probably put it in a pipe with marijuana which burns at a temperature to hot for DMT and melts it.  If you actually vaped DMT at the proper temperature or injected it you would never have done it 100 times.

       Lol everytime except once that ive done it (a dozen times or so) ive done the pot bed. It doesnt melt the dmt. Youre not supposed to keep the flame on long thats why you make it a bed sandwiched between the matress of weed and the thin blanket.

       You have no clue how to use DMT.  If you vaporized it on a nail or quartz banger, using an infrared temperature laser when you heated up, it would be a whole different experience.  You just have no clue.

       I've also partaken over 100 times. Not every time a breakthrough, but easily have done sub breakthrough doses that way.

       It's not that absurd. You can easily induce a heavy shroom-ish trip for 15 minutes and sometimes that's all that's needed/wanted.

       What is, seriously, the benefit of DMT.  What changes, actually (not just in how you feel temporarily)?  How do people actually change, in terms of their permanent behavior and opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, THC is not a natural compound in the body.  THC interferes with a system designed for another chemical which is natural in the body.  The system was discovered while researching THC, and so that's why it's named after cannabinoids.  Your body didn't evolve to use THC.
      </p>
      <p>
       DMT might be endogenous to the body, as far as I know, though, this is just a "theory".
      </p>
      <p>
       If DMT is actually produced in the pineal gland as speculated, then what is it's role?
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with drug users is they're a bit like shaman.  Snake oil.  Weed smokers who constantly forget that you called to hang out, but then forget that they forgot to the point where they don't even believe you that you called, or at least don't remember.  That is, they are unaware of a change in their behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can't see atoms with our eyes, and direct experience, but we assume they exist because of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drug users assume things about their experiences because of how they felt, but until these ideas are backed by evidence, then all they're proof of is that drugs alter your perceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding is that DMT affects your perception of yourself and the universe.  That doesn't change the universe at all, but it makes you feel like something has changed (when it really hasn't).  Perhaps a good depression treatment or something, but I'm skeptical of the value of the crystal elves.

       It is not just a theory. It is known to be produced in the liver and brain. The only theory part is that its also produced in the pineal gland. And thats backed up by rat experiments.

       Go research dmt yourself. No one is going to spell it out to you. Its your journey. Bur you may as well stay away. Youre too closed minded and still believe reefer madnessesque propaganda. Dmt won't ever work to you. Part of the requirements to break through are giving yourself over to the chemical. You wont be able to do that. Might as well not even try it

       I'm surprised not to many people know this but if anyone is interested in having more than a 10min trip on DMT I highly recommend snorting 100mg or more. It will burn for a little bit but the trip last for 45mins and I can't even explain how far you go past the waiting room when you're trip last 45mins.

       The chemicals are common chemicals you can get off Amazon and the bark you can get from American farmers so you dont have to deal with customs issues.

       I don't use "drugs" except cannabis (i wont incriminate myself) however i have done things without drugs. Channeling is one, but there are so many you can do without "drugs". Even being an enpath is not that hard. It is really easy to be psychic

       Meditating is a way I've tried. It was unsuccessful. I found success smoking weed tho and I have friends who also have had  experienced it through LSD. Reading your post and thinking about my experiences and my friends. It makes me think. My first time dropping LSD I told my friend who was watching over me "Everything is one" I believe every human is connected through the conscious mind. I also think because DMT is found in the brain the key to unlocking the full potential of the brain is through DMT use.

       Your christ consciousness khudalini can be activated with nothing but conscious intention. DMT would probably speed it along but it is not always needed.

       Okay yeah, I kind of compared my LSD trip to E+shrooms x 3, I felt a come up, multiple peaks (different from E as it’s normally 1 peak unless you redose)  very intense put peaceful, dependent on environments. Time was fucked for me lol 10 minutes sometimes was 1 hour in my head (albeit I was stressed out about appearing normal in public) but it seems to warp. Yeah Lucy makes you go through each step individually in your mind haha. Yeah I tripped for 12 hours almost (probably from the interval dose?) and it seemed like such a long time to where I’m really holding onto my other tabs due to a little reservation. But I just want a good environment for the next time.

       Dude this sounds like my girlfriend. I’m out here rooting for you too. I honestly felt like I’ve already known that exact thought and this is just a confirmation of patterns in different lies. Good for you bro. I’m glad you’re still in it.

       Think of a rock polisher, one of those drums, goes round and round, rolls twenty-four/seven, full of water and rocks and gravel. Grinding it all up. Round and round. Polishing those ugly rocks into gemstones. That’s the earth. Why it goes around. We’re the rocks. And what happens to us—the drama and pain and joy and war and sickness and victory and abuse—why, that’s just the water and sand to 
erode us. Grind us down. To polish us up, nice and bright."

       An example of this can be for religious people and atheists. Even though we live on the same planet, people of different groups have a totally different view on reality.

       You're probably referring to a stupid cigarette vaporizer.

       You have no clue how to use DMT.  If you vaporized it on a nail or quartz banger, using an infrared temperature laser when you heated up, it would be a whole different experience.  You just have no clue.
