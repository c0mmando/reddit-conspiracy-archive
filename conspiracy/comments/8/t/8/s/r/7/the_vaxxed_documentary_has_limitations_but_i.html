       Vaccine Ingredients Can Cause Harm
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the eighteenth century, vaccinations have prevented significant numbers of people from becoming ill. Vaccines can contain different ingredients that can cause various side effects. Aluminum adjuvants and Thimerosal have been proven to cause neurological damage (Dórea 927-938). A scientist with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that a specific vaccine can be attributed to causing autism (Thompson). The number of vaccine doses a country administers to its infants correlates with that country’s infant mortality rate (Goldman and Miller 1420-1424). Although vaccinations are not inherently harmful, vaccines can contain ingredients that harm people in a statistically significant manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the earliest vaccinations for smallpox was performed in England by Edward Jenner on James Phipps in 1796. Edward Jenner would expose a person to cowpox, which subsequently inoculated that individual to smallpox in a manner that involved little risk; cowpox is relatively mild compared to smallpox (Rusnock 19). Since then, science has allowed for new vaccinations and vaccination ingredients to emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern vaccines use different ingredients, such as adjuvants. Aluminum is used as an adjuvant because it stimulates the immune system’s response to an antigen (Dey and Srivastava 1466). According to Dórea, who wrote a paper on the neurological effects of Thimerosal, studies involving mice have demonstrated that exposure to aluminum adjuvants and Thimerosal are consistently correlated with neurological damage. He stated that, “it is worth mentioning that the brain of adult mice can accumulate substantial amounts of Al derived from vaccines . . . indeed, adjuvant-Al provoked significant impairments in motor functions and diminished spatial memory capacity” (927-938). Furthermore, studies have shown that there is a link between vaccine ingredients and neurological damage in humans. Thimerosal is a molecule containing mercury that is added to vaccines as a preservative. Children that have been exposed to mercury from Thimerosal-containing Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines within the first fifteen months of life are significantly correlated with a diagnosis for a pervasive developmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorders, compared to controls (Geier et al. 34). This shows that there is substantial evidence to suggest that Thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a study to investigate a possible link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Dr. William Thompson was a Senior Scientist at the CDC and was involved in the study that was published in 2004 that concluded that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. In August 2014, Dr. Thompson stated in an online Morgan Verkamp press release that, “I regret that my coauthors and I omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal
       <em>
        Pediatrics
       </em>
       . The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism . . . I believe that the final study protocol was not followed” (Thompson). According to Dr. Thompson, the CDC study originally did find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. The article creates concerns with regards to medical ethics because it was published without the data that demonstrates that the MMR vaccine causes autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Goldman and Miller have identified that countries that give greater vaccine doses to infants also have a higher infant mortality rate. This correlation can be observed when vaccination requirements and recommendations were increasingly introduced in the US during the 1960s. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was a term that emerged in the late 1960s to describe an increasing medical phenomenon. There is some evidence linking SIDS to vaccines. Two-thirds of babies that have died from SIDS received the diphtheria–pertussis–tetanus toxoid (DPT) vaccination prior to death. Seventy percent of those deaths occurred within three weeks after being vaccinated against DPT (1420-1424). Not only is there a link between vaccine ingredients and autism in infants, there is also an association between vaccine ingredients and sudden infant death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccine is an important technology that can safely benefit society. Modern vaccine ingredients, such as Thimerosal and aluminum, are consistently associated with harm. It would be ideal for future vaccine research and development to aspire to achieve safer vaccine ingredients than the ones used today.

       ? accountid=11824. This article concerns the importance of effective adjuvants in vaccine  research and development. Dey and Srivastava describe different adjuvants and the  resulting immune system responses. As a result, the article explains the purpose of an  adjuvant in vaccines. Since modern vaccines use adjuvants, that ingredient should be  explained considering it is relevant.

       ? accountid=11824. This article indicates that infants can develop a pervasive  developmental disorder, such as autism, if they have received a Thimerosal-containing  vaccine. Controls were used in the study, which establishes credibility for the article.  Geier et al. study data suggests that Thimerosal is correlated with neurological harm.

       They did the defaming all by themselves.
       <br/>
       Mark Geier lacks any background or training in any field of biomedicine related to vaccines and was stripped of his license to practice medicine.
       <br/>
       And his son, David Geier, who is not a physician of any kind was charged with practicing medicine without a license.
       <br/>
       Yet you claim they 'establish credibility'?

       Really!?

       If I recall correctly, they found that 99&amp;#37; of the pervasive developmental disorders were autism and that it was damage resulting from vaccines. The study used controls, which minimizes the possibility for limitations in data. What is wrong with the study?

       1) The study was published in a poorly peer-reviewed pay-to-play low impact journal
       <br/>
       2) All of the authors are unqualified to discuss immunology, virology, epidemiology, microbiology, vaccines, and public health.
       <br/>
       3) Two of the authors have been in trouble with legal authorities for pushing a dangerous and harmful “cure” for autism.
       <br/>
       4)
       <a href="https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/vaccines-and-autism-science-unrelated/">
        Vaccines do not cause autism

        Thiomersal does not cause autism
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       6) The paper presents not one single bit of primary research data that supports an alternative hypothesis, that vaccines and thiomersal cause autism. NONE.
       <br/>
       7) They are charlatans. They violated all aspects of the physician oath of “do no harm.” It is irresponsible that any journal, even a low ranked, barely credible, barely cited journal would publish any article that had the Geiers as co-authors. It’s not just the pro-science/pro-vaccination crowd despise them–it’s that the whole medical community despises them, and they have lost their licenses (well, the one that’s a real M.D.) to practice their snake oil medicine.

       Friendly reminder that Mark Geier has had his medical license revoked or suspended in every state. Partly because he claimed to be a certified geneticist and epidemiologist despite having no training or education in those topics whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy is a sham. You may say that we are just name calling or thowing slurs at him, but science is a peer-reviewed process in which many experts overlook each publication to try and avoid blatant lies from spreading. It is by this process of selection that liars like him are weeded out of the process.

       They fooled my sister into getting a flu shot even after I recommended that she watch Vaxxed and read my paper. She did neither and declared that she believes in vaccines. Plus, Publix gave her a $10 gift card to get a flu shot! She proudly announced, "Oh I got my flu shot!". They have to pay people to get vaccines nowadays!
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly doubt that she will suffer significant neurological impacts from that flu shot that most assuredly contained Thimerosol. The main concern is with infants. However, I did find out that vaccines also interfere with the T-cells in the body so that the immune system doesn't respond to viruses correctly.

       This issue has been carefully crafted into a false dichotomy. It’s a very complex science but they push it into an oversimplified pro vs anti debate. A simple vaccine good vs vaccine bad. The science of vaccination has probably saved more lives than maybe anything since pasteurization. So if it’s a simple binary debate, they can’t lose. These big Pharmaceutical companies don’t have to answer complex questions about ingredients, they don’t have to explain why a small number of people have been injured by vaccines. Their own documentation, written by their own doctors show these. Rather than arguing that these cases are extremely rare and that vaccination is a risk but very much worth taking, they just outright deny.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they know some people will find these cases and raise questions. They call them “Anti-vaxxers” to discredit them but also to stir fear in the rest of the public. They don’t want to expose the problems created by their constant reformulations of vaccines,  that they create to game the patent system. I think this is a big part of why we have so many multiple vaccine shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to cultivate public fear in order to get the sheep crying for government to make their product a mandatory product therefore guaranteeing their profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not anti-vaccine by any means but to say that they are all perfectly harmless is absolutely insane. It’s crazy not to vaccinate, but it’s also crazy to blindly believe big pharma.

       YOU dear OP rock! Any reason you left out Squalene, though? Though we have it naturally in our own bodies, INJECTING it or any other oil for that matter, causes huge problems, ala MOMA (molecular mimicry), severe auto-immune reactions. It was in the anthrax vaccine administered during the gulf war.
