       The government is corrupt, we all know. They are owned by a family of banks, rotheschilds,etc.
This could get extremely deep - ie - nasa are hiding the fact that aliens control earth and they are running the banks/ rothschilds
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a theory. Just like gravity is :) we know that the nuclues of an atoms stays the centre and electrons revolve around it, same principals goes to the solar system how it works, but yet we cant prove the force of gravity or why this happens, its because we are living inside a virtual reality simulation - and our universe has preset principles( the laws of the universe, theres only like 7 laws that control every atom &amp; every star in the universe-
We take these same laws, same mass of universe and simulate it in a computer today- you can get a universe that looks like ours. With atoms that act the same, and then eventually life that will evolve the same
.
What i believe , is another foreign civilisation created earth to inhabit life,to ensure it goes on or whatever reasons they have,
      </p>
      <p>
       How we are in a simulation, multiple reasons are possible, probably we live forever and come here, or we are slaved by ai and trapped here
      </p>
      <p>
       Do your own research , im not forcing a view into your head, come to your own conclusion . Im just getting information out before augmented VR takes over and we will never ever know a cgi faked video to a real live HD video.

       Do you believe flat earth and that NASA lies, OP? I encourage you to go camping and stare at the night sky rather than feeding your paranoia. You can literally observe satellites and the ISS with the naked eye tracking across the night sky. Additionally, the stars/constellations rotate in the sky as the Earth spins. I'm sure flat earthers have an explanation for all that... but yeah. Plenty of real conspiracies are real... just not this one.

       I’ve seen whatever is supposed to be the ISS and I didn’t need a telescope. This is already suspect for an object the size of a jumbo jet that’s allegedly 200 miles up. If orbiting satellites existed they would certainly not be visible to a naked eye.

       You aren't viewing the material of the satellite from that far. You're viewing the sun's light being reflected off of it. Much like a tiny signal mirror is used to reflect the sun's light for miles.

       Let's stick with the car sized mirror being in the night sky "300 miles away" and yes of course. Consider that you can see stars in the night sky but not during the day. It's a pretty important factor.

       So, something that is 300 miles away from one side of the earth is supposed to reflect the light of a luminous body 93,000,000 miles away from the other side of the earth, when there’s a giant earth-sized, um, Earth in the way?

       When the orbit brings the satellite/object into the correct position to reflect the light you will see it. It appears like a dim star moving across the sky in a straight trajectory. You may eventually see it disappear or lose track of it due to the angle of reflection changing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage you to try it for yourself.

       Thanks for that. It shows that a satellite reflecting the sun’s light would not be visible from the dark side (night) of the earth.

       I don’t see satellites. Whatever I saw when and where the ISS was supposed to be, I don’t have to know in order to know that the videos of astronauts on the ISS are filmed on earth and/or in planes, and they are not actually conducting business aboard an orbiting space station.

       So despite the mountains of evidence over the past sixty years, spanning multiple generations, countries and governments, and despite your own observations of seeing things floating in orbit, you still refuse to believe there’s such things as satellites?
      </p>
      <p>
       So how does GPS work if there are no satellites?  And where do all these pictures of the earth from space come from?  And how did google maps take pictures of every inch of the earth from space?  And where do those rockets go that I’ve seen launch with my own eyes?  How do you explain how I’ve been able to bounce a laser beam off of the moon and measure its return?

Flat earth is highly and probably more possibly than the current theory- mixed with the simulation theory its more possible again

       The flat earth model makes more sense than the globe model earth; 
Plane routes and times,
All weathering maps (theres a site showing all heat, wind, gravitational energy, data in the FE and globe model, clearly the FE model makes more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ONLY way the earth is flat, is if aliens/gods have created it, or our ancestors created it to enhabit life (think thats not possible? Well theres more of a chance of that happening than what scientists say what happened. (Big bang, evolution)
Not saying the big bang and evolution is incorrect, just stating the earth is flat, and designed.
Aliens/ ancestors is highly possible, but then the simulation theory comes in, and everything we see. Is just data and code, turning into realtime video (virtual reality) the same way minecraft renders the gameplay in first person view.
How we know this is because the 'double light slit consciousness experiment' proves this. So we could be playing a super advanced VR game right now, say about 2100 we will have this technology. ( vr that simulates life, and you can enter the game) we could be living in space in that realm and had to simulate life to see and live in it. Why? Because its cheaper than creating a flat earth with real labour, just simulate it and enter the realm with VR . If thats possible immortality is most likely there too.

       I pretty much disagree with everything you just said. The Earth being a globe makes more sense scientifically and from the standpoint of Simulated reality. Why would you make a world with edges? If it has no edges - is it infinite? I guess I don't know enough about Flat Earth to critique it appropriately. It just seems absurd to me being that I can literally see the cosmos spinning at night. I can literally see satellites in the sky, meteors etc. The sunrise and sunset and on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Flat Earth is meant to discredit forums like this so as to minimize true productive discussion.

       Nope, the textus receptus and it's lineage was the one being purified into the KJV just as god tells us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psa_12:6  The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
      </p>
      <p>
       All all that came before it are less pure and all that have come after it are Jesuit influenced deceptions.
      </p>

       God gives people what they want.  For instance people like you want to be deceived and not believe in him.  That's why he allows Lucifer to be the god of this world.  He is your spiritual father after all.

       As soon as you said "Just a theory. Just like gravity is :)" I knew you were an idiot and you don't know what you're talking about. Theory is a scientific term, very disimlar to the way you used it. Literally just to prove the force of gravity, all you have to do is look around us. That's the proof, explaining exactly why that happens, it's all to do with mass, but why does this mean the larger masses attract other mass I don't exactly know, but you're an idiot for saying this is a theory, just like gravity, thinking they are in anyway the same.

Gravity takes place on a fundamental level, everything attracts other things, only when the mass of a thing is great enough will this effect be seen.

       Gravity itself is an observable force, one which is demonstrated in life everyday, with everything we do. Designing cars? Buildings? gravity is taken into account, strength of materials and the finished piece must be able to withstand it's own gravity, otherwise it fails.

       I'm talking about your religion here (gravity).  You have no evidence that mass attracts other mass, you simply believe it based on what people have told you.  Yes, we can all observe that things are pulled down by some force but you assert it's because of mass.  There is absolutely zero evidence of this.  It's simply your faith because without it, your entire worldview falls apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again a downward force isn't the definition of gravity.  Gravity is specifically related to mass.  It's a fantasy that only exists in your mind.

       We actually have tremendous amounts of evidence that mass attracts other mass but you dismiss it because it relies on science. And what would you propose the reason why things are pulled down/towards one-another if not because off their mass and gravity acting upon them?
      </p>

       It's a logical reasoning we give to something in order to explain it without diving into the mythical and fantastical of your bibles.

       For one obvious instance, which you'll no doubt disregard because "there is no outer-space", but mass attracting other mass is what created everything, because of it we have earth, we have planets, we have a solar system, we have stars, we have this and all other galaxies because of a universal force of gravity (and probably anti-matter). Gravity is what caused oh so long ago for the dust in this universe, to colide, collect, and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, so you are quite the idiot then. If we have a clear up, is it still the same up from one side of the earth, or are they different 'UPs' and 'DOWNs'? does one person standing on the earth, pointing to the sky, point the same up as someone on the other side of the planet? or is it because of the planet itself, with it's gravity holding everything in place and down is towards the earth and up being to the sky and beyond?

       This perfectly sums up your false religion.  Gravity IS your God.  All you do is spew a bunch of Kabbalistic nonsense (without even realizing it because of your brainwashing) as "proof."
      </p>
      <p>
       You also believe people are standing upside down on the bottom of a spinning wet ball.  The earth is flat and motionless.  There is one up. Everyone is standing the exact same way all across the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be in your cult so I understand where you are coming from.  Just realize you are in the most successful false religion of all time that just happens to be the easiest one to prove false.

       If anyone know david sereda he explains how all matter in the universe is sffected bylike 6 laws of the universe &amp; shows the geometry of this outcome in star systems and galaxies
One law is , no atom/electron can touch another

      <p>
       Another is the nucleus stays the centre of an atom and has the same mass of its surrounding electrons - ? 
The nucleus at the centre means or sun has the same mass as all our planets combined, to achieve the gravitational pull?

       Gravity is an observable

       in our solar system. We haven't found a direct evidence for a

       . We just have theories how the effect is caused.

       Outside of our own solar system we can hardly look close enough and on a global scale they even had to invent the 20th century's "Aether" called "Dark Matter" to fill the deep holes in their theories.

       You just said the “proof” of gravity is objects falling to the ground. Ok, fine, that means there’s a force that makes relatively massive objects fall down. It says nothing about objects with mass attracting other objects with mass.

       That still doesn’t mean that attraction force is in any way proportional to an objects mass. You can’t demonstrate it with any other objects.

       You can though, gravity affects everything, and I mean everything, it even affects light and time, it may be in the smallest amount but it does and that's proof enough. Time dilation through gravity can be observed with massive objects, let's say, the pyramids, they have considerable mass compared to other areas, and therefore distort that which is around it slightly. If you time yourself and another person, the longer you're closer to the larger amount of mass the less time has passed, it is only fractions of a second but it happens. Look up gravitational time dilation.

       first you cant call him an idiot because he stated its a theory, it is call "The Theory of gravity" not proven, and you cant offer a proof by just stating look around you thats not an answer. He made a statement and because you dont agree you try and make him seem like an idiot. do research fool prove all things or keep quiet.

       No, his initial statement, claiming that his theory and the theory of gravity fall into the same categories of theories is stupid and incorrect. And if you seriously don't believe that gravity is real then you are just hopeless. I'm not trying to make him seem like anything, if he comes across as an idiot then it's his words. I do do my research, it appears you do not. 'unappreciated_genius' yeah right.

       Gravity isnt a force, its an effect, or whatever
If we are in a simulation, and they inputted mathmatical code to interact with matter, (atoms) i dont know the laws of the dome, but einstein wrote about them and they are known, so the only way matter throughout the entire universe is all controlled by a few rules and cides, then this means gravity is caused by one,
Flat earth says its because we are in a domed environment ( scientists say stratosphere) because all the atoms inside this dome including the atoms inside us, are affected by density and only density, u dont float in water and fall from the sky because of gravity

       A question here, what would be the reason for pretending that we cannot go into low earth orbit? Low earth orbit is basically available for very cheap, there are hundreds of experiments being launched every year where small universities and such launch micro-satellites into orbit. How are they faking all of the data returned by these micro-satellites?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is too much data being produced to fool everyone, I do not believe that low earth orbit is impossible.

       They fake it all to discredit Genesis chapter 1.  When one belies all of their lies one can logically conclude that the word of God is wrong.  Even for those who have faith, it causes them to misinterpret things and creates false doctrine as they think these things are metaphors and therefore anything their indoctrinated human mind disagree with can be called a metaphor.

       on the contrary, religion exists because human-like creatures came from outer space to our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elohim = gods. Anunnaki = Those who came from heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are more but I don't have the time at the moment. but pretty much all the ancient writings talk about beings who came to Earth from the stars. and naturally, the primitive cultures at the time created religions out of these events because they had no understanding of what they were seeing/experiencing.

       That may be true, and I entertain those ideas myself. However the person I was replying to is talking about "the word of god", There is no such thing as "the word of god". God is as imaginary as aliens, and I choose to believe in a more advanced civilization (aliens able to travel to our planet) out there than I do something that cannot be imagined in science (a "person" that created a world which is proven by all means we can accomplish to be much older than the "scriptures" say).
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know, I guess, or most of us don't know. But I think we can all agree that, I guess what you are talking about is the Christian god. There are so many gods available to us - why is one god above another, or more important or real that some other god? Science has only one result.

       i see what you mean. yes no one can know for sure, but that's the convenient thing about faith and belief. in order to be religious, you have to put blind faith in something that cannot really be proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       personally, after being agnostic for 20+yrs, I tend to lean in the direction of a deist/pantheistic/pastafarian viewpoint. especially after seeing the computer models that show that the multiverse and the neuron arrangement of the brain are strikingly similar:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       briefly, here's my take: there is an ultra-gigantic flying spaghetti monster who's brain is made up of multiverses, our universe, our millions of galaxies/stars/planets. when our thoughts and actions line up with its own, we are following Natural Law and can do cool Jedi things with The Force. the spaghetti monster doesn't directly interact with us, because to do-so would cause too much destruction. (think, trying to do brain surgery on yourself..even if you could do it, you know it'd be a mess by the time you're done.)
      </p>
      <p>
       but yeah i totally get what you're saying. i don't believe for a second that the OT god is the legit supreme creator of everything. way too demanding of destruction. and i will never ever get over how "do not kill/murder" is one of the 10 Commandments when just like 50 pages or so later, god is telling the israelites to go to war and start chopping off dicks (foreskins) of the enemy. like come on..war involves killing. make up your damn mind...

       Biblical literalism is on the rise due to people waking up to the reality of the flat earth and the fact "outer space" is a complete hoax.  Both of these truths are supported in scripture.  Only people who have been forced to reconcile their brainwashed, indoctrination with their understanding of scripture can't see this.

       I discovered the flat earth and fake "outer space" before becoming a "religious nutter."  You have to admit to yourself if you knew you were in a flat, enclosed terrarium that we couldn't escape from ant here was nothing else but lights in the dome above it would drastically change your worldview.  The reason they lie about all this is to create your particular impression of the Bible.  Seriously research it for the sake of your eternal soul:

       Thats explained by atmospheric pressure changes 
Blue sky is blue because of a dome shape , refracting just the blue light back to us, 
Sundogs &amp; rainbows are an affect of the dome
The dome was nuked about 10 times,
The moon&amp; sun is within the dome, clearly they both share the same electromagnetic paths, positive and negative, if you assume the moon is the hour clock, the sun is the minute clock, the flat earth map then exactly tells the time based where the sun and moon equinoxs are,

       Youtube search " astronaugts on strings "
We probably went to the moon, once or twice. Not 30 times, the main point is we have been lied to and are still being scammed tax money, every country is doing it. Stealing. Thats the main point and thats how we end a very small part of the fraud the government commits against us.

       So you mock it due to the theory changing over the years? That is exactly how science works, unlike say the bible which has been proven to be utter bs time and time again
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not claiming science has got everything right, everyone who understands it ought not to claim that. However the process is the best way to get the truth

       Your comment perfectly shows that you don't understand the science of it.

       There are things that support the theory. Also we can't quite know 100% but science works by having a theory and seeing if there is evidence to support it/contradict it

       You have nothing specific! Of course the main stream scientific community discredits the Bible, it goes against their stupid theory. You still have yet to show me evidence of the Big Bang. I’m not responding anymore due to you being an indoctrinated fucking retard.

       All you have is assumptions!  I have studied religion, I know what I believe. I have studied the big bang and it’s all assumptions, just like you, just like science. You have nothing and you’re trying to defend nothing. You are delusional, you are willingly ignorant.

       The flat earth debate highly considers the globe earthers "ballers" to use science, as yes you have been decieved with false data. Cbf explaining it as there is no point trying to convince you, basically the solar system is s theory, the angles and distances aren't proven, the flat earth actually explains everything, both theories cant be proven wrong as both theories work out due to scale, there was an experiment with 3 shadow angles in an equalateral triangle(assuming a flat earth) it proves the sun is 5000 miles high

       So the hundreds of versions before it and after it were all a scam?  Wasn’t the KJB based on previous translations of these other scams?  Why the fuck would your pretend god allow that?  Seems like a shitty god to me.

       That may be true, and I entertain those ideas myself. However the person I was replying to is talking about "the word of god", There is no such thing as "the word of god". God is as imaginary as aliens, and I choose to believe in a more advanced civilization (aliens able to travel to our planet) out there than I do something that cannot be imagined in science (a "person" that created a world which is proven by all means we can accomplish to be much older than the "scriptures" say).

       We don't know, I guess, or most of us don't know. But I think we can all agree that, I guess what you are talking about is the Christian god. There are so many gods available to us - why is one god above another, or more important or real that some other god? Science has only one result.
