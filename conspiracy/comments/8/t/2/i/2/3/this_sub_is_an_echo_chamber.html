<p>No, its not. This is the primary defense that the pro-NWO shills use against Pizzagate. There is a Uniparty consisting of both &quot;Democrats&quot; and &quot;Republicans,&quot; and they are all implicated.Stop worrying about whether a conspiracy theory might hurt &quot;your team.&quot; You&#39;re doing us all a disservice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, you just can&#39;t help yourself. It always has to be about Trump with you people. If you want to think Trump is implicated, you can.

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think Trump is involved in pizzagate. Because pizzagate bullshit made up to attack people that Trump supporters dont like.

<p>Because the line between conspiracy and propogada is much thicker than people realize.  So when you believe a conspiracy that has been proven demonstrably false 100x over, you&#39;re no longer a conspiracy theorist but a propaganda machine.  Flat Earth is one of those topics that fall under propoganda, and reading the 100th post citing the horribly-misinterpreted Michaelson-Morley experiment is annoying.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it has been proven false many times over by several fields of science.  Science isn&#39;t a strawman just because it&#39;s too hard for you to understand.  Are you one of those who don&#39;t understand the Michael-Morley experiment too?  </p>

<p>Well over 99% of people with degrees in science is &#39;buying my shit&#39;, but feel free to convince yourself that we&#39;re all &#39;trills&#39; while you  better because of some YouTube propaganda you watched.  </p>

<p>Well luckily that &#39;we&#39; is like 100000 people doing nothing in the real world.  BTW, your shitposting is only possible based on satellites, EM propagation theory, and sereral other things that wouldn&#39;t work if the earth was flat.  But please continue, your stupidity is hilarious!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While subs operate on the basis of shared interests and commonality, there&#39;s a difference between a group of unique individuals sharing a passion for a given thing and a community where dissenting opinions are silenced and heterogeneity isn&#39;t allowed. Granted someone who has no interest in conspiracies probably doesn&#39;t belong here, but people who are interested in conspiracies have differing viewpoints and may not agree with others. Subs shouldn&#39;t be echo chambers because even in a specific field, people aren&#39;t going to think of everything the same way. </p>

<p>I believe you&#39;re trying to simplify things a little too much here. Mass media is more echo chamber-y in the sense that the content needs to be approved by someone to make sure it conforms to the standards of the given outlet. In a forum, content isn&#39;t as policed and people can weigh in. Reddit is imperfect because people use the downvote as a silencing function, but this sub isn&#39;t an echo chamber just because the fact its an online forum</p>

<p>Repent and believe to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>
