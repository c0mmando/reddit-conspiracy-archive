<h1>The Conspiracy</h1>

<p><strong>&quot;In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that ...the threat of global warming, ..would fit the bill. ...caused by human intervention, the real enemy then, is humanity itself.&quot;</strong> - Club of Rome</p>

<p>The environmental movement has been described as the largest and most influential social phenomenon in modern history. From relative obscurity just a few decades ago it has spawned thousands of organisations and claims millions of committed activists. Reading the newspaper today it is hard to imagine a time when global warming, resource depletion, environmental catastrophes and &#39;saving the planet&#39; were barely mentioned. They now rank among the top priorities on the social, political and economic global agenda.</p>

<p>Environmental awareness is considered to be the mark of any good honest decent citizen. Multi-national companies compete fiercely to promote their environmental credentials and &#39;out-green&#39; each other. The threat of impending ecological disasters is uniting the world through a plethora of international treaties and conventions. But where did this phenomenon come from, how did it rise to such prominence, and more importantly, where is it going?</p>

<p>While researching for these articles, and during my academic studies, I have come across many references to the The Club of Rome (CoR), and reports produced by them. Initially I assumed that they were just another high-level environmental think-tank and dismissed the conspiracy theories found on many websites claiming that the CoR is a group of global elitists attempting to impose some kind of one world government.</p>

<p>I am not a conspiratorial person by nature and was faced with a dilemma when I first read their reports. But it&#39;s all there - in black and white. The CoR claims that &quot;we are facing an imminent catastrophic ecological collapse&quot; and &quot;our only hope is to transform humanity into a global interdependent sustainable society, based on respect and reverence for the Earth.&quot; In the end I came to the conclusion that there are two possibilities – either the CoR wrote all these reports and setup a vast network of supporting organisations just for fun or they actually believe what they have written and are working hard to fulfill their role as the self-appointed saviors of Gaia.</p>

<p>Many years ago H.L. Mencken warned us of this technique. Of course not referring to current day climate hysteria, he know how the elites attempt to control the populous.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed — and hence clamorous to be led to safety — by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false face for the urge to rule it.&quot;</strong>
-H.L. Mencken:</p>

<p>Based on my close observation of their actions, and watching the recommendations made by the CoR many years ago now being adopted as official UN and government po</p>

<h1>So, what exactly is the Club of Rome and who are its members?</h1>

<p>Founded in 1968 at David Rockefeller’s estate in Bellagio, Italy, the CoR describes itself as &quot;a group of world citizens, sharing a common concern for the future of humanity.&quot; It consists of current and former Heads of State, UN beaureacrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe.</p>

<p>The Club of Rome subsequently founded two sibling organizations, the Club of Budapest and the Club of Madrid. The former is focused on social and cultural aspects of their agenda, while the latter concentrates on the political aspects. All three of these &#39;Clubs&#39; share many common members and hold joint meetings and conferences. As explained in other articles on this website it is abundantly clear that these are three heads of the same beast. The CoR has also established a network of 33 National Associations. Membership of the &#39;main Club&#39; is limited to 100 individuals at any one time. Some members, like Al Gore and Maurice Strong, are affiliated through their respective National Associations (e.g. USACOR, CACOR etc).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html">http://www.green-agenda.com/globalrevolution.html</a></p>

<p>Dr Tim Ball details how the science of climate change came to be “tortured until it fitted in with [the] notion” :</p>

<p><strong>Almost every aspect of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) work is manipulated, selected, and controlled, to prove human CO2 is causing global warming. The objective was to prove the hypothesis, not to perform objective science.</strong> <a href="https://climatism.blog/2014/01/24/in-searching-for-a-new-enemy-to-unite-us-we-came-up-with-the-threat-of-global-warming/">Source</a></p>

<p>This is echoed over and over again in the world of &#39;climate science&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>“Rather than seeing models as describing literal truth, we ought to see them as convenient fictions which try to provide something useful.”</strong>
-David Frame, climate modeler, Oxford University</p>

<p><strong>&quot;It is no secret that a lot of climate-change research is subject to opinion, that climate models sometimes disagree even on the signs of the future changes (e.g. drier vs. wetter future climate). The problem is, only sensational exaggeration makes the kind of story that will get politicians’ — and readers’ — attention. So, yes, climate scientists might exaggerate, but in today’s world, this is the only way to assure any political action and thus more federal financing to reduce the scientific uncertainty.&quot;</strong>
-Monika Kopacz, atmospheric scientist</p>

<p>Assisted by politicians like Al Gore and Tim Wirth, in 1993 the latter did not hide the naked political objective.</p>

<p><strong>“We’ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy.“</strong> – Timothy Wirth, President of the UN Foundation</p>

<p>It was never about the &#39;science&#39;.</p>

<p>They were aided by national weather agencies and bureaucratic scientists with similar political persuasions appointed to the IPCC.</p>

<p>They claimed their goal was achieved in the 2007 IPCC Report which concluded,</p>

<p><strong>“Another unusual aspect of recent climate change is its cause: past climate changes were natural in origin, whereas most of the warming of the past 50 years is attributable to human activities.”</strong></p>

<p>All the CO2 numbers used by the IPCC are very poor estimates and designed to underline the human impact. They are meaningless figures from the total volumes to the annual flows and the human inputs as depicted in the IPCC carbon cycle (diagram). More <a href="http://drtimball.com/2012/ipcc-control-calculations-of-annual-human-co2-production-for-political-agenda/">here</a></p>

<p><strong>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.&quot;</strong>
-Paul Watson, a founder of Greenpeace</p>

<p>IPCC wanted to prove human CO2 was causing global warming as part of their belief that industrialized populations would exhaust all resources and had to be shut down. Their only objective was to show human production was steadily, inexorably increasing. Their calculations predetermine that, because human CO2 production is directly linked to population increase. A population increase guarantees a CO2 increase. It is another of their circular arguments that has no basis in science. <a href="http://drtimball.com/2012/ipcc-control-calculations-of-annual-human-co2-production-for-political-agenda/">Source</a></p>

<p>They admitted as much.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;We routinely wrote scare stories...Our press reports were more or less true...We were out to whip the public into a frenzy about the environment.&quot;</strong>
-Jim Sibbison, environmental journalist, former public relations official for the Environmental Protection Agency</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The only way to get our society to truly change is to frighten people with the possibility of a catastrophe.&quot;</strong>
-Emeritus professor Daniel Botkin</p>

<h1>Human CO2 production is central to the IPCC objective so they control production of the information.</h1>

<p>-Like most things they do it is disclosed, but they know few people realize the significance. The key is to control the process.</p>

<p>They do this through control of methodology, designation of technical advice, establishment of task forces, guidelines for reporting, nomination of experts to produce the reports and final approval of what the reports say. There have been many slip ups when they tell us the real agenda.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have.&quot;</strong>
-Stephen Schneider, Stanford Univ., environmentalist</p>

<p><strong>“The data don&#39;t matter. We&#39;re not basing our recommendations [for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions] upon the data. We&#39;re basing them upon the climate models.”</strong>
-Chris Folland of UK Meteorological Office</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post, though I must disagree.
First of all, every quote listed is a matter of context and perspective to the reader. All of them can be used to support or deny climate change in one way or another. 
Your most convincing quote that climate change is made up is the first one, but I cant help but wonder what else is being said. He sure is correct in Humanity being the real enemy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that...(I wonder what he said here)... the threat of global warming, ...(here)... would fit the bill...(and here)...caused by human intervention, the real enemy then, is humanity itself.&quot; - Club of Rome.
But a lot of these quotes simply point out human behavior much like a conspiracy theorist would.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does however reveal 2 potential motives based on the readers perspective. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.&quot; -Paul Watson, a founder of Greenpeace</p>
</blockquote>

<p>*Climate Change Denier &quot;See It&#39;s fake, he doesn&#39;t care about truth, he&#39;s been peddling a lie about climate change.&quot; 
*Climate Change Believer &quot;I don&#39;t see what that&#39;s got to do with climate change, but he sure is right. If the majority of people believe a lie, then it doesn&#39;t matter what the truth is, because the public acts as if the lie is the truth&quot; </p>

<p>Being an activist is much like being a conspiracy theorist, no one believes you until it is accepted as truth.
Environmental Activists know that humans don&#39;t act unless they have real motivation. Using media tactics to get the public to change their behavior doesn&#39;t say anything about the legitimacy of climate change science. </p>

<p>Climate science is really simple, projections will always be different, some people consider different elements to their model, such as the accelerating factor of ice melt reflecting less sunlight back out each day, or deforestation for the sake of livestock producing meat but also methane. Greenhouse gasses are 100% legitimate science and Humans have been definitely flooding the atmosphere daily with Co2 ever since Coal was utilized for heating. Humanity has know about greenhouse technology for centuries. Greenhouse gases can be measured, temperature can be measured, emissions can be measured, Ice melt can be measured, Ice cores can be measured for historical atmospheric content, Ocean acidity can be measured. Scientific consensus, is not a consensus for nothing.</p>

<p>1.Show that human produced CO2 is the &#39;knob&#39; that controls the planet&#39;s temperature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shows a fundamental misunderstanding about the role of CO2.  The energy in the atmosphere comes from the Sun.  One can have a decrease in Sun activity and have a decrease in temperature even if CO2 levels go up.  One can have CO2 levels go down and Sun activity go up and have increased temperature, and so on.  These are all possible worlds, but in this world, changes in Sun activity do not explain changes in temperature since the second half of the 20th century, changes in greenhouses gases do.  </p>

<p>Do you doubt that there are such a thing as greenhouse gases? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Show that if the planet were to warm a bit (notice how this is different from number 1) that is a bad thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here we see another large misunderstanding, actually two.   The first is that small changes in one variable can have huge changes in ecology, and the second point is that it is the RATE of change matters more than the actual change itself.  If the change is happening over 100,000 years, is fundamentally different than if that change is happening over a decade. </p>

<p>El Nino in 1998 caused a lot of damage, and is responsible for the variation in temperature.  You understand how your point is a statistical artifact, yes? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is just silly at this point. Not only do small variations like this influence crop production, but appealing to an average in this way is just silly.  One can have the highly variable temperature fluctuation that impair the growth of corn during the growing season however, it the yearly mean would only show a difference of 1 degree.   It is literally meaningless. </p>

<p>This is another silly point, Oxygen makes up 21 percent yet it is vital to our ecology and variations would have large consequence.  Moreover, different greenhouses gases have different potency of the greenhouse effect. CO2 is not the only one. </p>

<p>Of course it is, you claimed there was large variation in temperature, that went unnoticed... for a time-period that started in 93 and ends in an El - Nino year.  Furthermore, that was actually expensive in terms of damages.  So I really don&#39;t know what point you are making. </p>

<p>Early in the earth&#39;s history carbon dioxide and methane likely produced a greenhouse effect. The carbon dioxide would have been produced by volcanoes and the methane by early microbes. During this time, earth&#39;s earliest life appeared.[9] These first, ancient bacteria added to the methane concentration by converting hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane and water. Oxygen did not become a major part of the atmosphere until photosynthetic organisms evolved later in earth&#39;s history. With no oxygen, methane stayed in the atmosphere longer and at higher concentrations than it does today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is Increasing CO2 Even Capable of Causing Warming? </p>

<p>There are some very intelligent people out there who claim that adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere can’t cause warming anyway. They claim things like, “the atmospheric CO2 absorption bands are already saturated”, or something else very technical. [And for those more technically-minded persons, yes, I agree that the effective radiating temperature of the Earth in the infrared is determined by how much sunlight is absorbed by the Earth. But that doesn’t mean the lower atmosphere cannot warm from adding more greenhouse gases, because at the same time they also cool the upper atmosphere]. </p>

<p>While it is true that most of the CO2-caused warming in the atmosphere was there before humans ever started burning coal and driving SUVs, this is all taken into account by computerized climate models that predict global warming. Adding more “should” cause warming, with the magnitude of that warming being the real question. But I’m still open to the possibility that a major error has been made on this fundamental point. Stranger things have happened in science before.</p>

<p>My guess is they didn&#39;t adequately account for cloud behavior...</p>

<p>This is typical misinformation from the denial camp. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What seems to have happened at the end of the recent ice ages is that some factor – most probably orbital changes – caused a rise in temperature. This led to an increase in CO2, resulting in further warming that caused more CO2 to be released and so on: a positive feedback that amplified a small change in temperature. At some point, the shrinking of the ice sheets further amplified the warming.</p>

<p>Models suggest that rising greenhouse gases, including CO2, explain about 40% of the warming as the ice ages ended. The figure is uncertain because it depends on how the extent of ice coverage changed over time, and there is no way to pin this down precisely.</p>

<p>Not all temperature changes being caused by CO2 does not entail that CO2 increases do not cause a change in climate. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here we present results of the lowest 200 m of the Dome C ice core, extending the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration by two complete glacial cycles to 800,000 yr before present. From previously published data1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and the present work, we find that atmospheric carbon dioxide is strongly correlated with Antarctic temperature throughout eight glacial cycles but with significantly lower concentrations between 650,000 and 750,000 yr before present.</p>

<p>Models used for predictions approach the final result with varying degrees of accuracy.  They are not wrong, and their accuracy keeps on increasing. </p>

<p>No one is making shit up, except your denialist camp.  You can read the scientific literature on this.  The ice ages are initiated by orbital changes which explain 800 years of warming, followed by 5200 hundred years of warming caused by CO2 increases.   The fact that you somehow think that all temperature variation has to be caused by CO2 betrays your misunderstanding, of which at this point I am starting to suspect is willful. </p>

<p>The theory is that we had an impact. </p>

<p>Do clouds reflect the sun&#39;s energy or trap it? At what rate compared to CO2 or sulfur? If less moisture is trapped in ice we should have more clouds due to more evaporation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not clear on your definitions based on your post. Can you define them within the context of science generally, but without reference to climate change?</p>

<p>I will address this though</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do clouds reflect the sun&#39;s energy or trap it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, definitions are important, e.g., what is a cloud? I&#39;ll use this definition for cloud: &quot;A localized collection of condensed, aerosolized water vapor and particulates.&quot;</p>

<p>Under this definition the answer is both. Clouds contribute the Earth&#39;s albedo, and reflect solar radiation. But they also reflect bact to the surface solar radiation that has penetrated the atmosphere, reached the earth&#39;s surface, and been reflected from the surface. Note that much non-infrared radiation that reaches the earth&#39;s surface is reflected back into the atmosphere as infrared. Infrared radiation is the kind of radiation that raises the temperature of matter (including the atmosphere and surface of the earth).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At what rate compared to CO2 or sulfur? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is too general a question to answer. Water vapor does a good job at keeping infrared radiation between the atmosphere and the surface of the earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If less moisture is trapped in ice we should have more clouds due to more evaporation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This conclusion needs a lot more explanation and evidence for me to accept as true. Like, more clouds relative to what? Plus, there are lots of places for water to be other than either ice or water vapor. For example, oceans. But also, say, biomass. There could also be fewer, but denser (and rainier) clouds.</p>

<p>More importantly, more evaporation (more water vapor) doesn&#39;t necessarily mean more clouds, especially if the atmosphere is warmer. The warmer the air, the more water a given volume can hold as vapor instead of liquid. This is basic chemistry.</p>

<p>As an aside, there is a bigger question you are kind of raising, and that is, what do we owe future generations?</p>

<p>If you could be absolutely certain that you personally were causing global warming, but that no one would feel any adverse effect for 200 years, would you care? Should you?</p>

<p>For me personally, the answer is about being a good Christian, in that I feel obligated by God to make every effort to return creation in better shape than I found it (and that includes God&#39;s children as well as the earth). I also have kids, and want them to be successful, and have healthy kids of their own, and on down the generations. But if I was living only for myself, I might find it hard to justify spending any effort (or making any sacrifice) for the benefit of people down the line.</p>

And no, no all change is leveraged by everyone is incorrect and im a beacon of light, change usually comes from adaptation. just because something is group thinking doesn&#39;t make it incorrect. Sure, there are some absolute dickheads that support global climate change, but, because unlike you, I use logic, I don&#39;t let that get in the way of the facts that you have.

<p>No, I&#39;ll read the article later cuz im playing video games but I think there are still big flaws in data and certain measurements and def some scientists who couldn&#39;t give a shit but using it to make a career.
