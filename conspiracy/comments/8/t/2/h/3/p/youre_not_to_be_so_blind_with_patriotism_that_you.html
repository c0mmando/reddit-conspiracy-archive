<p>You claim to care about the working class, but put an American worker next to an immigrant and you&#39;ll happily slit the former&#39;s throat so the latter can cannibalize the corpse...and you play right into the hands of the rich who would try to seek workers willing to accept the smallest wages possible. Your sympathy has made you an enemy of the working class, the propaganda storm taking place to try and open the borders is an attempt to race wages to the bottom for the profit of the business owners and shareholders that control the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have the power to choose to commit crime to seek money. Your racist sympathy has declared their profit seeking behavior okay because you just care about them more than their victims, who are <em>also</em> working class people.</p>

<p>And you rail against the rich...while supporting wage suppressing measures that will only further concentrate wealth at the top. You don&#39;t really care about rich vs. poor, social justice has placed you in a position to deem American workers as those who have to be sacrificed for the &quot;greater good&quot; of foreign workers, and you act like the profits to employers is just coincidental.

All too common nowadays to ruin the discussion with identity politics. Your reply is full of malicious assumptions that have no base in this conversation.</p>

<p>However one key observation in your post is correct. It is true that the victims are working class people. But you focusing blame on the illegal workers is exactly what is beneficial to the &#39;ruling class&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>Racism is inherent in thr immigration issue. When you think about the worker who is suffering because wages are low, you aren&#39;t picturing a skin color, you&#39;re picturing an &quot;average&quot; American, someone you don&#39;t have to sympathize with. Immigrants, however, are a &quot;special&quot; race, one that has to be uplifted and revered. Social justice clamps onto these people as superior to the &quot;average&quot; American worker because they are from a social group held to be superior in deserving sympathy.</p>

<p>You claim you don&#39;t want the working class fighting one another, but you clearly have chosen one part of the working class to be allowed to cannibalize the other, and you act as though the corporate profits to be gained from wage suppression are coincidental. Why is it that American workers have to &quot;take one for the team&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first point is again making unfounded assumptions and I&#39;m not going to agree. The issue isn&#39;t racial, it&#39;s about class. Atleast it should be, but racism is a great excuse to cause infighting in the lower class.</p>

<p>Also, Americans specifically don&#39;t have to &quot;take one for the team&quot;. They should recognise their own team in the first place and fight against the &#39;opposing&#39; team i.e. those who hold real power. And don&#39;t get me wrong, given the current state of affairs I don&#39;t mean violence by fighting, but political activism and such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we should fight against the business owners....by giving them the wage suppressing cheap labor pool that they want?</p>

<p>The immigrants are the ones cooperating with business owners to cannibalize American workers. The business owners <em>prefer</em> them, because they are willing to work for less. Your idea of class unity is for Americans to sacrifice their future for the well being of people you find more sympathetic (because of their skin color, lets face it) and &quot;coincidentally&quot; let business owners realize ever greater profits.</p>

Immigration made this country great. I&#39;m not saying that the borders should be left wide open, but I think there should be significantly fewer restrictions on immigration and asylum seeking. I think that the way these people are treated is despicable. And I&#39;m honestly not at all concerned about the fact that people are coming here to build a better life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that you have a very naive view of immigration that comes from a good place but just isn&#39;t reasonable. Observably, the majority of these immigrants AREN&#39;T hard working individuals looking for a better life. Some are, don&#39;t get me wrong, but many will simply be looking for financial benefits. To say that immigration made the country great is also misleading, certainly immigration has existed for some time in America&#39;s history but the places that the people came from and the <em>amount</em> of people let in was always far less than what we see today. I do see where you&#39;re coming from and I think it&#39;s noble and kind spirited but it will inevitably lead to the decline of your country and culture.</p>

<p>What evidence do you have to support this? Sounds like maybe you&#39;re pulling it out of your ass?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This metric doesn&#39;t matter much. It&#39;s more important to look at the number of immigrants as a percentage of the population, which was <em>significantly</em> higher in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was this influx of labor that allowed the country to rapidly industrialize, and to develop the strongest economy in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;To work in our factories and farms&quot; do you believe these people working without papers are making the same money as legal residents? They get paid less and lower outher legal labors wages. They come here and live 6 people in a 2 bed apt. (Illegal) have chicken and goats in their garages and backyards (also illegal. don&#39;t tell me they don&#39;t I&#39;ve seen it over and over)
 In the city I&#39;m in every day I see a half dozen scooters and mini bikes, no plates, no helmets, on bike paths. They live the same way they do in their country.
 It&#39;s lowering the standard of living in this city. And everyone in the labor market has to compete with this influx of workers. Someone who is making the effort to come here legally and live by the rules, welcome, become an American, but don&#39;t come here and lower everyone to the living standards of the 3rd world mess that you left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you&#39;re wrong we definitely do live in a zero sum world.</p>

<p>For example jobs they&#39;re not infinite there finite so if you have a hundred jobs and a hundred people it&#39;s all gravy but if you have a hundred jobs and 200 people  a hundred people are going to not have a job then how will they pay for food and shelter? The people with a job will be able to buy a house that people that couldn&#39;t get a job because there&#39;s no more jobs will not be able to buy anything.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not an unlimited amount of homes so for someone to gain a home somebody else must lose a home because I won&#39;t be able to afford it for example someone a low salary job will never be able to afford a house because people that make color salaries will always out bid them.</p>

<p>That is why you see people priced out of their own countries due to foreign investment like in my country of Canada where if you look at Ontario specifically Toronto our housing prices are propped up due to foreign investment meaning that normal citizens can no longer afford to own.</p>

<p>For you and me to have all our cheap stuff someone somewhere is working borderline slave labor so that&#39;s their loss and our gain is cheap things.</p>

<p>By measuring the world around us we are able to refine our models, and thereby make more accurate predictions about future events. This is why we are able to do things like predict major storms days in advance with high degrees of accuracy, for instance. We do this in part by quantifying things - by assigning them numbers. Assumptions aren&#39;t much good for predicting future events, or understanding the world around us.</p>

<p>So numbers are the best we have to go by.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example in tbese eztimates on they spend more then take an illegal will have to work for cash. How much money has American taxpayers lost due to being undercut by Cheap illegal labor?</p>

<p>If I&#39;m an illegal and I&#39;m in a car crash and I break my leg and they take me to the hospital will they treat me? So the question is how much money does America lose to people don&#39;t pay their hospital bills?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are fine questions. I haven&#39;t looked at the research - I&#39;d start there. As long as it&#39;s less than the many billions of dollars that undocumented immigrants pay in taxes, then we&#39;re still in the black.</p>

<p>Do those calculation account how much this american will have to pay to fix his car? Now how often does that happen? The thread has a few instances of it.</p>

<p>It would take 9 million illegals causing 1000 dollars worth of damage to other americans property to erase the taxes they pay.</p>

<p>Plus you can add on variables.</p>

<p>Like hospital visits no one pays. </p>

<p>Grants and tuition scholarships. I memebr one account of an illegal whose been going too school forever on grants 7 degrees. </p>

<p>How many of those exist?</p>

<p>Now extrapolate that?</p>

<p>We also predict major storms with zero accuracy. We just update the prediction when we have information like downgrading or upgrading storms while the originaln projections were wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being an attorney (but agreeing with all comments above yours), I have to respectfully disagree. Morals can change and are a little too different amongst people. The law isn’t designed to be morality or take its place. It’s designed for what the majority of people think is best for the majority of the governed people. Basing laws on morality is how you get Sharia Law. And I mean that truly. Because for MANY folks, morality can’t be separated from their religion. You probably don’t think it’s an issue because your morality isn’t based on any religion, but what you know is objectively right/wrong. I just want to bring up the valid point that not everyone is like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same thing happened under Obama.  This whole media frenzy started when Obama&#39;s former speechwriter tweeted a photo of a child in a detention facility, that turned out to be from 2014.  The difference is that Trump has a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, so now the parents are always arrested, instead of only sometimes under the Obama admin.</p>

<p>Also, the only reason this happens at all is because they cross illegally and then claim asylum when the get caught.  If they don&#39;t claim asylum, they would simply be deported.  Once they claim asylum we can&#39;t deport them unless and until their asylum request is denied.  So the children were housed separately, temporarily, because their parent or parents were in jail awaiting asylum processing.</p>

<p>To hell if that&#39;s not controversial. It is a HUGE crime to cross into a country illegal for literally every other country. The only reason the Democrats want lawlessness on the border is because they&#39;re trying to import voters.</p>

<p>For every other criminal, they get separated from their children. Contempt of court charge where the judge sends me to jail? Trivial crime. Separation from children.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 100% the fault of the parents if they bring their children along while committing a crime. IT IS ENTIRELY THEIR FAULT. For any other parent that takes their kids along on a crime run, we&#39;d sent protective services to protect the children. This is not different in the slightest.</p>

<p>Then we can talk about how 80% of the children involved are not even with their parents, and that a very significant percentage are trafficking. For the latter reason, we should be taking the children and making sure they&#39;re returned to the parents... unlike the Obama administration, who admits they GAVE CHILDREN TO TRAFFICKERS.</p>

<p>Stop ingesting these idiotic propaganda that makes no sense at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because I have thousands of pieces of real evidence, including the Podesta leaks from Wikileaks. There are an unprecedented number of sealed indictments around the country. We have tons of evidence of corruption in the Clinton Foundation. We&#39;ve known for a year and a half that the Russian Narrative was complete bullshit, and now the IG report proves it (letting the normies catch up somewhat). Literally the Hillary campaign paid for it, the DOJ and FBI used it to spy on the Trump campaign, and even planted spies within the campaign. The arrogance of these people is completely beyond belief.</p>

<p>Go look at the pictures that were collected from the PizzaGate instagram, and THEN tell me there&#39;s nothing going on.</p>

<p>Finally, whether Q is a LARP or not, research all the questions that he asks. The information is out there. If you do that, and start putting the pieces together, you will shake your head at the absolutely <em>insane</em> level of corruption that&#39;s right in front of our eyes. They are so brazen, because they had the FBI and DOJ in their pocket, along with MSM who refuses to report anything damaging to leftists.</p>

<p>When you start peeling back the layers... it&#39;s just mind boggling how much is publicly known, yet it was just... ignored. I&#39;m not talking wild conspiracies, I&#39;m talking in-your-fucking-face corruption and they just laugh about it.</p>

<p>The only thing that keeps me sane is that as you&#39;re peeling back the layers, you <em>also</em> see subtle hints of things getting unraveled. Corrupt judges retiring. Corruption being leached out of the DOJ and FBI. And it starts to make sense -- you have to get rid of the horrorshow of corruption in law enforcement before you can start enforcing the law.</p>

<p>Once you see it, you can&#39;t unsee it. Like I said, I&#39;m not talking about wild UFO theories. But it&#39;s so huge, you have to dive into it until you see the pattern. One piece of corruption -- you can write it off as &quot;whatever&quot;. Two... Three... OK, the government sucks, we know that. Ten... Twenty... FUCKING HUNDREDS of examples of <em>documented</em> corruption. It&#39;s mind blowing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And what makes you so sure what YOU believe is the truth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s why. It&#39;s so huge that you can&#39;t ignore all the evidence. And it&#39;s not MSM bullshit, like screaming &quot;TRUMP SAID ALL MEXICANS WERE RAPISTS!!!!!!111&quot; (which was 100% a lie). It&#39;s original sourced stuff. It&#39;s tracing the fact that George Soros funds hundreds of radical leftist organizations, many of which are proven linked to various riots that have occurred. Or linked with Antifa violence. This is just a taste. You have to see all the connections of all this shit, and you start to wonder, &quot;Why the fuck isn&#39;t the media <em>telling me this</em>??&quot;</p>

<p>Why indeed. Then you see the chart about who in the media is married to what politicians. And in the Podesta emails, what &quot;journalists&quot; go to private &quot;strategy&quot; parties.</p>

<p>Start with Q Anon. You don&#39;t have to believe that Q is a real insider. Q just asks questions. Research the answers. Feel the rage as you learn the truth as you make the connections and don&#39;t have propaganda &#39;conclusions&#39; spoonfed to you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Depends on what you mean. If you mean political parties, in the USA there are certainly corrupt Republicans in league with the bad guys, such as McCain.</p>

<p>But you need to define your terms. &quot;The Left&quot; means people who fundamentally believe in Collectivism, and &quot;The Right&quot; means people who fundamentally believe in Individualism. That&#39;s why corruption in government overwhelmingly lands with leftists, who need people to give their power to the collective (with them in control, of course). That&#39;s why those sort of people gravitate there.</p>

<p>How do you control people when you&#39;re telling those people at the same time to pull their own weight and take care of themselves? How do you control them when you&#39;re telling them own weapons in a fundamental right?</p>

<p>Again, there&#39;s plenty of corruption in the Republican party, but it&#39;s more about lying to people as they try to control them. It&#39;s the general philosophy of leftism / collectivism that&#39;s the true evil.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason the Republican leadership hates Trump almost as much as the Democrats. That should tell anti-Trumpers something, but of course, they&#39;ve been filled with so much irrational hate from leftists that they can&#39;t think it through -- yet. The big wakeup is coming.</p>

<p>Having dependent children is actually something that&#39;s considered when judges are sentencing criminals. It often results, especially in cases where the crime is minor ie a misdemeanor, in the parents staying out of jail and getting some other penalty, as judges realizes that separating kids and parents is far from ideal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crying migrant child photo was a bit of an awkward example for them too. Turns out she wasn&#39;t separated from her mother. </p>

<p>&quot;Correction: The original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she taken from the scene. The girl was not carried away screaming by U.S. Border Patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/longform/john-moore-getty-photo-separation/">http://time.com/longform/john-moore-getty-photo-separation/</a> See bottom of the article for the correction. </p>

<p>This is also interesting from 2014: </p>

<p>&quot;WASHINGTON — Immigration and Customs Enforcement last year carried out more than 72,000 deportations of parents who said they had U.S.-born children, according to reports to Congress obtained Wednesday by The Huffington Post.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/parents-deportation_n_5531552.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/25/parents-deportation_n_5531552.html</a></p>

<p>I agree that this is emotional manipulation and propaganda. I also think we need to somehow come to some kind of an agreement on what to do about the border. I don&#39;t have the solution, but I&#39;m also not paid to figure that out. The government should figure something out and both sides of the population need to come to some kind of understanding of the others&#39; positions and ideas, instead of fighting like rabid hyenas. </p>

<p>And no, I won’t. I am not an expert at law and anything I come up with won’t matter, to you or the government. I <em>can</em> just say that I find taking children from their families is immoral, and nothing about it being “legal” can change that. The law is not my moral compass, so I’m happy to see efforts being made to stop the separation. Your almighty President Trump even signed an executive order to get the ball rolling. It’s not a perfect solution, but it’s better than you lot plugging your ears screaming, “but it’s legal!!” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cool of you. I don&#39;t agree with the solution as it sounds impossible to enforce on a grand scale and it sends the signal to illegal immigrants that nothing &quot;bad&quot; is gonna happen if you choose to cross illegally into the US.

    <div class="md"><p>In that situation, I’d imagine there’d be stricter laws for the people that circumvent the system, as the system would be more inviting. We give them a much easier, more humane way into the country, and straight deport the ones that don’t.

<p>Plus this system would cost a lot less, so we could up security with that saved money. The tricky part would be the situations we see with cops nowadays, shooting non-threats. Body cams would be a must I think, to prevent/deter any extrajudicial “decisions”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither are inherently bad, but they can be. if you’re so nationalistic that you support the government indiscriminately bombing other nations and droning US civilians because they’re caught in the crossfire, I think that’s pretty bad. But if you’re nationalistic fighting for your government/states freedom from tyranny or an outside power, I think that’s pretty good. Depends on the level and reason imo, like most things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey guys, idk if this is a terrible idea or not, but would like opinions.
What if we established a one world government. We could fix up a plethora of countries&#39; infrastructures and what not. There&#39;s close to 8 billion people in the world so it would be possible. Technology is advancing so rapidly that it could help (i heard millitary has 35 years ahead). We could establish a great standard of living for each individual. Each person gets a standard house, weekly food, water, clothes etc. BUT minimum hours have to be worked for these benefits. From there we could allow capitalism to a certain extent, capping individuals. Another problem faced is people wanting the top housing locations, cars etc. But idk how to combat that.
What ya&quot;ll think?</p>

<p>What evidence do you have to support this? Sounds like maybe you&#39;re pulling it out of your ass?</p>

<p>This metric doesn&#39;t matter much. It&#39;s more important to look at the number of immigrants as a percentage of the population, which was <em>significantly</em> higher in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was this influx of labor that allowed the country to rapidly industrialize, and to develop the strongest economy in the world.</p>
