It seems to me that the civic chaos this policy is causing must be a cause for glee within the Kremlin about now. Certainly it&#39;s weakening this country&#39;s political cohesion even further than it already is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems to me that there is something of a coordinated effort on the part of some world leaders to destabilize the political systems of previously democratic or semi-democratic nations. Under the guise of nativism, we have the US, UK/Brexit, Australia, Hungary, Greece, and now Italy clamping down on migrant/illegal immigrant populations to the extent their citizen demographics are in open revolt against their ruling parties. The last two weeks here in the US have even caused mutiny <em>within</em> the GOP. </p>

<p>Given this administration&#39;s long term ties to Russian oligarchs connected with Putin, it occurs to me that the idea of <em>mandatory</em> separation of immigrant families may have its origins outside of the party.</p>

<p>Or not. Just wondering if there&#39;s a connection and if anyone here had any thoughts on the matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think promotion of nativism is destabilization. Humans naturally group into like minded populations, just like other animals. The true purveyors of instability are those that seek forced integration of human beings that aren’t naturally compatible. You wouldn’t force your pet cat and pet mouse to live together would you?  I think that people are tiring of being told that they have to get along. When people are allowed to self segregate, they seem to get along just fine, think of the Indian tribes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>trump has laundered money for Russian oligarchs since the late 1990s, essentially having been bailed out of bankruptcy by corrupt foreign interests.  See: His money &quot;losing&quot; casinos, South Beach and Manhattan real estate, and hotel projects in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal">Russian satellite countries</a>. </p>

<p>More to the point, his son is widely quoted as confirming these ties with <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-jr-said-money-pouring-in-from-russia-2018-2">&quot;Russian money pouring in&quot;</a> during the housing collapse of 2008.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People should have known something like this would happen.  Now, Trump never directly campaigned on separating families at the border, but he did campaign on &quot;deportation forces&quot; and on repeating Eisenhower&#39;s expulsion of illegal immigrants, known as &quot;Operation Wetback.&quot;  Anyone who spent 5-10 minutes thinking through the logistics of how such an operation might go, or studied how Operation Wetback went, should have forseen that human rights abuses were inevitable with what Trump was campaigning on.</p>
