       After keeping up with his story and watching all of his interviews in the past, this stuff is starting to oddly add up. I'm too lazy to go back and find the interviews and the IG posts where all of this was said, but if you want to go find it for yourself, godspeed. In one IG Live video, he predicted his own death of being shot. In another interview with DJ Akademics, he mentioned if he were to die, no one would be there to lead the youth. This isn't the only weird thing. In another interview right after he got out of jail, he mentioned he wanted to make a comeback video of him waking up from a casket to show that hes still alive but a part of him died inside when he was in jail. The thing that makes me really look up to Jahseh was his intelligence, despite his history. At a mere 20 years old he really understood the music industry. He stated in the same interview with DJ Akademics (i think it was the same interview) that he is finessing the rap game by making music that fits all people, even if he himself doesnt approve or like the music. But the reason he does it is to pull all of these people in so when he makes REAL music, like he did with the 17 album, he would gain a larger and larger following.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think about it all, he faked getting shot, he is going to either A: Wake up in his casket at his OPEN CASKET FUNERAL or B: Use all of the people that have started listening to all of his music to listen to his unreleased music when it comes out and profit off of it. I mean its so genius.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is just a theory/conspiracy but I mean, hes showed his genius in the past but you heard it here. I admire Jahseh alot and I've always loved his music and it really, REALLY hurts me to see him go. Thats why I've dug and dug to the point of where I've convinced myself that this is all a setup.

       Find out that he’s dead?  You can’t just pay police off for a publicity stunt, especially if you’re a convicted felon. That would make the police department in charge look horrible. Accept the fact and maybe look into some other posts to enlighten you what this subreddit is really about.

       It’s on video by both the suspects and the motorcycle dealership. He’s dead. Start working on 69 material imo, cause dummies are going to copy cat the fuck out this event. For likes, follows, upvotes and karma no doubt.

       These mentally unstable kids targeted by record labels, paid to act hard, begin to believe their own lie, pop off at people who are actually about it..... then this unnecessary shit happens.... waste of a life.

       Yes I’ve been following it, it was a botched robbery. X didn’t give them his bag full of money so they shot him. The police already found the person who killed X and put him in jail.

       I mean there are tons of people throughout history I would have a strong urge to punch in the face but I still enjoy thinking about what happened to them. Murder conspiracies are very real in the hip hop community.

       I'm also a huge hiphophead so I can see that influencing my opinion.

       As much as I wish it was a hoax and he will still be making music but it’s not. Too much evidence of him being dead. If you want a real conspiracy look into the drake had him killed conspiracy. That one could be onto something. And also to the other comments on here only the driver (also bought the red masks/bandanas(why he got found out)) who blocked his car in got arrested none of the shooter(s).

       I personally think he got put into witness protection, it would make sense with the IG post saying if he dies it is Drake, and he is snitching on him right now (XXX on Drake) although I have no idea what he would have on Drake that would be enough for witness protection (although Drake was a child actor so I'm sure he has some weird stuff in his past)
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are lyrics from the Phryme song Era from February of this year talking about XXX being put in witness protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The extra extensive extent we've gone, To send you in witness protection, Exit with this throne. I can hit you niggas ex. Or I can get you niggas x.Or I can get you niggas XXXTentacion. Bitch we not the same thing, me I come from a different world. I flip you out yo' frame like the wayne wayne, then hit ya girl. Run up bare-faced broad day, the fuck I'ma wrestle for. Leave your ass on heavens staircase touched at the chapel door"

       Whether he's dead or not, he was involved in an Eclipse/Jesus ritual by the numbers(Gematria). He essentially was a puppet for the tyrants(elite) at the top.

       He was a subpar rapper that tried to live a life that he was not actually about, and it cost him his life.... I hope his soul finds peace.

       If, and this is a big IF, he set all this up as a publicity stunt to launch a record then he is a fucking clown.....

       Pac was actually about it though, big difference here.
       <br/>
       These mentally unstable kids targeted by record labels, paid to act hard, begin to believe their own lie, pop off at people who are actually about it..... then this unnecessary shit happens.... waste of a life.
       <br/>
       All because young kids buy into it.....
