        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After keeping up with his story and watching all of his interviews in the past, this stuff is starting to oddly add up. I&#39;m too lazy to go back and find the interviews and the IG posts where all of this was said, but if you want to go find it for yourself, godspeed. In one IG Live video, he predicted his own death of being shot. In another interview with DJ Akademics, he mentioned if he were to die, no one would be there to lead the youth. This isn&#39;t the only weird thing. In another interview right after he got out of jail, he mentioned he wanted to make a comeback video of him waking up from a casket to show that hes still alive but a part of him died inside when he was in jail. The thing that makes me really look up to Jahseh was his intelligence, despite his history. At a mere 20 years old he really understood the music industry. He stated in the same interview with DJ Akademics (i think it was the same interview) that he is finessing the rap game by making music that fits all people, even if he himself doesnt approve or like the music. But the reason he does it is to pull all of these people in so when he makes REAL music, like he did with the 17 album, he would gain a larger and larger following. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>If you think about it all, he faked getting shot, he is going to either A: Wake up in his casket at his OPEN CASKET FUNERAL or B: Use all of the people that have started listening to all of his music to listen to his unreleased music when it comes out and profit off of it. I mean its so genius. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, this is just a theory/conspiracy but I mean, hes showed his genius in the past but you heard it here. I admire Jahseh alot and I&#39;ve always loved his music and it really, REALLY hurts me to see him go. Thats why I&#39;ve dug and dug to the point of where I&#39;ve convinced myself that this is all a setup. </p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Prediction of own death:

<p>I know I said I wasn&#39;t going to show videos but I figured it needed to be put out there. I also discovered a video that makes me kind of go with option B a little bit more. Here is that video as well:

If you want a real conspiracy look into the drake had him killed conspiracy. That one could be onto something.

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think he got put into witness protection, it would make sense with the IG post saying if he dies it is Drake, and he is snitching on him right now (XXX on Drake) although I have no idea what he would have on Drake that would be enough for witness protection (although Drake was a child actor so I&#39;m sure he has some weird stuff in his past)</p>

<p>Here are lyrics from the Phryme song Era from February of this year talking about XXX being put in witness protection.</p>

<p>&quot;The extra extensive extent we&#39;ve gone, To send you in witness protection, Exit with this throne. I can hit you niggas ex. Or I can get you niggas x.Or I can get you niggas XXXTentacion. Bitch we not the same thing, me I come from a different world. I flip you out yo&#39; frame like the wayne wayne, then hit ya girl. Run up bare-faced broad day, the fuck I&#39;ma wrestle for. Leave your ass on heavens staircase touched at the chapel door&quot;</p>
