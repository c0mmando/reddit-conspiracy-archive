        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll write this as though I am speaking to one such person, because it will be more impactful to those who are as such if they are able to read it all. </p>

<p>Why do all of you rely entirely on name calling to support your world-view, and why do you believe that it is a valid form of argument?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s simple, really. You are insecure and uncertain of who or what you are in relation to the world. It arises from a lifetime of your actions, and how you are treated, proving to you that you are &quot;not as good&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; or &quot;a loser&quot;. This is why you feel so shaky around those who are truly great at what they do. Of course, you don&#39;t consciously realize this, but the great thing about all of our subconsciouses is that they are incapable of lying. So, because you feel that you are lesser, deep deep down, and you, as a social being, want to be useful, you default to believing what you are told by your &quot;betters&quot;, who you joyfully seek out in all things. </p>

<p>This is why you say &quot;I&#39;m doing well&quot; without really understanding the difference between it and &quot;I&#39;m doing good&quot;. This is why you have such near-religious reverence for &quot;experts&quot;, taking even their opinions to be synonymous with truth. This is why snopes saying that a thing is true or untrue is enough for you to believe. The thing you wish for most in the world is to be told you are a good boy; a part of the better-than club; to be more than you believe you are on your own merits. You want this because you cannot objectively enforce this sense of worth by yourself. </p>

<p>This might sound negative, and it is in a broad sense, but it&#39;s far from unique, and those like you have their purpose in society. You helped to reinforce the power of the priest classes, back when they held sway, saying things like &quot;it is true for it has been written&quot;, and &quot;we should trust the priests: They can read!&quot;, etc. You are the glue that holds together society while the truly great seek to hold the reins of power, by force of will and belief in their own personal truth, which you so respect. Without those such as yourself, life and society would be a bloody, warring place, moreso than it is already. For instance, during the French revolution, some 85% of people chose to remain impartial; to watch as things unfolded, while 15% of people chose to fight the system in place at the time. I would argue, due to projection that the Pentagon have made of the effects of a civil war, that there are much more &quot;fighters&quot; among us in the US then were in France, at the time, due to their models suggesting that a full 30% would rise up in defiance should the call ever be sounded. How much of this is due to fundamental differences between the French and the American spirit, and how much is a result of the comparative severity of abuses, is anyone&#39;s guess.</p>

<p>So, as one who does not wish to fight, who are satisfied with being told you are good boys and girls, when you see those who choose to seek their own path, who believe in themselves enough to test the merit of any idea for themselves, and especially if they go against the grain of what is accepted by your revered &quot;experts&quot;, you again subconsciously think to yourself &quot;they need correcting! They are being bad boys! What would put me in my place... I know! I hate when I am reminded of my feelings of insecurity and I feel just terrible when people tell me I have bad boy things in me, so, I&#39;ll just remind him he&#39;s being a bad boy&quot;. You say, in a rough approximation of the style of the experts you default to, &quot;fallacy!&quot;, without naming the fallacy, or, &quot;you&#39;re mentally ill!&quot;, without naming the illness, or &quot;you&#39;re ignorant!&quot; without naming what the bad boy is ignoring/lacking, or &quot;you&#39;re a nazi antisemite sexist racist fascist!&quot;, and the like, without really understanding what it is you are critiquing, because to you, emotionally-based shame language is your truth, so objective reality as can be measured takes a backseat. </p>

<p>I know that you are almost certainly going to be unable to act on this information, because there is some truth to your feelings of inferiority. However, if you&#39;ve read it, then that purely truthful subconscious place within you has heard, and will begin the work that is too painful for your conscious mind to engage in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is BS. To be fair I didn&#39;t read your whole post, but leftist and right-wingers use insults equally. In fact, I would say the opposite is more likely true as leftists are generally more intellectual than right-wingers. However as I have no statistics to back that up I will say both do it equally, so should you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speaking of remaining ignorant, what is the basis for your assertion of 85% remaining impartial during the French Revolution? Did you even bother to define terms? Because if, as you claim, 85% remained impartial, and 15% decided to fight the system then the percentage of the population defending the Ancein Régime was 0%. I trust your subconscious will tell you truly that a battle must have at least two belligerents. Further, how do you define participation? The 1789 population of France was 28 million, so 15% is 4.2 million. Under the 1789 constitution, the franchise was extended to tax paying adult males. Approximately 2/3 of French adult men were eligible for the franchise, meaning they paid taxes. Is not the remittance of taxes to a revolutionary government inherently participation in said revolutionary government? Under that definition, your 15% woefully underestimates participation. Is your definition military participation? Again, there is a problem of defining terms. For one thing, women were excluded from military service, as were those too young and those too old. I don&#39;t have the exact demographics of 1789 France, but let us assume a breakdown of 50% male, 50% female. Let us further assume 20% of the male population to be too old, or too young for military service. That would leave a potential military population of 11.2 million. 15% of 11.2 million is 1,680,000. The Levée En Masse alone  mobilized 1.1 million. Acquiescence to military conscription unambiguously amounts to participation, and this single conscription netted almost 10% of the population eligible for military service. And that is just the population that acquiesced to the revolutionary government. You claimed that 85% remained impartial. So we must further add all the royalist forces as well as the substantial anti-revolutionary reactions and autonomy plays in the various French administrative districts. The Vendée is the most notable, but far from the only instances of sustained civil war. So by any measure, your 15% seems like it was something you found in a book and adopted uncritically as the truth. Which is exceedingly curious as you claim such passive reliance upon so-called experts is the exclusive realm of the deluded liberal. Maybe your subconscious is trying to tell you something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are real leftists? </p>

<p>The leftists here in the U.K. are like the ones you see on YouTube videos - uni students, coloured hair,  hate white people and their own country, love Islam like it’s their life.   They’re incapable of discussing anything with facts because they just bring emotion to it and scream and shout.   Many times I’ve just walked away from the arguments bc I can’t physically listen to bullshit lmao.  </p>

<p>I guess you get those everywhere but I’ve never had an intelligent discussion in real life who was not conservative. </p>

<p>I could say the same about a lot of right-wingers. </p>

<p>The point is that PEOPLE discuss like that. The reason you only had intelligent conversations with a conservative is because you are one yourself so you are in an ecco-chamber. Once you discuss with someone directly opposite your views it very quickly descends into insults. </p>

<p>Remember that it takes two to tango... if people start insulting you then it is likely you invited that somehow.</p>

<p>Not a word about policy here. The oligarchy wants to open up or ISP data for its giant corporations and has done so under Donald Trump. I&#39;m against that because it is the same George W. Bush &quot;Total Information Awareness&quot; where the oligarchs get all the information and the people don&#39;t. As we have seen with Cambridge Analytica, such information is used to undermine the truth and take advantage of the internet bubbles that the largest conglomerates created.</p>

<p>Then, the oligarchy wants to end net neutrality and has done so. This is a great compliment to the Total Information Awareness of taking our most personal ISP data because they get all of our data, but they only feed back to us what will create a world of bad information designed to control us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends what you mean by “progress.” Progress can definitely be bad. The communists in the USSR made “progress” at the expense of the 60ish million that were killed. Mussolini’s brand of fascism was originally seen by American progressives as the way of the future. </p>

<p>Your argument that “like making progress in anything is bad” is like the doomsday cult in Parks and Rec calling themselves “Reasonablists.” If you’re against them, you’re against reason. If you’re against progressives, you’re against “progress.” It’s an Orwellian slight of hand. </p>
