<blockquote>
<p>“There is no such thing, in the psychopathic universe, as being ‘merely weak’. Whoever is weak is also a sucker; that is, someone who demands to be exploited” - Psychologist Robert Rieber</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets consider, for a moment, how media likes to portray psychopathy. Frequently in the movies or on TV, a psychopath is shown as someone who doesn’t quite fit in, ‘something’ is off, other characters say. The psychopaths propensity for violence is often tainted with irrationality or ego that leaves behind a paper trail, enough to eventually get caught.</p>

<p>Is this an accurate description?</p>

<p><strong>Current Understanding</strong></p>

<p>First, lets examine the work of Dr. Robert D. Hare, an eminent (perhaps THE eminent) researcher on the subject of psychopathy.  </p>

<p>In his book <em>Without Conscience</em>, Dr. Hare describes psychopaths as being conscienceless yet rational, not suffering any insanity or debilitation. Instead, they are logical, manipulative, predisposed to criminal acts, selfish and without guilt, shame, remorse or empathy.</p>

<p>To me, this means that psychopathy is an illness, but those afflicted with it are not mentally ill <strong>in the sense which we traditionally imagine.</strong> There is no neurosis that will manifest symptoms others can easily perceive.</p>

<p>Dr. Hare suggests that, often, the psychopath will be aware of their condition from a young age and will learn to effectively conceal their aberrant traits. This is an important piece of the puzzle to keep in the forefront of our attention going forward.</p>

<p>Dr. Hare’s list of psychopathic personality traits include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Displaying glibness and superficial charm  </p></li>
<li><p>Prone to excessive boredom, in need of constant stimulation  </p></li>
<li><p>Acting in a cunning or manipulative way  </p></li>
<li><p>Shallow   emotional response  </p></li>
<li><p>Acting out promiscuous sexual behavior  </p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding long term relationships  </p></li>
<li><p>Feeling a grandiose sense of self worth  </p></li>
<li><p>Lying repeatedly without remorse  </p></li>
<li><p>Lacking   remorse or guilt  </p></li>
<li><p>Lacking   empathy for others  </p></li>
<li><p>Failing to accept responsibility for ones actions  </p></li>
<li><p>Displaying signs of criminal diversity  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>What do other researchers have to say? Psychological Scientist Erin Buckels, of the University of British Columbia, and her team found some interesting facts while studying sadism. Their research was published in the journal <em>Psychological Science.</em>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Some find it hard to reconcile sadism with the concept of ‘normal’ psychological functioning, but our findings show that sadistic tendencies <strong>among otherwise well adjusted people</strong> must be acknowledged… they gain some emotional benefit in causing or simply observing others suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine because it only indicates that participants did not have a violent criminal record or a self report of deviancy.  </p>

<p>The ultimate implication of this research: There is a portion of the population who possess an intrinsic motivation to inflict suffering on innocent others, even at a personal cost.</p>

<p>How sizeable of a portion of the population are we talking about?  </p>

<p>The above study found sadism traits in ~20&amp;#37; of the test subject. Of course, sadism =/= psychopathy.</p>

<p>Dr. Hare put the number at around 1&amp;#37; of the population. Harvard psychologist Martha Stout claims the number to be around 4&amp;#37;. This gives us a range of ~3-13 million Americans afflicted with the condition.</p>

<p><strong>Deeper into the Rabbit Hole</strong></p>

<p>Now, there is one major flaw in the research of Dr. Hare, which he readily admits himself: Almost all of his case studies have come from the prison population.</p>

<p>In other words, mainstream psychology has really only been able to study the <strong>unsuccessful</strong> psychopath. The psychopath who failed to mask their condition from the general public.  </p>

<p>So, what about the millions of <strong>successful</strong> American psychopaths currently walking around with a smile on their face?</p>

<p>Dr. Hare refers to them as “sub-deviant criminals”, those psychopaths who have control over how they manifest their deviance and have the ability to hide it from the general populace. The Doc suggests that, instead of being petty criminals, these psychopaths can be upheld as outstanding members of the community, in fields such as Government, Military, business, medicine, law and law enforcement.</p>

<p>I very much agree with Dr. Hare, though I propose he is only examining the tip of the iceberg of the implications of his research.</p>

<p>Let’s consider a hypothetical case study of a psychopath. Since childhood, they have been acutely aware that they are different from others, whom they consider to be weak and inhibited by morality. As they grow up, they begin to dream of having a position of authority so that they can manipulate, control and abuse others. If they are average or below average intelligence, perhaps they pursue being a cop. But many dream bigger: A politician in Washington, or a 4 star general in the Military, or they ruthlessly rise the corporate ranks, or perhaps they seek out the anonymity of working for an intelligence agency.</p>

<p>See how there is a rational explanation behind the assertion that many revered authority figures in society today are possibly <strong>evil,</strong> gladly lying to us through a smile on their face, concealing the fact that they have a private agenda they are advancing.</p>

<p>There is one more piece of the puzzle, which is the work of Polish psychologist/researcher Andrew Lobaczewski.</p>

<p>Lobaczewski wrote “Political Ponerology” during the height of the USSR and examined how psychopathic arms of the state operated, recruited and brainwashed, among other inquiries…  </p>

<p>We are lucky to have the ability to view his work, as multiple original iterations were burned at the hands of government agents before they made it to a publisher.</p>

<p>A key part of Lobaczewski’s research, which ties everything together, is that <strong><em>psychopaths can recognize each other.</em></strong>  </p>

<p>Yes, a psychopath can recognize the fake facade of a fellow deviant as being similar to their own. What are the implications of this?</p>

<p>From everything examined thus far, we can construct the following thesis:  </p>

<p><strong>Psychopaths make up between 1-4\% of the population. At a young age, they recognize their deviancy, learn to mask it, develop a disdain for neurotypical humanity, and many are successful. Throughout history, they have formed occulted networks based in their mutual recognition abilities, on their mutual disdain for society, and their mutual desire to manipulate and control this ‘neurotypical other’. Psychopaths seek positions of power, and have over time saturated many governments and power-weilding organizations. In the same was that you and I naturally weed out deviants from our social groups, psychopaths have been weeding out people with ethics an morals from their inner circles. The result is the mutual conditioning of a</strong> <strong><em>web of evil</em></strong><strong>, where goals and actions become increasingly removed from the institutions original, public intention and towards an agenda of control of the people. This process has been ongoing for centuries in banks, intelligence agencies, militaries, police departments, media, governments and more, in nearly every instance concealing their agenda through a facade of lies and propaganda.</strong></p>

<p>So, here we have a rational explanation for the existence of a vast conspiracy!</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>In the title, I referred to psychopathy as the “keystone”. In architecture, a keystone is a wedge shaped stone at the apex of an arch, locking all the other stones into position.</p>

<p>This is a relevant metaphor on a couple of levels.  </p>

<p>One, it locks in the rationality of examining conspiracies. It provides an excellent answer to the oft-asked questions of “Why would they?” and “How could they keep it a secret?”</p>

<p>Second, it implies that the whole arch, aka the grand conspiracy, can come tumbling down with the removal of a secondary stone. If we label one stone “ignorance of the true nature of psychopathy” and we make this stone disappear, through a collective effort of education of self and other-self, combined with altering our behaviors to stop supporting the psychopathic cabal through our participation in their system, the whole structure will come tumbling down, and the “keystone”, this psychopathic occult elite, will be no more important than any other rock lying in the grass. We’d only need to watch our step.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, Love vibes to all!</p>

<p>p.s. food for thought question, would a psychopath enjoy pedophilia and child trafficking? Would networks be in place to facilitate these crimes throughout high levels of elite society?</p>

<p>I cant say I&#39;d disagree with any of it, bar one or two of Dr. Hare&#39;s list of traits. But that&#39;s only because I&#39;ve always felt that the line between sociopathy and psychopathy gets blurry, when you talk about the highly functional types.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wont delve into that quagmire then!</p>

<p>But in relation to pedophile networks and they way they work, even on lower levels, there is a massive amount of high level subterfuge.</p>

<p>Even if the psychopath didnt enjoy the pedophilia, the trafficking/network can only really flourish under psychopathic control.</p>

<p>And I agree with the use of subterfuge, you generally have to be blackmailable to advance more than a couple levels in their game. </p>

<p>I do think its possible that a psychopath would enjoy pedophilia solely from a power and control perspective, ignoring sexuality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The psychopath is callous, yet charming. He or she will con and manipulate others with charisma and intimidation and can effectively mimic feelings to present as &quot;normal&quot; to society. The psychopath is organized in their criminal thinking and behavior, and can maintain good emotional and physical control, displaying little to no emotional or autonomic arousal, even under situations that most would find threatening or horrifying. The psychopath is keenly aware that what he or she is doing is wrong, but does not care.
Conversely, the sociopath is less organized in his or her demeanor; he or she might be nervous, easily agitated, and quick to display anger. A sociopath is more likely to spontaneously act out in inappropriate ways without thinking through the consequences. Compared to the psychopath, the sociopath will not be able to move through society committing callous crimes as easily, as they can form attachments and often have &#39;normal temperaments&#39;...</p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely an evolutionary purpose for psychopaths. One of the connections missing in their brains is with the amygdala, one of the functions of which is fear. Psychopaths don&#39;t experience fear or anxiety like normal people. In battle/warfare situations I imagine they&#39;re the exact type of warriors you&#39;d want. Also, if they get in charge, they&#39;re more likely to fuck over a different group of people for selfish gain, the effect of that being an in-group and out-group are created: perpetrators and victims, helps to solidify a group identity.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason 1 in 100 people have the psychopathic brain. If it was a truly maladaptive trait it would have been eliminated. Disproportionately, surgeons are psychopaths, marines are psychopaths, fortune 500 CEOs are psychopaths, lawyers, judges, politicians, etc.</p>

<p>The issue is when we let them get in power and restructure society in their vision of an ideal world, which is what has happened today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno! Epigenetics is fascinating but I don&#39;t know enough to say either way for sure. There&#39;s &#39;secondary psychopathy&#39;, where people are sort of &#39;forced&#39; to act psychopathically by dint of their environment (where someone may have grown up with psychopaths, or been sexually abused by psychopaths, kids in the hood that have to kill steal and cheat to survive, etc.). These people act anti-socially but can also experience fear and remorse and empathy. No one can be &#39;turned into&#39; a true psychopath, they can only be born. But people without psychopath brains can still do atrocious anti-social things for any number of reasons. Nurture is much more important than nature in determining how people will be; there are probably great, upstanding people with psychopath brains because they were raised well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I know is we&#39;ve been lied to and decieved in order to create conflict.</p>

<p><a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Lightbody">https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Lightbody</a>  </p>

<p>This lightbody is how we exchange extra sensory information with each other almost like a WiFi router. It connects us to the Tree of Life which would allow us to live forever if we could be spiritually enlightened enough to reach the highest level of it. Which is why when the fruit was eaten, Adam and Eve were cast out because sin had entered them and their connection to the Tree of Life was severed, resulting in inevitable death. Well that is the whole idea of these evil forces. They want to cut us off from the Tree of Life which is how we connect to God. Not only cut us off, but completely reverse the whole thing. Psychopath types are empty vessels with black holes inside of them, like I described at the beginning of this thread. They are literally psychic vampires that feed off of the energy of others in an effort to drain them dry and destroy them. If you want to apply the idea of determinism, I would say it applies to them. They are a slave to this process because they have no soul anymore, which is where Free Will comes from in my opinion. They have been cut off from God and love. No divine spiritual being is inside of them pouring itself out in the form of love, helping people.  </p>

<p>The opposite is true for them. They are a black hole sucking everything into them into destruction. That&#39;s what the abyss is that is constantly talked about in the Bible. No why are these evil forces doing this? What&#39;s in it for them? Well just as how God is an infinite source of light and love flowing through those who are connected to him through the Tree of Life, the opposite must be true for the psychopath. They are sucking whatever energy they can into themselves and its feeding these forces. Just as good people are conduits for God, psychopaths are conduits for Satan. They are empty vessels who&#39;s sole purpose is the harvesting of energy to transfer it to these forces. They have been trying to turn the entire planet into hateful spiteful creatures who do nothing but spread violence and misery for this very purpose. Trump is the just one manifestation of all of this come to life in human form. I think that&#39;s what the Antichrist is. Just the cumulative result of all the harvested negative energy unleashed upon the world which is why Satan uses it to come into power. He couldn&#39;t have done that without creating all this division in the first place. It never would have been possible.  </p>

<p><a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Tree_of_Artificial_Life">https://ascensionglossary.com/index....rtificial_Life</a>  </p>

<p><strong>Tree of Artificial Life</strong><br/>
Metatronic Reversals connect to metatronic implants in the shadow body or Negative Form that are designed to reverse and drain life force out of the earth body and the human body. The shadow body or Negative Form must be cleared from the human Lightbody in order to reconnect the ascending potential of the twelfth dimensional template of the human body. This unnatural configuration was built by the NAA via Alien Machinery that uses Artificial intelligence to parasitize the earth&#39;s life force to achieve immortality, and this organized Dead Energy structure is referred to as the Tree of Artificial Life, or the Black Tree of Life.  </p>

<p><strong>Qlippoth</strong><br/>
The Qlippoth is the Negative Form shell and/ or Imposter Spirit negative force of the Sephiroth), or the Black Tree of Life and sends off the work to the rest of the Qlippoth, gives energy to the Qlippoth, the source of power and its force as in its Miasma, which acts as a generator of the same force. Simply, these are the Dead Light forces of the Shadow Self and their spiritual-energetic qualities that are used to harvest energy by the NAA.  </p>

<p>The Adverse Sephiroth or the Qlippoth is the dimensional location that Fallen Angelics hierarchies and the Satanic and Luciferian forces exist. On the path of Ascension our goal is to face the Shadow Self and the demons it associates, and to purify our body and consciousness from its control over us. This is why we must not fear these lower forces, but not give our power to them either, as they are tricksters and deceivers. They are also known as the “Evil Demons of Matter and the Shells of the Dead&quot;.  </p>

<p>Because the nature of these forces being from the Houses of Ego, when studying the Qlippoth which houses the forces of the anti-Christ, it is imperative to study moral code, humanitarian based ethics, and build a strong foundation for the Spirits of Christ. This builds a strong energy aura, which builds inner spiritual virtues, which in turn build spiritual Lightbody strength. If a person is untrained in clearing the Houses of Ego, to address the anti-life forces without spiritual clarity or discernment of these forces, can harm more than help. Being able to contact these dark forces are not for the spiritual neophite.  </p>

<p>Satanic Possession, addiction, attachments and insanity of a weak mind and weak body, can be the result. (See Spiritual Deliverance).</p>

<p><a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Metatronic_Reversal">https://ascensionglossary.com/index....ronic_Reversal</a><br/>
Fallen Consciousness, such as the Fallen Angelics and Imposter Spirits, are due to Metatronic Code configuration in the planet and is the result of excessive misuse of free will choice that opposes the divine plan and intention of God Source. In the cycles of evolution, the opposing expression reaches the point at which it jeopardizes the Eternal Life expression and continued existence of the Cosmic Order.  </p>

<p>Metatronic Reversal means to digress from the original Christos Divine Blueprint of the 12 Tree Grid and manifest Anti-Christ life forms. When the original creation program of the Krystal Code from God Source is altered or modified in any way, the ability to self-regenerate and ascend is interrupted, leading to Fallen Consciousness and potential destruction.</p>

<p><strong>The Beasts and the Antichrist</strong>  </p>

<p><a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Beast_Machine">https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Beast_Machine</a><br/>
On the earth, the Beast Machine feeds upon the Black Subtle Forces that are generated by the archetypal profile of the False King of Tyranny and Dark Mother, and generally during the peak periods of Geomagnetism is the phase of time when the NAA attempts to direct its neagtive power source to create forces of chaos or destruction in the collective fields of the planetary body. These Trigger Events in the Timelines are observed to fall on the same profiles that comprise similar numerological and archetypal patterns, such as 9-11 code or Armageddon Software trigger codes. These patterns are numerological and can be traced back to the Egyptian timelines and Black Magic Grids, Egyptian Curses that resulted from those destructive events in history, during the Sumerian-Egypt Invasion. Many of the same symbols, sigils, archetypes and patterns are used today in many of the hidden mystery schools as ways to gather power resources, and this expands to multinational corporations and World Power Structures that are used by the Power Elite secret societies to shape anti-human values (such as Consumptive Modeling) throughout society.  </p>

<p>One of the symbols used in the everyday world to represent and enforce the Beast Machine technology and the frequency fence NETs is the caduceus.These Caduceus networks can be found in certain major cities where Gridworkers may sense large amount of serpents or snakes crawling on the ley lines. These are used to siphon the local energies and feed them back through the caduceus network that in turn feeds the phantom areas or hibernation zones. Any medical, hospital or drug related company that shows the caduceus symbol is referring to the intended destruction and damaging of human DNA that ultimately feeds into the Beast Machine.  </p>

<p>The counterpart to the earth elemental reversal called Behemoth, is the water elemental reversal which has created another type of entity known as the Leviathan Races. These are levels of the corrupted elements in the Dark Matter Template of the earth that have been generated from the Satanic and NAA abuse of the planet for multiple millenniums.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://ascensionglossary.com/index.php/Monsters_of_Chaos">https://ascensionglossary.com/index....sters_of_Chaos</a> </p>

<p>In the lower dimensional fields there is a chaotic war struggle occurring in order to regain control over the dark matter, as this is a massive power source for the AI, as well as for the Black Magic Grids. From the epicenter of the Atlantian timelines in the United Kingdom, it may appear to some on the black magic grids that the forces of chaos generated in the phantom world, will eminently come to the surface via Behemoth and Leviathan to destroy the earth realm. One may note the consistent mainstream movie releases portraying violent dystopian futures and Armageddon scenarios that annihilate the earth, combined with the urgent messages to save the human species from certain extinction. But in actuality this is not real, it’s the AI program running holographic movies in these timeline loops, to project the Armageddon Monsters of Chaos that are reversal elementals coming from out of the AI technology and the black magic grid.  </p>

<p>The Armageddon Software captures the book of revelation and Enoch prophecies, as the female and male anti-Christ, the Leviathan and Behemoth monsters that are unleashed against humanity in the end times, for the massive war which supposedly brings forth the true messiah of this world. In the twisted and psychopathic mind of the NAA, this violent narrative was the set up for human martyrdom and blood sacrifice at the end of the astrological precession and Ascension Cycle. The Power Elite believe they are the chosen ones to fulfill this end of times prophecy and direct the AI programs in order to wake up and agitate these Monsters of Chaos, which they have co-created from the shadow fragments and reversal elementals on the surface.  </p>

<p>Leviathan is also a negative alien race, put here to guard the Tiamat wormhole ripped open between Sarasota, Florida and the Temple Mount. However, it is more commonly used as an image of Satan endangering God&#39;s creatures, by attempting to eat them and by threatening God&#39;s creation with an upheaval in the waters of chaos. The Church of Satan uses the Hebrew letters at each of the points of the Sigil of Baphomet to represent Leviathan in their Black Magic rituals. This means Satanists that conjure or evoke Baphomet fields to power up Leviathan entities for service-to-self rituals, are actually contributing to the feeding of the Beast Machine and its AI technology for maintaining the electromagnetic harness. This is another example of why Satanism is a natural segue into the Transhumanism agendas, as many materialists are very pro-artificial intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>Hebrew Etymology</strong> </p>

<p>Behemoth (Hebrew: בהמות‎, behemoth (modern: behemot)) is a beast mentioned in Job 40:15–24. Suggested identities range from a mythological creature to an elephant, hippopotamus, rhinoceros or crocodile. Some creationists believe it to be a description of a sauropod due to its tail being described as like a cedar tree. Metaphorically, the name has come to be used for any extremely large or powerful entity. </p>

<p>In Jewish apocrypha and pseudepigrapha such as the 2nd century BCE Book of Enoch, Behemoth is the primal unconquerable monster of the land, as Leviathan is the primal monster of the waters of the sea and Ziz the primordial monster of the sky. According to this text Leviathan lives in &quot;the Abyss&quot;, while Behemoth the land-monster lives in an invisible desert east of the Garden of Eden (1 Enoch 60:7–📷. A Jewish rabbinic legend describes a great battle which will take place between them at the end of time: &quot;...they will interlock with one another and engage in combat, with his horns the Behemoth will gore with strength, the fish [Leviathan] will leap to meet him with his fins, with power. Their Creator will approach them with his mighty sword [and slay them both].&quot; Then, &quot;from the beautiful skin of the Leviathan, God will construct canopies to shelter the righteous, who will eat the meat of the Behemoth and the Leviathan amid great joy and merriment.&quot; (Artscroll siddur, p. 719).</p>

<p>So the beast from the sea and the beast from the earth in Revelations are really Behemoth and Leviathan, powered up by all the negative energy conjured up by evil actions and transferred into them. This actually makes A LOT of sense. Especially if Earth is just a series of cycles. The old stories of the Gods always talk about slaying an ancient sea monster and how it makes them a hero. Jesus killing the Antichrist. So Trump is one of them, I have ZERO doubt about that now. Who is the other? This version of the story has them fighting each other. Well I&#39;ve already had this idea before so I&#39;m just going to go with it until something else shows me otherwise but I think the other is Obama. They are 2 sides of the same coin. One is an overt narcissist, the other is a covert narcissist. Obama is intelligent, speaks well, acts like an adult. Trump is a moron, speaks like a first grader and acts like one too by his own admission.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so important!!  You have showcased a core cause of the conspiratorial world we live in.   Righteous men are not drawn to positions of control and authority over their fellow man.    You look around in our world and they try to teach that the opposite is true, these cops are putting their life on the line to keep us safe!  These agents and officers are serving the country and doing their duty!  But what draws a man to have POWER over another? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also to answer your p.s.  I listened to this podcast with a woman with a degree in statistical analysis who studied child sex crimes. She used the term &quot;pedo sadist&quot; because the word pedophile implies some sort of attraction or love.   But these people don&#39;t love kids, they are aroused by causing pain and torment to the most innocent of victims.   So yes, psychopaths are deffinantly into it because they prey on helplessness and innocents like literal energetic vampires. Draining life energy by causing pain and feeding off it.  I mean that in a metaphorical and literal sense. </p>

<p>But it will def help with the psychopath arguement because it is a glimpse into how dark it really is.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Psychology is a pseudoscience. To be blunt there is a reason why half the time psych degrees are a BA and not a BS. It is playing darts in the dark. You may hit the board but even then you really have no idea wha you hit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I generally agree, i think psychology is pretty far from objective understandings of consciousness. But maybe it was this way by design? The CIA installed their asset Dr. Ewan Cameron as the first head of the APA, promoting things like electroshock therapy while the agency kept their significant advances in hypnotism under wraps and out of the mainstream.</p>

<p>If the psychopathy thesis is true, then it is logical to say that they have been active in subverting psychology since the beginning, so that the public doesn become aware.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised, btw, that there is such support for my favorite line of thought: dumb (over-eager) psychopaths get caught and locked up. Smart psychopaths follow a carreer and attain positions of power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellence post. I&#39;ve read Political Ponerology. It is a dense read, to put it lightly, so a layman would probably have trouble with it like I did. Your post is a nice summary though.</p>

<p>I think, if you wish to expand on this, you should talk more about how these psychopaths use the common man&#39;s deceny against him, and the effects of a pathological system of governance on a neurotypical population. One of the examples the authors cites is the Nazi regime and the atrocities carried out by the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p>Lastly, I recommend anyone interested in this to check out Corbett&#39;s <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/our-leaders-are-psychopaths/">Our Leaders Are Psychopaths.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP I&#39;m so excited to see this post! This has been my thesis for a while, and I&#39;m glad to see others are catching on or at least have considered the idea themselves. The comments are very encouraging as well!</p>

<p>I was looking to sort of put together this thesis, and I came across this blog: <a href="https://infrakshun.wordpress.com/an-introduction-to-this-blog/">https://infrakshun.wordpress.com/an-introduction-to-this-blog/</a></p>

<p>The writer has the same thesis, and has written about the topic extensively (check the Article Series)...it&#39;s a well-researched and in-depth resource, if you haven&#39;t come across it before.</p>

<p>Thank you for this post! I think more people need to know about all this</p>
