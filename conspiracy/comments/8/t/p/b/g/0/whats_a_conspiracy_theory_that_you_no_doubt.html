       Well. I'm not that guy. But considering the government admitted to it years ago and said that they "discontinued it"; it's pretty obvious they are still using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, part of the original program involved sex abuse by high level officials so they could blackmail them into continued funding. Which is totally still par for the course.

       I’ve kind of tuned out of popular media for a bit but if you go to vigilantcitizan.com and see all the celebs using occult signs or putting occult imagery in their videos, most of these celebs have “handlers” in hollywood occult societies who attempt to direct culture from behind the scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mark Zuckerberg is an example, this gizmodo article is just scratching the surface.

       Kanye was forcibly taken to a hospital a couple years ago after going on a rant at a concert, recently hes been saying he is out of the “sunken place”, a reference to hypnotism mind control in Jordan Peeles movie Get Out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its less politicians because they are usually controlled through blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is either to control n unruly celeb or to use hypnotic suggestion in big stars to influence basically everything.

       I think that the only reason MK-Ultra was reported to be a failure is that the goal was to see the limits of depravity they could imbue in random citizens. There was no limit so the depravity, and so the mission was "unsuccessful".

       Unless the research was into what information “undesirables” are are willing to freely give up and the effects of such posts on the community.  Posts like this would be useful, and would eventually end up as a plot on a graph.  Sort of like a temperature check for the sub.  How do replies to posts like this change over time, if at all, specifically in relation to media and search engine manipulation, TMoR activities, shill tactics, censorship, etc.  This would be a bit of data that would be useful, and only able to be obtained from such posts and activity.  “Yes Mr. Investor or Government lackey, we still have control over our pied piper website, evident from datasheet A.”

       I'll second Vegas. Fuck the people saying no one died or it didn't happen or any of that bullshit, but Lombardo's sketchy ass definitely covered something up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It happened, people did die, and Vegas was changed (honestly? Probably for the better... We have a sense of community now) because of it. But it wasn't some lone wolf old dude that did it. There was far too much prep, he shot at fuel tanks he should have known wouldn't explode from gunshots, and brought way more guns than one person could ever dream of shooting. And had an exit strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most likely case, imo given the evidence, is that it was supposed to be a much bigger event and his cohorts dipped out at the last minute. That's why he had so many guns, that's why he shot at the fuel tanks, that's why there was a car with explosives in the parking garage, that's why there was a couple going around the festival saying "You're all going to die tonight". More people were supposed to show up/be involved. Someone was supposed to move the car, someone was supposed to be in the second room providing a secondary source of fire and for whatever reason they either didn't or couldn't show up.

       The failure of Vegas to be as horrible as it was supposed to be was one of the signs that the good guys are very well on to the bad guys' tricks.

       I subscribe to the flat earth theory, mostly because I always thought it was ridiculous that the explanation for eclipses is that the sun its 400 times further and also exactly 400 larger than the moon, seems too much of a coincidence.... but I dont believe on "angels" (those are lies) also dont believe on "mandala effect or ghosts" (that is just internal psychological experiences or "infra-sound" look it up) also dont believe on aliens (im 100% positive any alien encounter is just rapey CIA guys hypnotizing and drugging people on their classified aircraft, and they bring aliens up to distract from the classified matter, podesta brings up aliens all the time that is a big red flag right there.

       okok, i can explain..:  during the eclipses the sun is covered by the moon, this is possible even though the sun is huge, supposedly because the sun is exactly at the right distance to look the same size and be blocked.  400 times larger and at the same time 400 times further away in space. which is not true.

       Oh right, I see what you're saying, well I would say as large as the universe is, which is, really, really, large and as many planets and solar systems there are, I wouldn't say it's too unlikely that there would be planets where total solar eclipses could happen due to the Moon and Sun being the same size in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also say that it probably seems more coincidental to you because you're focusing so heavily on it, so I understand how you think it's a wierd fact however nowhere near enough to convince me the Earth is flat.

       first you realize that there is another possible explanation for the eclipses, then you realize there are explanations for everything else, that make more sense, like the explanation for the fact that the earth seems still, we dont feel the movement of the earth, cause it doesnt move for example....

       Well, the reason we don't feel the rotation of the Earth is because we're spinning along with it, it's a stable rotation so it doesn't feel like any typr of movement, just like if you're in an aeroplane, you're travelling pretty quickly but it doesn't feel like you're moving fast at all.

       That is the alleged reason, one could take it and leave it like that, like in school, just use it to answer the test, get called smart for repeating it out of memory, but you could also wonder why if the earth is moving so fast how come this also doesn't affect the clouds or plane flights, if the earth is rotating wouldnt the planes that fly towards the rotation arrive faster? they dont!

       I think you would benifit from reading books on these topics, there's a lot of resources for you out there to affectivley learn how these processes work, ie. flight, weather, the atmoshphere, gravity, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's hard to understand sometimes which is where Google is a godsend, if you're stuck on anything, just research that specific topic or word or whatever it may be.

       Not only am I college educated, I am passionate about this topic, I know all the "mainstream lies" better than your average globe earther, to me you sound like a cristian telling an atheist to read the resurrection chapter, you should know there is a line of lies agreed to by "the top scientist" and elites, this lies give them control and allow them to hide many places on earth for themselves, like the middle of Antarctica, that is why people say things like "only Einstein and a handful of people understand relativity"  Cause its lies, like TESLa HIMSELF said "EINSTEIN IS a Lying Hack who can speak complex stupidity" (Im paraphrasing but its close enough)

       Well, to be fair that could mean a lot of things, just because you attended college doesn't mean anyone could assume you have a solid grasp of anything you're talking about here.

       It means I have been exposed to the globe propaganda at the very least, and that I can make a successful google search too...   ...if you ever look at any body of water and wonder how is it possible that all water finds its level EXCEPT ONLY on the earth supposed curve, you may find some stuff searching online too, we all start as globe believers

       The reason I suggested researching these topics, exstensivley on your own is because it seems like your only critisisms beyond you not understanding how certain things work is that it's all propaganda, or a lie, or fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I just don't see any justification for you to believe that to be true, so if we at least give the science a chance and look into it ourselevs and take months or even years, just reading about whatever it is you're interested in I'm 100% certain all your questions will be answered by you, however that can never happen if you always just resort to it's all a lie, which again I just don't see any reason to believe so.

       I do understand your position, again, Im coming from there, I guess one thing you have to go through before you stop believing the false song of Scientism (science lies made official and added to the books by people in power to benefit themselves) is watching people in power swear their discovery is true, when its a lie, you could start searching for the word "hoax" to get some examples, the people who perpetrated them would only wish their tricks were as successful as the pros, when the rich do the "hoax" it becomes true.. ... Nasa is the worst, so transparent...  not all science its a lie, only some of it, the part people claim only a handful of people can prove, and they happen to know eachother.

       Haha happy to help!  The old me (before Jesus Christ quickened my spirit) used to be a huge video game troll.  This was my name in old school Diablo 2 when I would PK people in hardcore.  I just thought it would be that much more insulting to die to this name.  Anyway, since this account holds my testimony (saved spring 2017) I decided to just keep using it even with it's ridiculous name.

       It's to hide the greatest physical evidence of God which the flat enclosed cosmology we are in.  TPTB (Luciferian Eltie) don't want you to know that the narrative of God putting on the flesh of Jesus Christ who laid down his life and allowed his blood to be shed as a final sacrifice to atone for your sins is true.  They don't want you to realize this because if they can deceive you your entire life and you die without ever believing you are a sinner in need of the atonement of Jesus Christ then you will burn in an eternal like of fire with Lucifer and his fallen angels/devils.  That's +1 eternal soul that could have been a child of God that Lucifer was able to deceive into suffering the second (spiritual) death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The King James Bible explains it all.  The kingdoms of this world are influenced spiritually by Lucifer and his principalities and powers.  These are a spiritual unseen government that can be communicated with via sorcery (pharmakeia: DMT, ayahuasca etc) and witchraft (occult ritual, mediation, astral projection etc).  He puts people into positions of power all over the world in all institutions who are willing to deceive for temporal power.  The reason they lie about this is to try to discredit the Biblical narrative of creation.  If they can get people to believe the foundation of the Bible is either wrong (create atheists and agnostics) or metaphorical (create false doctrine due to not knowing what is metaphor and what isn't) they can get more people to die in their sins without believing the gospel which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as simple as repenting of everything you currently believe and believing the above gospel (you are a sinner that is saved by the grace of God through belief in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as a final sacrifice for your sins).  If you do that you can be saved by the grace of God.   They lie and create all the false religions to make you think it's something that can be earned.  "outer space" creates so many false new age religions involving the universe or alien seeding.  Aliens are just fallen angels.  Once you understand this fundamental lie you can cut out so many red herrings.

       You are correct that the actual shape of the earth is irrelevant to one's salvation and ultimately doesn't matter if it is not a stumbling block for the individual to have faith in Paul's gospel.  For someone like me  though who learned at a young age about the verses in the Bible that alluded to the earth being flat and unmovable which subsequently caused me to reject it early on due to my faith in the spinning ball in outer space; coming across this particular truth is what got me to actually read the Bible and take it seriously for the first time.  People are coming to a saving faith in Jesus Christ in droves due to this truth being reviled in this later times:

       I don’t think it’s that mental.  Sure it sounds it but that’s the way they orchestrate it.  If you can believe the lies of the government then what is not possible.  I’m certain they are hiding something about the earth but whatever it is I don’t know.  I don’t know any good flat earths bc I was shit at science in school.  I’m drunk so who knows if this makes sense.

       Why MLB "to some extent" when MLB had a fixed match back in the 20's? not to mention the roids being an open secret, if any league is fixed It'd be the MLB.

       I think MLB is less likely fixed for two reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       The players union is stronger than any other sport
      </p>
      <p>
       The players make more, on average, than any other sport
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there were
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       ways MLB is
       <em>
        corrupt
       </em>
       , but not necessarily fixed: Looking the other way on steroids, letting some criminal players get away with more than others, umpires blowing close calls to keep a game close, low budget teams like the Marlins or Padres trading away star players to big budget teams because they put profit ahead of winning, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the NBA, refs have been caught shaving points. You could probably find two dozen NBA playoff games that look shady still. NFL's refs are notorious for their player-favoring.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm open to the idea that MLB is fixed, certainly could be done. But baseball's free agency suggests a guy has the ability to maximize his value by playing his best. NBA only has that in a limited sense and NFL not at all.

       NFL fixed...I've been saying that for years!
      </p>
      <p>
       I could list sooo many examples:  Donald Driver's last TD reception and NO Lambeau Leap and NO smile.  That catch put them within a score of being in the Superbowl with plenty of time on the clock and he just walks to the bench and sits down.    Then the first SB between the NYG and NE, there was only one flag thrown against the Giants and that was a blatant pass interference against Randy Moss in the end zone.  And the refs hesitated throwing it--they looked at each other first and kind of shrugged, as if to say, "Well shit, we have to call that one."  That whole SB was as blatantly fixed as a game can be.  I could go on, but it would take all day.
