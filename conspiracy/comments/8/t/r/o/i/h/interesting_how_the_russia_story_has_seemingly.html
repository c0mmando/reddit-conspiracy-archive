       The media has found a new talking point, separation of families at the border. I’m sure as soon as this news cycle ends, it’ll be back to Russia and then shortly after a  new mass fake outrage when the Russia story starts falling flat.

       This is a form of brainwashing that those who control the media (as well as schools, entertainment, major corporations) have complete control over. "Repeat a lie often enough..."

       By what metric isn't this a witch hunt? An investigation that started after Trump fired Deep State fixer James Comey which prompted the hiring of another Deep State fixer friend of James Comey, who then hired a team exclusively filled by Hillary Clinton supporters to overturn the election by trying to remove Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       More like a coup attempt than a witch hunt, I suppose.

       Of course the Republicans are in on it. Trump humiliated their greatest champions and took over their party. They hate him.

       Hmm let's see.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Investigation started after Trump went on TV and said 'i fired Come because of this Trump Russia thing' and after Trump said to the Russian ambassador that firing Comey relieved pressure regarding Russia.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Comey is a republican. Rosenstein I'd a republican. Mueller is a republican. Is anyone that dislikes Trump
         <em>
          not
         </em>
         the deep state? You're using it as a crutch so you don't have to think critically about the facts.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The investigation has lead to multiple indictments and has revealed rampant dishonesty coming out of the Trump campaign regarding their foreign ties.

       1)The Special Counsel investigation started after Trump fired Comey.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Comey being a Republican means nothing when Donald Trump isn't one other than in name only. Romney, McCain, and Bush are Republicans too. The establishment wing of the party hates Trump and hates Trump's movement/base.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)The indictments haven't amounted to shit and have nothing to do with Russian collusion or Trump.

       Why shouldn't establishment Republicans hate Trump? All he's done is insult them and their policies, actively campaigned against other Republicans that didn't agree with him, blame other Republicans for his failures (Obamacare repeal), and generally drag down the office of the President. Every day he tweets he lowers the prestige of the GOP. He's done absolutely nothing to help the GOP that a rookie congressman could have done.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it's no big deal when all the higher up people who Trump surrounded himself in the campaign have been caught lying to the FBI about their Russian connections and even get caught money laundering with Russians? Just a coincidence I guess. How can you read Trump's tweets with your head so far up his ass?

       Because Trump's policies are basically everything the GOP demanded for years. Tax cuts, Obamacare repeal, end of regulations, end Iran/Paris deals etc. None of that matters to the McCains, Bushes, Muellers, and Romneys who have globalist ambitions being hampered by Trump's nationalism.

       Who are these close confidants of Trump who have lied to the FBI? Manafort, who served with Trump for a few months and is connected to every other major GOP campaign? Flynn was charged for forgetting about talking to the Russian ambassador, not a spy or lobbyist.

       Oh that makes it better. How many lies is the right amount of lies? Is just 1 lie okay? Obviously not - if someone is caught lying the truth should be found out.

       The GOP could have gotten their entire agenda passed had they elected literally anybody but Trump. His inability to govern in good faith and his absolute need for controversy and crisis has hamstrung the GOP agenda the entire time. It's clear he's purposefully driving controversy and division, which is inexplicably OK according to the GOP.

       The Russian story has been pretty firmly beat to death by the news.  It’ll resurface during the next round of indictments, then die down again, then resfurace again after more indictments, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story won’t go away until the Mueller report is released, Congressional action is taken (if necessary) and trials/proceedings are completed.  It’ll be around for a couple more years.

       That’s fine and I’m just answering to add context. I think he’s wrong both generally and about it not being covered in the media. This is just one story. There are plenty from the last few weeks.

       Why on earth would you think I do that?? Whether someone agrees or disagrees with me has nothing to do with whether he/she is a degenerate. All shills are degenerates by default, because only a degenerate would accept a low wage in exchange for the subversion of genuine discourse.

       I think the Democrats realized that ranting about conspiracy theories involving Russia won't help them at all during the midterms. Having the corporate media braying about unproven theories might even have a negative effect on Democrats' electoral performance. They'd do better blaming Trump for concentration camps even though Obama also locked up children in concentration camps.

       This method of propagandizing a population to do their bidding has worked so well in the past, why change it?

       That’s fine and I’m just answering to add context. I think he’s wrong both generally and about it not being covered in the media. This is just one story. There are plenty from the last few weeks.

       Trump Jr. met with a "former" Russian intelligence agent who specializes in

       at Trump tower with Kushner and Paul Manafort.

       Trump Jr. himself released the emails and admitted they talked about Russian sanctions.
