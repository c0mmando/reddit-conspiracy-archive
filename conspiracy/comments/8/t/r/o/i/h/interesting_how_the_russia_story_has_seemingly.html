    <div class="md"><p>Why shouldn&#39;t establishment Republicans hate Trump? All he&#39;s done is insult them and their policies, actively campaigned against other Republicans that didn&#39;t agree with him, blame other Republicans for his failures (Obamacare repeal), and generally drag down the office of the President. Every day he tweets he lowers the prestige of the GOP. He&#39;s done absolutely nothing to help the GOP that a rookie congressman could have done.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s no big deal when all the higher up people who Trump surrounded himself in the campaign have been caught lying to the FBI about their Russian connections and even get caught money laundering with Russians? Just a coincidence I guess. How can you read Trump&#39;s tweets with your head so far up his ass?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Trump&#39;s policies are basically everything the GOP demanded for years. Tax cuts, Obamacare repeal, end of regulations, end Iran/Paris deals etc. None of that matters to the McCains, Bushes, Muellers, and Romneys who have globalist ambitions being hampered by Trump&#39;s nationalism.</p>

<p>Who are these close confidants of Trump who have lied to the FBI? Manafort, who served with Trump for a few months and is connected to every other major GOP campaign? Flynn was charged for forgetting about talking to the Russian ambassador, not a spy or lobbyist. </p>

<p>Oh that makes it better. How many lies is the right amount of lies? Is just 1 lie okay? Obviously not - if someone is caught lying the truth should be found out.</p>

<p>The GOP could have gotten their entire agenda passed had they elected literally anybody but Trump. His inability to govern in good faith and his absolute need for controversy and crisis has hamstrung the GOP agenda the entire time. It&#39;s clear he&#39;s purposefully driving controversy and division, which is inexplicably OK according to the GOP.</p>

<p>Why on earth would you think I do that?? Whether someone agrees or disagrees with me has nothing to do with whether he/she is a degenerate. All shills are degenerates by default, because only a degenerate would accept a low wage in exchange for the subversion of genuine discourse.</p>
