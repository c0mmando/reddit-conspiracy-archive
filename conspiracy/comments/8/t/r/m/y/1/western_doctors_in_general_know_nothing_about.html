        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Western doctors,  in general,  know nothing about nutrition.   They&#39;re  taught nothing about the healing powers of food in medical school because their whole purpose (by dedign) is to prescribe pharmaceuticals for the Rockefeller Medicine machine.   </p>

<p>I had to go to the hospital once (emergency medicine is the best and most justifiable aspect of Western medicine) and while I was there started to develop a huge cold sore on my lip from high fever.  </p>

<p>The herpes virus in cold sores can be deactivated with lysine; iirc it interferes with an enzyme the virus needs for replication. Every time I feel a cold sore coming on,  I take lysine orally and apply an ointment containing lysine.   The sores never develop because I halt the virus in it&#39;s tracks and it goes back into dormancy. </p>

<p>I tried to explain this to my nurses and doctor,  a cardiovascular surgeon.  I didn&#39;t have any lysine at the hospital and could tell the outbreak was going to be insane if I didn&#39;t get some in me, so I requested it and offered my explanation as to why I needed it. </p>

<p>The intereference of lysine with the function of herpes virus is an established scientific fact,  yet none of the nurses nor my doctor believed me.  I could overhear them discussing my &quot;odd beliefs&quot; in the hallway. They finally decided,  &quot;well, it&#39;s just a supplement, it isn&#39;t going to hurt him&quot;, and they agreed to let me have the lysine as some sort of placebo (from their perspective) to help me feel better. </p>

<p><strong>People can go to medical school for decades, but,  if the schools are limiting the information distributed to only that which benefits particular agendas, the students are only being taught how to further that agenda</strong>. We end up with medical experts that know very little about how the body actually works outside the context how Rockefeller pharmaceuticals affect it. </p>

<p>I started writing this in a comment concerning cancer treatments.  </p>

<p>People, generally,  &quot;get&quot; cancer because their immune system becomes so compromised that their body no longer kills off cancerous cells before they become a problem.</p>

<p>The Western medical cartel will never admit to this, but will instead advocate their brand new &quot;Immune response stimulating cancer treatments&quot; which cost an arm and a leg and tend to only extend the patient&#39;s life for a few more months while the draining of their savings account occurs.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve already been pushing this type of bullshit &quot;treatment&quot; for over a year on the &quot;ask your doctor&quot; ads. Funny thing is, the shit they&#39;re shooting people up with and charging big money for just doesn&#39;t stimulate your immune system as efficiently and properly as clean foods you can pick up from your local farmers market or grow yourself.</p>

<p>Pharmaceuticals do not heal you. &quot;Tricking&quot; your body into an immune response with drugs or adjuvants is damaging to your entire immune system.  It isn&#39;t supposed to be cattle-prodded that way. </p>

<p>If you want to heal your body,  nutrition is the key.  You are what you eat; don&#39;t build the foundation for your immune system with processed &quot;food&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may seem obvious to some that more nutritious meals can affect your health and recovery from disease. You would have expected that such questions would have been solved decades ago. You might also assume that medical schools would have long ago provided rigorous nutrition education programs as a requirement to become a physician, but that&#39;s not true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 1985 landmark report on nutrition in medical schools by the National Academy of Sciences found that on average, future physicians received 21 hours of nutrition instruction over four years. Medical students need at least 25 hours to be adequately prepared to help patients, the report concluded.</p>

<p>Yet more than two decades later, nutrition education in U.S. medical schools remains inadequate, according to a 2010 study led by Adams and her UNC colleagues and published in the journal Academic Medicine.</p>

<p>On average, doctors receive 19 hours of total nutrition education in medical school; in 2004 the average was 22.3 hours, according to the study, conducted as part of the Nutrition in Medicine project at UNC. In 2009, 27 percent of the schools met the minimum standard of nutrition training, compared with 38 percent in 2004.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Years later, as a newly minted doctor on the wards seeing real patients, I found myself in the same position. I was still getting a lot of questions about food and diet. And I was still hesitating when answering. I wasn’t sure I knew that much more after medical school than I did before.</p>

<p>One day I mentioned this uncomfortable situation to another young doctor. “Just consult the dietitians if you have a problem,” she said after listening to my confession. “They’ll take care of it.” She paused for a moment, looked suspiciously around the nursing station, then leaned over and whispered, “I know we’re supposed to know about nutrition and diet, but none of us really does.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great Post. Check out <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org">nutritionfacts.org</a> </p>

<p>There is a lot more that interlinks in just the pharma companies. It even goes to the farmers and lobbyists in the U.S.  </p>

<p>Since we are on the topic of nutrition.</p>

<p>American government pays out 38 billion in subsidize for meat and dairy.  A measly 17 million for fruits and vegetables. Pretty fair huh?</p>

<p>Look up recommended foods for the diabetes or heart disease from top U.S. non profits or U.S Government entities. Absolute joke. The China study is something worth checking out too.</p>

<p>Most of the processed foods and animal products cause inflammation in your body, which can lead to disease over time.</p>

<p>Most doctors in the U.S. barely even take one nutrition class through out all their years of schooling. They should be taking one at least every other year in my opinion. Most nutritionists are also spoon fed the FDA guidelines or use it for their go to source.</p>

<p>Yes! And where did those FDA guidelines come from?  Those were engineered as the result of lobbying pressure.  The first three decades of my life,  I was advised by the &quot;food pyramid&quot; and every official source pushing it to consume the lionshare of my calories in the form of grains and dairy products...  Which is horrible fucking nutrition advice.</p>

<p>Most people were eating a diet promoted only by financial interests that didn&#39;t care what the health results were of following that advice. </p>

<p>Your body can absorb more useable calcium from kale than it can from pasteurized milk, but, the kale industry just didn&#39;t have as much weight or money to throw around... So,  &quot;milk does a body good&quot;! was plastered all  over the TV and papers instead of sound nutritional advice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, no it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Lysine isn&#39;t discredited by anyone, but its efficacy is pretty shit. It&#39;s the same for any &quot;natural&quot; remedy -- if you can&#39;t predict patient outcome, why propose it at all? Besides, most medications are literally synthesized from so-called &quot;natural&quot; remedies.</p>

<p>It has been proven numerous times that holistic medicine is a fucking joke.</p>

<p>Juicing is also terrible becuase it removes the fiber, which is <strong>needed</strong> for absorption. You absorb <em>more</em> nuterients from eating whole foods than from juicing/blending/blahblahblah.</p>

<p>&quot;Ask your doctor&quot; exists because of the way our laws work. When you go to the ER you can&#39;t ask your doctor for <em>X</em> because they aren&#39;t your primary care physician. They&#39;&#39; write up a PCR, file it, give you a short duration medication (no more than 10 doses but usually 5), and refer you back to your primary care physician.</p>

<p>You are supposed to &quot;Ask your doctor&quot; while at a general check-up for something chronic, and even then it is dependant upon your PBM whitelist if you can receive it covered. If you have CVS Caremark you may have something completely different than Tricare.</p>

<p>Furthermore, most medicines fall under three umbrellas: Brand, Generic, and Biosimilar. Brand is usually owned for 10 years, then generics are allowed to enter the market. Biosimilars may enter during brand control because they may have a different mechanism or concentration.</p>

<p>Lastly, it takes 20-25 years for a new drug to hit retail. I&#39;ve read reports from AstraZeneca where a targeted genomic therapy was showing promise, but they the efficacy wasn&#39;t high enough in trials for the FDA to approve it (even though it was ~70%). We&#39;re guided by FDA legislation from 1962.</p>

<p>I will make a key note here: Medical doctors (there are many specialties) are not nutritionists or Dieticians (RD). If OP wanted nutritional advice, he would seek out an accredited RD not an MD. Nutritionists are loosely regulated and not a protected title so they can claim anything, ignore them.</p>

<p>One more thing I want to make note of when the OP says &quot;tricking your immune system&quot; is bad for it... bullshit. Absolute bullshit.</p>

<p>Our immune systems are incredibly robust, so much so that many of us suffer from allergies, arthritis, asthma, lupus, inflammatory bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, Guillain-Barre syndrom, psoriasis, Graves&#39; disease, vasculitis, and many more. Why? Because our immune system is fucking <strong>strong</strong>.</p>

<p>Go to any doc, and steroids are a last ditch effort since they effectively shut down the immune response. Look at AIDS patients, they whither away and die from simple illnesses when untreated. Hell, there are studies under way right now showing that proto-humans up until even a few hundred years ago had bodies absolutely infested with parasites, and trials have already been done using hookworms to suppress people with chronic allergies and asthma.</p>

<p>TLDR; OP has no fucking idea what he is saying. Read a book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You are wrong. The USA is the most prescribed nation in the world with a huge pharma driven complex for money making. Period. If you have a healthy diet and lifestyle, unless affected by some type of genetic disorder, your body will be at an optimal physiological state. The western diet and lifestyle is bullshit and contributes to the majority of disease in the USA. Sure anyone who smokes, consumes alcohol, or takes toxic drugs puts themselves at risk, but so does eating all these processed and unnatural foods with toxic additives. The addiction to processed sugars in America, regardless of what the texts say, is the leading cause  of medical problems anywhere. And that&#39;s not mere speculation, its biological and physiological fact. For example, processed sugars act as an inflammatory agent in the body, especially in the vasculature and overwork your liver and pancreas in hormonal regulation. That&#39;s why eventually if someone gets diabetes, it&#39;s essentially synonymous with cardiac disease. So Cajual, you are grossly misinformed. And that&#39;s merely one example of many from an endless list. And in response to the juicing thing, instead of juicy, make a smoothie and keep the fiber. Problem solved.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I do think that people who preach homeopathic medicine are equally misinformed. There needs to be a balance between natural and pharma in terms of treating diseased individuals.</p>

<p>Processed means pasteurized with preservatives. The only reason we can even feed the population at large is by preventing bacterial growth. Salt is a preservative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The addiction to processed sugars</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All sugar is processed. If you mean &quot;refined&quot; sugar, that just means a sugar that has been removed from its source. All sugar is bad for you without moderation, but there is no difference (outside of enzymatic processes) between glucose, fructose, dextrose, etc. One caveat is that the most <em>natural</em> of sugars, lactose, actually causes gut inflammation in a large portion of humans. We aren&#39;t meant to intake as much dairy as we do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if someone gets diabetes, it&#39;s essentially synonymous with cardiac disease</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Type 1 diabetes is caused by an overactive immune system, and has nothing to do with the cardiovascular system OR sugar.</p>

<p>Type 2 does not <em>cause</em> CVD, it&#39;s simply an indication of possible CVD risk because if you have Type 2 you&#39;re probably obese and have horrible health anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an well aware about the dangers of &quot;refined&quot; sugars. I&#39;m not playing the semantics game. Sodium itself is overconsumed in the western diet, with many individuals vastly consuming more than is recommended each day. Ffs, and meal from McDonalds can contain 3-4 grams of sodium, talk about fluid overload and HTN. FDA guidelines are flawed and clearly money driven or influenced. Remember the push of a &#39;low fat&#39; diet which was consider heart healthy. LOL. No no no, a low carb diet, especially simple sugars, is what is heart healthy, I conjunction with increased protein and healthy fat intake. And I said if someone develops diabetes, which points towards DM II, and it absolutely is synonymous with cardiovascular disease. If you&#39;re at the point where you develop type 2 diabetes you most likely have vascular disease to some extent. And you don&#39;t have to be fat and in terrible shape to get diabetes. Again, it&#39;s a balance that needs to be achieved in western medicine, which doesn&#39;t exist right now.  The need to exponential increase lifestyle modification education is paramount, with a focus on diet and substances.</p>

<p>I saw improvement in my health from such a diet. I had more energy, consistency and focus. I had no major diseases to cure though. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re missing e and point the op is making. What material we give the body to construct, repair and fuel the body matters. It matters for every machine we know. Give it poor fuel, electricity or improper fluids and it fails faster. Do you think our body is robust enough for endless assaults? You yourself have indicated, no.</p>

<p>Lysine works for me 19 times out of 20. It also works without side-effects because it isn&#39;t a pharmacuetical, which makes it  a great deal better. I also know 3 other people that have as much success with it as I do.  I&#39;m sorry thus upsets you so thoroughly.</p>

<p>Fiber helps digestion in many respects,  but does <strong>not</strong> assist you in absorbing nutrients. That is why you&#39;re not supposed to take medications within 2 hours before it after a fiber supplement, because it can hinder drug absorption.  You&#39;re completely confused about what fiber does for you. Im not eating a fiber-free diet anyway... The juicing is for tripling or quadrupling my veggie intake. I mention that in my post.

<p>Implicit in “ask your doctor if drug X is right for you,” is the message: “go to your doctor.” That’s the key. If the ads can put a viewer into the system, he will be diagnosed with <strong>something</strong>, and he’ll be given a drug for it. </p>

<p>Our immune systems are incredibly robust, so much so that many of us suffer from allergies, arthritis, asthma, lupus, inflammatory bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, Guillain-Barre syndrom, psoriasis, Graves&#39; disease, vasculitis, and many more. Why? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Evidence has been mounting that a lot of things on that list can be caused by vaccines manufactured with human cells or with ingredients that have a similar counterpart in the human body. When you &quot;cattle-prod&quot; the immune system with a cocktail of adjuvants, a simple human protein contamination in the vaccine can be percieved as a foreign invader and your own immune system will start attacking parts of your own body. We do have strong immune systems,  but for it to attack our own body is not normal, and the prevalence of this abnormal state is rising, likely due to immunologists not quite understanding fully their self-proclaimed &quot;settled science&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Go to any doc, and steroids are a last ditch effort since they effectively shut down the immune response. </p>

<p>Is that why most of those drug ads urging you to &quot;ask your doctor&quot; are for drugs that destroy your  immune system? Damn near everyone of those drugs is designed to hinder your immune system. They make it clear in the disclaimers. &quot; don&#39;t take x if you&#39;re prone to infections, tell your doctor if you&#39;ve been to parts of the world where fungal infections are common&quot;.</p>

<p>Uh, there is a major difference between a prescribed medication and absorption of nutrients. Foremost, I&#39;ll put this in layman&#39;s terms: gastric fill rate allows for more digestive time to absorb nutrients. Medications are dosed based on specific absorption rates, so the easiest method of measurement is an empty stomach.</p>

<p>Uh, no I&#39;m not. While these ads are completely unethical, they exist because of the ridiculous laws around our healthcare industry.</p>

<p>The company that creates the drug/therapy is NOT the benefits manager that pays for the medication, which is NOT the local pharmacy, which is NOT the hospital, which may employ doctors that work at numerous facilities.</p>

<p>Calling out &quot;big pharma&quot; is absurd. It&#39;s mostly the FDA, insurance agencies, and politicians that regulate this cluster fuck.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in this evidence, since I haven&#39;t heard anything about vaccines and allergies. All my children were vaccinated, and only the first one, which we used to Lysol everything, has allergies. The other two played outside barefoot and ate dirt and we switched to simple cleaners rather than harsh cleaners and they do not have allergies. New research does, however, show that slowly presenting common allergens, like peanuts, to infants and toddlers has reduced the number of acute allergic reactions, known as &quot;oral immunotherapy&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is that why most of those drug ads urging you to &quot;ask your doctor&quot; are for drugs that destroy your immune system? </p>

<p>Say what? Outside of anti-inflammatory drugs the only two drugs I know that fuck with the immune system and have a common commercial presence are SSRI&#39;s and Statins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. My wife and I both recently watched <em>Take Your Pills</em> and <em>What the Health?</em> (both on Netflix) and it&#39;s really staggering the amount of misinformation being spread in the USA.</p>

<p>Granted, both documentaries push their vegan or keto lifestyle, and while both <em>can</em> be considered propaganda for their respective diets, the simple underlying fact remains: <strong>Eat ZERO processed food (nothing from bags, cans, or boxes) and eat as much stuff that grows out of the ground naturally, or feeds off the earth naturally and is not pumped full of hormones</strong>.</p>

<p>Luckily, one of my wife&#39;s clients owns her own cattle farm where each cow is grass fed and hormone free; a friend of the cattle owner has their own chicken farm which also has natural chickens that are hormone free. Between both farmers, we have hormone free eggs, poultry, and beef. It&#39;s a large cost up front for the beef, but once vacuum-sealed and frozen, our portion of the cow will probably last a good year.</p>

<p>Question though: We&#39;re expecting our first this October and one of the things I&#39;m getting <em>very</em> concerned about are vaccination shots. Polio, Diptheria, etc. are all listed as preventable via vaccination shots and the CDC lays out the vaccination schedule for the child through 18 years. I&#39;ve heard stories of children who were perfectly normal up until a certain vaccination, then after, the child no longer speaks and is severely autistic. Given that doctor&#39;s are incredibly uninformed about diet and nutrition, I&#39;m beginning to question how much they <em>really</em> know about the concoction they stick into infants. In theory, it&#39;s the necessary ingredients to vaccinate against the above diseases, but is there something more that can really fuck up a child for life? Are there natural alternatives to the vaccines pushed upon us by doctors and the CDC?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You have good reason to question.  IMO and experience, most family doctors do not investigate these issues for themselves.  They feel confident in what they learned in medical school and are quite content to do whatever the AMA tells them to do;  that&#39;s how they keep that license they worked so hard for,  after all.  Rocking the boat by looking into matters the AMA calls nonsense is a great way to lose their career.  </p>

<p>Since that is the case,  I think most family doctors assume they are doing good by people,  even when they aren&#39;t.  They don&#39;t have to bother second-guessing themselves,  because the organization which lays down their guidelines does all that &quot;thinking&quot; for them,  they just have to implement the knowledge they&#39;re given.</p>

<p>My kids were a few years old when I met them so I missed their baby shots; they&#39;re not mine biologically.  I didn&#39;t know anything about the vaccine controversy when they were young and they got most of their shots before I learned that there could be problems.   When they were required by their school to get the MMR vaccine as teenagers, their mother insisted they get it so there were no problems with the school cliques.  I didn&#39;t feel all that great about it, so I made the kids some bottles of juice from plants and fruits that have anti-inflammatory properties and told them to drink em up before and after the shot. Vaccine damage can occur due to inflammatory response in the body and brain and it has been theorized that the presence of <strong>natural</strong> anti-inflammatories can help prevent that over-reaction of the immune system.  I stress <strong>natural</strong> anti-inflammatories; stay away from pharmaceutical analgesics immediately after a vaccination. </p>

<p>Read as much as you can about the specific vaccines in your baby&#39;s schedule so you know what you&#39;re dealing with.  Not just &quot;official&quot; information from the CDC....  read <strong>everything</strong> you can find, separate the wheat from the chaff, and then make your decisions from an informed perspective.   You might decide some are not necessary; there is much controversy about the need for hepatitis B vaccine administered to a newborn, for example.</p>

<p>Not following the vaccine timeline is recommended... spacing things out more can give tiny bodies a chance to adapt.  This is your baby we&#39;re talking about; doctors need to accommodate your wishes,  not the other way around. I suggest avoiding combo shots,  if possible.  The combo shots, generally,  sow more problems.   If you can get the same vaccines separately and not in some fast-food-like combo pack the risks might be lower due to less complexity in manufacturing = better quality control. </p>

<p>I,  personally,  think vaccines have not been pushed with the best intentions in mind,  and I&#39;ll never accept another. My kids will get the meningitis vaccine when they go to college, but I can&#39;t really think of any other they must have. </p>

<p>There are people here who are way more OCD about vaccine information and most likely have a far better idea of what information you should look into.  u/liverpoolwin is my absolute favorite poster concerning vaccines. Picking through their post history is gold and they&#39;d probably happily offer information more specific to your needs than I can. </p>

<p>Best wishes with your first!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right.  But see, while most doctors do care, they end up having a fatalistic approach to things as they deal with people at their worst, day in and day out.  They give the right advice all the time, and most the time they see it not carried out.  (i think i have a mistake in my post that makes it read incorrectly.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that most doctors do care, but the problem lies in their <del>education</del> indoctrination into medicine by the same Rockefeller sponsored General Education Board. That said, everyone has a responsibility to educate themselves, especially in these times where information is readily available. And that goes for doctors as well. </p>

<p>Too many times you see doctors using outdated methods because they don&#39;t care enough to keep up to date with the latest research (a big part of that research being diet and nutrition). So while doctors do inherently care about their patients, many don&#39;t care enough to continue learning once they&#39;ve received that degree and start getting a really nice paycheck. And that really falls back on the entire system itself. </p>

<p>You&#39;d think doctors would have to pass a test every year that includes all of the medical advances from the previous year(s) in order to keep practicing. Or at least have a basic, current year understanding of proper diet and nutrition, as OP so eloquently pointed out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so two things related to this thread:</p>

<p>first, youre absolutely right about nutritional science. it is one of the roughest industries in the USA about misinformation and in my opinion, the worst group to impact it has been the sugar industry. Many scientific journals rewrote their rules about publishing and disclosing financial ties because of the awful science published about fats compared to sugars and obesity. So nutrition has dealt with insane bullshit for years.</p>

<p>Secondly, I would say give your doctor a bit of a break. In medicine, you become so incredibly highly specialized. Everyone learns the basics of how the body works, but medicine in the US has developed so that your doctor will be incredibly good at a narrow set of skills. He was a cardiovascular surgeon. He most likely had no idea how to treat a cold sore, and if you came to him with a fungal infection on your foot, he probably could not tell you how to treat it. But the dermatologist or podiatrist couldn&#39;t effectively completely a stint in your heart valve. So, I dont know if its a huge conspiracy, as much as that is entirely out of the docs expertise</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re  saying about specialization.  </p>

<p>I certainly didn&#39;t go to him for my cold sore,  I just needed his help with getting lysine because I wasn&#39;t allowed to leave the hospital and go across the street for my own supplements.   I was pretty much under his full control and everything I consumed had to be cleared through him because it had to be brought to me by hospital staff. So, despite him being a great doctor with much expertise whom I highly admired,  his lack of knowledge in nutrition directly affected me. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re attempting to minimize the huge actual conspiracy of valuable nutrition information intentionally not being taught in medical school by conflating it with my silly little example of trouble getting supplements for my cold sore.  </p>

<p>If he&#39;d had proper training in actual nutrition (as EVERY doctor should during to course of medical school, but doesn&#39;t ) he wouldn&#39;t have had the general perspective that supplements can&#39;t really do anything for you, and my request for Lysine wouldnt have been received as if I were asking for a voodoo ritual to be performed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your second point helps make the case of a conspiracy. The first thing you do when trying to keep something a big secret is to compartmentalize those involved. Then you teach them what you <em>want</em> to teach them. After years and years of indoctrination, we get highly specialized doctors with no basic understanding of proper diet and nutrition, which is the fundamental key to good health. </p>

<p>Nutrition isn&#39;t rocket science.  Yes,  there is a lot to learn.  Interestingly enough,  a large portion of the learning curve for educating yourself about it involves learning what needs to be <strong>unlearned</strong>. We all grew up getting incorrect advice from official sources. A large portion of &quot;the basics&quot; we learned growing up are complete bullshit. </p>

<p>Now,  I&#39;m learning as much as I can about nutrition from non-mainstream sources,  for obvious reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When someone is talking about science says that there is no evidence, they mean that there is no enough evidence of high enough quality to support something. Yes, of course there are studies that say that it works, but there are studies that say that it doesnt work. But the current metaanalysis say that current studies are not good enough to get meaningful data, which is common for anything about diet.</p>

<p>Not important at all. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s terrible advice, if you have the best (better outcomes, less side effects) treatment for something you use that. Using mild remedies may make things worse because you are wasting time, which is really important for Acne because if it goes untreated it may get worse and leave scars on the patient face/body.</p>

<p>If you have acne, go see a doctor, make it better while you can, I have seen too many idiots that don&#39;t do it until their skin is a mess beyond what medicines and cream can help.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to get serious about juicing, aim for a juicer that is easy to clean. The easier it is to clean,  the more you&#39;ll do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My eczema was caused by an overgrowth of Candida Albicans yeast in my system,  from eating too many carbs consistently over a long period of time.   Western doctors think the overgrowth can only happen in people who have severely incapacitated immune systems,  like folks undergoing chemotherapy or who have AIDS.  That simply isn&#39;t true.   A much larger percentage of the population has an overgrowth  of Candida which is out of control enough to cause chronic inflammation in their bodies.  The AMA loves unidentified chronic inflammation; it creates more customers. </p>

<p>The yeast themselves don&#39;t hurt us;  it is their waste products which build up in our bloodstream and tissues.   They&#39;re  fermenting everything we eat and they&#39;re in our bloodstream as well as our guts.  Everyone has yeast in them;  only for some does the balance get out of whack,  usually after a course of rigorous antibiotics which kills off beneficial flora in the gut. </p>

<p>Once I finally understood what was wrong I employed the Atkins diet,  keeping my daily intake of carbs below 10g  for the first 3 weeks then going up to no more than 50g per day after that.  </p>

<p>It took 3 months,  but the Candida yeast population did subsist and I can finally eat carbs in moderation without having to worry about getting a body-wide rash. </p>

<p>After 2 months of Atkins,  I started using High Meat.  High Meat is meat which has been carefully and dare I say,  &quot;cleanfully&quot; rotted under aerobic conditions.   I know the FDA hates the idea of bioactivity in the foods we eat,  but I think consuming the cultured bacteria in the High Meat is what tipped the scales concerning my healing with Candida. </p>

<p>Even though the meat was putrid (2 months old with several  multi-day stints at room tempersture to ensure a cranking culture),  I never became ill or got food poisoning. </p>

<p>Here is the information which got me started with understanding and safely using High Meat.</p>

<p>it&#39;s similar in a way to what i found to be the likely culprit for the sebhorreic dermatitis -- some kind of fungus</p>

<p>i wonder if it&#39;s a body culture issue that i&#39;ve just figured out how to contain (because it always comes back rather quickly)</p>

For the most part doctors get a couple classes in their education for nutrition. More or less the basics, some do more if it’s an interest to them. The reason for this is because nutrition because such a large part of the healthcare system, also a specialized one where you go to someone specifically for nutrition, and these are commonly referred to by physicians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, no it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Lysine isn&#39;t discredited by anyone, but its efficacy is pretty shit. It&#39;s the same for any &quot;natural&quot; remedy -- if you can&#39;t predict patient outcome, why propose it at all? Besides, most medications are literally synthesized from so-called &quot;natural&quot; remedies.</p>

<p>It has been proven numerous times that holistic medicine is a fucking joke.</p>

<p>Juicing is also terrible becuase it removes the fiber, which is <strong>needed</strong> for absorption. You absorb <em>more</em> nuterients from eating whole foods than from juicing/blending/blahblahblah.</p>

<p>&quot;Ask your doctor&quot; exists because of the way our laws work. When you go to the ER you can&#39;t ask your doctor for <em>X</em> because they aren&#39;t your primary care physician. They&#39;&#39; write up a PCR, file it, give you a short duration medication (no more than 10 doses but usually 5), and refer you back to your primary care physician.</p>

<p>You are supposed to &quot;Ask your doctor&quot; while at a general check-up for something chronic, and even then it is dependant upon your PBM whitelist if you can receive it covered. If you have CVS Caremark you may have something completely different than Tricare.</p>

<p>Furthermore, most medicines fall under three umbrellas: Brand, Generic, and Biosimilar. Brand is usually owned for 10 years, then generics are allowed to enter the market. Biosimilars may enter during brand control because they may have a different mechanism or concentration.</p>

<p>Lastly, it takes 20-25 years for a new drug to hit retail. I&#39;ve read reports from AstraZeneca where a targeted genomic therapy was showing promise, but they the efficacy wasn&#39;t high enough in trials for the FDA to approve it (even though it was ~70%). We&#39;re guided by FDA legislation from 1962.</p>

<p>I will make a key note here: Medical doctors (there are many specialties) are not nutritionists or Dieticians (RD). If OP wanted nutritional advice, he would seek out an accredited RD not an MD. Nutritionists are loosely regulated and not a protected title so they can claim anything, ignore them.</p>

<p>One more thing I want to make note of when the OP says &quot;tricking your immune system&quot; is bad for it... bullshit. Absolute bullshit.</p>

<p>Our immune systems are incredibly robust, so much so that many of us suffer from allergies, arthritis, asthma, lupus, inflammatory bowel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, Guillain-Barre syndrom, psoriasis, Graves&#39; disease, vasculitis, and many more. Why? Because our immune system is fucking <strong>strong</strong>.</p>

<p>Go to any doc, and steroids are a last ditch effort since they effectively shut down the immune response. Look at AIDS patients, they whither away and die from simple illnesses when untreated. Hell, there are studies under way right now showing that proto-humans up until even a few hundred years ago had bodies absolutely infested with parasites, and trials have already been done using hookworms to suppress people with chronic allergies and asthma.</p>

<p>TLDR; OP has no fucking idea what he is saying. Read a book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right.  But see, while most doctors do care, they end up having a fatalistic approach to things as they deal with people at their worst, day in and day out.  They give the right advice all the time, and most the time they see it not carried out.  (i think i have a mistake in my post that makes it read incorrectly.)</p>

<p>Even if there wasnt any evidence. You can ask anybody (including myself) who has/had acne if their diet has an influence on their acne and they will wholeheartedly tell you yes.</p>

<p>My opinion is that doctors should tell their patients to try mild remedies, suchs as changig their diet or taking vitamin supplements, first, before putting them on creams or pills. </p>

<p>I think modern medicine is a great thing. And we are certainly able to help/cure a lot of people. But I do believe it has become too much of a business and we have lost a little of our focus and appreciation of what we can do with nature/plants/non chemical remedies. </p>

She won&#39;t eat meat period but she doesn&#39;t know enough to get a diet with the proper protein and she gets sick and of course my brother in law becomes hyper critical.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so convinced of this path I&#39;m on that I want to take it to extremes.  Roots and certain mushrooms seem to be a miracle for a lot of ailments. Oils like Olive and Grapeseed are good too.  I&#39;m not near where I want to be though.</p>
