       I think he's waiting for it to happen still. Its all a big joke. And a kinda hilarious one. I had never seen those Halloween specials before but this clip of AJ opening for Stanhope shows that Alex Jones understands stand up despite claiming never done it before.

       Alex is 'Bill's new character. Yes, the two are the same person genetically. You can see it in the teeth. Tooth for tooth. Freckle for freckle. Same facial profile. Height. Weight. They worked with the same producer, Kevin Booth, and began their fame in the exact same city under the same man. When testifying in court, Alex Jones defends himself as an actor... the same as any WWE actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Bill passed away... (under very suspicious circumstances with no official burial from pancreatic cancer at (32!!!))... Alex Jones pops on the radar with his Rush Limbaugh inspired public access style show. (Actually replacing a first 'Alex Jones' of which only one  video recording exists in '97 - this 'Alex' was replaced by Hicks) Keep in mind that Bill's final standup acts vehemently critisized Rush for being people's "daddy" and ranting about people not being able to think on their own. Bill despised Rush's style and the way people echoed his every word while valuable independent social critics/comics had no platform or following. Bill was definitely not a republican style neo con. He was a 'conspiracy theorist' as one would say today who indulged in shrooms and philosophy, but he taught the ideas of Chomsky and the foundations of quantum physics in a palatable way for crowds to understand or just laugh with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch Bill's last interview, and his last stand up. He's 50 years ahead of his time. He created the world's greatest joke and he's laughing at the entire universe, while still half educating and half providing a layered satire unlike any other. The fact that you see comments all over the internet stating things like "Bill was a genius. Fuck Alex Jones he's a stupid conservative." is only a testament to how brilliant Bill is. He fooled the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's waiting for someone to call out the bullshit in a way he can't slither out of. Right now however, he's actually successfully educating the audience from a different satirical angle while peddling products that are shown to increase IQ and testosterone. He's got his own gravy train so why stop now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill/Alex is pure chaotic neutral. Although, I think his radical opinions have been greatly suppressed by the CIA. He's performed this act for so long - will he fly too close to the sun? Will Obama or the CIA make him disappear?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tune in next week for more Bill Hicks/Alex Jones antics!

       aaight, i get that harmless fun approach, If I had to defend them I would say those dumb conspiracies make us look harmless, so they pay less attention when we are uncovering the world cannibal elite

       I wouldent call them elite. They dont score higher in university. They dont win gold medals. By no measurment other than wealth are they elite. And they simply came into wealth typically by murder and some form of slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       So i would call them the ruling class. Because that is what they do. They rule everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for an not taking the sub seriously, sure. I can understand that this may make us look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time anytime you say "world cannibal elite" no one is going to take you seriously any way. You might as well say Pink hipographs ailean hot dog.

       They call themselves EL-ITE cause "EL" means god, look it up, the more I mention their Cannibal inclinations the more likely someone will get redpilled when they come across things like "spirit cooking" or the world famous "human hunting parties" that everybody around the world knows happen on the "black forest" also look that up, Hansel and Gretel is based on that forest, that is how famous it is

       It is portraid on almost every piece of mayor fiction, for example in "one piece the anime there is the elite who live on a private area and keep all species as food and slaves, if you look for this after hearing someone like me mention it, you will see it EVERYWHERE, I highlight it on every chance I get, they are after the "adrenochrome" that humans produce in the blood when scared, then they drink it, its their main thing.  nice link thanks.

       The Mandela thing has been controlled from the beginning. There's something to that. If not for anyone else but for me personally in that I have all three versions of the same creepy ass Halloween "berestein/bernstein/barenstein" book. I think really that one just comes down to changes in branding.

       I watched Alex Jones on access TV when he was in his early 20s, and I also knew who Bill Hicks was. They were different people, and Alex Jones is the same guy now as in the 90's.

       I did watch the video. While they do resemble each other, they are clearly not the same person (as amazing of a story as that would be). Bill Hicks was huge at the same time around these parts, and the younger Alex was quite obviously copying him in mannerisms and broadcasting voices. They are both white guys from the same region; it's not exactly mind-blowing evidence that they share some physical characteristics. I suspect this whole thing is enabled by autistic face blindness, no offense.

       Alex is 'Bill's new character. Yes, the two are the same person genetically. You can see it in the teeth. Tooth for tooth. Freckle for freckle. Same facial profile. Height. Weight. They worked with the same producer, Kevin Booth (Sacred Cow Studios), and began their fame in the exact same city under the same man. When testifying in court, Alex Jones defends himself as an actor... the same as any WWE actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Bill passed away... (under very suspicious circumstances with no official burial from pancreatic cancer at (32!!!))... Alex Jones pops on the radar with his Rush Limbaugh inspired public access style show. (Actually replacing a first 'Alex Jones' of which only one  video recording exists in '97 - this 'Alex' was replaced by Hicks) Keep in mind that Bill's final standup acts vehemently critisized Rush for being people's "daddy" and ranting about people not being able to think on their own. Bill despised Rush's style and the way people echoed his every word while valuable independent social critics/comics had no platform or following. Bill was definitely not a republican style neo con. He was a 'conspiracy theorist' as one would say today who indulged in shrooms and philosophy, but he taught the ideas of Chomsky and the foundations of quantum physics in a palatable way for crowds to understand or just laugh with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch Bill's last interview, and his last stand up. He's 50 years ahead of his time. He created the world's greatest joke and he's laughing at the entire universe, while still half educating and half providing a layered satire unlike any other. The fact that you see comments all over the internet stating things like "Bill was a genius. Fuck Alex Jones he's a stupid conservative." is only a testament to how brilliant Bill is. He fooled the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's waiting for someone to call out the bullshit in a way he can't slither out of. Right now however, he's actually successfully educating the audience from a different satirical angle while peddling products that are shown to increase IQ and testosterone. He's got his own gravy train so why stop now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill/Alex is pure chaotic neutral. Although, I think his radical opinions have been greatly suppressed by the CIA. He's performed this act for so long - will he fly too close to the sun? Will Obama or the CIA make him disappear?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tune in next week for more Bill Hicks/Alex Jones antics.
