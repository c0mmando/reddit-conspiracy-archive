    <div class="md"><p>9/11. My adoptive grandfather used to fold up dollar bills and show me when I was around 5. Then in second grade when it happened, I was one of the only kids not freaking out. You should’ve seen my face when he showed me the move They Live in 3rd grade. He claimed his earliest memory is watching the news of the JFK assassination  on television, and since then he’s never trusted anyone. Ive been a firm believer that everything we’re shown is just reality tv ever since. (26).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea it was both a blessing and a curse. I’ve been a strict atheist or I guess you could say epistemological nihilist since I was tiny. So my entire time growing up, felt like I was a human walking around a big farm of sheep. I did my best to wake up everyone around me. I was so happy when futurama did the episode where Farnsworth came to the conclusion that it was pointless to try with people, and just said “I don’t want to live here anymore.” Lol. Finishing up a degree in psychology, then hope to immigrate to British Columbia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love reading in general. Read the Tibetan book of the dead, enuma elish, epic of Gilgamesh, King James Bible, satanic bible, quran, Book of Mormon. Really been wanting to read something on Norwegian myth but haven’t gotten around to it, just finished off the Invincible comic book run, and started Jordan Peterson’s new book. Used to thoroughly enjoy Ike before he became obsessed with “love” ha, still have an entire collection of Sitchin books. Been reading and watching documentaries and movies while looking for things hidden in everyday life since childhood, and been reading and listening to podcasts on far out things since adulthood. I’ll read or watch anything that can keep my interest ha. I’ve been particularly interested in chaos magic lately, but feel like reading much on it would be pointless as it’s entire thing is “willing” stuff into existence ha. Can’t wait to go to the McKenna academy after graduating. Did you have any suggestions?</p>

I’ve got a month left of summer and time to read at work so I’ll try to cram something into my reading schedule. I’m re-reading Sandman in rotation with Peterson’s new book, so I’ll probably slot it in Peterson’s spot when I finish that. Never heard of Manly Hall though, or that comes to mind. Thanks for the recommendations. After finishing my degree I’d love to research advertising and symbolism’s impact psychologically. </p>

<p>I was about 20, KPFK radio, a &quot;progressive&quot; station here in LA, used to love to <em>sell</em> conspiracy DVDs during their quarterly fundraisers. Sitting in my car, I heard excerpts from &quot;9/11 Eyewitness: Hoboken&quot; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCrLDQwNlqw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCrLDQwNlqw</a>) where a dude set up a camera across the river and his high-end mic kept picking explosions well before the collapse of the towers. Haven&#39;t been the same since...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>im currently 24 years old. Its hard for me to determine what my red pill moment was because I feel like it has been a long gradual process.  The podesta emails is what started me getting really deep but I feel like there was a long gradual road on the way there.  As a kid I think what first got me into the &quot;conspiracy&quot; realm was bigfoot.  Then came ufos and area 51 and the kennedy assassination. That was what got me started on thinking that our government doesnt tell us everything.  Then bohemian grove and skull and bones. Then I started looking into politics and reading about third parties and our founding fathers. That opened my mind to not just following the left or right which I think was critical because I would research things that werent as popular as the mainstream left or right.  That led into the denver airport which led into 9/11 which led into afghan opium production which led into corrupt corporations. But yes id say the biggest repill to swallow has been the shadow government money control and trafficking children for sex conspiracies. I hope those little children can one day be freed. Justice will be served for those responsible.  </p>

His apartment was set up with bombs and I remember the news saying it was &#39;professional&#39; grade bombs, like something you&#39;d only learn in elite military units.
He had his car set up to escape with spike strips and a med kit, but just sat in the parking lot. He had no intention of going out easy, then just sat there air surrendered once LEO arrived.
And his eyes. That&#39;s what really turned me on to conspiracies. All these mass shooters have the same look in their super wide open eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m only 18 but have never been content with what I’ve been told. My father is quite the skeptic and conspiracy theorist and often begins long rants. While he might be excessive, it nonetheless has taught me to question everything. My first red pill moment was when I was about 16 and was talking to my father about the moon landings. Regardless of anyone’s position on the legitimacy of the landing, it never hurts to see things in all perspectives. Too easily these days, the media completely controls your perceptions of events—generally entirely fabricated. It was at this time, I learned about several false flags. 9/11, mass shootings, initiation of wars, USS Liberty, etc. None of these events are painted accurately by the media, the schools, by society. I am thankful that I’ve learned to think for myself and question everything in this generation and at such a young age. Most kids these days are too distracted or lazy to explore beyond what is brainwashed into their minds. Unfortunately, conspiracy theories are so stigmatized that anyone considering any is automatically labels a lunatic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My red pill journey began in the 1980’s when I watched Roger &amp; Me by Michael Moore. Later I read Manufacturing Consent by Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn’s People’s History of United States. I saw successive Republican and Democrat Presidents and realized it didn’t matter who was in charge. The Rich always get richer. The game is rigged.</p>

<p>I watched Oliver Stone’s JFK and that ignited a lot of thought as well. Eventually the internet came and the Franklin coverup made me aware of elite pedophiles. When 9/11 happened I immediately knew it was a false flag because I’d read about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Pearl Harbour, Sinking of Lusitania and the USS Maine sinking. Oh and the Hearst papers and Yellow journalism (the Fox News of their day).</p>

<p>I never believed we’d be at the point we are now and because of that I don’t believe anything will happen. I’m highly skeptical of Trump and believe he’s just a plant of the rich and a distraction. The fact that the only bill he’s gotten through the houses is a huge tax cut for the rich sealed that deal. I am shocked that finally conservative minded people are finally onboard with this conspiracy stuff but a little disturbed too. I never thought I’d have to share this space with gun loving bible thumpers.</p>

<p>The Q stuff is fascinating to me but I’m too cynical these days to believe words alone. I need actions. And those haven’t happened yet. I wait like all of you. And my heroes are JFK and Roosevelt. Liberal heroes. I’m worried that if the purge happens the country will become ultra conservative when I actually embrace liberal democracy. The best parts of American history are when new ideas succeed in destroying old structures. Progressiveness over staying the same. I tell myself if conservatives always had their way we’d still be in caves.</p>

<p>So welcome all of you right wing newbies. Quit hating on the left. There are good ideas and patriots on both sides of the spectrum. And welcome to being red pilled. You’re super late to the game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I saw Bill Clinton playing sax on Arsenio Hall, I realized that the political paradigm had shifted. Substance no longer mattered, image was where it was at. It probably started with Kennedy, but that was a little before my time. Reagan worked the media hard too. But by Clinton&#39;s campaign, it became painfully obvious that the mainstream media was THE make-it-or-break-it variable in the DC power structure. Presidents were going to be actors rather than statesmen or politicians from here on out.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton&#39;s involvement in policy making (she was handed &#39;healthcare&#39; as an issue to tackle, biggest domestic issue in America - Mrs. Clinton, whose role as first lady was traditionally picking drapes and china, or maybe a little lifestyle-nudging campaign like &quot;just say no&quot; or &quot;be best&quot;) despite being an unelected individual was just unbelievable to me. Isn&#39;t that kind of policy-making, oh say... Congress&#39; job? </p>

<p>At some point she said something along the lines of not being a stay-at-home, cookie-baking kind of wife, and it clicked for me that she was the real power-hungry force behind the Clintons. Staying with Bill through the Monica thing indicated that the Clintons either had so much dirt on each other that they were stuck with one another or that Hillary was simply that desperate to maintain position. Seemed to me she was running for a third presidential term in &#39;08. </p>

<p>Over the course of the last decade, I&#39;ve become aware that these people in front of the camera - the Clintons and Trump alike, and most transparently Obama - are at best second-tier in the power structure. Sociopathic strivers. But they&#39;re essentially puppets. It took awhile, but my biggest ah-ha thus far is that real power goes to great lengths not to reveal itself.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 46.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always been on the fence then I spent 3 hours on duty in Afghanistan. I observed a large black mass hover over the base for a few minutes then disappear. It was only observable in IR, and had no distinguishing characteristics. Anyone else who has been there knows of the giant white blimps, this was easily three times the diameter of one of those. I had always been on the fence, but this was just fantastic. This was the perfect event to create enough personal bias for me to invest way to much personal time and energy into finding answers to things I may never know.</p>

It was jarring, and honestly, had I not experienced it, I probably wouldn&#39;t have read every single email from the Podesta leaks, which just took me further down the rabbit hole. </p>
