       “The PATRIOT Act Was Written Many, Many Years Before 9/11 [And The Attacks Simply Provided] An Opportunity for Some People To Do What They Wanted To Do”
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Ron Paul
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The Patriot Act greatly expanded powers of surveillance upon the populace under the deceptive guise of protecting us from terrorism. Where has it led?  Now we're
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       being surveilled,  not just suspected terrorists. That was the plan from the start, not just an undesired outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Department of Homeland security was supposedly spawned "in response" to the 9/11 false flag attacks and was created through the integration of all or part of 22 different federal departments and agencies into a unified, integrated Department.
      </p>
      <p>
       DHS is basically a "fusion center" which assists in the sharing of information between agencies.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fusion centers serve as focal points within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the federal government and state, local, tribal, territorial (SLTT) and private sector partners.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/topic/information-sharing">
        https://www.dhs.gov/topic/information-sharing
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       DHS is a processor of the vast amounts of information gathered by illegal surveillance,  coordinating law enforcement  and intelligence agencies so the information gathered can be utilized to it's greatest effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The National Counterterrorism Center is another information fusion center created in response to the 9/11 false flag attacks.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The precursor organization of NCTC, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC), was established on May 1, 2003,[8] by President George W. Bush by Executive Order 13354.[9] President Bush announced the creation of TTIC in his 2003 State of the Union Address. TTIC was established in response to recommendations by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission) that investigated the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency">
        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We all lost privacy and freedom due to our government's "response" to a false flag attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ready for history to repeat itself?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ... other nation-state actors have learned from the Russian playbook, singling out the Chinese who, she said, are now conducting influence operations and disinformation campaigns in Australia, Taiwan and other countries in the region. All this, she said, calls for new U.S. government measures,
        <strong>
         including the creation of a multiagency “fusion center” — modeled after the National Counterterrorism Center created after the Sept. 11 terror attacks
        </strong>
        — to collect intelligence and expose “state-sponsored efforts to undermine our democracy”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://archive.is/TbksX">
        http://archive.is/TbksX
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA-fabricated cyber "attack" blamed on Russia is being used as justification to create yet another new network of information fusion centers. This grand expansion of the surveillance state wouldn't have been viewed as acceptable if there wasn't a manufactured threat to begin with... just like the passing of the Patriot Act and the creation of DHS and the National Counterterrorism Center.

       This has been the M.O. for awhile:  commit a bit of 'light treason'. Pearl harbor, 9/11, etc..  Except now, you don't even need anything to actually happen: you (the CIA) leak it to WaPO (Bezos has $800 million dollar with CIA via Amazon) and just tell them it happened.   This USED to be illegal, as it's domestic propaganda.  But not since the 2014 NDAA.

       This guy pretty much predicted the state of the government-press/media relationship over the last 3 years.  Also, he correctly identifies the real danger: anonymous dissemination.  The WaPo article about Russian's hacking the Vermont power grid is EXACTLY what he warned about.

       They have been on the side of the terrorists all along. It is not a War on Terror. It is a war on We The People by the global elite. A war in which they use terrorists to conduct false flags, regime changes and take away our rights while they cement their control over all of us.

       Why does the distinction matter? Russia has stated its goals are to destroy America, it's even in the Foundation of Geopolitics. Which oddly enough, Trump is helping them achieve the steps laid out in that book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once Trump incites his supporters into civil uprising due to his presidency being threatened from the Mueller investigation, shit will hit the fan, the power grid will go out, the internet will go down, and all these immigrants that we put in camps will riot and there will mass violence in the streets. Fun times.

       I was under the assumption that you thought all the bad actors of the world were working under the same evil force. My mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Russia being our enemy and trying to destroy us through covert means is not from MSM fear mongering. It's literally what they've been doing for over a century.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In
        <em>
         Foundations of Geopolitics
        </em>
        , Dugin calls for the influence of the United States and Atlanticism to lose its influence in Eurasia and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.
       </p>
       <p>
        The book declares that "the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] Russians" has not ended and Russia remains "the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution". The Eurasian Empire will be constructed "on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us."
       </p>
       <p>
        Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook believes in a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia's gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The book states that "the maximum task [of the future] is the 'Finlandization' of all of Europe".
       </p>
       <p>
        In Europe:
       </p>
       <p>
        Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term "Moscow–Berlin axis"
       </p>
       <p>
        France should be encouraged to form a "Franco–German bloc" with Germany. Both countries have a "firm anti-Atlanticist tradition".
       </p>
       <p>
        The United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be "donated to Murmansk Oblast"
       </p>
       <p>
        Estonia should be given to Germany's sphere of influence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Latvia and Lithuania should be given a "special status" in the Eurasian-Russian sphere.
       </p>
       <p>
        Poland should be granted a "special status" in the Eurasian sphere.
       </p>
       <p>
        Romania, Macedonia, "Serbian Bosnia" and Greece – "Orthodox collectivist East" – will unite with "Moscow the Third Rome" and reject the "rational-individualistic West".
       </p>
       <p>
        Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because "Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Middle East and Central Asia:
       </p>
       <p>
        The book stresses the "continental Russian–Islamic alliance" which lies "at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy". The alliance is based on the "traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization".
       </p>
       <p>
        Iran is a key ally. The book uses the term "Moscow–Tehran axis".
       </p>
       <p>
        Armenia has a special role: It will serve as a "strategic base," and it is necessary to create "the [subsidiary] axis Moscow-Erevan-Teheran". Armenians "are an Aryan people ... [like] the Iranians and the Kurds".
       </p>
       <p>
        Azerbaijan could be "split up" or given to Iran.
       </p>
       <p>
        Georgia should be dismembered. Abkhazia and "United Ossetia" (which includes Georgia's South Ossetia) will be incorporated into Russia. Georgia's independent policies are unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russia needs to create "geopolitical shocks" within Turkey. These can be achieved by employing Kurds, Armenians and other minorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The book regards the Caucasus as a Russian territory, including "the eastern and northern shores of the Caspian (the territories of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan)" and Central Asia (mentioning Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan).
       </p>
       <p>
        In Asia:
       </p>
       <p>
        China, which represents a danger to Russia, "must, to the maximum degree possible, be dismantled". Dugin suggests that Russia start by taking Tibet–Xinjiang–Mongolia–Manchuria as a security belt. Russia should offer China help "in a southern direction – Indochina (except Vietnam), the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia" as geopolitical compensation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russia should manipulate Japanese politics by offering the Kuril Islands to Japan and provoking anti-Americanism.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mongolia should be absorbed into Eurasia-Russia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: "the main 'scapegoat' will be precisely the U.S."
       </p>
       <p>
        In the United States:
       </p>
       <p>
        Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Eurasian Project could be expanded to South and Central America.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Funny how Trump has somehow helped them with these goals, especially the one in America. He supported Brexit and he has completely ruined our relationship with Europe, while spreading anti-Americanism all around the world. Now he's even saying things about Germany that aren't even true. What are his motivations for attacking Germany?

       Umm.. I already explained my mistake in that regard. So that perspective is null and void. You're absolutely right, it doesn't justify that. I wasn't trying to, I made a dumb assumption about your beliefs based on my own line of thinking without even realizing it. I realized the error and explained it. What else would you like me to do?

       I may have made another incorrect assumption about your beliefs again in regards to Russia and Trump, if so, I apologize. No need for the hostility man.

       DynCorp (Computer Sciences Corp - now DXC technologies after a merger with HP) is a company contracted to run the fusion centers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, THAT DynCorp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: Stephen Feinberg (Cerberus Capital) owns dyncorp and is Trump's man appointed to "stop leaks" in the alphabet agencies.

       There has certainly been a campaign going on to smear Russia for awhile, which fits the agenda of a certain group to use for false flags. I am aware of this and call it out constantly. I have a few Russian friends. I realize the country isn't perfect. At the same time it's obvious when the US gov is trolling Russia as a means to an end.
     Despite that, reading the language in this new legislation, I most definitely think that this refers to China. The US most definitely needs good and better defense against China. In 2011 they sent up a missile in LA. Recently, in Wa, a missile was sent up that is pretty much being covered up as to what was going on. Before that a missile came into Hawaii, was shot down, and that story was covered up. The Canadian government has suborned themselves to Chinese military-this is a very serious detail. Chinese triads have been murdering Native people in Canada, sometimes ENTIRE families. There have been thefts of patents and classified material as well as cybercrimes. A huge number of Chinese nationals have left   China. China has been murdering and torturing Tibetan people since the 40's. If I see a Chinese person walking down the street, I don't fear. I understand that they left a beautiful country such as China, most likely under duress. If  I saw a Chinese soldier on the other hand, I would be on high ALERT. If I were a Canadian, I would feel stressed at any such sighting. Just my 2 cents

       Funding terrorists to terrorize the terrorists originally hired to terrorize the predecessors of said terrorists. A flow chart of the various terror cells' alliances\enemies would resemble an incestual Royal family tree.
