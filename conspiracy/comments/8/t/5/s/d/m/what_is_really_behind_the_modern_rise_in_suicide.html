        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Did you really want to die? No one commits suicide because they want to die. Then why do they do it? Because they want to stop the pain.” - Tiffanie DeBartolo
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/health/us-suicide-rate-surges-to-a-30-year-high.html">
        Suicide rates are at an all time high
       </a>
       , as you may have heard. I kind of laughed (sadly) when I saw people urgently posting the suicide hotline in Reddit comments, patting themselves on the back, and then moving on with their lives. Why?
       <em>
        Because that is the problem.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Our society has become so vapid that many cannot even begin to dive into the real reasons behind this rise in suicide, especially in teens. There is nothing wrong with posting the suicide hotline, of course, but the problem is the superficiality behind people “caring” about others.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what’s the conspiracy? Well, it was not always like this, and while the reasons for this rise in suicide rates are multi-faceted, I believe technology is directly associated in nearly every instance. The conspiracy is that people have become so self-absorbed by this said technology that many do not even have the capacity to reflect anymore. In this post, I will discuss the real reasons behind suicide in America, and why it will likely only get worse (though there is always hope, I think). Going back to the quote above, what is causing people pain in our society?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Breakdown of Community
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ““One can acquire everything in solitude except character.” ― Stendhal, Five Short Novels of Stendhal: The Duchess of Palliano, Vittoria Accoramboni, The Abbess of Castro, Vanina Vanini and The Cenci”
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1897, sociologist Emilie Durkheim came to the [conclusion](durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/suicide.html) that most suicide cases were due to isolation – he noticed a pattern of higher suicide rates in states with higher levels of isolation. Again, reasons for suicide are multi-faceted and the results are more complex than I can state here, but most people can get through really tough problems in their lives when they have a sense of community.
      </p>
      <p>
       What community do people have today? Perhaps this may sound a little dramatic, but do people talk to their neighbors anymore? Do people go outside anymore? There is no doubt Americans are certainly becoming more [socially isolated](theconversation.com/americans-are-becoming-more-socially-isolated-but-theyre-not feeling-lonelier-96151), though this article claims they do not feel any lonelier. I disagree with this claim, and if Americans are feeling less lonely, though more isolated, it is no doubt due to the fact that technology creates the illusion of community.
      </p>
      <p>
       More and more, our communities are online. The problem with this is that these online communities, whether they be Reddit, gaming communities, or other social media, can not replace the human need for real life people to people interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you feel that you hate spending time with people, the question is, have you been programmed to believe other people are something to hate? Why is misanthropy promoted so deeply in our society?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, technology is simply [destroying the quality of human interaction](
       <a href="https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2012/01/technology-is-destroying-the-quality-of-human-interaction">
        https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2012/01/technology-is-destroying-the-quality-of-human-interaction
       </a>
       ), so while social interaction exists, could anyone say it is truly quality? We are spreading ourselves too thin, according to the article, and while we may feel we have more social interaction, what value does it have if it is superficial?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, there is a breakdown of
       <a href="https://thebottomline.as.ucsb.edu/2012/01/technology-is-destroying-the-quality-of-human-interaction">
        family
       </a>
       ,[marriage](journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174129), and whatever your opinions about religion, a breakdown of [church communities](
       <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/u-s-public-becoming-less-religious/">
        www.pewforum.org/2015/11/03/u-s-public-becoming-less-religious/
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, online social interaction cannot thoroughly replace real life communities. Even with technology interaction, we are technically still in solitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A Superficial Society
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       ““Hastiness and superficiality are the psychic diseases of the twentieth century.” ― Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it is cliché, or even superficial to say that this society is superficial, but I really would like to discuss this topic in depth. : )
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember seeing a meme a few weeks ago about how a girlfriend did not want her boyfriend watching youtube video analyses on movies because it was “too deep.” Really?
Thinking deeply seems to be an art of the past, and I believe that contributes to even more isolation for certain individuals. It is likely that a more deep-thinking individual will see the reality of the world for what it is, and that may lead to sadness and depression. But if that person has no outlet for these thoughts, other than vapid social media, then is it any surprise so many suffer?
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, there is literally a crisis in
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-intuitive-parent/201703/the-emerging-crisis-in-critical-thinking">
        critical thinking
       </a>
       , and while I may not agree with all the reasons stated in that article, there definitely is a problem.
By the way, I am not talking about “education” here, as education has many definitions. The educated in society are not always the most intelligent or deep in thought. Rather, I am talking about the loss of the ability to think deeply, to reflect, to analyze, and to evaluate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could, technology to be to blame for this?
In real life, you will find real people who disagree with you, but people do not talk to each other as much anymore. Online, you find
       <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/04/12/522760479/tech-creates-our-political-echo-chambers-it-might-also-be-a-solution">
        echo chambers
       </a>
       . Reddit, unfortunately, is a perfect example of this.
Today, there are so many rules on major subreddits, and all of the rules basically translate as, “You must agree with this opinions of this sub or be banned.” Whatever subreddit you find yourself on, you have to ensure you agree with the majority or face being banned (isolated). I remember when I could freely voice my opinion about abortion without getting death threats on
       <a href="/r/twoxchromosomes">
        /r/twoxchromosomes
       </a>
       , but that was many years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other problem with these echo chambers is that they can be created everywhere online. Now, on social media, you can choose an audience that agrees with you on everything and loves you no matter what terrible choices you make in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, free speech is attacked daily. So many lose their jobs for voicing seemingly harmless opinions. Today, speaking freely about politics can
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/your-money/speaking-about-politics-can-cost-you-your-job.html">
        cost you your job
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure many of you on this conspiracy forum know that we must keep quiet about “real” topics in real life, for fear of being ostracized, persecuted, or sadly, even losing jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, of course, I am not saying that a person should not be professional, but still, it is uncanny how one controversial opinion can ruin your life (and it may not even be that controversial!)
      </p>
      <p>
       The point here is that technology has created the illusion of free expression, but really, all it has done is eliminated anonymity and increased paranoia. People, again, feel isolated when they cannot express their true selves or beliefs.
       <strong>
        Filter Bubble
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “More and more, your computer monitor is a kind of one-way mirror, reflecting your own interests while algorithmic observers watch what you click.” ― Eli Pariser, The Filter Bubble
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only do we have to filter our speech now, but we have to filter our lives in general. If you ever get a chance, hang out with some teenagers for the day, especially girls, and let them tell you how ugly and disgusting they are, because I am being serious, that is all they are going to talk about. They will take endless selfies through multiple filters to try to feel beautiful, as they compare themselves to a endless amount of internet models. Now, we all know beauty standards have harmed women extensively, but this has gotten to a new level. Today, people seriously cannot compete with the pictures online because now everybody has the ability to “photoshop.” [Filters are literally distorting self-image](college.usatoday.com/2016/08/18/fight-the-filter-snapchat-selfies-distort-users-self-image/.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, it is almost as if nothing is real. Social media allows to filter out the bad in our lives, and on top of that, it even allows us to filter information. There is actually a word for this:
       <strong>
        a filter bubble.
       </strong>
       According to Wikipedia,
      </p>
      <p>
       “A filter bubble is a state of intellectual isolation[1]that can result from personalized searches when awebsite algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior and search history.[2][3][4] As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles.[5]”
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what does this have to do with suicide? Well, these filters are just another element of isolation. It is dangerous to become isolated in our own paradigms, especially when we view anybody who disagrees with us as enemies ALL OF THE TIME. Look, online, there are shills, trolls, and creeps, and I am not dismissing that. But, technology has created a world where people fear disagreement because that means lack of social approval, and therefore, social isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
       These social relationships we have are “built on sand” in a sense that they are based on validation and agreeability, not true relationships. A true friend will tell you when they disagree with you without repercussion. Online, a person who disagrees can be blocked, ignored, deleted, etc.
We are building a society of people who fear criticism.
      </p>

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when people do get that little chance to relax, what do they do? For many, the internet and Netflix have become new favorite past times. What is so wrong with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, again, this contributes to social isolation. People are so worn out, so exhausted that their only free time becomes mindless, which again, eliminates “deep thinking and reflection activity.” What are people going to do? Read Durkheim’s study on suicide, or watch funny cat videos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Life becomes a cycle of work, sleep, and  mindlessness. While there is nothing wrong with watching a movie or browsing the internet, there is something wrong when that becomes all people do
       <em>
        ever.
       </em>
       By the way, I have definitely been guilty of this, which is why I have taken on hobbies that get me out of the house. Unfortunately, though, it is easier for many to just live through others online.

        Lack of the Divine
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Moral nihilism comes with a price we can now see.” Torbjorn Tannsjo
 
Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, I believe our modern, nihilistic society directly contributes to suicide. Yes,
       <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-is-nihilism-on-the-rise_us_5849ab9be4b0afda6e983ef8">
        nihilism is on the rise
       </a>
       , and there are many contributions to this increased perception that "nothing really matters."
      </p>
      <p>
       While many here are atheists and criticize a belief in God, I would argue that if people do not worship God, they simple worship other things: money, sex, work, material objects, etc.
Still, I am sure many will disagree with me on that point, but whatever you believe, the point is that our narcissism leads to this nihilistic worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       We become Gods because we worship ourselves, and technology makes that possible. A rise in narcissism is directly contributed to
       <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/narcissism-the-science-behind-the-rise-of-a-modern-epidemic-a6925606.html">

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The article states, “Maybe it’s time to take a break from that smartphone, shut off your
      </p>
      <p>
       computer and meet up with a friend or two.”
People need to value things outside of themselves, and though I  am a strong believer in God, but even if you are not, we need more than our own self-absorption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, connecting with anyone on a deeper, more authentic level, to me, at least is a spiritual experience, yet that is so difficult to do. I mean, it seems even leaving the house today and getting some sunshine might count as something spiritual for most people, and I am not saying this mockingly.

        Two Minute Hate
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic." (1984)
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1984, “Two Minutes Hate” is “The Two Minutes Hate, from George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, is a daily period in which Party members of the society of Oceania must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies (notably Emmanuel Goldstein and his followers) and express their hatred for them for exactly two minutes.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, people have lost passion for anything except what they are told to care about. Take a look at the immigrant/separation crisis that nobody cared about before except for the two minutes this week, and that will be replaced by the two minutes next week.
      </p>
      <p>
       We lack connection, cohesion, and critical thinking. No issue in society is really ever solved. Instead, it blows up, people blow off some steam, and they move on with their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take this suicide crisis. It was a big deal for a few days on Reddit, and then everybody goes back to their ordinary worlds. I do not blame people, but the problem is that people do not recognize this as a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody becomes invested in anything anymore. The two minute hate spiel is meant to desensitize people to the real world, and it works. Desensitization is a coping mechanism, and I believe our society is in a state of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization">
        systematic desensitization
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not that people do not “care”, I do not think, but rather, there is too much to care about and think about, so it is probably easier to be distracted and mindless.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, going back to the hook of this post, it is easier for a person to post a suicide hotline in a Reddit comment, get some Reddit gold, and feel good about themselves, then actually do anything real. That is why “clicktivism” is so popular. It creates the illusion that we are doing something good for the world, when in reality, the online clicks are mostly inconsequential (especially with the shills, and paid posts, and such).

       “No work is insignificant. All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity”
Martin Luther King, Jr.
 
It used to be kind of a joke, reserved for a minority of society, but today, more and more people have no choice but to live with
       <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/05/its-becoming-more-common-for-young-adults-to-live-at-home-and-for-longer-stretches/">
        their parents for extended periods of time
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only is this devastating for many, especially those drowning in debt from degrees, but it isolates people. People surely have difficult marrying and forming relationships when they still live with their parents. It is normal and natural to leave home, and our society has made that more difficult than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not mock or criticize anyone. Rather, it is to look at a real problem that is largely avoided.

       <strong>
        True Empathy
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        “You cannot do a kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it will be too late.” ― Ralph Waldo Emerson”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       At the beginning of this post, I noted my frustration with the superficial sentiment and commentary behind today’s growing suicide rates. What can be done?
      </p>
      <p>
       When all else lacks in society, it never fails me when I am kind, and being truly kind means valuing another human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, there is a sort of superficial kindness in our society, where people do things for likes, attention, and social status. But true kindness needs none of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this Berkeley study,
       <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/kindness_makes_you_happy_and_happiness_makes_you_kind">
        Kindness makes you happy, and happiness makes you kind
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this may seem like a vapid solution to those reading this post, but I believe it is the place to start. If we begin every thought we have with kindness, I believe our individual worlds change, which may change other individual worlds.
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern technology creates an isolated individual which has directly contributed to a rise in suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       I challenge anyone reading this post today to break your technology routine even if just temporarily. Go for a walk and leave your phone. Invite some friends to go do something and turn off your phone. Do something kind without need for social validation on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if we truly want to help others and prevent suicides, we need to reach out to others directly. When I have gone through hard times, people reaching out to me was all I needed to get through it. If you do see the same person posting the same depressing lyrics every day on facebook, send them a message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human life is valuable, even if "they" do not want you to believe that.

       You are correct, loneliness is the cause of suicide. The darkness can consume the soul, leaving the illusion of no purpose.
      </p>

       Everything has a purpose, do not give up. Tribulation can be outmatched by your persistence.

       Interesting points &amp; good write up, but no mention how everyone is all pilled up these days?  IMO big pharma is largely to blame.  Most drugs or a mixture of them cause suicidal tendencies.  Chantix &amp; Anthony Bourdain is one recent example.

       Another very important factor I didn't see mentioned is our disconnection from the natural world and all the life in it. We are an intrinsic part of that web of life, it replenishes our energy and lifeforce.
      </p>
      <p>
       In modern society we are taught that nature is gross and dangerous.. when the truth is that it IS us and being separated from it feeds our feelings of isolation and depression. So many people are completely disconnected from our Earth and will never know that so many answers are right out there waiting for us.

       Well put together. Im a millenial(born in 1990) and i think our generation is messed up, and who knows whats gonna happen to the kids graduating now. I think technology is growing faster than we can handle it.
I swear i meet more and more people who just wanna live on a farm, provide for themselves and be in a small tight knit community where we feel valued and have a role. Thats what i want. I feel like nobody interacts anymore and everyone is either depressed or has anxiety. Nobodys where they wanna be in life. I think something about our american culture is making us zombies. Fear based consumerism. 
Why am i always so anxious and depressed. I make over $50 an hour and cant even afford  to live in san diego. 
The system has gotten bad

       Not just America guys I live in the UK and everything you say is exactly how I feel here. The fact that nothing really matters is coming to the surface more and more. The simulation theory is a prime example, if it’s possible everything’s not real why put up with the pain of it all ?  But at the end of the day we’ve got what we’ve got and we have to make the best of it. Sorry if I’m rambling at little it’s nearly 4am and I’ve been at work for 15 hours.

       Yeah np as I said earlier it may not read too well as I’ve been at work for nearly 16 hours now but I’ll give it my best shot. When I was 21 I was due to join the Royal Air Force but I had an accident which meant this wouldn’t be possible I couldn’t walk for two years and I had been prescribed opiates that whole time. Now the pain continued so anyway five years after the accident my life hadn’t really gone anywhere yeah I was working etc but wasn’t happy. So while still taking lots of codeine me and my partner had three miscarriages now this is the point where my life changed our relationship ended   And unknown to me at this point I was depressed. So once I finally realised this feeling of hopelessness was getting worse it was at this point I met my current partner but this coincided with the start of my self harming. I’ve got a little ahead of myself here but I was already taking AD at this time after visiting my gp. So at this point my depression was spiralling I was mixing cannabis codeine and mirtazapine (ad) well of course the Ad’s weren’t working so I tried several other AD’s didn’t like any of them some made me fat some made my depression even worse but there was one I was taking for four days and it literally almost killed me i couldn’t even open my eyes so I went back to my initial AD (mirtazapine) and have stuck with it since, I’m now fully functional again no longer taking codeine (unless I really have to) but unfortunately still taking AD. So this brings me to the next phase of depression I’m now feeling much better 80% of the time but still have my bad days so I’m no longer a slave to the depression but I am a slave to the medication as I really don’t want to risk coming off them and going back to what I was. The fact I still have bad days makes me so frightened to come off them that I think I’ll be taking them forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah to sum up AD’s have balanced me out but I feel once you have depression you have it for life I now feel like it’s part of who I am as a person.

       Do you exercise regularly? If no, force yourself to do 10 push-ups a day. Even the smallest effort goes a long way. Drink a shit load of water too, basic shit like hydration is a solid foundation that is vastly overlooked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you get past some basic hurdles like hydration and exercise, you might be surprised what you’re ready to take on.

       You are right on the trail!  Well summed up.  I also think that people are just realizing in mass that things are pretty fucked up, everywhere.  Between the sensationalist media constantly bringing up the worst of the human condition, but the stark reality that is; the great pacific plastic patch, animals and insects dying off at a scary pace, recession of glacial ice, pollution, corruption, all that you and OP mentioned, it just gets overwhelming, and if you are in a place in your life where it’s hard to see the bright side, you could be in trouble.

       I'm honestly at the point where I want to tune everything and everyone out except that which effects me personally. Everything else? I could give two shits about anymore. The world could explode tomorrow and I'd hardly care frankly...I'd almost welcome it with how hellish everything is. Not as if anything is gonna change anyway and most of that is out there is bullshit in one way or another anyway.

       Thanks for you words of kindness. I actually did move. I lived in Wichita, KS for 2 years. It was livable, problem was, it didn't vibe with me. It caused a huge hole in me and I was severely depressed the entire time I was there. So I moved back here with family. Unfortunately due to personal circumstances, I had to move out on my own. So yeah, I'm just a lazy millennial who didn't try at all.

       How much is your rent? I was paying 675 a month for a place in Clairemont Mesa. I do agree though on your points that social media has become toxic to the point of people wanting to do things so they can present them to their friends on Facebook/Instagram/Snapchat instead of doing it for their own sake.

       I saved this post. This was truly an exceptional enlightening post that really hit home.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been personally trying to simplify my life through less material items, more meditation, less work, stopping social media, eating a simplified meal plan that's healthy etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is I read about it intellectually understand it but now have to force myself to practice daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mantra is to make one upgrade even if it's tiny per day. Just get momentum in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently listened to an interview with Rivers Cuomo from Weezer. He talked about mediation 2 hours per day every single day. This basically turned his entire life around and allowed him to continue with his songwriting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I continue to move away from western consumerism and perpetual growth and more towards eastern philosophy. Alan Watts helped change my perspective quite a bit in the last decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       American culture is so overwhelming to me. It's difficult to even have real conversations with friends and family. Most are so absolutely brainwashed left or right and totally emotionally if not religiously invested in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zen, simple living, truth, mediation, health, empathy, and consciousness are my direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know why but this post made me ramble a bit.

       I feel you on a lot of things that you just said, but if you’re making $50 an hour then San Diego shouldn’t be that expensive to live in. I moved from ATL to SD about six years ago and was living pay check to pay check on my weak ass 17.50 an hour job but I still got by. I make way more now and have a job I’m actually passionate about, and living here is expensive but not impossible by any means. You’re making around $2000 a week pre-tax. You could live in a lot of dope spots and still be able to save a good bit of money if you’re making that much in this city.

       I think TPTB have shot themselves in the foot regarding the increase of people wanting farms. They want you to rely on them to provide you with everything but in their greed they have forced people the other way.
      </p>
      <p>
       People do not take enough enjoyment out of life anymore because there isnt much to enjoy. Its hard to think about personal goals when youre glued to your phone looking at some random persons holiday pictures on instagram etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I stopped using my phone for social media. I use it to read, I do not enjoy my daily dose of propaganda anymore and things are looking up for me. England has become a cesspit and im happy that im not going to be there for 6 months. People need to travel the world, speak to random people and learn that we are all worthless. The only thing about us that isnt worthless is how we choose to spend our time. Sorry for the essay, just my two cents

       Born 1993, and I share your sentiment. But here's the positive side, think of socializing as a need to be filled.  If enough people just want to get away from it all for however long and you provide them with that means, they'll do it even if they're total strangers.  That's why the meetup app is so popular. And there's a website (no app) called roomies that helps you find someone looking to split the rent.  Whenever you talk to someone who feels the way you just described, network with them and tell them to network, too.  Get enough people together, and it will turn into a movement naturally.

       I think a lot of our issues have to do with removing ourselves from nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever walk in a yard or park barefoot? Its one lf the best feelings in the world. Feeling the earth and grass in your tows. Most of my best times in life have come out of being out in nature camping. Even my daughter was conceived in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being inside all day and being around nothing but concrete hurts humans deep in their DNA. I try to go walk at least an hour a day (beyond my hour a day I actually workout at the gym) and its done a hell of a lot of good for my anxiety from ptsd from war even. Just changing little things like our time outside absorbing the sun goes a hell of a long way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone in my family thats had depression issues has been because of a vitamin deficiency caused by not being out in the sun.

       My brother did just that (I'm in Australia). Moved out onto a farm in a rural area and grows plants for the local community to put food on the table. Basically no technology, spends most of his days gardening and with his cats and in the town working on community projects. He was so close to suicide before its not funny. Now he's pretty content.

       As others have said, fantastic write up!
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you wholeheartedly, and would like to add on a bit of my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely the rise of technology is one of, if not the biggest, factors in the social isolation people, especially youth and teens, are feeling today. The biggest cause of suicide is loneliness, second to chronic pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from technology, I believe the rise in diagnosis of mental illnesses that "need" to be treated with pharmaceutical medication (Depression, General Anxiety, ADHD, etc.) are absolutely affecting the mental state of millions of people in the US and Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pharmaceutical companies have completely taken over, and we are just now as a population slowly waking up to this fact. Holistic Medicine (Treating the whole body, rather than a partucular symptom) has been painted as a bunch of hippie bullshit, its not a coincidence. (
       <strong>
        I urge you to look up the story of the real Patch Adams.
       </strong>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway my point is, yes technology is driving people to suicide, but the powers that be (The Pharmaceutical Industry, Advertisers, a Government that is trying to keep its population complacent and segregated etc.) are certainly lubricating the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I'm currently going to school for Education Assistant, Community Mental Health Worker, and Personal Support Worker, and so have been studying hard on this subject for a while now, in Canada, for credibility's sake.)

       Thanks for this insightful comment. Sadly, therapy is demonized in our society when it comes to getting help too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fail to believe that all people experiencing depression are just experiencing chemical imbalances, as seems to be the perpetuated myth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are true external factors making everyone feel like shit.

       I don't think therapy is demonized, but I do feel that finding the right therapist is crucial! Not all therapists are good at their job. Also, sometimes you don't "click" with one therapist, but if you try another one you might find a better fit. So some people don't realize this and will give up on therapy if they have had a bad experience.

       I lost my two best friends to suicide and would like to throw my two cents in here, in addition to all OP has provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stigma around Mental Health: People are embarrassed and ashamed to admit they have problems, particularly mental health issues, which are often characterized as "not real problems." Sometimes great people slip through the cracks cause they can't come to terms with needing help. The onus is not simply on the ill though, we need to speak up when our friends and family are obviously in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender expectations: By 30, men are supposed to be in the midst of profitable careers and women are supposed to be at least one birth in-- fail these and our culture will decide you are already a failure. This is bullshit, of course, but the pressures and expectations are built into the system. Gender expectations also factor into how one is "supposed to" process and express emotion, when in reality we should hold no expectations regardless of gender.

       People that can afford a therapist are much more prone to brag about it than someone who is dealing with crippling mental illness due to socio-economic, or environmental, or poverty reasons

       My controversial answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Women prone to anxiety issues. Women are taking on roles now that men traditionally took on in the past. Women do not cope with these roles well, so there is an increase in severe stress which contributes to anxiety and depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I am not against women working. I am against a society that requires two incomes for a family to barely survive, when in the past one income was enough. It is almost as women have been tricked.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Whether people want to hear it or not, biologically women are natural caregivers. Without family or children, are they losing purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       Source: woman and I can actually quote other sources if people want.

       Why do we
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to fulfill a biological purpose though? Yeah life kind of sucks but passing the buck to a younger person isn't going to change that. I guarantee you people in ancient civilizations and hunter gatherer societies were just as listless, inhumane, nihilistic and antisocial as we are now, probably more so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not modernity that's the problem, existence has always sucked, human nature has always been violent and wretched and we have always needed religion to lie and peer pressure and rationalize our way around painful truths. Existence has never needed us, we our not divine, and most of our lives are destined to suck, if not be entirely upended by human bigotry and sadism. We're just beasts on a rotting planet slowly drowning in our own waste.

       They were full of rape and village raids, entire cities razed to the ground in days of terror, farmers butchered by armed men on horseback and their daughters gang raped to death, dirt poor people sleeping next to open sewer and droughts and famines where people watched themselves and their infants starve.

       What if religion was responsible for those dark ages, and the dark spots in our knowledge and understanding to this day? Since when is it in any way helpful to believe in lies about things we don't understand? We should always have been asking questions, not making up and enforcing ignorant answers. Religious dogma has held us back intellectually for thousands of years.

       Rome Fell. That's what started the Dark Ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       The established order was shattered, it was a mini Apocalypse, Millions died from reduced trade and mass starvation as well as wars springing up everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recovery FROM the dark ages was accelerated by the Clergy, the Irish Clergy specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       They preserved as much knowledge from the Post-Roman Era as was possible. This helped mankind relearn mysteries lost to us and accelerated our recovery by immeasurable years.
      </p>
      <p>
       People, struggling to learn the mysteries of the heavens (Literally Religion) has driven science since before the mastery of Fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion is nothing more than people trying to explain reality, the physical world, and the metaphysical world around them. With varied success.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a tool, like science, what people do with it is on them. Do you blame science for the Atrocities of Nazi scientists? For the Bomb? For Bioweapons? Of course not. You blame the individuals who bastardized it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm killing in the name of god" Nice justification to enable a person's lust for more, with the added plus of getting the people happily murdering each other. Same mechanisms (Our cause is just, our enemy is subhuman for resisting our cause) are used today in a largely secular world.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are sometimes too quick to throw out the baby with the bathwater. Don't get me wrong, I think religion currently is all about the money/abuse of power, and has done some serious bad, but let's not be completely backwards about it. It has done a magnitude more good than bad.

       I don't agree with your dismissal of posting a suicide hotline and patting yourself on the back. The purpose is to get the person in contact with a (semi) trained professional locally who's job it is to work people through issues and suggest solutions. I'm not going to say it's a cure obviously, but for some random on the other side of the world to someone, what else are you supposed to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       If your answer is "get involved, get mad, overthrow the government" well sure, that's fine. But so is referring someone to a local resource to help them NOW.

       Having multiple sexual partners over a relatively short period of time (less than a decade lets say) certainly may contribute to desensitization over time--i.e. it certainly can´t be making people more Romantic.

       I lost my two best friends to suicide and would like to throw my two cents in here, in addition to all OP has provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stigma around Mental Health: People are embarrassed and ashamed to admit they have problems, particularly mental health issues, which are often characterized as "not real problems." Sometimes great people slip through the cracks cause they can't come to terms with needing help. The onus is not simply on the ill though, we need to speak up when our friends and family are obviously in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender expectations: By 30, men are supposed to be in the midst of profitable careers and women are supposed to be at least one birth in-- fail these and our culture will decide you are already a failure. This is bullshit, of course, but the pressures and expectations are built into the system. Gender expectations also factor into how one is "supposed to" process and express emotion, when in reality we should hold no expectations regardless of gender.

       It's been my opinion that people are not connecting. Connecting with others, with nature, with the world around them. They just exist and go through the motions day in and day out. Few gain joy doing what they do and many are living on the edge and not in a good way. The constant stress takes it's toll both mentally and physically. That's why so many people are getting hooked on hard drugs. They are not looking to die, they just hate the emptiness of their lives and that is their escape sadly.

       Great post. Thank you very much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I liken societies behavior to that of a traumatised person. For the sake of the argument let's use BPD because that is what I have, what I know about and the resulting issues are very similar to that of a mind control victim. I see BPD as a type of complex trauma / PTSD formed during childhood that compounds as you get older.
      </p>
      <p>
       I notice many similarities between this condition and our society as a whole and I believe this is why we are purposefully traumatised from a young age. Why TV is so sexual and violent, the music industry sexualises young children and pushes violence, marketing distorting our self image and esteem, the school system is so traumatic and soul crushing. The debt slavery later on in life. Pretty much the whole way our society is set up to constantly re-traumatise us. No wonder people are having midlife crises, they have been abused by the system and the results of it their whole lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       So back to BPD. Take the concept of Splitting for example. People or things are seen as either black or white, good or bad. Friend or enemy. We see this every day in the media and news. On the front page of reddit. A new person to hate or like. Your 2 Minutes of Hate reference was spot on and it's what makes the left right boot mechanism the well oiled machine that it is. People can't help but get caught up in it because they have been programmed to Split.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another aspect of BPD is suicide ideation. And we see this in memes on the front page of reddit a lot. Why is it so relatable to so many people now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Insecurity is another big one with BPD. Self esteem so low that we are constantly craving acceptance and validation. If we don't get it we can quickly begin to feel isolated and empty. Well, we all know why people upload their whole lives to social media like facebook and instagram etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anger can be an issue with BPD. I certainly feel like people seem a lot angrier than they used to. Look at all the vitriol we come across on a daily basis online. Faggot this and Cuck that. Why are people so angry at each other? Even when I go out I notice people seem sullen. Far less people smile or make jokes or attempt conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a great post yesterday or the day before about male circumsizion and studies showing it affected the infants psychologically. Not surprising to most of us I'm sure, but it made perfect sense as a way to initially traumatise a person. It is exactly what they practise with MKUltra. Traumatise them as babies and throughout their life re-traumatise over and over again. Their minds will be totally malleable.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems to me we have a whole society of traumatised mind control victims exhibiting symptoms of childhood trauma and abuse. No wonder suicide is on the rise, it's programmed into us, just as MKUltra whistleblowers have stated they were programmed with self destruct triggers.

       I also like to think we are all in a constant state of trauma - we are all actually mk ultra abuse victims, and our personalities have been fragmented or broken by technology so that we all feel empty and rarely whole.

       I really do believe this is the case, too. Once it clicked I couldn't help but see it everywhere.

       One of the more interesting things to do is notice the change in personality when someone gets their phone out to take a group selfie. It's like a switch is flicked and all of a sudden everyone is an MKUltra Sex Kitten. It's creepy.

       I'm a clinical psychologist and I must say, if you have no background in psychology other than your own experience with mental health, this post is extremely impressive and insightful. Psychodynamic theorists of the modern age are heavily invested in the idea that the personality behavior of leaders and government becomes mirrored in the behaviors of the population. You are right on.

       No background other than being messed up and interested in why it was so. Also, thank you for the kind words.

      <p>
       I can see what you're saying, it makes sense. I kind of see it as if human behaviors act like fractals, or at least that is the image that pops into my minds eye when I think about it. You see it all the time in cliques of children. They mirror the most popular, ruthless bully, and that bully is mirroring his older brother or aggressive father and so it goes back into the violent mists of time. It seems like typical hardwired to fear being outcast from the safety of the group behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that is why our modern leaders, with the help of the media, attempt to put up the facade of being decent human beings? To appear as business men rather than warlords, because if they were outright tyrants killing babies in the streets the population would reflect that and be more likely to carry out violent unrest against the leaders? Easier to control beaurocraticlly minded corporate sociopaths rather than physically violent street thugs?

       There are two theories that help me understand this behavior:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Systems Theory. This states that all levels from the microsystems to the mesosystem to the macrosystem follow the same rules. All systems seek equilibrium that is in sync with the demands of the leader. We see this in ant behavior that follows the demand of the queen. We see this in families with the patriarch or matriarch. We see this in the workplace with syncing to the personality of the boss. And we see this on a national level as well.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Drive Theory. Neo-Freudians argue that the brain works on drives and defenses. Drives (instincts to feed, flee, or fuck) arise and the frontal lobe, our consciousness, regulates this via use of Defenses. We have developed Defenses on a national scale. This is why "Red pills" are so difficult to swallow, because it cuts through our defenses. The people in charge who appear good on the outside are simply sublimating powerful drive energy that gets acted out in secret.

       Yes obviously. What is "really" behind the modern rise in suicide is the mass prescription and consumption of drugs with the primary negative effect being suicidal thoughts. I appreciate the other points you mention but they are not the real cause.

       Yeah, it may be a contributing factor, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say you are grossly generalizing and oversimplifying things here. People dont just take those drugs because they want to. People on those drugs began taking them in the first place because they were depressed already. Correlation vs causation.

       The number one side effect caused (i.e. causation) in a large percentage of widely prescribed psychotropic drugs is suicidal thoughts. They CAUSE suicidal thoughts as admitted by manufacturers. Go read the labels. Psych drug apologists gross me out.

       Your point about lack of community is spot on. Sebastian Junger has a book called tribe which goes over this. He also believes there is a correlation between this lack of community and the rise of mass shootings. Add nihilism to the mixture and you’ve got the perfect storm for all of these tragedies that seem to happen on a monthly basis.

       I will comment on the male/female aspect of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men are no longer appreciated in society. Women and men used to go well together. Now they seem to be enemies, and this all seems to be purposeful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men are "going their own way" because women are fucked up. But let me tell you this...women have 100% been tricked into being this messed up.

       I both agree and disagree. I believe women at their core seek out the best genes possible and are therefore incapable of extended loyalty to men. (the evolutionary psychology concept of Hypergamy: women are always on the look out for a better mate)
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern society has allowed women's Hypergamy to run unchecked. The lack of religion means fewer marriages, the push towards isolation means less successful marriages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women are now free to seduce as many men as they want. If you could have food for free at any time, would you take McDonald's or a gourmet meal? This is the case for women: they can have sex at any time, so they only go for the best men. This is leaving the majority of men feeling invisible and unwanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marriage gave men a purpose. The lack of it is now killing men and turning women into whores.

       This is one of the most insightful posts I have seen on here in a long time. I agree with your argument, especially the Lack of the Divine, All Work and No Play, and Two Minutes of Hate. Right on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be very lost and depressed. However, once I found a spiritual path that worked for me, everything changed. Now, I don't look for validation or happiness in the material world. I have found them within.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often lament how much happier people would be if they found a spiritual path that works by them.

       In addition to this, I would recommend Jacques Ellul's "The Technological Society" -- though it's a bit dated, considering how fast technology has moved since the 50s, the way in which he analyzes the fundamental aspects of how technology has changed society, and humans themselves, still hold very true.

       Great post, i would like to add one perspective i heard some years ago that stuck with me: An Indian mystic named sadhguru in one of his lectures claimed that IIRC in 20 years 20 percent of the kids will take to suicide since modern life/technology has erased childhood, and the mystery of growing up no longer exists since all questions can be answered as quickly as you can write the question into google.

       Depression has hit me like a ton of bricks really in the last few weeks. I’m 21.5 years old. I’m a lonely soul who just wants connection but where I once could effortlessly find it, I AM HOPELESSLY LOST.  All of my shortcomings up to this point in my life dominate my thoughts. When I hear others, 3-4 years younger then me, speak of fruitful relationships and rich experiences, I just wanna leave the room and jump off a bridge. Because I want that so bad. And I’m envious.

       You are missing the biggest issue I think, our addictions to toxic shit that makes us feel self conscious about ourselves. Heroin being the worst offender, I watched all my hs friends turn to addicts, it sucks. Also tobacco, booze, whatever.. I've been victim to these things and nearly offer myself but I'm glad I didn't. Also the fact I've seen UFOs clear as day multiple times and nobody gives a fuck..

       Not only is this devastating for many, especially those drowning in debt from degrees, but it isolates people. People surely have difficult marrying and forming relationships when they still live with their parents. It is normal and natural to leave home, and our society has made that more difficult than ever.

       That is a Edward Bernays uniquely generated in the US propaganda meant to dissolve family bonds &amp; promote more spending on household consumer items.
      </p>
      <p>
       Families &amp; extended family used to combine their resources by living together. Governments &amp; predatory capitalists don't want extended groups of people bonding strongly &amp; saving their money. They are more difficult to exploit that way.

       Individualists are much easier to economically exploit.

       We are too far our natural-ness (is that the right word?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Technology is good, but is has been causing more problems lately. A line must be drawn, at least i think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of emotion, critical thinking, the hive mind, etc. are all resutls from our hyper-consumerist culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I jsut graduated college in December (22 yo) and i'm dreading the office life. These 40k loans ain't gonna pay themselves though! Don't worry yall, i've got an aggressive payment plan worked out assuming i can make at least 45k.
      </p>
      <p>
       My solution to all of this is to stay as far away from "it" as you can...it being the consumerism, the lack of thinking, the following of the mass thought...
      </p>
      <p>
       Debt is slavery and they got us by the balls...they tell you to buy the biggest house you can, to make sure you keep that car shinny, to always be dressed to the 9's, to have 3 kids cause one is never enough, you better get that master's cause a bachelors is the new HS diploma, have a fancy expensive wedding, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these things are nice, and they can dig you in a endless hole of debt before you know it. Now you sit at your office bleeding your eyes out at your computer just so you earn
       <em>
        just enough
       </em>
       to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       Debt is slavery! You will never be free when someone else hands their hands in your pocket! But not everyone will be smart, not everyone knows, some never even had the chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       By luck i always had an interest in saving money and finance, so i got a degree in finance. Other people won't realize before its too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't take a master's or PhD to be financially stable. Find what you enjoy and make money from it!
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to burn a hole chasing that 4 year degree. Go to community college, be smart if you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a system of corporate feudalism ruled by debt. School ain't free and neither is that pretty house.
      </p>
      <p>
       I
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be free. Sam has me by the balls until i pay these 40k in loans off and i'm never going back in debt like this again...
      </p>
      <p>
       Live simple and true to your nature, if you follow the path they set for us you will only end in suffering and pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if i rambled, but oh well.

       Why did you decide to take on debt by going to college especially when you are dreading the office life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking on a trade right out of high school is answer to avoiding everything you listed above.

      <p>
       Become a plumber, welder or similar and you’ll be making $100k by your mid 20’s. You’ll also have a skill that will be in demand for your entire life.

       I was 17 and didn't really have the chance to think of my options. My mom was pressing me to get applications done and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not worrief about the loans. I have a plan to pay them off aggressively and a pretty marketable major. It's not like I majored in art history lol.

       Looking back, I'd have gone to community college first.

       I think since around 9/11 happened, there has been a massive campaign to attack the populace with chemical poisons, propaganda, and decreased living standards. The rising suicide rate is the tragic byproduct of the sick agenda called the New World Order. Not all wars are fought with guns and explosives. These are "silent weapons for a quiet war."

       when you said if you dont worship a god I worship something else you lost me. how did a conspiracy sub get so religious? so many people posting here are pushing religion and making assumptions about non religious people. The disbelief in god is just that and nothing else. I dont hold anything divine, i don't use face book, Instagram or anything. It is extremely insulting to tell me that if i dont belive in god that i am Obsessive or worship something else that is so judgemental and false.

       That was such a good read. A lot of things mentioned in there resonated with me a lot, and it mentioned a lot of shit that's been going on in my mind and world view. It's actually kind of scary haha. But it's true, and I feel like it explains why I feel the way I feel everyday. At least partly. The words I live by are; if you want to change the world, then you gotta start with yourself. Cuz that's all you can really do at the end of the day. But it seems like today, a lot of people have found comfort in this isolation you discussed, and people don't take the time to really think about this way of living. OH MY GOSH, it's just so frustrating to think about. I can't find the words to express it. Technology is both a gift and a curse. We can utilize it in however way we want to actually benefit us (and I mean everyday people), but I feel like "they've" set it up this way for a reason. It's basically our lullaby to keep us quiet.

       Ok this is my two cents.  It's not going to be popular but here I go.
      </p>
      <p>
       People used to go outside leave their houses and go hang out with other people.  Instead now people stay inside on their computers "connected" over the internet which isn't the same kind of connection at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, social media is constantly showing us our deficiencies in our lives.  Look, that garbage guy from ha has a degree and a fancy job.  I didn't get that.  Now I feel like shit because I feel like a failure even though my shit is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've set ourselves up to be constantly comparing things that don't need to be compared.  Paired with the lack of personal connection we all feel isolated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to all of this work, and financial insecurity and NOW political unrest like we've never experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another less tangible route I also think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many more chemicals in everything anymore.  There have been studies that show the effect of westernized food on isolated tribes.  They were healthy and once they began consuming processed foods they were more lethargic and health issues set in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some many every day chemicals we encounter no one knows which ones are fucking us up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some many things we don't know.  If humans didn't have eyes, does that mean things don't have color?  What else is there that we don't know just because we aren't able to discern it for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NOT anti-vax.  Vaccinations are important, children shouldn't have to worry about polio because of somebody's fake study.

       I have the real answer to this question and it's the lack of sex. If you feel down go get laid get on one of those dating apps and bam boo bam you'll feel happy for a good 3 months.  There is someone for everyone all you have to do is look, if you're fat there might be a beautiful chubby chaser waiting for you, if you're ugly there might be a sexy person whose into your specific look like it's their fetish.   Take a bath and go get some.

       Life is pain, my 1000 dollar I-phone is running so slow, I'm going to go kill myself. Maybe we should let some immigrants into this country because its seems a lot of spoiled brats who don't recognize how good this life is wanna end it. I'd rather have myself surrounded with people who think they can change the world than with those who just simply want out. I've been here a long time and am well aware of all of it. All wars are bankers wars folks.!! It is what it is, whatcha goin do? Kill yourself and make them happy or grow a pair of balls and stand up to it? Every day I point out some stinky shit on social media and all my friends are silent, they are a bunch of pussies. I refuse to bow to down to all these zionists so I carry a gun everyday waiting for them to try and silence me.

       well put and constructed.

      <p>
       this reminds me of something mid-late 20th Century philosopher Guy Debord apparently used to talk about. He was convinced that depression didn't exist as a sickness in the Middle Ages. It was only after the alienation of post-enlightenment modern labour that depression came to exist. Depression then spiked post-WW2 with the advent of entertainment like TV, further alienating the average person from everyday, hands-on life; broadcasting a dreamlike 'spectacle' that is ultimately unattainable to the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose the internet is just an extension of this alienating spectacle, selling people dreams, detaching us further from real life.

       I think I can honestly say that this world isn't worth fighting for at this point. It's too far gone and I'm only sticking around to see how far the can can get kicked down the road anymore.

       Went out for a longer walk than normal today. Walking by the river or through the forest feels the exact same as if I was sitting at home in my room, and my exercise is feeling more and more pointless as I make it harder.
      </p>

       I'll never kill myself. It's not like I really can anyways, because I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I was told I was in Hell already.

       I'm so glad you posted this cause I just came to this subreddit to make a post about celebrity suicides.  I don't mean to hijack it but I want to point out what I noticed that no one else is even mentioning. I just want other people's input about whether their might be something to this or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since May 18th 2017, 4 high (I'm only mentioning these 4 i don't know if there's more I'll have too look into it.)  profile celebrities have "Committed suicide".  In this order, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, as you all well know. Chester died only 2 months after Cornell.  Kate Spade died June 5th while Anthony Bourdain died June 8th.  Is it just me or is it odd that in both cases two celebrities killed them selves very close to each? Heres the kicker And not just killed them selves but all 4 did it the exact same way.  All 4 "Hanged them selves".  Think about that.  4 celeberitys..  In the span of one year and 2 months all killed them selves the exact same way.  Not to mention the 3 other fashion designer who have hung them selves recently.  How often do you see 2 people kill them selves the exact same way within 2 days of each other?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention men are more likely to be violent in their suicides (For example shooting them selves) while women tend to take less violent means like overdosing.  I mean these people had access to any drug in the world.  They could've went out by overdosing and die in bliss.  I could see if one or 2 out of 4 hanged them selves. But not 4.. All within a year and roughly 20 days of each other.  I don't know whether it could be someone killing them or what.  But I believe there's a pattern and that at the very least its really weird and deserves looking into.  So please feel free to tell me what you think.

       Suicide is the biggest killer of men under 45. The powers at be tell us its mental health, which is partly true, but its often a scapegoat to hide the fact that our society is unfulfilling to alot of people and our culture is toxic
      </p>
      <p>
       If we lived in a society where everyone was more friendly, we didnt have such a toxic political discourse, people where willing to help with healthcare, public education, etc etc, do you really believe the suicide rate would be what it is today? Mental health is a big part of it but there is another big piece of the pie that is completely ignored by everyone. Our culture

       I agree with everything that has been said here, but I think an important point has been excluded. This being either abuse of parents or divorces. These cause mental illness. Almost every person I know with a mental illness has had divorced parents. So this would be a big factor in suicide as they wouldn't be living with two caring parents and would be isolated too.

       Might sound harsh but I consider it natural selection to a degree. Society works so hard to prop up every single person and keep them all going but inevitably you can't catch it all. Whatever things genetically that make these folks predisposed to commit suicide are being taken out of the gene pool and hopefully before they reproduce so the cycle doesn't keep going

       I don't blame technology for it, in the end the education people have is the ultimate cause. 
Nowadays almost everyone is taught that they can be anything they want, and have everything they desire. Children are being spoiled by their parents, they never deal with frustation growing up. And guess what, when they reach adulthood they learn that life is hard and full of obstacles and by then, don't have the psychologic strentgh to overcome and take the easy way out.

       Well, these filters are just another element of isolation. It is dangerous to become isolated in our own paradigms, especially when we view anybody who disagrees with us as enemies ALL OF THE TIME. Look, online, there are shills, trolls, and creeps, and I am not dismissing that. But, technology has created a world where people fear disagreement because that means lack of social approval, and therefore, social isolation.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        These social relationships we have are “built on sand” in a sense that they are based on validation and agreeability, not true relationships. A true friend will tell you when they disagree with you without repercussion. Online, a person who disagrees can be blocked, ignored, deleted, etc. We are building a society of people who fear criticism.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Very good points here. I make it a point to never block anyone.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We become Gods because we worship ourselves, and technology makes that possible.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't really get this statement. To me if we really believed we were gods we would worship both ourselves and each other because of our recognized divinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       All around an excellent write up. Thank you.

       I don't believe it has
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       to do with technology. I do agree, more people are becoming nihilistic and don't believe in anything. So if you talk about something deep and meaningful, they don't really wish to talk about it. However, I can find people on the internet that enjoy this type of discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe another big part of this is all the expectations society puts on you and if you don't meet those you're labeled a loser or a failure.

       Brain inflammation (NIMH confirms this). In general people are not aware of the impact brain inflammation has on depression. We have an epidemic of Babesia/Bartonella/lyme/RMSF/parasites/mold/metals and nothing substantial in place to properly treat any of it. The numbers impacted are increasing and this population has a very high suicide rate.

       I see this as a physiological symptom of actual disease or response to prolonged pain and suffering (ptsd).

       I don't think therapy is demonized, but I do feel that finding the right therapist is crucial! Not all therapists are good at their job. Also, sometimes you don't "click" with one therapist, but if you try another one you might find a better fit. So some people don't realize this and will give up on therapy if they have had a bad experience.

       Men are no longer appreciated in society. Women and men used to go well together. Now they seem to be enemies, and this all seems to be purposeful.

       Men are "going their own way" because women are fucked up. But let me tell you this...women have 100% been tricked into being this messed up.

       I was 17 and didn't really have the chance to think of my options. My mom was pressing me to get applications done and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not worrief about the loans. I have a plan to pay them off aggressively and a pretty marketable major. It's not like I majored in art history lol.

       Looking back, I'd have gone to community college first.
