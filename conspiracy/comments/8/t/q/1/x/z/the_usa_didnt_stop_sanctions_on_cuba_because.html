<p>If they can further develop this cancer treatment, that is currently in trials, then it could be worth billions. Now, Cuba gave it to their citizens for a dollar a day, but I’m sure it’s going to cost significantly more after USA gets done with it.</p>

<p>This is a good thing, we all will benefit but I’m sure Cuba knew if they went willing to “trade” it to the USA then they would come get it, just like USA does with countries that refuse to sell their oil at a “fair” price. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a multi-generational conspiracy and it started with the Rockefellers wanting control of the medical establishment to ensure their chemical companies had plenty of demand for their products.</p>

<p>Western doctors,  in general,  know nothing about nutrition.   They&#39;re  taught nothing about the healing powers of food in medical school because their whole purpose is to prescribe pharmaceuticals for the Rockefeller Medicine machine.   </p>

<p>I had to go to the hospital once (emergency medicine is the best and most justifiable aspect of Western medicine) and while I was there started to develop a huge cold sore on my lip from high fever.  </p>

<p>The herpes virus in cold sores can be deactivated with lysine; iirc it interferes with an enzyme the virus needs for replication. Every time I feel a cold sore coming on,  I take lysine orally and apply an ointment containing lysine.   The sores never develop because I halt the virus in it&#39;s tracks and it goes back into dormancy. </p>

<p>I tried to explain this to my nurses and doctor,  a cardiovascular surgeon.  I didn&#39;t have any lysine at the hospital and could tell the outbreak was going to be insane if I didn&#39;t get some in me, so I requested it and offered my explanation as to why I needed it. </p>

<p>The intereference of lysine with the function of herpes virus is an established scientific fact,  yet none of the nurses nor my doctor believed me.  I could overhear them discussing my &quot;odd beliefs&quot; in the hallway. They finally decided,  &quot;well, it&#39;s just a supplement, it isn&#39;t going to hurt him&quot;, and they agreed to let me have the lysine as some sort of placebo (from their perspective) to help me feel better. </p>

<p>People can go to medical school for decades, but,  if the schools are limiting the information distributed to only that which benefits particular agendas, the students are only being taught how to further that agenda. We end up with medical experts that know very little about how the body works outside the context how Rockefeller pharmaceuticals affect it, because that is all they are taught.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have moved a lot in my life and have experienced many doctors in my day. </p>

<p>I only see Doctors of Osteopathy (DO) for a reason.</p>

<p>Medical Doctors (MD), in my experience, are only concerned with throwing pills at symptoms. DOs are focused more in the body’s physiology and proper treatment based on the symptoms.</p>

<p>This isn’t true for everyone, of course. I’ve come across a couple DOs that seemed like previous MDs and vice versa.</p>

<p>But I feel confident making such generalizations based on my personal experiences.</p>

<p>I always thought it was funny that people saw DOs were seen as “lesser” Doctors when they in fact, up until recently, received MORE education than that of Medical Doctors. I wonder where that stigma came from?</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/PepeSilvia1160.html">PepeSilvia1160</a> 2018-06-25</p>
    <div class="md"><p>...Where did you read that DOs used to receive more education than MDs? The only additional training they receive, now or in the past, was in osteopathic medicine. All in all, their training is relatively similar, but it is universally agreed upon that the coursework, research, and clinical work of an MD is more rigorous. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying DOs aren&#39;t great; my PCP is one. I&#39;m just saying, those are some pretty lofty claims to throw around. Plus, while you did say it was anecdotal and I respect what you&#39;ve experienced yourself, this is an excerpt from the distinct differences in patient care and perception of the two:</p>

<p>&quot;Several studies have investigated whether there is a difference in the approach to patients by MDs and DOs. A study of patient visits to general and family medicine physicians in the U.S., including 277 million visits to MDs and 65 million visits to DOs, found that there was no significant difference between DOs and MDs with regard to time spent with patients and preventive medicine services.</p>

<p>The study of approximately 341 million healthcare visits founds that there was no difference on the rate that doctors provided to patients diet or nutrition counseling, weight reduction counseling, exercise counseling, tobacco use or exposure counseling, and mental health or stress reduction counseling. Some authors describe subjective distinctions in patient interactions, but Avery Hurt writes, &quot;In actual practice, the variations between the two types of physicians are often so slight as to be unnoticeable to patients, and a day in the life of each can appear indistinguishable. But the differences are there, subtle but deep&#39;&quot;.</p>

<p>Regarding your other question though, the stigma definitely came from other physicians. In the 1800&#39;s, DOs broke off from MDs, claiming to want to treat the illness rather than the symptoms, like they thought the MDs were doing. The education for DOs was largely unregulated, or at least not anywhere nearly as regulated or extensive as that of an MD. Until 1989 even, DOs couldn&#39;t practice as a physician in Nebraska, and they&#39;re only accepted as practicing physicians in 44 countries today.</p>

<p>It was definitely born of an unfair stigma against DOs, but historically there has been a fairly significant difference in education, test scores, and the like. Even today, the average MCAT and GPA scores for MDs vs DOs reveals is fairly heavily slanted to the side of the MDs. And all of that is assuming you&#39;re just talking about General Practitioners. Once you need a surgical or medical specialist, it is typically an MD due to the extensive sub-specialty training they receive that a DO can&#39;t/doesn&#39;t. Typically, DOs provide the same level of care that MD PCPs do, but fall very short in terms of specialization of care.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a fact check about the Illegal Russian nuclear trade. They claimed the allegations to be false. Yet, no-one in the public, outside of the State Department and the DOJ, know the answer to that.</p>

<p>Snopes was questioned over twitter about an article stating that it&#39;s false there was more than one one Vegas Shooter, while as far as the public knows, the findings are inconclusive, and that &quot;there may have only been one shooter&quot;. Snopes removed both with an apology.</p>

<p>For reasons unknown, at several times snopes made claims about facts checked on issues that were inconclusive. </p>

<p>Now much of the fact checking I find are there are of irrelevant circumstances that went viral and may have been misleading, yet, much of those fact checks, regardless of their outcome, have any impact on our lives.</p>

<p>If snopes pushed its resources to fact-checking the daily Loby activity, I&#39;d be more interested in browsing their site more often.</p>

<p>The Snopes Link: <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/second-gunman-shoot-fourth-floor-mandalay-bay/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/second-gunman-shoot-fourth-floor-mandalay-bay/</a> is the incident in Vegas.</p>

<p>You said: &quot;while as far as the public knows, the findings are inconclusive&quot;  </p>

<p>Whereas the assistant sheriff in charge said: &quot;I want to emphasize we believe Paddock is solely responsible for this heinous act. We are aware of the rumors outside of the media and also on social media that there was more than one assailant. We have no information or evidence to support that theory, or that rumor. We believe there was only one shooter and that was Stephen Paddock.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Owning land and &quot;starting a business&quot; is antithetical to socialist principles. It&#39;s a no-brainer why it&#39;s hard to do there. Land and businesses are the means of production and they are to be owned by the commons. There are problems with Cuba, any Cuban will tell you that. As far as I have heard, Cubans are relatively happy with how things are going in Cuba, all things considered. The spirit of the revolution is strong with them.</p>

<p>The reason Cuba&#39;s government wants tourism is because tourists are the only way to bring capital into the country, since almost no one will trade with them. Cuba, existing in an overwhelmingly capitalist world, has to make some concessions to stay afloat. Especially with the dissolution of the USSR and the US embargo, and by extension - embargo by countries who can&#39;t piss off the US for fear of &#39;liberation&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every country has elitist but they are still accountable to the courts in most places. You might say they can buy expensive lawyers to get off but that further proves that even elites can go to jail for breaking the law and they spend tons of money on lawyers bc they know that. 
In Cuba people are jailed for political views and jailed without a trail. How can you defend that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are/were jailed for political views in the USA, also... Socialists and Communists were once very prevalent in the states. The red scare (thanks, McCarthy) made it criminal to be a Communist in the USA and that legacy continues today. Leftists are frequently jailed for partaking in nonviolent protests in the USA. I&#39;d say that constitutes political imprisonment.</p>

<p>Also, the only reason wealthy elites go to jail is if they piss off *other wealthy elites*.  Martin Shkreli went to jail because he defrauded the wealthy, not because he objectively caused harm to the people who could no longer afford their medication after he jacked up the prices. I don&#39;t know how the law operates in Cuba, I&#39;ve never been there - but I&#39;d wager it doesn&#39;t take much to improve on the way the &#39;states does things.</p>
