As well as taking down the corrupt corporate elements.&quot;</p>

<p>HLI answered:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot; There are elements in existence that are prepared and able to fight, but it won&#39;t go down the way you perceive.</p>

<p>Instead, <em>the breaking of the current regime will look fairly ordinary to the masses</em>.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe anon was under the assumption Hillary was going to win, and HLI was describing what we are currently witnessing with Trump. Doing things through the proper legal channels. Getting SCOTUS picks that are against the deep state agenda (disarming the people, eliminating freedom of speech, etc.), making peace with our “enemies” all over the world, while simultaneously “creating enemies” of those we once considered allies (who are also on board with the globalist agenda).</p>

<p>Idk, just spitballing. I don’t really remember too much of what HLI claimed.</p>

<p>That sounds pretty extraordinary, IMO. So, how do you make it look <em>fairly ordinary to the masses</em>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I think it’s kinda already started happening. Hypothetically, had Hillary won and been able to appoint not just one, but <em>two</em> far left, SJW-type justices to the courts, the globalist agenda would have been able to move ahead at near full speed unimpeded (even just 1, really). At the very least, their plan has now been set back likely 20-30 years, right?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the old regime’s media has got everyone absolutely FREAKING OUT as if the world has ended because of these appointments. Most people don’t even understand the significance of what has recently occurred. It’s why we are seeing the media become even more and more aggressive lately.</p>

<p>It just feels like behind the scenes, A LOT of people in DC are the ones who are actually freaking out. All the people that “played ball” their entire careers because that’s just how things worked, and they knew (thought) they’d never get in trouble for any of it because the power structure would insulate them from consequences. But externally, they appear calm and just upset about Trump and his policies. Giving the appearance of “business as usual”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be but for now, that knowledge is being used against people. These people have just been psychologically tricked and this has been going on for decades. They&#39;ve been conditioned over and over to be terrified that a Democrat is going to take their guns and a lot of them are the type that are aware of the Secret Societies and the elites and such that run things and are pushing us towards a one world government. So they&#39;re terrified of the threat of it happening and what a tyrannical government would do once their guns are taken. This fear was constantly reinforced for a reason and the fruits of its labor are about to be harvested. They used Obama as a red herring to get these people all whipped up into a frenzy for 8 years so they would be desperate enough to vote for Trump. The NRA wasn&#39;t being used to arm the people to rise up against an oppressive tyrannical government, they were arming people to fight FOR one.</p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s an accident that Trump has been talking about this for 30 years? That his uncle use to talk to him about nuclear weapons and he&#39;s always wanted to make deals with Russia about nukes and a peace deal in the Middle East? That he became the leader of the birther movement? That he checks every single box of the Fox News watching, conspiratorial, white, Christian conservative American archetype? Rails about the liberal media, fights against the Clinton&#39;s/Obama, fights for the working man, loves the military and the police, respects the flag and the national anthem, is all about American exceptionalism, #1 issue is illegal immigration, pro business and anti regulation, pro tax cuts, doesn&#39;t believe in climate change. It&#39;s like your typical Fox News viewer&#39;s entire belief system came to life, complete with thinking he&#39;s a victim and superior at the same time. And dressed up in a nice pseudo fake Reagan costume just to really get them hooked.</p>

<p>Trump is the Messiah they&#39;ve been waiting for. The outsider who is finally going to drain the swamp and make america great again. End the corruption and kick all the worthless bums out of our government and set things right. He&#39;s going to fight the evil hold the Elite and the Secret Societies have on the world and free the people from them. Except they&#39;ve been tricked, brainwashed even. Their own knowledge and awareness were use against them to blind them to the trick that was being pulled. This Trump vs Deep State thing is just pro wrestling. A conflict conjured up so the next stage can be implemented. They&#39;ve slowly been conditioned to vote for Trump for decades without even realizing it. Why? Because what better way to bring a covert plan into fruition than to lead the people aware of the plan who are trying to thwart it into carrying it out themselves unknowingly.</p>

<p>What do you do when you want to takeover a government of people who are very paranoid, armed to the teeth and are aware of the typical tactics that a tyrannical government would employ to do such a takeover? Make those people in favor of the takeover and even cause them to initiate it.</p>

<p>&quot;Ergo, you are wrong - the military, acting according to the letter of the highest law of the land, has no authority to remove a president from power.&quot;  The military can do a lot according to military law.  They are not required to stand there and do nothing while any of the three branches of government commit treason.  The American people are allowed to reform the government, and the military is allowed to help with this.  </p>

<p>&quot;Only Congress can do so.&quot; And, what if Congress is committing acts of treason?  Then what?  </p>

<p>&quot;I suggest you read the Constitution.&quot;  I read it in law school.  </p>

<p>Are you not aware that a &quot;coup&quot; has been going on since Trump won the election?  That is why all of these people are resigning from business and government. They are NWO globalists, but they lost the 2016 election.  </p>

<p>This might be why there are 40,000+ sealed indictments since last October.  We will see about this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia wants to destroy us. Trump is the culmination of a century of trying to destabilize us. Why do people not understand this? The right was screaming about Russia right up until Trump. Then all of a sudden not only are they our friends, we should just completely do their bidding.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Foundations of Geopolitics, Dugin calls for the influence of the United States and Atlanticism to lose its influence in Eurasia and for Russia to rebuild its influence through annexations and alliances.  </p>

<p>The book declares that &quot;the battle for the world rule of [ethnic] Russians&quot; has not ended and Russia remains &quot;the staging area of a new anti-bourgeois, anti-American revolution&quot;. The Eurasian Empire will be constructed &quot;on the fundamental principle of the common enemy: the rejection of Atlanticism, strategic control of the USA, and the refusal to allow liberal values to dominate us.&quot;  </p>

<p>Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook believes in a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia&#39;s gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries.  </p>

<p><strong>In Europe:</strong>  </p>

<p>Germany should be offered the de facto political dominance over most Protestant and Catholic states located within Central and Eastern Europe. Kaliningrad oblast could be given back to Germany. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow–Berlin axis&quot;.  </p>

<p>France should be encouraged to form a &quot;Franco–German bloc&quot; with Germany. Both countries have a &quot;firm anti-Atlanticist tradition&quot;.  </p>

<p>The United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe.  </p>

<p>Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because &quot;Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics&quot;. Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.  </p>

<p><strong>In the Middle East and Central Asia:</strong>  </p>

<p>The book stresses the &quot;continental Russian–Islamic alliance&quot; which lies &quot;at the foundation of anti-Atlanticist strategy&quot;. The alliance is based on the &quot;traditional character of Russian and Islamic civilization&quot;.  </p>

<p>Iran is a key ally. The book uses the term &quot;Moscow–Tehran axis&quot;.  </p>

<p>The book emphasizes that Russia must spread Anti-Americanism everywhere: &quot;the main &#39;scapegoat&#39; will be precisely the U.S.&quot;  </p>

<p><strong>In the United States:</strong>  </p>

<p>Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke &quot;Afro-American racists&quot;. Russia should &quot;introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After encouraging Brexit, fueling instability in the US that&#39;s about to lead to a civil war, pulling out of the Iran deal, okaying Russia&#39;s takeover of Ukraine, ruining the our partnership with Europe and turning the whole world against us, its time to help form that &quot;Franco–German bloc&quot;!  </p>

<p>The U.S. has a $20T+ debt to the international bankers, so our interest payment to them is huge.  Our debt grew significantly under Obama, and would have grown even more under Hillary.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>HLI&#39;s take is super interesting actually. He said that our language was subverted and that it&#39;s the Old World Order we are standing against, not NWO. Some selected quotes, just quick:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The old world order is your enemy. It already exists. It is not something that is coming down the line.</p>

<p>They do not have end goals. They are attempting to maintain control. The idea of a &quot;new world order&quot; is a psy-op. It is an old world order that is being guarded and propped up, not a vision for the future being worked towards.</p>

<p>The old order doesn&#39;t have an end game. They are not plotting a new world order, but rather fighting to maintain the old order. The language you have been given to describe your predicament is all upside down.</p>

<p>The old order is composed of conscious individuals who seek to limit the extent of consciousness, maintain a slave / unthinking class beneath them. We disagree with this secrecy and limitation and seek general enlightenment, cooperation, and progress of all people. </p>

<p>The new world order is basically the ambitions embodied in the American revolution. The old world order is comprised of bankers, nobility, secret societies which seek to conceal information and feed upon the downtrodden masses.</p>

<p>We plan to preserve US hegemony and use it as intended: a city on the hill that lifts up the rest of the world, rather than the military arm of the old world order that it is now. </p>

<p>You are opposed to the old world order, not the new world order. It is a few thousand years old. The new world order is what needs to be built - the American enterprise.</p>

<p>As I have said repeatedly, the world order that most of you are aligned against is not a &quot;new world order&quot; but rather a regime seeking to maintain the old world order.</p>

<p>We believe that the organizing principles and ambitions of the old order are not only wrong but unsustainable. It needs to be overthrown not only for your own good, but ours and theirs as well.</p>

<p>We are actively working against the old world order and setting into motion the coming transformation, a process that will only continue to accelerate.</p>

<p>We will seize control of the US state apparatus and use it as a force for good in the world. You&#39;ll see the emergence of a new world order of sorts, not by conquest or subversion or trickery, but because people admire the progress and values and wish to share in it. We will build the entire world up, starting in America and spreading rapidly elsewhere. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we will release cures for diseases and invest heavily into biotech focused on life extension. Within about 10 years at most you&#39;ll see life expectancy climbing at a rate greater than one year per year. By mid to late 2030s, people will be coming to terms with the idea that they are only at risk of dying very narrow set of causes like acute trauma / violence, etc.<br/>
In terms of marriage, you should realize that when the institution was invented life expectancy was dramatically shorter - not much more than what it took to bring your kids into independent adulthood. We strongly value the nuclear family and marriage institution for procreating and raising a family, but this is already not really a lifelong activity and as our lives extend into hundreds or thousands of years, the reproductive phase is merely a short episode in one&#39;s own life.
The attraction that people have to such permanence creating schema will fade as the fear of their own mortality subsides, but the will also invest themselves more intensely in their current relationships. You can expect shallow pleasure seeking to grow dull and uninteresting to most very rapidly and people to gravitate to things that fulfill them only on the deepest levels, love, enchantment by their music, the most richly crafted novel, or other things of this nature.</p>

<p>reading the rest of the text, i can&#39;t believe that this is a source for any real information. this is just a delusional person with followers</p>

It’s hard to really nail anything down when you got a thousand things hitting at once. I try not to give concrete belief into any one line of information, reading them all repeatedly. At some point bits will start to stand out as true or false, at least to me they do. I really can’t even remember if I read the HLI drops when they first came out, lol.

    <div class="md"><p>HLI&#39;s take is super interesting actually. He said that our language was subverted and that it&#39;s the Old World Order we are standing against, not NWO. Some selected quotes, just quick:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The old world order is your enemy. It already exists. It is not something that is coming down the line.</p>

<p>They do not have end goals. They are attempting to maintain control. The idea of a &quot;new world order&quot; is a psy-op. It is an old world order that is being guarded and propped up, not a vision for the future being worked towards.</p>

<p>The old order doesn&#39;t have an end game. They are not plotting a new world order, but rather fighting to maintain the old order. The language you have been given to describe your predicament is all upside down.</p>

<p>The old order is composed of conscious individuals who seek to limit the extent of consciousness, maintain a slave / unthinking class beneath them. We disagree with this secrecy and limitation and seek general enlightenment, cooperation, and progress of all people. </p>

<p>The new world order is basically the ambitions embodied in the American revolution. The old world order is comprised of bankers, nobility, secret societies which seek to conceal information and feed upon the downtrodden masses.</p>

<p>We plan to preserve US hegemony and use it as intended: a city on the hill that lifts up the rest of the world, rather than the military arm of the old world order that it is now. </p>

<p>You are opposed to the old world order, not the new world order. It is a few thousand years old. The new world order is what needs to be built - the American enterprise.</p>

<p>As I have said repeatedly, the world order that most of you are aligned against is not a &quot;new world order&quot; but rather a regime seeking to maintain the old world order.</p>

<p>We believe that the organizing principles and ambitions of the old order are not only wrong but unsustainable. It needs to be overthrown not only for your own good, but ours and theirs as well.</p>

<p>We are actively working against the old world order and setting into motion the coming transformation, a process that will only continue to accelerate.</p>

<p>We will seize control of the US state apparatus and use it as a force for good in the world. You&#39;ll see the emergence of a new world order of sorts, not by conquest or subversion or trickery, but because people admire the progress and values and wish to share in it. We will build the entire world up, starting in America and spreading rapidly elsewhere. </p>
