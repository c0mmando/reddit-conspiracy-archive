   r/conspiracy: Looking for a video. A few years back there was a video that circulated the internet for about a day and I have yet to find it again. It was a recording within some covert CIA meeting. A scientist was giving a speech about introducing a flu that could alter genetic makeup. Anyone remember? | /r/Conspiracy Archive

       This is either a subsequent or substitute video. The point should be made that these Dr. Mengelas are trying to manipulate genetic expression in living human beings. It's time to cut the defense budget. 800 billion dollars a year get you plenty of these kind of monsters.

       Soon we'll have insane people in basements infecting strangers using rhinovirus in spray bottles in public stadiums just to see what happens. For now it's mostly the insane people in CDC and Darpa and DOD. Time to cut some budgets before these assholes open Pandora's box.

       I think I know the video you are talking about. I thought I even have it on HD, but couldn't find it.

       But the video I'm talking about turned out to be a hoax anyway. Can't remember how it was debunked though...

       I think it was scraped off the web. I remember looking for it a couple days after watching it and not being to find it anywhere. If it was debunked maybe that was just part of the scrape. Why would they go to such lengths to get it off the web?

       I really can't remember how it was debunked, I only remember that the debunking convinced me rather quickly. 
I guess it was something like a link to that "CIA lecturer's" social media account, showing he's an art student or something the like. It really was just an "oh" moment and I didn't think about it anymore.

       The lecturer was a rather young guy and there were only 3-4 other people in the room, right?

       So this is what I gathered from the debunking.  The image used in the slide was either shopped in afterwards, or the video altogether is staged because the image used was not available until 2010, but the video is supposedly from 2005.  I say still up in the air.

       Yeah I remember this one. I think the idea at the time was to infect the middle east, destroy Islam as a religion and end Islamist terrorism. Who knows if it was ever tried, but you can bet your pants the Pentagon is saving this stuff up for a rainy day. Creepy stuff.

       I'm not familiar with the video but if you do find it bring it here, I'd like to watch it.
I also was looking for a video/website I watched a couple of years ago. It was a guy who worked with the Navy (but I don't think he was in the Navy himself) and he talked about how they change our DNA with electromagnetic frequencies. I thought his name was Eldred Byrd?

       I remember this also. It was frightening how casually the concept and technology was described. That's what stood out to me.

       My dad is a Vet, and same with my Dead GPa. My dad Navy sub tech, and my GPa was Air Force and never talked about stories or anything, he didn't like it. My dad had all sorts of stories.

      <p>
       One thing my GPa said that my father backed up hardcore was that Military Intelligence in the United States is always at least 20-40 years ahead of any tech in the current year.
