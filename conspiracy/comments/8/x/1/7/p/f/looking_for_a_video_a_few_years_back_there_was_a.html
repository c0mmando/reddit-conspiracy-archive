    <div class="md"><p>I think it was scraped off the web. I remember looking for it a couple days after watching it and not being to find it anywhere. If it was debunked maybe that was just part of the scrape. Why would they go to such lengths to get it off the web? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn I could swear I had it on my HD, but it&#39;s not there anymore.</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t remember how it was debunked, I only remember that the debunking convinced me rather quickly. 
I guess it was something like a link to that &quot;CIA lecturer&#39;s&quot; social media account, showing he&#39;s an art student or something the like. It really was just an &quot;oh&quot; moment and I didn&#39;t think about it anymore.</p>

<p>The lecturer was a rather young guy and there were only 3-4 other people in the room, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is what I gathered from the debunking.  The image used in the slide was either shopped in afterwards, or the video altogether is staged because the image used was not available until 2010, but the video is supposedly from 2005.  I say still up in the air. </p>

I also was looking for a video/website I watched a couple of years ago. It was a guy who worked with the Navy (but I don&#39;t think he was in the Navy himself) and he talked about how they change our DNA with electromagnetic frequencies. I thought his name was Eldred Byrd?</p>
