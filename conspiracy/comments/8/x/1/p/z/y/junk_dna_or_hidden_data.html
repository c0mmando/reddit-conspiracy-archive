What if this DNA was actually stored information for the future by the hypothetical ancient aliens. If we were genetically assisted back in the ancient past, could information have been stored for us to find millennia later? If so, would it be likely stored in a language that would resemble ancient sumerian?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought that it was equivalent of source code functions that may have developed over time, however the coder removed the pointers that originally utilized the code. So we basically have old junk data that we no longer needed. That said, if there was some geneticist, they code encode other things in the same DNA and just not have it be referenced. I am no geneticist though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The junk DNA gets jumbled up and basically randomized from generation to generation. If your speculation was true and it was implanted for us to uncover later then it would be highly corrupted by the many generations that were the offspring that came after it&#39;s insertion. It&#39;s mostly neutral genes that does not harm us or help us to the point of reaching the breeding age. Some of it is leftover DNA from viruses that infected cells that manufactured reproduction cells such as sperm or eggs. Those cells didn&#39;t die to the many viruses we have encountered over the years so they lived to <em>tell the tail</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A nucleotide is just a single &quot;bit&quot; in computer speak. Insted of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s think of them as two bits condensed into one where the two can be reversed and give a completely different input into the code weather or not its reversed or not. There are 4 possible combinations AT TA CG GC. Think of it as 10 01 23 32 where 2 and 3 represent the same function as 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s but as a different thing. It takes two nucleotides to make one &quot;bit&quot; of a gene therefore an individual nucleotide is a half bit and holds no valuable information.</p>

<p>but what in the actual eff is a dream and what is instinct? Thats where the whole animus machine idea comes from. Just because the writers at ubisoft turned the animus into a plot device doesn&#39;t mean that memory viewing isn&#39;t possible.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in reincarnation, but i believe people think they&#39;re reincarnations because of these vivid recalls. I know I had a vivid dream as a kid.</p>

<p>As a science-y way of exploring the possibility that theres something deeper to these past life traumas I wager that mental illness is the survivors stain.</p>

<p>History was violent as fuck, bloody too. Some survived their torturing, went on to have kids. The brain ensures our survival, this could be a way for the mind to prepare itself. Reshape the pathways in order to resemble your ancestors - who are ALL survivors, you wouldn&#39;t be here otherwise...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the basis of your claim has merit since we recently were able to code the famous &#39;racing horse&#39; video onto DNA and the FBI voiced interest in it (though let&#39;s be real, they already have it).  But there is so much we&#39;re still learning about DNA, an example being that it is not a perfect helix and there are substructures within it.  The &#39;junk&#39; DNA, though, gives the misconception that it&#39;s concentrated in one area when in reality it&#39;s strewn about randomly in the genes that turn into proteins.  These junk bits are removed during processing.  The caveat being that the same gene can code for multiple proteins depending on what bits are removed.  Also there&#39;s non-coding DNA in front of genes that encourages or discourages the processing of these genes, as well as DNA bits required to start replication of DNA.</p>

<p>TL;DR The junk DNA story is another example of science watered down by the media to make it more palatable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a researcher in genetic algorithms. And the whole deal about this field is using evolution to solve problems. Maybe I can put a different perspective on junk DNAs.</p>

<p>Junk DNAs, are actually error correcting mechanisms. It means, although the actual genes responsible for it&#39;s phenotypic response are only used in a normal growth system, the junk DNAs help to keep things going even if there are mistakes in the sequencing process. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the theory that somewhere in that junk lies a secret message waiting to be deciphered</p>

<p>in actuality  it&#39;s just DNA we have no idea what it does, virus hitchhiking (boosting immune system), deprecated DNA (nature loves this), and of course non-coding (or turned off). </p>

<p>DNA has turned out much more elusive than we thought </p>
