    <div class="md"><p>Just look at how the Taliban has held the US government at bay with little more than AK-47&#39;s.  However, I would stipulate the only way there could ever be a successful revolution in America is if the vast majority of the military revolted along with the people.  Highly unlikely, but having an armed populace does give the government pause when the implement draconian restrictions on civil rights.  Just imagine if the Jews were armed in Nazi Germany, things might have been a little different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it has honestly surprised me that people have not used more violent/deadly ways to cause destruction and harm people. more often than not a bomb in a crowded area is significantly more deadly, and offers the bomber to get away, or ensure death (suicide bombers).

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhh depends. You can still get guns and hunting riffles pretty much in every country. Its just harder to get military and police grade weapons except if you live in switzerland or eastern europe. Though it is not fully automatic.</p>

<p>Again a mentally ill guy can still get guns easily even if you restrict their access. Maybe the gun stores should be better with the background checks?  Check the individual address and if he/she lives at home, contact the parents.</p>

<p>I read somewhere some time ago, that the background checks they do, is literally so bad that you can easy pass it even with a bad history of violence.</p>

<p>But again i go back to police kills way more people and you should fear the police more than mass shooters cause you are more likely to be killed by police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lightly armed insurgents have a huge advantage over professional militaries.  If you need some historical context, I would point you to the US war for Independence as one such example.  Where a bunch of poor;y armed and trained farmers resisted and eventually beat the largest military of the time.  Fast forward to the US war in Vietnam, where again, poorly armed and trained farmers bogged us down and were able to win by not being defeated.  go now to Afghanistan where we have been fighting for over a decade and the Taliban/ISIS/Al Queda, etc...continue to rule to interior and our massive military is unable to stop them.  </p>

<p>Now you draw up a scenario where the entire US military takes up again the population, and we not only out gun them, but we out number them, and that isn&#39;t considering that some military units would most likely fight for the insurgents (national guard for instance).   </p>

<p>I’m not saying it would be a slam dunk, but we have a lot of veterans and armed individuals that would be better at using local terrain and insurgent networks than the US military.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were 12 boys aged 12 - 16, plus their coach (for a total of 13 people) who is aged somewhere between 22 - 25 (I’ve read conflicting info, probably due to faulty translations). 4 of the boys were rescued this morning. They’re rescueing the boys in pairs, with a pair of divers for each boy (so 4 divers go in, select 2 boys, and the 6 come out).</p>

<p>I don’t know much about numerology but there’s some numbers for your brain if you so wish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just look at how the Taliban has held the US government at bay with little more than AK-47&#39;s.  However, I would stipulate the only way there could ever be a successful revolution in America is if the vast majority of the military revolted along with the people.  Highly unlikely, but having an armed populace does give the government pause when the implement draconian restrictions on civil rights.  Just imagine if the Jews were armed in Nazi Germany, things might have been a little different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lightly armed insurgents have a huge advantage over professional militaries.  If you need some historical context, I would point you to the US war for Independence as one such example.  Where a bunch of poor;y armed and trained farmers resisted and eventually beat the largest military of the time.  Fast forward to the US war in Vietnam, where again, poorly armed and trained farmers bogged us down and were able to win by not being defeated.  go now to Afghanistan where we have been fighting for over a decade and the Taliban/ISIS/Al Queda, etc...continue to rule to interior and our massive military is unable to stop them.  </p>

<p>Now you draw up a scenario where the entire US military takes up again the population, and we not only out gun them, but we out number them, and that isn&#39;t considering that some military units would most likely fight for the insurgents (national guard for instance).   </p>

<p>I’m not saying it would be a slam dunk, but we have a lot of veterans and armed individuals that would be better at using local terrain and insurgent networks than the US military.  </p>
