       Well it was, because the democrats rigged their primary so Killary would win. So you tell me what kind of choice we had.

       Now find out if those things were actually good for us or is it just Chinese farmer; cutting Medicare for the rich under the tax scam was terribly stupid.  Pollution matters. Recognizing Jerusalem only continues to fuel tensions. Honestly there are two sides to almost every story you just listed.

       Its funny how often this is asked.  I always say the same thing.  Cause she was the other candidate.  Its pretty simple really.
      </p>
      <p>
       And a candidate like Trump actually winning is more about Hillary than about Trump.  And the DNC did this.  And they are doing it again.  They need to shut the fuck up about Donald Trump, he is going to be president for the next 2 hears.  6 if they keep at this.  I have voted both sides mostly republican I aint voting for a candidate who just hates trump.  Has no plan no message and no reason to get elected other than to replace Trump.  Well at this point I will take the evil I know.

       That we should treat immigrants like human beings?

       Your platform is mexicans are rapists and murderers, that Muslims should be banned, that we should denaturalize and deport citizens because they are latino and that freedom of the press is bad.  They actually want to censor news that speaks truth to power.  They dont want people to question their actions or their motivations.  They refuse to be accountable to the rule of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isnt it your party that shouts down protestors by chanting USA USA and then becomes violent and drives cars into them, shoots into crowds, or begins beating up the elderly?  Isnt it your party that literally wore white supremacist logos, actual fascists, and badges and killed people in Charlottesville?  The left isnt all antifa and they are against fascism.  Thats why you call them antifa!  Abortions arent funded by the government either, they are an elective procedure up to the 24th week of pregnancy.  So you're the one trying to tell me we should mandate women to have children against their will, stripping them of any Constitutional right to freedom.  You need to re-evaluate your positions here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people are getting their power taken away from them by a packed judicial system that consistently rules against workers rights and for corporations.  You're President is expediting this process.  They've completely gutted the CPFB which is supposed to protect the people.  They've perverted the EPA to allow gross polluters to threaten the health of American citizens.  Theyve deregulated the same banking industry that nearly bankrupted American and stole everyones homes.  They've fought against wage increases in minimum wage hikes, theyve gutted healthcare reform and theyve taken away the ability for the people to file class action lawsuits.  They sued protestors, which is censorship, despite protest being protected under the first amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You still cannot tell me exactly what what the "hatred" is without listing a bunch of bullshit claims you lifted from a right wing echo chamber.

       Obama had pulled us out of the abyss.  Trump is now pushing us back towards it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left isnt in shambles or decimated, leaderless and floundering.  The right has abdicated their responsibility and turned a blind eye to unprecedented corruption and refuses to provide oversight.  Theyve put party over country and decided that the enemy is the other half of the country.  The left has always fought for civil rights, workers rights, the middle class, diplomacy instead of war and for expanding opportunity in American society.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're losing our power incrementally, and under Trump, its happening exponentially.  He's selling out the country to make a profit for himself and his business associates.

       I didnt copy and paste a single thing.  You're the one who couldnt provide an ounce of context and only stated what you're against, exactly like Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cant be bothered to provide context because you have no fucking clue why you believe what you do.  You're simply deciding to say the exact same things the President has.  I can literally provide an exact quote where Trump says NATO doesnt pay their bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinions come with context and explanations.  You cant even begin to tell me why you believe what you do.  Go ahead and leave thinking you win, you're the one that couldnt be bothered to form a reply because for some reason you're incapable of doing so.

       The Holy Spirit isn't leading me to debate your talking points at this current time as I have other responsibilities to attend to (I may return to do just that) ; but to convict your heart:
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to appeal to moral authority; but yet if there is No God, how can there be any form of binary reality? All things would just be subjective, but as much as you want to believe this, it is just not so.  Insomuch as; you can't even begin to believe what you think is true if there is no Truth.

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        31
       </strong>
       What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us,who can be against us?
       <strong>
        32
       </strong>
       He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
       <strong>
        33
       </strong>
       Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.
       <strong>
        34
       </strong>
       Who then is the one who condemns?No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
       <strong>
        35
       </strong>
       Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
       <strong>
        36
       </strong>
       As it is written:
      </p>
      <p>
       “For your sake we face death all day long;
       <br/>
       we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”[

       No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
       <strong>
        38
       </strong>
       For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[

       </strong>
       neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

       You cant address the actual topic you started here, saying the left has hateful views (thats a judgement by the way, without evidence), accused me of copy pasta and went about copying a bunch of bible verses because you couldnt form a rational reply of your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've lost here, you cant defend the things you say and quoting the bible doesnt give you any moral high ground when churches from multiple denominations condemn the actions you allegedly support.

       Antifa is not the left anymore than the KKK is the right.  They are antifascists, yet you called them fascists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was white supremacist supporters that actually killed people.  Then formed groups to hunt down and beat people who were black or jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the one making judgements about "the left" and saying they "only hate" yet cant back anything up.  A youtube video is not proof by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The policies of this administration are not Christian in any way, shape or form and they are being criticized by churches from multiple denominations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not debunking anything.  You're making wild claims you cant prove, statements of support that you cant even begin to tell us why you support them and making gross generalizations and judgements of people you cant back up.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do espouse your "beliefs" you just cant back up why you believe them.  That's not unique.   Thats you being part of a collective delusion because all you could do was repeat what Trump said.  Let me know when you can back your positions up in your own words, not the copy pasta of an opinion in the Washington Post that came after 2 pages of bible verses that had no context to the discussion you originally started.

       Yes I'm going to stop supporting the only president in my lifetime who has actually attempted to keep his campaign promises, because of a quote from a Hollywood produced TV show.

       Not that the current puppet in the Oval Office is a hero or anything more than the usual person that has sit there for the past decades.
