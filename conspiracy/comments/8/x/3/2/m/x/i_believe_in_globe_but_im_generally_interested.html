       No matter how far you're above ground, horizon is still at eye level. How is this explained? You can see it on Baumgartner video and amateur balloon videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       And gyroscopes. How is it possible that gyroscope stays level 24/7 even if we're orbiting sun, spinning along. Our solar system is orbiting the great attractor.

       The gyroscope is also orbiting spinning etc, it's only level within a certain frame of reference, that frame of reference being the earth.

       A gyroscope spins independant of the Earth; Gravity has no effect on it's spin/direction (But it does on it's mass).
      </p>
      <p>
       A gyroscope shouldn't stay motionless after hours of spinning, and thay's according to mainstream science.
      </p>
      <p>
       THe reason why they do is because the Earth
       <strong>
        is motionless
       </strong>
       . But they can always say the experiment is flawed (too much friction, gyroscope doesn't have free motion in the plane of rotation, whatevers) and point to a Foucault Pendulum in a illuminati controlled church/university near you!

       You believe in globe, but the fact that the horizon is
       <em>
        not

       Realizing the globe is a system of belief, just like the Flat Earth (although FE got some emperical science to back it up), already puts you further than most pleb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good job!
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no conclusive proof the Earth is flat (just like there ain't any proof it's a ball spinning through space #globedeception).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking for easy examples to illustrate issues with the heliocentric globe model:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Moon alledgedly causing tides makes no scientific sense, as it can be high tide (and low tide) on opposites of the "globe" at the same time. Hence, science is lying, the Moon doesn't cause the tides, or atleast not in a heliocentric fashion through the force of
         <em>
          gravity
         </em>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gravity vs Vacuum of space vs atmosphere.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Once you get a good understanding of the mechanics involved, there's no 2 ways about it: the scientific explanation for these things don't make sense; Although they never talk about this stuff in science class. "Gravity just makes the atmosphere stick to the ball Earth", no further questions asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Venus being visible past midnight on numerous occassions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a difference between trying to prove the Earth is flat and trying to prove it ain't a globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know for sure it's flat (altough visually it definitely appears so, including measurements with high precisions lasers), but it's definitely motionless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point to take away:
      </p>
      <p>
       The globe model is a luciferian lie. If you have a basic understanding of most sciences, eventually you'll realize this truth, and it's perhaps more important than the Earth being flat itself. (Which I still doubt, I'm an concave Earther)

       What's wrong with that? You could kinda simulate that. Have an iron sphere in a vacuum chamber, put some iron dust on that sphere. When you now go and create the vacuum in the chamber, the dust would be sucked out. Now magnetize the iron sphere and repeat. the dust would stay on the sphere. Sure, magnetism and gravity aren't exactly the same, but the observeable results are similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with the tides. You mean there can be high tide on both sides of the planet at the same time? Would be interesting...

      <p>
       The Moon and the Sun both cause tides on Earth. Gravitational tidal forces "squeeze" objects perpendicular to the force of attraction causing distortion on either end. This is why high tide occurs on opposite ends of the globe at the same time.

       Well lets agree to disagree then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im.not here to tell anyone what to believe; i wouldnt tell a Christian to stop believing in God, and I wont tell a globebeliever to stop believing the globe. If its not for you, its not for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, i know mah science (physics at uni), im not telling lies afaik, and if I am, im always more than willing to reconcider my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, theres no real need to. The globe falls apart in plenty of examples.

       Speculative isnt a science but I would be interested in both opinions.

       maybe we could even think of a test or two to verify them?

       Speculative isn't science, that's true. But Scientism isn't science either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream science:
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is pulling everything to the center of the globe Earth, that's why things "fall down".
      </p>
      <p>
       Speculative:
      </p>
      <p>
       A force (we can still call it gravity) is pushing, or pulling things towards the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big difference here being that mainstream science requires big G to exist (Which I doubt it does, further reading: Cavendish), whereas in speculation, we don't know the source of this force, we just know it pulls/pushes things towards the Earth. (down)

       Its going to require more than what you just wrote to dismantle gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can observe and model gravity interactions with extreme precision.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other mechanism can you theorize it is and can we think of a test to see if its works or not?

       Can you elaborate on this? If I understand you correctly, you support the idea that the Cavendish Experiment supports some sort of EM force rather than
       <em>
        G
       </em>
       ? Going off of another conversation I had with someone on this topic, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

       Gyroscopes do indeed sense rotation of the Earth. However, remember frame of reference and think of a plane flying. The coriolis effect and others are well known. Combined with accelerometers you can have a closed innertial navigation system without GPS. For basic gyroscopes like in phones it's simply caged when started and the effects you describe are too minute to have effects between caging.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't put it past current technology to realize when the gyroscope needs to be caged again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, we are not orbitting the great attractor. The peculiar velocity is less than apparent velocity. Constant velocity won't affect accelerometers and there is no rotation, hence no effect in either.

       I’ve had several answers to the gyroscope thing. All of them nonsense. Special scientific ones. Ones in planes adjusting (that makes no sense) the friction of crappy metals not accounting for the spin. Water ones ?  Etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact is gyroscopes are a bit of a smoking gun for me. But then the rotation of the stars around the southern pole is another for the globe earth. It’s a head spinner this one.

       Your first statement isn't correct.
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/horizon-level-liquid-test-jpg.27615/">
        Here
       </a>
       is a simple home made visualization. The problem with the videos you're citing is that you have no frame of reference for what "level" is. All you have is where the center of the frame is, but that's not proof of level, that's just where the camera is pointing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be careful with gyroscopes. They don't always
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty9QSiVC2g0">
        maintain their orientation
       </a>
       . You have to account for all forces acting on them, like the force the case they're in exerts on them to keep them from bouncing against their surroundings. When working with things like angular momentum, the moment of objects becomes much less intuitive, as you have to account for things like torque and angular momentum, not just regular linear forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would highly recommend a physics 101 course (102 usually goes more into magnetism).
       <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1/ap-torque-angular-momentum/angular-momentum-and-angular-impulse-ap/v/angular-momentum">
        Here
       </a>
       is a good introduction into angular momentum, but you may need to learn about things like dot and cross products to fully understand the details.
