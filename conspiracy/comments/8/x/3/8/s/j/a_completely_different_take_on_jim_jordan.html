        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-07-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/gambletillitsgone.html">gambletillitsgone</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>By now this sub should be completely familiar with the Jim Jordan story.  If not do a little research and come back to this post.  Here are the basics.</p>

<ul>
<li>Jordan grills IG Horowitz about Rosenstein hiding damning Strzok text messages pertaining to Russia Investigation.</li>
<li>Trump threw out Jordan&#39;s name as new potential speaker of the house.</li>
<li>Jordan(R) is up for reelection.</li>
<li>Shortly after Trump mentions Jordan as potential speaker of the house and Jordan grilling Rosenstein he is raked through coals regarding past sexual abuse happening within OSU Wrestling program when Jordan was Coach.</li>
<li>Jordan&#39;s Nephew dies in a car crash.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those on the right are quick to defend Jordan saying it&#39;s fake news and this backlash is led by ShareBlue as a coordinated shill campaign to character assassinate Jordan for his grilling of Horowitz and also because Trump mentioned him as speaker.</p>

<p>Those on the left are eating this story up without any regard for truth and they refuse to see the coincidence between negative stories breaking and timing of Horowitz questioning and Trump mentioning him as possible speaker of the house.</p>

<p>My Take</p>

<p>I think the Cabal has records on everyone.  I think the deep state has a dirt file on most politicians in order to keep them in line.  When they get out of line the cabal releases the dogs (Dirt and intel).  I think it is very possible the information / coordinated attack on Jordan is based in truth but was only made available after Jordan decided he wasnt gonna keep playing ball......</p>

<p>So who are the bigger criminals?  The ones who do the act or the ones that know of the act and use it as blackmail to keep people in line?</p>

<p>Just my take</p>

<p>Tell me if any other time you&#39;ve posted about child abuse you attacked the second degree of separation of the source? Like there are people directly corroborating the story and yet a big, very well established law firm having 2 high profile clients is really the focus? Absurd deflection.</p>

<p>Larkins Hall, the building that housed athletic teams, became such a well-known target that people who frequented it at the time have reminisced in anonymous postings online how easy it was to ogle naked members of the wrestling team.
The situation was so egregious that former wrestling head coach Russ Hellickson would at times have to physically drag the gawkers out of the building</p>
