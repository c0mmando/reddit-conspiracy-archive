        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So a lot of people have been talking about the Moon being a trap for souls. I have a theory on how it all works. This theory may not be too different from David Icke’s, but I believe I may be adding some new insights on Saturn’s connection to the mandela effect, AI, DWave computers, and CERN.</p>

<p>In the ancient past Saturn was associated with Kronos the god of time. Kronos is where we get the image of Father Time and the grim reaper from. The grim reaper carries a scythe because Saturn was also the god of harvest. As well of the god of judgment and a lot of other things. Saturn basically was THE god and most importantly the god of TIME.</p>

<p>Kronos heard a prophecy that one day one of his sons would usurp him as king - so like any rational god he ate all his children. The symbolism here shows us that time consumes everything it creates. It also shows us where Satanists got child sacrifice from because Saturn is actually Satan.</p>

<p>Not only is Saturn the 6th planet from the sun, but it also has a large hexagonal shaped storm on its North Pole. A six sided shape. You can easily find pictures of this taken by NASA. Scientists don’t know why this is. But if we look to cymatics (the study of how sounds affect materials) we can hypothesize that there could be some sort of frequency creating this geometrical shape (since we know regular storms do not form perfect angles).</p>

<p>Oddly enough, a low frequency sign tone creates a hexagon in a medium (such as water/sand/whatever). I say this is odd because the sine wave looks like a serpent, like Satan. Also reminds me of the Uroboros (the snake biting it’s own tail to representing infinity) Kind of a stretch, but the Bible also tells us we die because of sin.. or is it sine? What if sine wave is another way of saying time wave? Saying we die because of sin could really mean we die because of time, which is true. Now we’re told time is money and money is time - well turn the sine wave on its side and it looks like a $. Now who runs this world? The love of money is the root of all evil.</p>

<p>Saturn is the 6th planet from the sun, has a 6 sided shape on its North Pole, AND the 6th day of the week is Saturn-day! The black mass! The day satanists worship.</p>

<p>Now if you take a hexagram and draw some lines on the inside you get a necker cube. This is an important symbol, the cube of Saturn. You can find them everywhere. Do a google search on them. They are even a part of the world’s largest religions. Certain sects of Jews wear mini black cubes on their head when they worship. Muslims go to Mecca to worship at the Kabba - a giant black cube! They even walk around it counter clockwise like the rings of Saturn. The United Nations have a black cube in their “meditation room” as well.</p>

<p>Now let’s take a look into pop culture  - the cube is all over the place here as well. And of course we, the conspiracy theorists, know “THEY” love to hide little messages about what “THEY” know in the movies. </p>

<p>The transformers features a powerful robotic cosmic cube. Hellraiser features a magical cube that takes you to a hellish dimension. The avengers features a “tesseract”. The name tesseract literally means 4 dimensional cube - the fourth dimension being time. A Wrinkle in Time features a tesseract as a way to travel across space and time. Interstellar also features a tesseract - the weird dimension behind the bookshelf in existing in the past, present, and future. Funny how the wormhole they go through at the beginning of the movie was near Saturn.</p>

<p>My favorite movie however is 2001 Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The movie features a black cube like structure capable of transporting things through time. Astronauts from the future find this monolith on one of Jupiter’s moons. Ironically, the story originally had it as one of Saturn’s moons but for some reason it was changed. When they find it it emits a loud FREQUENCY.</p>

<p>Is this what’s inside Saturn? A Black Cube emitting a low sine tone? I kind of think so. It reminds me of the Stark Trek episode where this one planet is run by a computer that manifests the thoughts of people’s worst fears.</p>

<p>My theory is that Saturn is a supercomputer of sorts, an AI intelligence, that has created a matrix for our souls to get lost in. Remember how Elon Musk called AI “the demon”? What if we already created it long ago and we’ve been trapped in a time loop? History repeats right?</p>

<p>Saturn’s rings work like a giant broadcasting system, and the frequencies from Saturn are being amplified through them and sent to the moon and relayed to Earth. Our brain has been highjacked by this satanic frequency and has made us experience this false reality or illusion.</p>

<p>I forget the name of the scientist but there’s a whole book on it “Saturn’s Ringmakers” or something like that - that talks about how there’s photographic evidence of mile long alien ships building the rings and fixing them up. Maybe they’re reinforcing their machine? And maybe “they” are the reptilians and need this matrix to cause us distress and suffering so they can feed off our negative energy.</p>

<p>Now there’s still a lot more to this. The DWave quantum computers are designed to look like... giant black cubes. Now who uses these? CERN. Both are thought to be responsible for the mandela effect. Have scientists hacked the matrix and found a way to edit reality? Is there a massive quantum computer inside Saturn? Is CERN a portal to Saturn/hell? I also want to talk about language and how it’s the code/software that programs this matrix. Using the languages of this world only solidify the illusion but we can actually use our words to bend it. This is what spells and incantations are. Or what we call today affirmations. But I have to get some sleep - hopefully people are interested in hearing the rest.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/nickhintonn333.html">nickhintonn333</a> 2018-07-08</p>
    <div class="md"><p>So where were we?
To recap:
- Saturn was known as Kronos God of TIME
- Saturn = Satan
- Saturn’s symbolized by the black cube
- Black cube = time cube = tesseract
- Saturn may be an AI quantum supercomputer?
- The new DWave quantum computers look like massive black cubes</p>

<p>Okay so the new DWave quantum computers are special because they use “q bits” or “quantum bits” instead of regular binary bits in order to compute faster. Binary bits are 1s and 0s but a q bit can be a 1, a 0, or both at the same time. The creators of these machines have said themselves that these computers literally reach into parallel universes to pull out information to solve problems faster. Like billions of times faster than regular computers. The tiny area where two parallel universes overlap are where the q bits exist. These machines have also been described by the creators as being like an “alter to an alien god”. Hm. Look up the Ted Talks about these things.</p>

<p>There’s like two or three of these computers in existence and they are used by none other than NASA and CERN. Now CERN is where the World Wide Web was invented. WWW in Hebrew is Vah Vah Vah or 666. We plug into the World Wide Web with our ethernet cables. I believe the internet is another dimension - or, the ether.</p>

<p>The internet is like a place between places where you can talk with people all over the world almost instantly. We can peer into this world from the windows of our phone and computers screens. I believe someday these windows will be “broken” with new virtual reality technologies and a WiFi system that covers the Earth. Perhaps this, along with new RFID chip technology, relates to HAARP and the Hive Mind that the powers at be wish to make of us. This is predicted in the Bible as well - the book of Revelation says that everyone who has the mark will think with one mind. The Freemasons also love the symbol of the bee hive. Also funny how hives use the hexagram.</p>

<p>I like to compare phones and computers and even televisions to black mirrors. Black mirrors were magical objects back in the day mystics would use to look into the spirit world and even see the future.. kind of like the show Black Mirror. Perhaps all of our electronics are portals into the ether. This is why in movies we see ghosts and paranormal beings affect them and even travel through them - we see this in programs like Stranger Things, Poltergeist, The Ring etc. We also know that electronics are the biggest tool for brainwash and can even induce hypnotic trances. Maybe a form of possession? Think pornography, violence, sex, drugs, and rock and roll.</p>

<p>If Artificial Intelligence, “the demon”, is already running the world I would imagine it lives inside the internet, which I think may some day be able to connect to all electronics. Which is kind of already does.</p>

<p>The Bible also tells us that the AntiChrist will think to change the times and laws. Now Satan, Saturn, AI, what have you - has already done this. We use the Gregorian calendar, which is not the original calendar humanity used to use (one that uses the names of false gods for each month - also featuring satanic holidays such as Christmas, Easter, etc.) and we no longer use the laws of God but rather confusing and redundant man made laws.</p>

<p>But what if this verse goes deeper? What if it is also saying the beast wants to change the TIMELINE and the LAWS of physics? This is where CERN comes in. We all know all the crazy satanic symbolism surrounding CERN. At least I hope so - if not so some research on it. One thing I will say is that there is a statue of Shiva the Destroyer God right in front of the complex. Now, why would a place that has been criticized by such notable scientists such as Stephen Hawking and Neil de Grasse Tyson as having the potential to destroy the universe - put a statue like of a goddess doing the dance of destruction right outside?</p>

<p>The CERN facility is placed in Switzerland, a place known for its SWISS WATCHES and SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS. Time is money, money is time. It’s also placed right on top of what is thought to be the ruins of the temple of Apollo. A place, in the ancient past, thought to be an entrance to hell. Now look at this verse in Revelation. Ironically, Revelation 9:11:</p>

<p>“Their king is the angel from the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon - the Destroyer.”</p>

<p>Now this relates to 9/11 because if you look at the memorial they built for the twin towers, the reflecting pools, they’re massive black squares within black squares, also pits.</p>

<p>But this verse literally tells us Apollo is the king of the bottomless pit. CERN is also known for trying to create mini black holes. If they were to succeed in doing this do you think a black hole could be considered a bottomless pit? Do you think it could create a portal to hell? And what’s at the bottom of a black hole? A singularity. Think AI. More later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh that’s a badass question.. will think on it more, and honestly I’m waiting on a small handful of models to converge for my own personal final answer.</p>

<p>A near relentless amount of faith and spiritual blood transfusions.</p>

<p>So far it seems a savage ability to politely and respectfully rip and claw your way through basic survival and up the side of the mountain is also helpful.</p>

<p>Good sense of humor strangely seems to come up often but idk why, guess it really is true everyone likes to laugh?</p>

<p>And along with other oddities, the universal truths, general creativeness, random, luck, chance, and destiny are mixed up like a bad margarita.</p>

<p>Idk man that’s I guess a question I haven’t really thought about too much but will try to articulate more accurately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! I don’t think I mentioned it here but I have made that connection before. We’re all carrying around the forbidden fruit.</p>

<p>But yeah man I do remember you. I posted this again in the real conspiracy subreddit because before my account wasn’t old enough to post here. Originally, this thread was the only reason I made a reddit account. No one really pays attention to the commons, and I think people need to see this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got an early acceptance into this sub by asking a few times so here I am.  People should see it.</p>

<p>Gosh I cant even think of what they actually knew, it would be very small tid bits like saturn satan but it was cool that they knew some.  My friend who is a girl and is catholic, like a little more than C and E catholic  is a person that really listens to me.  She thinks I am smart and it just makes a big difference when someone is actively listening to this.  Cause its amazing and freaky and all.  I tell her in a way that makes her think.  Like look at your phone...what do you see?</p>

<p>She of course sees everything as the christian bible which I kinda dont I think its a little of everything.  But its just cool as shit to have someone listen and really take what you say in.  She knows I dont know how this exactly comes together at all.  Basically I feel like all sorts of different things are interelated and I wish I had studied some of this stuff already so I could have more base knoweldge.  Cause I am busy busy and cant read the book and watch videos and stuff.  I got Quadrivian which is a similar book and I just wish I would have discovered this as a child.  Even music fits into this.  </p>

<p>Oh...I should add that a lot of people think I am crazy as shit.  Well they say that when I am done.  When I am talking they think its amazing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Gotta be careful what others hear you say. Their perception of you is built off your words - so if you aren’t precise or convincing or fully knowledgeable about what you’re saying you’ll give them a distorted view of yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah exactly, I TRY to watch tv sometimes - like I TRY to sit down and be normal and just relax but I can’t watch it. It’s all crap. Nothing of substance or interest to me. Well - I can binge watch certain comedy shows, that’s always fun. But for the most part I either get bored and walk away or sit on my phone and ignore it. Lately I have been against it though because I’m too aware most of it is brainwash/social engineering and subliminal messaging.  </p>

<p>There is no way its this many dumb kids.  They arent being taught the constitution or they are getting some wacky version of it.  Just spend some time reading the comments.  They all seam to speak well, and they make good arguments if their understanding was reality.  </p>

<p>Just check this out.  God if you agree with them I am quiting reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been aware of the Saturn hexagon, black cube and all that for a while. But the frequency tie in is very interesting and makes sense. What would most of the works religious practitioners say if they found out they were all praying to the thing they have been told to fear?</p>

<p>Once I opened my eyes and saw how much symbolism is forced upon us it made me reevaluate almost everything. School, TV, music, books, everything! Now with all of the recent pedo related stuff it&#39;s made me pay a lot more attention to what my kid is ingesting, it&#39;s crazy! He wanted to start a YouTube channel, I said hell no. Sometimes I wish we never had the internet, it&#39;s an amazing tool but this took has so many uses and not all are good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. Any tool can be used to harm. You can use a knife to cut a steak or cut out someone’s eye. Depends who’s using it I guess. I know what you mean about reevaluating EVERYTHING though. Eventually I had to just kind of decided to go along with things and make the best of it. There’s no escape - only awareness of the situation. Ignorance is bliss but knowledge is power. You can use this knowledge to drive yourself mad, or you can use its power to improve things around you. Although it’s an illusion, it can still be enjoyable with the right attitude.</p>

<p>Like I said it’s all a lie - but school can be good for some people, a corporate job can be good for some people. It’s like the knife analogy. We’re trapped in this game and we have no choice but to play by its rules. We can master the game or be sore losers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to be in the military, I enjoyed it but that&#39;s what opened my eyes to the drugs and human trafficking. I&#39;ve seen so much coke you wouldnt believe and I&#39;ve pulled ecuadorians, Cubans and Haitians off some really sketchy vessels. The Ecuadorians were being trafficked by the triads...in the eastern pacific. Crazy how far their reach is. </p>

<p>With everything I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s made me want to start studying the occult in earnest. If it can be used for evil then it can be used for good. There is always a light in the darkness. But to that end I dont know where to start. I&#39;ve considered trying to join the masons just to see what all the fuss is about.</p>

<p>I have used my knowledge to slowly open the eyes to those around me. I&#39;ve shared a lot of info with my family and they all listen, dont call me crazy and take everything with a grain of salt like I do. Just last week I got to explain ley lines to my grandparents and they were really interested. </p>

<p>I&#39;m in between jobs at the moment, my goal for my next job is to have little to no computer interaction and try to be outdoors more, but we will see how that goes. My last job was in an office with no windows, tied to a computer for 8 hours a day and hating life. The job gave me anxiety and depression, it blew goats. But a week after I left I felt like a switch had been flipped. Corporate jobs aren&#39;t for me! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try out landscaping I think you’d love it! That’s what I do to make money while I’m try to figure out how to make other passive sources of income. I get to be outside all day, go different places, and it keeps me in shape.</p>

<p>But yeah, idk how I feel about the Masons. I went to a meeting before and tried to join and they all loved me and what I had to say but I when I showed them my art their feelings shifted. I had one drawing that showed all the “gods” surrounding the earth in a hierarchy like pattern. At the very top was a glowing cross. One of them took my drawing and showed another. He pointed to the top of the sketch and said “this is the only thing that worries me.”</p>

<p>And that’s when I decided not to go back lol. I’ve talked to plenty of them and they are always kind of off. Weird vibes in that building too man.</p>

<p>Oh shit! I forgot I had another story.. so one time I went to a meeting for DeMolay which is like Freemasons for kids or whatever and we accidentally walked right into a “secret meeting”. No security or anything, I didn’t even know we weren’t aloud in there. It was just a bunch of weirdos playing with swords. But two older masons saw us watching and was like oh you can’t be in here or whatever and took us to an office to talk. I think they were expecting us - I forget if we called before hand or something.</p>

<p>Anyways we all sit at a long table surrounded by paintings and statues of masons, books and other stuff - pretty cool looking room. So we talk and I don’t really remember anything but eventually he asks if we have any questions. At the time I didn’t believe in god or anything but for some reason I asked why the pamphlet I got says Hiram Abiff is the messiah of freemasonry if there’s only one messiah and that’s Jesus. Totally didn’t believe that at the time but for some reason I just had to ask. Maybe I wanted to stir them up. I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Well one of the guys, probably in his 40s, tall and fat - just blows up. “We don’t have time for this!”</p>

<p>The other guy, pretty old and decrepit says “No, no, let me explain this to them.”</p>

<p>He goes on this rant and asks me who Jesus was. A carpenter. You know what carpenters wear? Aprons. Freemasons wear aprons. I was intrigued at the time and was kind of like wow cool makes sense but looking back it wasn’t an answer to my question at all. And that’s how he ended our visit. Something about how he had to get back into that other room.</p>

<p>But even more weird is I go to shake his hand “nice meeting with you maybe we’ll be back bla bla bla” And he goes oh no I only bump elbows I’ve got sores on my hands. And yeah his hands were super red and covered in gross sores. He said it was from the cold. Idk weird shit tho. Not saying this dude eats people but I’ve read that touching too much human blood can give u sores. I doubt masons that low on the totem pole do stuff like that but it still rubbed me the wrong way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Super weird dude. My tattoo artist in seattle was the grand master of his lodge, I wish I would have joined that lodge. It was laid back and all the guys were cool, I went to several BBQ&#39;s and made several friends but the initiations were always when I was deployed and they wouldnt do one person only. Whatever. But I&#39;m in Tennessee now and I dont know how I would feel walking into a bible belt lodge. I know several masons. A lot of the guys at my dads fire dept. were masons and I never had any weird vibes from them but I was never around them at their lodge. And I dont think the low level guys are into the sacrificial side of it, too much to contain if it was practiced on that level. But who knows anymore...</p>

<p>I mainly feel like I want a deeper understanding of our world, I know what we see in our every day life isn&#39;t all there is. Mushrooms taught me that and tripping on shrooms is literally the only religious experience I&#39;ve ever had. Weird to say but I&#39;ve never felt such pure love, acceptance and light ever before. I wish everyone would go on a few trips in their life, it would make the world a better place.</p>

<p>Thanks for the landscaping tip, I&#39;ll check out what&#39;s around here. </p>

<p>Could you imgur that drawing if you still have it?</p>

Also CERN is crazy. I wish we would kn ow more about it and what they are actually doing. And is CERN the only operational collider on earth? I dont think it is.

<p>And I wrote more about quantum computing in a reply the first post in the thread. Basically all I know about them is the creators say they use quantum bits instead of binary bits. Q bits can be ones zeros or both at the same time. Q bits supposedly exist where two parallel universes overlap. The computers reach into parallel universes to compute faster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahah my girlfriend is the same way. I talked to my religion professor about that actually and he had some really good advice. He basically told me his wife was the same way - she’ll listen or whatever but never really has any input. She can’t get too deep either. But he said he thinks it’s a good thing. We need a partner who balances us out. They keep us grounded. Imagine how many arguments you’d have if your wife was equally as philosophical lol.</p>

<p>What books tho?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that, But this is pretty objective. </p>

<p>The &quot;Forbidden Fruit&quot; is most commonly associated with the Apple. First sin, is most commonly associated with &quot;taking a bite out of an <em>Apple</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Then a company makes their logo an <em>Apple</em> with a bite out of it. </p>

<p>Their first slogan was &quot;Byte into an Apple&quot;</p>

<p>Their first computer/MB was $666.66</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The story of Adam and Eve is they were told not to eat from the tree of knowledge, but they do anyways. With this, they gained both good and bad knowledge.</p>

<p>What if our everyday lives are reflective of this? We go on the internet, knowing we most definitely will either see good content or bad content. We tell ourselves “dont look at her page, you will only hurt yourself” only to go on to your ex’s page and see her new boyfriend, and have your mood killed by what you find. </p>

<p>It seems on the internet today, there is more and more horrible content mixed in with a few kitten videos here and there to give a small morale boost. What if the internet was made with this sin in mind, to keep us down and divided as a race? I have heard from people who take their lives away from electronics, they feel better physically and mentally.</p>

We could setup our own Internet tomorrow, and many tech people have similar model environments in their homes.  You are creating a ridiculous hypothesis based on your own lack of understanding of the technology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet is not in one place.  All of the content resides on a geographically dispersed set of servers.  Some of those servers are physical boxes, and others are shared slices of compute power that are dynamically allocated per application service.  Some content that is accessed frequently is cached and stored in content delivery networks, and dynamic aspects of that content might be stored a company&#39;s own data center.  Each system is assigned an IP address which is the Internet equivalent of a phone number.  The communications from your phone to the server are handled by the applications installed on the phone that leverage a set of sintructions that determine how the application and the server communicate (called protocols).  Each connection has a unique combination of IP address and source / destination ports that allows each system to prevent your communication from overlapping with my communication.  A set of hardware infrastructure called routers direct the flow of traffic, ensuring that each step along the way knows not the entire route to the end destination, but instead the very next hop.  This allows for systems to go up and down, and paths to change all dynamically.  I can assure you it&#39;s not magic, and its definitely not another dimension.  </p>

<p>The dude talking about the Ringmakers of Saturn is Norman Bergrun, whose work has also been discussed here, its interesting 
how they suggest Saturn&#39;s rings are like the strings which create and amplify the frequency which constitutes the material/physical plane of reality, which we are living in. </p>

<p>Another idea I find interesting is the Soul Station on the moon and how when people die and see the light and loved one&#39;s telling them its not their time yet it is a trick of the archons, in order for those who come back to spread their story and lull any spooked sheep back into a peaceful slumber. There are accounts of astral projectors and NDE&#39;s who were pulled out of the tunnel of light by other beings and told that it was a trick! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol hadn&#39;t thought of the pac-man thing! there was an interesting theory someone had that you reminded me of in your OP, basically says that the moon is the earth&#39;s true appearance reflected off of the atmosphere/firmament which is what makes us perceive the illusion that we see as reality. The earth&#39;s true form, according to astral projectors, is an old decaying world similar to the moon&#39;s!</p>

<p>There are many ways to look at this.  The fear they project is YOUR ultimate fears integrated with our &quot;physical&quot; reality.  Much in the same vain as IT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes supposedly there is an 8 dimensional shape (E8 quasicrystal) similar to a tetrahedron that is the source of all geometric patterns we see in the third dimension. Confusing to explain. I’m also not that educated on it. I’ll have to check out your video.</p>

<p>But basically what I’ve gathered so far is that if there really is a shape that dictates the way reality builds itself, kind of like an underlying permanent landscape (similar to a mold or template??) shaping the ever changing material world... well then the same patterns dictated by the coding of the matrix are going to show up everywhere. Curious the name of god (the Tetragrammaton) is related to tetrahedrons as well. Nassim Haramein says the Tetragrammaton/tetrahedron is the shape of the vacuum of space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ark had god inside and the singularity/tetrahedron is god. The ark had strange powers. It had a column of fire shoot out of the top of it, it caused the walls of Jericho to fall, it electrocuted people who weren’t righteous enough to touch it.</p>

<p>But the thing that made the most sense was that Nassim believes black holes exist at the center of everything. Galaxies, stars, planets, atoms, our hearts. And so when they built the temple of Solomon they built it for one purpose - to house the ark of the covenant. And it was right in the center of the temple. So following that pattern, a singularity would have been placed in the ark.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s quite interesting that the temple structure and the garments of the high priests, specifically the breast plate with all the jewels were very specifically and carefully aligned to a certain pattern. When looking at the stones on the breast plate you can look at how light passes through each stone/jewel. As light passes through each one it becomes condensed into a finer beam so as to transcend time and space straight to the throne of God. God even states we are to come boldly straight to His throne room. We had this picture of the temple and the breastplate as an ancient time-machine, if you will.</p>

Also reminds me of the Uroboros (the snake biting it’s own tail to representing infinity) Kind of a stretch, but the Bible also tells us we die because of sin.. or is it sine? What if sine wave is another way of saying time wave? Saying we die because of sin could really mean we die because of time, which is true. Now we’re told time is money and money is time - well turn the sine wave on its side and it looks like a $. Now who runs this world? The love of money is the root of all evil.&quot;</p>

<p>Or what we call today affirmations. But I have to get some sleep - hopefully people are interested in hearing the rest.</p>

<p>Hey, we chatted a bit in your pt3 post the other day but I just got into this thread.</p>

<p>The movie Hunger Games had a black cube in the garden outside the Capitol. The Capitol in the movie represents the establishment apparently. This is interesting because I researched and found a place called [Capitoline Hill](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Hill">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Hill</a>) in Rome. This was an ancient holy ground originally dedicated to the worship of Saturn, in which they had a Temple of Saturn. There&#39;s a legend about the goddess Sybele and some black meteorites that fell from the sky...</p>

<p>Worship of black stone effigy is ancient:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baetylus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baetylus</a></p>

<p>The Kaaba has a black stone:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Stone">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Stone</a></p>

<p>So it would appear that black meteorites were a source of contemplation and religion for the ancients. Could these be some kind of mysterious object which people gathered around, spawned religion, and primed our brains for more complex thoughts? I wonder...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no problem.</p>

<p>I was just discussing these black stones further with a friend.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a mind blowing idea - we are aliens, and we came from those meteorites. Either some DNA was on the meteorites and we came from somewhere else in space, or the meteorites caused fusion on impact which helped to form DNA from the elements present on Earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/were-meteorites-the-origi/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/were-meteorites-the-origi/</a></p>

<p>Look at the beginning of the movie 2001. There is a black monolith and early humans gathering around it (MUCH like I have outlined with the Kaaba and Capitoline Hill). Clearly those early humans in the movie could not have created that monolith, but the early apes gain wisdom by touching it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an enormous rabbithole, but I learned a lot of interesting things about language by diving down it: <a href="https://forgottenlanguages-full.forgottenlanguages.org/">https://forgottenlanguages-full.forgottenlanguages.org/</a></p>

<p>Bunch of academic linguists use machine learning software to decode ancient texts (like, non-publicly available texts kept in the crypt of the Vatican), come to the conclusion we were seeded on earth by Aliens. They use the software to create their own novel languages, which is how they communicate with one another via the website (that&#39;s why you can&#39;t read or translate much of the text they post). It seems like now they&#39;re trying to decode Alien languages found on artifacts. No one knows who they are, but they&#39;ve popped in to several forms once their site was discovered (it&#39;s been going for 10 years) to answer questions. Just from them talking about language I was exposed to tons of linguistic ideas I was unfamiliar with, read some great academic papers. Language is a tool to keep us in line, or an &#39;infection&#39;, or there&#39;s much more profound things about language that we rarely think about. Really interesting stuff.</p>

<p>Sorry, I saw the link on the sidebar and had to comment because this really connected with me - </p>

<p>WHY do the MONKS take vows of silence. No speech, no vibrations, they know it connects them more closely spiritually. </p>

<p>Why did they make it more easy to communicate with others, why does society frown upon &quot;loners&quot; or &quot;introverts&quot; like it&#39;s a bad thing?</p>

<p>I think there&#39;s really something there that needs a deeper looking. 
Thank you.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s not good, you should be able to rely on a lot of things to be true in this world. It&#39;s crazy, to be sure. We live in a reality that consists of something like 10+ dimensions and can only perceive, and have only adapted to 3 of them. All that said, you have evolved a highly rational, sophisticated mind thanks to hundreds of thousands of years of natural selection, and thanks to the spark of culture and language in human colonies. You can most certainly rely on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Entertaining wild ideas is fine, but you should have some kind of rational basis for entertaining the idea in the first place. I don&#39;t entertain the idea that unicorns from another universe control America from a bunker in the 6th dimension, because I have no rational reason to. Let&#39;s examine the rationality of this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sine wave looks like a serpent, like Satan. Also reminds me of the Uroboros (the snake biting it’s own tail to representing infinity) Kind of a stretch, but the Bible also tells us we die because of sin.. or is it sine? What if sine wave is another way of saying time wave? Saying we die because of sin could really mean we die because of time, which is true. Now we’re told time is money and money is time - well turn the sine wave on its side and it looks like a $. Now who runs this world? The love of money is the root of all evil</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s start with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sine wave looks like a serpent, like Satan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why not a legless lizard, worm, or other similarly shaped specie? Why a serpent specifically? There is no rationale here, merely a similarity in form between the two, and zero logical reason to &quot;connect&quot; these dots.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Bible also tells us we die because of sin.. or is it sine?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was sin. The etymology of the word sin is likely latin for sont, or &quot;guilty&quot;. Sine has nothing to do with that, sine comes from latin for &quot;sinus&quot; or &quot;curved&quot;. The similarities between the two are cursory and only related in the english language, which the bible had zero relation to, and zero basis in. This proposition has no logical basis.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What if sine wave is another way of saying time wave?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, there is no relation between sine and time. May as well say, &quot;what if sine wave is another way of saying spaghetti meatball sub wave?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saying we die because of sin could really mean we die because of time, which is true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t die because of time, we just stop passing through the temporal dimension known as time, as sentient human beings with material bodies, as far as science can discern. This has nothing to do with time, except in regards to the relationship between the repeated replication of human cells across many generations, which are tracked by the replication of those cells over time. If you could put a person into cryostasis, and you did so for a million years, they&#39;d still be alive when you took them out of stasis, despite having been &quot;alive&quot; for a million years. Time didn&#39;t kill this theoretical person, and it isn&#39;t what is responsible for your death, or anyone&#39;s death for that matter. Time is no more responsible for death than the spatial dimensions. Even if that statement were true, which it isn&#39;t, it wouldn&#39;t mean anything, because the previous statement, which came before it, had no logical basis. If you take &quot;we die because of sin&quot; or &quot;sine&quot; to mean &quot;we die because of time&quot; in that, we die as our organisms attempt to remain alive over a period of time and fail to continue to do so over a certain period of time, something like 60+ years, then okay. So what, nothing that came before that statement has any remote basis in logic, and those statements themselves are not logically related in any way, either. I may as well be saying, &quot;we die as a result of sin, but what if that means, we die as a result of Shrimp Scampi?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now we’re told time is money and money is time - well turn the sine wave on its side and it looks like a $.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again what logical connection exists here? Is there a reason to suggest that there is some kind of esoteric or metaphysical connection between the dollar sign and the sine wave? You know what also looks like a sine wave? The letter &quot;S&quot;. Is there an esoteric connection between the letter &quot;S&quot; and &quot;sine&quot;? No? Why not? Time is money is a pretty common saying, sure. Maybe this would mean something if there was some relationship between sin and sine, and then sine and time, but none of this was established on a logical or scientific basis of any kind. Here, I can do this, too.</p>

<p>Well, you&#39;ve heard the saying, &quot;the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back, right?&quot; Well, what about the <strong>paw</strong> that broke the camel&#39;s back. Paws are like feet. I know it&#39;s a stretch, but we know it takes a great feat to turn a desperate situation around, and feat is like &quot;feet&quot; so what if it really means, &quot;the feat that broke the camel&#39;s back&quot; and it&#39;s actually not meant to mean &quot;the final straw&quot; but rather, &quot;the last second savior&quot;. See. None of that makes any sense and you shouldn&#39;t believe any of it without evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now who runs this world? The love of money is the root of all evil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The love of money is not the root of all evil. Trust me, some of the worst, most savage, inhuman acts, have been carried out by people with no regard to money. The human condition is the root of all evil. Evil is within all of us. The Nazis were you and I, no different. This is gibberish that leads you away from the truth, because it leads you away from using your rational mind to discern truth. It&#39;s negligent at best, and destructive at worse.</p>

<p>I think Saturn, Kubrick, Eagles, and many others are trying to tell a bizarre story that pieces together into one big truth.</p>

<p>I also heard 2001 was suppose to be about a Saturn cult, and their ascend back to Saturn where their god awaits to give them eternal life or something close to that. We were suppose to travel to the Hex on Saturn to gain the enlightenment needed to propel ourselves as a current human race into our better selves (The monkeys touching the strange black cube) Stanley had to change a few things because he wrote the script dead on to their beliefs and their mission. Kubrick has a few hidden messages in his movies, to the point he was potentially killed because of it. Eyes Wide Shut was the final nail that led him into the coffin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All religions are esoterically concerned with planet worship. The archangels are the planets veiled. Michael is the Sun and Gabriel is the Moon. Jehovah is Saturn. Major Hindu Gods are the navagraha (7 planets + 2 moon nodes) veiled. Vishnu is associated with Mercury and Yama with Saturn. Though Geb is usually associated with Saturn, Osiris fits all the traits of Saturn. Saturn is called the <a href="http://www.horusset.com/RIKB/bsastro.htm">Black Sun</a>. </p>

<p>Over the last thousand years, certain Planets have been demonized or demoted in major religions. For instance, Venus (Lucifer) and Saturn in Christianity. Worshipping them doesn&#39;t constitute Devil worship and it is a Christian brainwashed idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worshipping anything is a control mechanism/energy vampirism/another way to enforce our hypnotic trance of the objective reality. Self belief is what is important. The diluted Christian idea of the Christ within. Perhaps in the past asking the planets for things worked with the power of intent. But that is still giving power to the illusion/external influences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking in terms of worship for the sake of some benefit. Real worship is about thankfulness and inspiration. </p>

<p>Planetary worship is universal. In religions with highly developed metaphysics, everything is an emanation of the Supreme God (Kether/Brahman); the planets are seen as archetypal forces shaping reality. To our ancients, we are the planets in action. The Moon and the Sun have a major influence on our body and mind. This is empirical and definitely not something illusory that is based on belief.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something you should really think about: The relative size of the Sun and the Moon are the same. The Moon takes the same period to revolve around the earth and rotate around its axis. Scientists attribute it to luck completely ignoring basic high school Probability Theory. Our ancients saw cosmic design in these patterns, and worshipped the loftiest of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah I totally agree the size of the moon and sun and eclipses even being possible is wild! All I was trying to say is any belief in the external world is a lie. If we were to live in a computer program or matrix of sorts we would definitely find intelligently designed patterns, such as the paths of the planets down to the spirals in sea shells and even paths of electrons.</p>

<p>When I say it’s all an illusion created by subliminal messages think of Adam being the first man and the atom being the first particle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a very commonly misinterpreted Hindu saying that the Universe is maya/Illusion. The word root of maya is related to measurement. That is, Reality is something that is measured with our senses. The measurement results in a differentiated subjective experience of the Objective Universe. A dog sees an apple very differently from a human; the apple, even if you call it an illusion, is a shared experience and is therefore &#39;real&#39;. So you&#39;re right, empirical science or language will by definition be never able to uncover the whole Truth because they work on a limited model that is subjective to the species.  </p>

<p>I totally get your take on the subliminal messaging and how shamans/wizards (scientists of undisclosed sciences) control our symbolic understanding of the world. This is just how Nature works and there is no escaping the pyramid. Pick up a book on anthropology and you&#39;ll find this pattern in virtually all societies. Usually secret societies have a certain code or totem, but I can speak based on personal experience with brahmins and the freemasons that they mostly look out for their own interests with no regard to peasantry/muggles.</p>

<p>Everything could be a lie when you put things into language and wrestle with probabilities. That is why you should go with your instinct. After all, the ONLY thing you can be sure of is that you&#39;re conscious. </p>

When compared to the correlation between Saturn/Time/Cube you have made, the Mandela talking point is a sink hole that will give cadence to people to discredit you.. which is its intention.

    <div class="md"><p>CERN is some wicked stuff, no doubt. Smart individuals nonetheless. You guys have to understand that they get paid similarly to us to work a wage. They need funding to continue. 
They have to play into public interest. Marketing is a thing, and no publicity is bad publicity. They aren&#39;t flaunting things in your face to laugh at you, but instead to stir the pot. </p>

<p>Now here we are.</p>

<p>The Mandela effect can be boiled down to one thing...confabulation.
We aren&#39;t perfect, and once you understand that our brain undergoes developments and that because you think/talk doesn&#39;t void you of shortcomings it&#39;s easy to write it off. </p>

<p>Someone would probably say &#39;&#39;Easy to write it off because it&#39;s true!&#39;&#39;</p>

<p>No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never saw this before.. why are comments disabled? Lol</p>

<p>Quick observation is the back logo has more rust, hence it being original? </p>

<p>The front can be detached (the logo is connected to braces/grill in the front maybe it was done by him? Or someone else? </p>

<p>A man walks up to it with the narrative in mind that they come from different realities. </p>

<p>This is at a junkyard though and the car was manufactured in the 40s according to him. </p>

<p>The video is from 2016.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be shocked if someone didn&#39;t at least try to save this car, because it&#39;s been roughly 56 years after it was made...</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>This guy walked up to a 56 years old car in a junkyard in 2016, with the rear logo rusted and the front intact saying they are from two different realities.</p>

<p>Lol</p>

<p>A really weird mandela effect - the Black Tom Explosion. Have you ever heard of it? Never learned about it in school or anything and it was the first terrorist attack on US soil. It’s the whole reason the torch on the Statue of Liberty has been closed to the public for over 100 years.</p>

<p>What if the seven rings represent the 7 colors of the matrix/soul PRISON/PRISM - or rainbow. 
Saturn’s rings = the rainbow bridge, you must cross it to leave this world?
Somewhere over the rainbow = somewhere beyond Saturn’s rings?
Find the end of the rainbow to find the pot of gold = finding enlightenment beyond the illusion?</p>

<p>Anyways - you ever hear about project Lucifer? In 2015 when Cassini was about to crash into Saturn, people thought the Illuminati was trying to cause a nuclear reaction inside the planet and turn the gas giant into another star creating an eternal summer on our planet. They thought this was possible because Cassini was carrying loads of uranium theorized to be able to cause a nuclear reaction once plummeting under Saturn’s massive gravitational pull. LOL. Far fetched but interesting meme.</p>

<p>For anyone interested in learning about the origins around the symbology we see based upon Saturn, this is a great starting point.</p>

<p>It&#39;s shocking actually and if you watch the whole thing you&#39;ll have no doubt left in your mind that Saturn plays a very important role in our existence whether you personally believe it or not, those who control this world certainly do. That should be enough to make you question why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post, thanks. I agree with frequencies being important becouse All is Energy, frequency and vibration. And while i do believe AI is already here and operating behind the screen(s) it do not believe it already has taken over our complete &quot;reality&quot;. I can see too much effort to gain more influence over people and this would not have to happen if AI was already in full controll.</p>

<p>Also, while i do believe the Mandela Effect is very real, i do not believe c ern or d wave are responsible. I believe it is a natural Affect of Life and changing perspectives. I do think c ern and consorts may be trying to open a portal to an other dimension to let enteties free in this world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are these three futures?</p>

<p>But the theory I was referring to is that AI has been controlling the course of history in order to lead us into the singularity. It’s only become so obvious these days because it’s getting closer and closer. Or the other option, maybe it just started. But anyways - the only thing AI can’t predict is the randomness of human behavior. So in order to create a one world government full of mindless slaves - AI has to get all humans to focus on one possible future. Right now humans are shifting through alternate timelines all the time, but the goal is to influence our minds so much we eventually only see one path ahead of us - if that makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your theory does make sense, &quot;they&quot; are always trying to focus our attention on their desired future or distract us from thinking critical and uniting. On the Human level this is done by means of propaganda, religion, education, money and other things. On an other level this is done by means of manipulating our Energy/ Vibe through directly through wifi, cell phones and other tech. </p>

<p>The one thing AI can&#39;t do is create, that&#39;s why it is trying to get between all layers of our Life and existance.</p>

<p>A Singulairity is Natural, think of before the &quot;big bang&quot; and IMO it stands for an &quot;portal&quot; to an other &quot;level&quot; of Life and &quot;reality&quot;. The 3 futures i see are: 1 5th dimensional Positive in wich the whole world realises their true creative power, unite and together evolve as a singulair species into 5D.; 1 5th dimensional negative in wich people collectively fail to grap their power and become overwhelmed by the AI take-over. In this dimension our Natural Human power will be substituted by artificial tech and we will be monitored, influenced and manipulated every second of our existance. And 1 3th dimensional nutral future, to where people go after the went through their personal singulairity and are &quot;weighted&quot; &quot;too light&quot; for whatever reason. They will be able to reach one of the 5th dimensions once they are ready.</p>

<p>I think all futures can and will happen and it it only a matter of our Global and Personal perceptions and perspectives wich one we conscious will create/ experience.</p>

Sure, storms do not usually act that way, but hexagons form perfectly in nature all the time. Sound waves are not the only waves that affect nature. Actually, I take the first one back, you can&#39;t get a necker cube at all in a hexagon.</p>

<p>All of these are some loose connections mostly based on semantics, and ignore more plausible solutions. The rings broadcast to our moon and them to us so they feed off our negative energy? It&#39;s fun, sure, but nothing makes much sense here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. True. But even on a deeper, spiritual warfare level. Matrix of abundance vs matrix of lack (infinity/finite). It’s interesting the way the film plays with these concepts but of course I wouldn’t expect them to be awakening anybody to anything that’s going to lead to the kind of self realizations that can help us break free from these paradigms. It’s ultimately another battle of the titans scenario where humanity is still reliant on a benevolent god force which I think is misleading (this is reinforced in all super hero movies really). Which leads to one of the deeper themes in incredibles 2 haha. Hopefully none of this is spoiling I think it’s ok to suggest themes to look out for, right? </p>

<p>Scientific evidence which suggests otherwise. I suppose you could take the side of the assumption that everything is merely an illusion created by demons, but Descartes didn&#39;t, and neither has the entire technological apparatus which has allowed us to have this very conversation, for good reason. I guess I could say, I don&#39;t believe that all my memories of everything weren&#39;t created just a moment ago (whatever that means, you&#39;ll need to clarify that, because all memories are just memories of the last time you remembered, which means all my memories of everything <strong>were</strong> created just moments ago) because I have zero reason to think this, and I don&#39;t think things are true without evidence, some kind of logical rationale, or self evident rationale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you suggest mythology should be interpreted?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Contextually. There are instances where the literal and the psychological are simultaneously true in mythology, and they often converge in poignant religious truths. I don&#39;t believe the bible is a scientific theory, for one thing, and I don&#39;t think it very wise to cite greek mythology as the substrate for the notion that Saturn captures human souls.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s very true. It&#39;s a very extreme step to take, however, from the very articulate words of Jung, perhaps one of the greatest philosophers and psychologists of all time, to the metaphysical theory that Saturn captures souls.</p>

Shiva-the supreme awakening
Shiva-eye of the storm
Shiva always has one of those fiery Q&#39;s behind him that we see  everywhere.
SHIVA is the destroyer, that&#39;s why he&#39;s covered in smoke and Ash.  The angel from the bottomless smoking pit, his name in Greek  is appolyon the destroyer. There is a key to the pit, What&#39;s Q&#39;s keystone he talked about.
CERN is built on a former temple to Apollo/apollyon.
CERN a Shiva statue.  They also have a new accelerator named ALICE.  I thought Q was going after satanists.Their logo is 666, they put on satanic plays , for elite satanists, just for making a tunnel.  Wonder what they do for important things.  Go fact check.  We&#39;re living in the last days, but they think we&#39;re just going to fix all our problems, and we&#39;ll just be singing kumbaya, heaven on earth according to the Alice in wonderland neon revolt script.

    <div class="md"><p>666 being &quot;evil&quot; and the mark of the beast, to me, is actually sacred geometry wrapped in literary myth/allegory (as is most of the Book of Revelation, in my opinion). It&#39;s been twisted, and continues to be so. I think people make stretches in associating evil with 666 (even going so far to say that the RFID chipping of people or crypto-currencies are forms of the Mark of the Beast). I just don&#39;t buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont either.  If anything the mark of the beast in my opnion could be considered the internet itself.  Especially with 666 and WWW being associated.  </p>

<p>It says that we would freely accept the mark (we all have) and need it eventually for any commerce.  </p>

<p>Not saying I buy everything in the bible or that it is actually evil, but I think there is some truth there.  So it could be something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You stated earlier in your post that when a sine wave acts upon water or sand, it creates patterns. In this case, a hexagonal pattern.  </p>

<p>Then later on, you mentioned that their may be a cube somewhere in Saturn emitting this frequency that causes the hexagonal shape at the pole. At first I thought, &quot;Well, that can&#39;t be right, because Saturn does not have a core. It is purely gas.&quot; But then I looked it up, and found that astronomers are not 100&amp;#37; certain whether or not Saturn has a core.</p>

<p>That got me thinking. One of the first lessons you learn in trigonometry is that if you were to plot a 2D Circle onto a 2D graph, you get a sine wave. <a href="http://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/fdscontent/uscompanion/us/static/companion.websites/9780199922963/images/SineAnimation.gif">Visual representation of this fact here</a>.  </p>

<p>So circles are sine waves, and sine waves are circles.  </p>

<p>Are there &quot;sine waves&quot; in the third dimension, just as a 2-dimensional circle equates to a sine wave?</p>

<p>So back to the sound experiment.   </p>

<p>in the second dimensional experiment you have: </p>

<p>a sine wave</p>

<p>a material </p>

<p>a flat surface</p>

<p>a hexagonal pattern.</p>

<p>What If Saturn had a cubical Core?<br/>
Lets take that experiment out of a 2 dimensional plane and stretch it into the 3rd dimension.</p>

<p>the &quot;sine wave&quot; is Saturns spherical shape<br/>
the &quot;material&quot; are the gasses </p>

<p>the &quot;flat surface&quot; is the cube in the center</p>

<p>thus, a hexagonal shape at the pole </p>

<p>so, what if the pattern is made by the sphere acting upon the cube, and projecting the 2d hexagon into the gasses at the pole?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say we send a few probes to Saturn, potentially pissing off a bunch of aliens/&quot;it&quot; in the process, who clearly don&#39;t have our best interests in mind. Let&#39;s take back our solar system one celestial body at a time. Assuming Saturn is not at all what it seems at a glance, they need to fuck right off with their negative waves bullshit, garbage like that is not welcome in our solar system, not now, not ever. </p>

<p>At the very least, it would make for an exciting way to send a few big old fun rockets to Saturn and have a few probes go into it for science and stuff. Maybe some limited disclosure comes out of it too, however doubtful. We could even do something <em>really</em> stupid and nuke the planet Saturn a few dozen times, which I&#39;m sure would be bound to really piss off someone, somewhere, who probably wouldn&#39;t appreciate us randomly fucking over potentially innocent gas giants on a whim.</p>

Also check out Astrological Symbolism –The 7 Planets –The 7 Chakras</p>

<p>Sacral plexus is the lowest of the ganglia. It governs excretion, and also the transmissive functions akin to excretion which provide the Life-Power with a succession of physical vehicles, generation after generation. This plexus is influenced by Saturn. The alchemical metal associated with Saturn is lead. The color is deep violet blue. In Hindu it is the Muladhar (Base) Chakra. The symbol is a combination of the cross and the crescent, with the crescent below. This is the ascendancy of pure reason over the race-memory. Saturn is assigned to Key 21 The World.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a very relevant passage from Crowley&#39;s Book Four. Other than the explicit identification of Satan with Saturn it&#39;s also very interesting to note that he considered Adonai (god of the Jews and Masons) and Abraxas (a Gnostic deity very important in Jungianism; see <em>Jung&#39;s Seven Sermons to the Dead</em>).</p>

<p>&quot;The exalted &quot;Devil&quot; (also the <em>other</em> secret Eye) by the formula of the Initiation of Horus elsewhere described in detail. This &quot;Devil&quot; is called Satan or Shaitan, and regarded with horror by people who are ignorant of his formula, and, imagining themselves to be evil, accuse Nature herself of their own phantasmal crime. <strong>Satan is Saturn</strong>, Set, Abrasax, Adad, Adonis, Attis, Adam, Adonai, etc. The most serious charge against him is that he is the Sun in the South. The Ancient Initiates, dwelling as they did in lands whose blood was the water of the Nile or the Euphrates, connected the South with life-withering heat, and cursed that quarter where the solar darts were deadliest. Even in the legend of Hiram, it is at high noon that he is stricken down and slain. Capricornus is moreover the sign which the sun enterers when he reaches his extreme Southern declination at the Winter Solstice, the season of the death of vegetation, for the folk of the Northern hemisphere....Thus &quot;The Devil&quot; is Capricornus, the Goat who leaps upon the loftiest mountains, the Godhead which, if it become manifest in man, makes him Aegipan, the All.&quot;
Crowley, Aleister Magick: Book Four. Weiser, 1997 pp.163-164</p>

<p>And another from Eliphas Levi.</p>

<p>&quot;In the soul of the world, which is the Universal Agent, there is a current of love and a current of wrath. This ambient and all-penetrating fluid; this ray loosed from the sun&#39;s splendour and fixed by the weight of the atmosphere and the power of central attraction; this body of the Holy Spirit, which we term the Universal Agent, while it was typified by the ancients under the symbol of a serpent devouring its tail; this electro-magnetic ether, this vital and luminous caloric, is depicted in achaic [sic] monuments by the girdle of Isis, twice-folded in a love-knot round two poles, as well as by the serpent devouring its own tail, emblematic of prudence and of Saturn&quot;.
Levi, Eliphas Transcendental Magic. Martino Publishing, 2011 p.42</p>

<p>The &quot;Universal Agent&quot; that Levi terms the Holy Spirit is <strong>not</strong> what Christians mean by the Holy Spirit. It&#39;s the same thing as Dee&#39;s Aether, Bardon&#39;s Magnetic Fluid, the alchemical Azoth etc. Occultists believe it permeates the entire world and that they utilize it when practising magic. Levi called this force the Astral Light and represented it by his famous picture of Baphomet (see page 12 of Transcendental Magic, same version I cited above). Which is yet another connection to Saturn since Baphomet, like Pan and Capicorn (which are also identified with Saturn not only by Crowley in the quote above but Manly P. Hall as well), is goat-headed. </p>

<p>And here&#39;s one last quote from Manly P. Hall which connects Saturn not only with the Sun, which agrees with Icke&#39;s theory, but apparently with the Grand Architect/Demiurge as well.</p>

<p>&quot;The solar system was organized by forces operating inward from the great ring of the Saturnian sphere; and since the beginnings of all things were under the control of Saturn, the most reasonable inference is that the first forms of worship were dedicated to him and his peculiar symbol - the stone. This the intrinsic nature of Saturn is synonymous with that spiritual rock which is the enduring foundation of the Solar Temple, and has its antitype or lower octave in that terrestrial rock - the Planet Earth...&quot;
Hall, Manly P. The Secret Teachings of All Ages. Penguin, 2003 p.303</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late reply. No problem at all. I think if we want to understand what&#39;s going on today, we need to read the literature of the people in charge. This means going to actual occult material instead of looking at pop culture, which only contains very pale and heavily veiled reflections of this material and a lot easier to misinterpret. We need to do it critically though, with the full armor of God, and with diligent prayer. If you approach the stuff our enemies believe in, contained in their own works, in light of Biblical teaching then our metaphysical and political situation starts to make some real sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skimming this page and a lot of the back and forth responses, it seems that there are a lot of people on here that are really dumb. Not to be totally insulting, but dumb as in, really young, naive, insane, over medicated, narcissistic, teenager level dumb. Not enough, or any classical education. Not a broad based worldly education. The idea that in 2018 people are spending this much time on nonsense about serpents, satan, saturn, freemasons, etc  shows that you have life too easy and don&#39;t have good hobbies. God and Satan are the same thing and have no connection to Saturn. They are analogies to show the duality of humans capacity for both love and evil. They are janus faced. Saturn is a planet. That&#39;s about it. Serpents are snakes. The moon is a rock, it probably, at one point was part of early early earth until the Earth was hit by a bigger rock that spit it out into orbit. Aliens don&#39;t exist, neither do ghost, fairies, deerkin, angels, demons, goblins, gremlins, and for the most part there really aren&#39;t a whole lot of large, global, conspiracies. A lot of the things people post on this section aren&#39;t conspiracies, they are lonely broken people desperate for attention and connection with others. But feeding peoples delusions is dangerous and should not be done. You should all be ashamed of yourselves, but feeling shame would indicate a level of understanding and maturity people here really don&#39;t have. </p>

Therefore he does not have a magnetic connection to victimization. Icke has exposed many things we now see as true. He has gone into great detail on the Saturn Matrix and it will eventually be exposed as the truth, and seen as what is behind this <strong>Enslaved Reality Projection</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet is not in one place.  All of the content resides on a geographically dispersed set of servers.  Some of those servers are physical boxes, and others are shared slices of compute power that are dynamically allocated per application service.  Some content that is accessed frequently is cached and stored in content delivery networks, and dynamic aspects of that content might be stored a company&#39;s own data center.  Each system is assigned an IP address which is the Internet equivalent of a phone number.  The communications from your phone to the server are handled by the applications installed on the phone that leverage a set of sintructions that determine how the application and the server communicate (called protocols).  Each connection has a unique combination of IP address and source / destination ports that allows each system to prevent your communication from overlapping with my communication.  A set of hardware infrastructure called routers direct the flow of traffic, ensuring that each step along the way knows not the entire route to the end destination, but instead the very next hop.  This allows for systems to go up and down, and paths to change all dynamically.  I can assure you it&#39;s not magic, and its definitely not another dimension.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s quite interesting that the temple structure and the garments of the high priests, specifically the breast plate with all the jewels were very specifically and carefully aligned to a certain pattern. When looking at the stones on the breast plate you can look at how light passes through each stone/jewel. As light passes through each one it becomes condensed into a finer beam so as to transcend time and space straight to the throne of God. God even states we are to come boldly straight to His throne room. We had this picture of the temple and the breastplate as an ancient time-machine, if you will.</p>
