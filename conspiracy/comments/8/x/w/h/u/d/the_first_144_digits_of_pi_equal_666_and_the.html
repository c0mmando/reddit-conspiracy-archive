       Hello folks. Ive had a largely peculiar series of events regarding numbers and synchronicity. What it really comes down too is incredible levels of improbability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain numbers enter my life and interact like characters in a story. The numbers relate too time and or space and the designations attributed them. Like 864 is a solar number via the diameter of the sun being 864,000 miles and there being 86,400 seconds in a day. If you look at that once again you may see how WEIRD it is that miles of diameter of the Sun resonate with the spin of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       My experience with numbers has highlighted particular numbers as important actors in the stage of reality. 365,666,216,864,432,108,144. These guys show up everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill get right into the story then. My wife and I are fire spinners and entertainers, we recently had a gig a a local library and we did juggling inside and Fire outside. While we were inside I noticed the “Maximum Occupancy” was 365. The number of days in a year. I commented to my wife if we had as many people as days in the year in here we'd have a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       We continued the show outside and finished up for the day with the librarian handing me the check. I looked at it once we got to the car and noticed the check number was 86400. I mentioned that's odd that's how many seconds there are in a day. I also mentioned the convergence of the size of the sun and seconds in the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 20 minutes Into the car ride after mentioning that a commercial came on the radio saying “There are 86,400 seconds in a day, we are open 24 hours a day 365 days a week.” I sat stunned pointing at the radio “did you hear that!” My wife said holy crap I sure did.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a couple weeks ago, but a couple days ago I stumbled across this gem while looking for significance into the number 144. As I had just found out the first 144 digits of PI add up too 666. I had also read that PHI's first 144 digits added to 666 but this was false. The first 144 digits of PHI add too 660. the next digits are 006 so truthfully the first 147 digits of PHI add too 666.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This little article showcases a prime example of what I call guided research. An example of ideas popping into mind and when checked resulting in improbable results if it were cherry picking or the like. It truly is odd how gematria can surprise you.
      </p>
      <p>
       NINE IS THE KEY = 144 = THE SECRET KEY
      </p>
      <p>
       The author found the peculiar link between these 2 phrases. And had made a designation for words that were spelled out like ONE THREE ect...
      </p>
      <p>
       THE ALPHANUMBER = 144
      </p>
      <p>
       The author describes seeing the Mayan calendar laid out in a 10x26 grid and noted the fact the alphabet would nestle in quite nicely.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Realizing this matrix consisted of 260 cells, the number 260 caught my attention. I recognized it as base-10 harmonic of 26, the number of letters in our alphabet. I was compelled to substitute the numbers in the matrix with the letters of the alphabet. The result reminded me of one of those Find-The-Word puzzles. So I began scanning the matrix for any words that might have randomly occurred. I was stunned when I discovered the word "KEY" magically appeared, intact, exactly 9 times.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now this is when my face gets hit by a brick because I have SEEN this chart before!
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       About a year ago a friend I met online made this graph you see in the first rectangle. The second rectangle is the inspiration to add the alphabet too the grid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amazing thing is there are 9 KEYS present in this Mayan grid
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that NINE IS THE KEY = 144 = THE SECRET KEY
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Baktun = 144,000 days So the Mayan calendar is directly linked to the number showing up in the English gematria of these simple phrases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the Sumerian Gematria for all of the 144s is 864.
      </p>
      <p>
       THE ALPHANUMBER = 144 Sumerian 864
      </p>
      <p>
       ALPHANUMBER = 111 Sumerian 666
      </p>
      <p>
       In the midst of all this research My grandmother calls downstairs asking if I wanted to pickup some outback steakhouse. I look on the menu and settle on the 'Big Sky Burger” we call it in and a silly little voice says ' Check the gematria, teehee.”
      </p>
      <p>
       NINE IS THE KEY = 144 = THESECRETKEY=BIGSKYBURGER=THEALPHANUMBER=144
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't believe it the fact that the stuff I had just been looking at echoed the choice I had just made at the request of my grandmother.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that was the mid story, today another amazing “COINCIDENCE” happened
      </p>
      <p>
       I was writing this post above and my wife was working online next to me on her computer. She mentioned huh “i got a 666 ticket”
      </p>
      <p>
       3652666 was the ticket number
      </p>
      <p>
       She said oh that's weird its connected to a 111 ticket number. 3651113
      </p>
      <p>
       I immediately thought too ALPHANUMBER= 111  ordinal and by extension Every-time ordinal is 111 then Sumerian would be 666. But do you also see the 365 in both ticket numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where IMPROBABILITY does not cover it. The ticket had a voicemail attached and she played the voicemail. The mans name was SOLOMON!!!!!! Does anyone in the audience know the significance?! I felt woozy when I head the name and pulled up the bible verse being referenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-14.htm">

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       over the course of 365 days/666 talents of gold. And the name Solomon. I have never seen something this POTENT as far as the ping pong, recursive Receive info/research info/ acquire acknowledgment in the form of coincidence/sync. I also have never had such machine gun hits in Gematria research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets recap the Gematria that was discovered I found 2 groups. One group is the (111 ordinal  /666 Sumerian) the other is (144 ordinal/ 864 Sumerian)
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the significant standout words.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is about the act of venturing down someones rabbit hole that then has synchronicity leading deeper into the rabbit hole. Diving down rabbit holes (note RABBIT HOLES=111ord/666sumerian)
      </p>
      <p>
       I found Gary Val Tenuta 's gematria work detailing the 144  9 secret keys. I had seen the graphic but never the gematria findings. So while researching this  I was asked by my grandmother what I wanted from outback and I chose a burger and had the tingle to “calculate” the gematria and found that “Big sky burger was identical to the other 144/864 findings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came my wifes ticket numbers with the 111 and 666 directly connected with solomon.
      </p>
      <p>
       KING SOLOMON= 144/864 =BIG SKY BURGER= RABBIT HOLES
      </p>
      <p>
       3 direct links came up via different methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grandmother asked me what I wanted from restaurant and I chose the only thing that had a gematric match. “Big sky burger” and then later finding “Rabbitholes” = 144/864 and then “KING SOLOMON”
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't have checked the gematria for KING SOLOMON had my wife not brought up 666/111 and solomon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole this got jumped off from this simple fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first 144 digits of pi add too 666. Now I had also read that the first 144 digits of PHI added to the same but that was not quite accurate as the first 144 digits of phi add too 660.
      </p>
      <p>
       so I went looking into the significance of 144 and I found  3 direct connects
      </p>
      <p>
       1st is biblical being the 144,000 chosen people, which is 12,000 people from each of the 12 tribes.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd is Mayan baktun is 144,000 years

       The life of PI is 111/666 as well.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The magical square of the sun is 666 and 111 in relation to positions. So mathematically the SUN/864 is once again connected to the 666/111  sun moon and earth connected intrinsically via gematria.
      </p>
      <p>
       SUN MOON = 111/666 as well
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose ill leave you with another seeker who I feel has been traveling similar rabbit holes. And I hope at the very least you could get some entertainment out of reading this. It SOUNDS insane/crazy ect. But I just report the facts. Its about time and space and the INTRINSIC oddity and connectivity of the universe we live in.

       Below are some previous posts so you can get a feel for the level of “Research/experience interaction.” Its like the universe wants to be known in all its intricate glory.

       Above is an infographic I made on the improbably measurements present at the Giza pyramids/Mexican temple of the phoenix, The shard/silbury hill and The temple mount/ Kaaba of Mecca. You may notice the 666 and 144 links within and note the oddity of comparing Nautical miles to meters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below is the last nugget that this all seems to be hearkening back too.

      </p>
      <p>
       108,216,432,864 these numbers are intricately linked to the SUN EARTH MOON trinity. Note how these numbers interact in the biblical Gematria of the Genesis triangle. There is an elegence just below the surface of everything and unless you take a HOLISTIC view on things you wont/cant have the full picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible is important, the Mayan calendar is important, time and space measurement are important. Numbers are important, astrology ,tarot, etymology,onmancy,geomancy,prophecy.... ect... are all facets too this reality. The underlying holographic nature of consciousness is expressed with the underlying energies of language and number. The universe wants to be discovered and known I think.

       Maybe I should have said something else, but I truly believe he needs to see someone. A therapist or something. I’m not certain who he would need to see but i think it would benefit

       Look man, based on your other posts in this thread I'm probably not going to get through to you but hopefully this can help a few others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for thinking differently, outside the box, etc. It's literally my job every day of the week to think differently. The problem I have with OP and his post history and this one in particular. He's going down a rabbit hole of nonsense to try and make sense of things that have seemingly no correlation to each other. It would be funny if this were a meme but this dude is dead serious, nothing about this is OK. Rational thought has actually gotten us very far in this wonderful technology filled world of ours, despite what you and others in this sub would like to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're using these incredibly phenomenally smart intellectuals as a reference to how they were viewed from a society as a way to put down my voice on OP, but they actually had the respect of their peers, and the people closest to them and could actually make out what they were trying to convey, irregardless of the perspective of society. I'f you're trying to compare OP, who is trying to find meaning behind completely unrelated phenomena, events, and standards of math and how we function as a society (couldn't find a better way to say this, I'm talking about his view on number of days in a year kind of thinking) to his own liking, to Galileo, who had decades of knowledge, education, and the forum of debate with some of the greatest minds of our modern Renaissance, you're insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between great schools of thought and the crazed writings of random people on the internet, is a bit of a fine line. But first and foremost the difference is thus; if you have to change details, no matter how seemingly irrelevant they may be, such as rounding numbers up or down, you're not finding anything interesting. You're making you're own narrative to fit how you would like it to read for your own personal world view.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; Having your own thoughts is great, but they shall forever remain your own opinion if you have to manipulate the information that you base those thoughts on.

       The world would benefit from the ingenuity of the mentally ill? These situations are rare but, ya maybe you could be the one. However, it is the individual (and their family) who pays the price for it. That estranged lifestyle takes a toll. 
For example, Robin William's bipolar disorder was a source of talent. He did a lot of great works. But how did that turn out for HIM?
Sometimes it's like this;  Assuming you are right, and that you could come up with a cool painting, or nice song unlike anything before. Which is more important to YOU? Proving you're right to make that song, or being a happy individual and living a nice life?

       Thank you, for this friend, but i am no Da vinci or Mozart. There are people who are curious and open to this realm of inquiry and others who still hold their protective barrier of..... not ignorance, thats too harsh. more like they SEE the ridicule someone who holds my ideas gets and they dont want that. I see the various ways people reply and can tell which side they fall on. Thanks for being an open minded seeker.

       from the article you linked to:
      </p>
      <p>
       "or if people with mental disorders are especially susceptible to or even looking for these experiences."
      </p>
      <p>
       These experiences find
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       .  The patterns are there, and some people are  aware of them, and there are people who've studied and written about patterns in chaos. It isn't necessary to fabricate the patterns, and whereas the awareness can certainly complicate things for people, it's questionable whether anyone would deliberately seek it.  You should consider, also, whether the powers that be, which includes members of the psychiatric industry, are well aware the patterns are there, but want to discredit those who have them manifest themselves.  Those in the know are adept at manipulating reality though occult means, and they don't want to share that with the rest of us.  The knowledge that the patterns are really there and part of reality is occult knowledge, as in "hidden"..  They can even make people crazy with drugs that blast a person's mind wide open to make them realize the patterns and thus incapacitate those who present some kind of threat to them.  Think CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a lonely feeling to experience reality in a way so unusual people will refuse to even listen to your description of it.  You should keep an open mind and try not to belittle those who have experienced things you haven't.

       No, recognising patterns happens to be our brains specialty. Naming constellations based on the characters they resemble, spelling words in your alphabet soup, and finding pictures in the clouds are all examples of this completely normal behavior. But the intense focus on them may or may not indicate obsessive thought patterns. Also the belief that the patterns have a specific meaning that needs to be investigated, may or may not be symptomatic of delusions of grandeur.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is completely normal to notice that a spot on your toast looks kinda like Elvis. Thats ok. However, if you think Elvis must be trying to communicate to you through your toast; this kind of cognitive thought pattern is concerning.
Still, not jumping to conclusions though.

       That's my points. If you jumble enough numbers up randomly. If there is enough of them, occasional pattern are inevitable, especially in chaos. This is a statistical certainty. As humans, to notice this is more than likely to happen. Attaching meaning to it and devoting a lot of time into it is the concern. It isn't necessarily bad, some religion's see numbers and patterns as significant importance, they certainly aren't just a bunch of sick individuals. 
It is in a gray area though. Something a person may want be aware of, and.... consider?

       If someone notices the patterns and assigns meaning to them which affects their actions, then It would be a problem.  But if they believe they indicate some kind of intelligence is responsible for them, it;s going to be a life changing thing.  That's something that would probably come into someone's mind when seeing too many patterns for them to be considered random.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also possible to mess with someone's mind by planting a series of items or pieces of information that are identical or similar enough to be perceived as connected.  It could be a form of gangstalking/experimentation.  Peope in the intelligence fields including psychiatrists would be suspect.

       Sorry to burst your bubble, but humans are genetically programmed to find patterns in anything. Ever seen an object in the clouds? It's just a bunch of condensed water, why would it assemble in the shape of a whale.

       Hehe bubble not burst. Have you ever thought there MIGHT be a reason to our innate pattern recognition? There is a difference between water vapor assembling into the shape of a whale as that is subjective. Now if an ACTUAL whale appeared then we would be in the same boat.

       Anyone would jumps in a discussion to contribute a contrarian point of view
       <em>
        that is in agreement with the mainstream
       </em>
       is giving more information about who and how they are as an individual than info that defends their supposed personal viewpoint. That they would take the time to defend an already defended (mainstream) point of view indicates something is amiss- not with the post to which they are responding but with their own motives and thought process.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is passionately fighting (autonomously, of their own accord) in favor of a status quo - that which is widely accepted. No one “normal” or well-intentioned jumps to defend that which is the center of the road, the already-widely accepted viewpoint
       <em>
        unless the person challenging the status who has a point
       </em>
       and it personally upsets the contrarian OR they are being charged with the task by external forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s say you come upon a post and the person is writing that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “I have been tracking and measuring the patches of colors of grass in my yard and it corresponds directly with events in my life.” And they proceed to break down somehow how the way the grass grows is reflecting a pattern of their experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds pretty out there to you and you disagree that this is possible, and don’t understand how someone could logically think this... BUT Do you respond by saying “Hate to burst your bubble but the grass isn’t talking to you. U SOUND NUTS. You should probably go seek help bro.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       “Here is evidence that grass does not communicate. 
Insert evidence that plants are not conscious.
More links to info about our brain’s natural pattern seeking tendencies.
More comments about how it makes no sense and then more examples of people who said they could commune with nature who turned out to be wackos, according to mainstream....”
      </p>
      <p>
       All neatly lined up with bold and highlites and links and formatting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who takes the time to DEFEND SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY ACCEPTED? And to do so so....elaborately...? 
Do you know what I mean?

       Do you see the 20x13 grid in the middle. That is the Mayan calendar laid out.  13x20 is 260 so the english alphabet will fit 10 times within this grid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The grid on the left I first saw a year ago when a Facebook friend posted it.  He had got there through an entirely different series of operations and ideas. And yet the result is the 9 KEYS that show up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The grid on the right i saw earlier this week. The gematria of THE SECRET KEY- 144- NINE IS THE KEY was the..... key element of this that really connects it tightly.  144,000 days is directly connected to the Mayan calendar through a BAKTUN.
      </p>
      <p>
       the next whale was the burger i ordered. I know that sounds silly but what are the odds that the thing i order is IDENTICAL too the research being looked into. 144/864
      </p>
      <p>
       Then My wife had the ticket number that was 3652666  and it was connected too ticket number 3651113. a 111 and 666. and SOLOMON was the caller. SOLOMON was given 666 talents of gold per 365 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then further whales appear when finding KING SOLOMON is the same as the 144/864 counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       RABBIT HOLES is 144/864 as well.

       you can see the 2 main focal points of this is 144/864 and 111/666

       Ok but nothing you are saying is anything significant. You have some numbers on a ticket, did it win? You heard numbers on a radio, did anything special happen from that?  No. No actual whales just numbers.

       You just don't have the context or experience to understand the significance. When i say a whale is a whale i mean 666 is 666. OR THE SECRET KEY =144 = NINE IS THE KEY. This is a matching and comparison game. when i state "there are 86,400 seconds in a day and then have the announcer say the exact same thing and then too have that number 864 come up in a significant relation too 144.
      </p>
      <p>
       You haven't mentioned what you think of the fact that overlaying the English alphabet over the Mayan grid shows NINE KEYS and that 144 connects to that. I know its tough, you have to be able to hold alot of things in your head at once.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ticket numbers were just pings referencing the research AND offering a new path of research. I had not looked into KING SOLOMON before and the reference too 666/111/365/SOLOMON via her work tickets added more information too the puzzle.

       Ok so today someone mentioned the Fibonacci sequence having 144 as the 12th # and that 12squared =144.
      </p>
      <p>
       So i think " I wonder what the 216th Fibonacci digit is. "
      </p>
      <p>
       619220451666590135228675387863297874269396512
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats quite a number now i wonder what it adds up too!?
      </p>
      <p>
       You've gotta be kidding me!? 216!!! the 216th Fibonacci number sums too 216.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now lets try the 360th Fibonacci number
      </p>
      <p>
       769246427201094785080787978422393713094534885688979999504447628313150135520
      </p>
      <p>
       Well that's weird IT equals 360!!! So im thinking this is an odd pattern and it must continue i popped in and calculated a bunch of others and could not find any matches like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.goldennumber.net/fibonacci-60-repeating-pattern/">
        https://www.goldennumber.net/fibonacci-60-repeating-pattern/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well there it is someone else has discovered the same facet.
      </p>
      <p>
       out of the first 5000 Fibonacci numbers only 18 have this phenomenon occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then too top it all off TWO ONE SIX = 144/864 just like KING SOLOMON, BIG SKY BURGER, NINE IS THE KEY,THE SECRET KEY, THE ALPHANUMBER.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last little finding. 2368 is the sum of greek gematria for JESUS CHRIST and it shows up in the weirdest places. Anywho i found what the 2368th number sum = 2220....... nothing really stood out so i searched.
      </p>
      <p>
       the last verse of the bible  REV 22:20..... Thar SHE BLOWS! :P

       Haha i am SIRIUS when i play. But really im glad you brought him up.
      </p>
      <p>
       From APOLLO 11 mission until the release of MAN ON THE MOON is 11111 days! also 11111 days is 365 months...... let that sink in. Days of the year, in months = 11111 days
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore Dr SIRIUS is the Dr in the number 23. The 23 enigma brought to the world attention by Robert anton Wilson. Jim plays EDWARD NYGMA or ENYGMA.  Sirius is the star that almost STRIKES Truman in the Truman show.
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; To Greek observers, this signified certain emanations which caused its  malignant influence. Anyone suffering its effects was said to be  "star-struck" (ἀστροβόλητος,
       <em>
        astrobólētos
       </em>
       ). It was described as "burning" or "flaming" in literature
      </p>
      <p>
       The term STARSTRUCK derives from SIRIUS. Now where does truman want to go????
      </p>
      <p>
       FIJI!!
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt;the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji">
        Fiji
       </a>
       at 17°S and thus passes directly over the islands each night
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is the only Service DOG who dies on 9-11?
      </p>
      <p>
       SIRIUS....

       damn lol I looked at most of it and will go through more of it later. I saw you mentioned Lost but nothing about the numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Do you have any info about these numbers? Because they are also referenced in the arcade game that "doesn't exist" POLYBIUS, which is also full of sacred geometry.(if you haven't heard of this already heres a video about it
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7X6Yeydgyg">

       ). 
42 is everywhere in the bible, 42 months of the antichrist, egyptian book of the dead your soul passes by 42 judges.. ect
23 is a big occult number and linked to Eris the greek god of chaos. 9/11 = (9+11+2+0+0+1)= 23. Hiroshima bomb dropped at 8:15 (8+15=23) and the list goes on forever. But I'm not sure what the other numbers mean. Anyways, heres a list of "conspiracy" related books I've been reading

       You should really check out the 9th book on the list about ascension frequencies. Its only 25 pages and talks about the Matrix in our DNA.

       This is true but it doesnt necessarily throw off any of the applicable numbers here.  144 decimals of pi does equal 666 the first 6 Roman numerals do equal 666. The number of beast and man is 666. Carbon is 6 electrons 6 neutrons and 6 protons.

       Except isotopes are by definition stable compounds. C14 (Carbon-14) is literally so stable it is used for carbon dating and has a half life of 5730 years. Thats older than literally the number systems used in this discussion.

       The etymology of the prefix iso- as derived from the Greek is 'equal'.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in any way implying that C14 is not the same as C13 or C12 I would strongly encourage you to review basic chemistry as the defining characteristics of what classifies an element is the number of protons residing within the nucleus. Any atom with 6 protons is considered to be carbon. There can be more or less neutrons. Technically, there can also be ion forms of elements with varying electrons as well, though those are very unstable in the case of carbon.

       C14 is C14, just as it is not C13 nor C12.

       First of all, 'C flat' is technically Carbon 12. Secondly Carbon isotopes are called just that 'carbon isotopes'. C-14 is not a new element or a different chemical. It is carbon with an extra neutron. Carbon 12, 13, and 14 are all alike entirely on the basis of protons, electrons, and nearly every other measurement technique or characterization machine that can be used to discern elements from each other.

"any of two or more forms ofa chemical element, having the same number ofprotons in the nucleus, or the same atomicnumber, but having different numbers ofneutrons in the nucleus, or different atomicweights. There are 275 isotopes of the 81stable elements, in addition to over 800radioactive isotopes, and every elementhas known isotopic forms. Isotopes of asingle element possess almost identical properties."

       Yeah, if you really want to drag elements into this nonsense your best bet is to point at Period 6 of the periodic table which happens to contain Hg. Mercury is a very odd outlier in regards to all other chemicals due to being liquid at room temperature and was believed by the old old Chinese traditions to be a miracle elixer for eternal life.

       So it's not cognitive dissonance to say I don't believe while still considering. The reason I chose carbon specifically is because I am versed in chemistry enough to speak to that.

       That being said, what you have is a significant amount of what is known as 'survivorship bias'. It's really easy for you to remember seeing these numbers in strange places because your mind is actively looking for them. I guarantee if you do a statistical comparison between those numbers showing up and every single number you forgot or your brain didn't pick up on in between them. Consider things like cell phone times or radio stations or nearly any sign marker on any road. There is a significantly larger amount of numbers you didn't recognize because you werent looking for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same reason that once you buy a red Chevrolet pickup you start to notice how many of that same make and model are on the road even though in reality they didn't all go out and buy them at the same time as you.

       I do not believe in anything of your post at all. The reason I provided the Mercury example is to demonstrate how easy it is to pick any subject, especially chemistry, and find something to fit the numerology you subscribe to. In fact, by not believing and still being able to process your train of thought to produce a similar one I am demonstrating the ease at which it is to 'make this up'.

       Numerology typically focuses on the discussion of numbers as being connected to divine instances or situations of importance. Saying that you found a number on a ticket neither really, to me, constitutes divine or significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, to me, it seems a significant amount of survivorship bias that you've failed to address in any of your responses to me. If you feel this is as valid and insane as you say it is, can you refute to me that there were not large amounts of numbers that you likely ignored or passed over unconciously until you say a handful you were looking for?

       Genesis 1:1's total gematria value is 2701 which is 37x73. 2701 is the 73rd triangular number and the 37th triangular number 703 resides upside down triforce style. the phrase "and the earth" is the 703.... which leaves 3 triangles of 666 surrounding or on top of the earth..... Its a simple metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
       2701 is a fascinating number as 2701+1072= 3773. 37x73=2701+1072=3773
      </p>
      <p>
       37 is the 12th prime 73 is the 21st  12squared=144 441= 21squared
      </p>

       Note also that #3652666 was my wifes ticket number who was attached to Solomon which got me to look up the bible verse with Solomon which mentioned both 365 and 666. Then checking KING SOLOMON in the gematria calculator and finding it is IDENTICAL to the previous 144/864 gematrias.

       ...its 666 because of a mistranslation. The bible wasnt written in English first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course all of those will have 666 because they mistranslated the original mark of the beast 616.

       Would you be surprised if I told you that our Sun is partially made of Gold and Silver.  It is just not in the structure or matter that our scientists think it is.

       My favorite creation was the pyramid of 100 consecutive #s. I came up with this one day just randomly doodling. It’s amazing because the pyramid is perfectly shaped with 100 digits exactly and 10 rows. Then from there you begin to add the sides, the columns, the rows and you come up with some interesting totals. Eventually you will spot certain patterns that reveal themselves like a story.

       The meru foundation has some of the most groundbreaking research that noone really knows about. but the gist is that GEN 1:1 actually GENERATES a three dimensional shape that when viewed from specific angles will cast the shadow of the various Hebrew letters.

       These from OP and those numbers you equated, when the numbers are added or broken down together, they equal 9 as well. (Except 365) Ex. "666" 6+6=12, 1+2=3, 3+6=9. or "864" 8+6=14, 1+4=5, 5+4=9 and etc.

      <p>
       The numbers you resulted in your post, also all add into 9.

      <p>
       A lot of these numbers that seem to be important in our measurements, angles, ancient structures, musical frequencies, may have been fabricated to fit a pattern or miraculously naturally fit into one, these important numbers tend to add up into 3s, 6s or 9s.

       Also the solfeggio scale, that includes the 432 hz frequency, every scale adds into 3, 6 or 9.

      <p>
       Another interesting thing about 9, that doesn't happen to 3 or 6s. Is that when number X is added to 9, it always breaks down back into X.

       SS: Here's a series of 9/11 news reports and interviews that are, if not 100% proof, at least a credible "smoking gun" that an F-16 from the D.C. Air National Guard, directed by the White House, shot down Flight 93 over Shanksville, PA on September 11, 2001.

       Myself, I can't imagine another jet was targeting the Pentagon. Perhaps the State Department building? A car bomb was reported by ABC News, then not mentioned again:

       The implications of a physical airliner attack are what interest me. What was the target and why? What did Israel hope to get from that they did not get from the 9/11 attacks as they played out? Perhaps simply more intimidation of the State Department to attack Afghanistan and Iraq --

       I did some digging. Numerology "digital reduction" plays into this. Here are the frequencies of the notes on the A432 Pythagorean scale:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A432 Pythagorean Musical Tone Derivations:
        <a href="https://imgur.com/xpICWG9.png">
         https://imgur.com/xpICWG9.png
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and here are their digital reduction:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A432 Pythagorean Digital Reduction:
        <a href="https://imgur.com/jvJG0Fa">
         https://imgur.com/jvJG0Fa
        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So in A432 Pythagorean, "C" (1-2-4-8-16-32-64-128-etc.) reduces to the integers 1-2-4-8-7-5-1-2-etc. Its perfect fifth, "G" (1.5-3-6-12-24-48-etc), reduces to 6-3-6-3-6-3-etc. And
       <em>
        everything else
       </em>
       on that scale, including the sharps and flats, reduces to 9-9-9-9-9-9-9-9-etc. (!!)
      </p>
      <p>
       (Note that A440 Equal Temperament or Pythagorean digitally reduces to an utter trainwreck, no integers, just totally random looking.)

       Best I can tell, 432Hz is the resonance of the universe -- kind of like certain frequencies make cymatic patterns on metal plates of certain thickness/stiffness:

      </ul>
      <p>
       And, of course, careful with information surrounding this stuff. The whole "528 Solfeggio" thing appears to be disinfo. All those notes digitally reduce to garbage.

       Wow a lot of interesting info here, most of it is going over my head but I want to take some time and digest this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the Solfeggio Scale. I always thought there's something a bit off on it all and it's hard for me to articulate why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still learning this whole musical frequency and scales. But to my understanding, everything we tune we use A440 scale or frequencies or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       But A432 scale applied to music is perhaps the frequency that is natural or organic. (Depending on what you mean is natural) and it matches those frequencies resonating in our universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this tie in of A432 has been incorrectly associated with this Hz scale called the Solfeggio Scale, incorporating the frequencies I listed in my last post? 432, 528, etc. These frequencies/numbers is not actually in the realm of A432? I'm probably grossly mistunderstanding scales and frequencies, and apolgies for my potentially nonsensical rambling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, thanks for the links, I intend to check into them.

       Hey, thank you for the link -- good to see other folks on this same path, whatever it means. I wonder, is it possible that some of the man-made patterns we see with (for example) gematria in names and days between deaths and such... Could it all be a grand psyop to distract us from the
       <em>
        natural
       </em>
       patterns that could, say, hold the keys to free energy? (And if/when that happens, TPTB lose control.) So the idea is that they generate false patterns to obfuscate the real ones, thereby hiding deeper understanding of reality. Just a thought.

       I read through the comments so far; there are a few who are interested, and recognize the work you are doing. thank you for this information.
      </p>
      <p>
       now, as i am sure you have noticed, you have gotten an inbox full of, "are you high?!" and "dude,
       <em>
        grumbles
       </em>
       mentally ill, bruh."  thing is, they always use this tactic. they always have, whenever we've gotten close through millenia. They would like us to think it's all mumbo jumbo, but they use the numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       they insinuate that you are high and nuts for two reasons; it creates a false narrative, that the casual reader will buy at first glance, chalk you up to a recluse and close the link, (i wonder who would care enough to find time to do this, AGAIN and AGAIN?) and it makes you feel alone. more isolated, perhaps insane, certainly no one worth noting, much less listening to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not alone. there are many of us. more than they want. which is why there are so many people willing to simply put you down for what appears to be trolls getting their jollies.
      </p>
      <p>
       the road less traveled is fucking weird.being peaceful, remaining humble, and having a willingness to look the fool are vital. best of luck to you.

       He goes into specifically the mathematics behind pyramids, calendars, etc. from all over the world and shows how their number system worked. You are onto something here and you personally might really like that book.

       I know right. Its like numbers scare people or make them angry. The nitpickers like to highlight a single error and ignore everything else so that they don't have to worry about thinking, thinking is tough and its just easier to find a reason to write off everything and not have to strain the brain.

       No, it's because you could literally nitpick any number sequence apart to mean anything you want when you make up your own rules for how they apply to each other.....gasp

       YOU can nitpick and make the numbers fit sure. But i am simply presenting ALL the data. NO cherry picking. Its easy to look at a corpus of number data and assume that the data was picked and there was hours of plugging in and disregarding data that didn't fit the "Narrative". Narrative being an odd word because i don't determine the narrative lol. The NARRATIVE is the universe, i am just mentioning things that happen in my reality that have a higher than usual threshold of probability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mathematics determines the rules that mathematics goes by. Point out in detail my manipulation of any data point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just ignore the Math portion entirely and look at the Mayan calendar English alphabet grid.
      </p>

      <p>
       Lets break down the levels at play here.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 separate people people (that i know of) have noticed that the TZOLKIN  grid has resonance with the English alphabet of 26 letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now in this type of research the finding itself is a level of improbability. Then the actual person going through the motions to FIND the data point is a magnitude higher improbability.
      </p>
      <p>
       For someone to think "Hey that looks like i could overlay the alphabet over it." and then BOOM you see nine keys.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 of the people that found this data point made absolutely no mention of the Gematria links.
      </p>
      <p>
       only GARY made the "THE SECRET KEY=144=NINE IS THE KEY"  notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Gary's experience and research is by itself a corpus of synchronistic data. The fact that THE FIRST WORD i checked OUTSIDE of the research IE "BIG SKY BURGER" had identical gematria to the collection of words already shown within the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact the Mayan TZOLKIN resonates with the English alphabet is true. as is the fact that SEMANTICALLY 9 keys show up and metaphorically can be interpreted.
      </p>
      <p>
       144,000 days in the long count BAKTUN calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
       144,000 White polished limesone bricks encased the Great pyramid of GIZA
      </p>
      <p>
       144,000 chosen people of GOD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly ill go over the biggest and most difficult fact to take in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pyramid of Giza to the Pyramid of the Sun in Mexico is 6666 Nautical miles Which is ALSO 12345.432 Kilometers.

       This world is much more peculiar than you think, Its hard to accept but there is alot too learn. and honestly i think the only way is Holistically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the gentleman who has taken the keys to a completely other level.

       Significant figures have little to do with any of this. im not doing ANY rounding here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You couldn't possibly believe that this ISNT cherry picking  but if you go through my post history with an open mind i think you'll begin to see a little better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its kinda like trying to explain a TV shows plot that is 100 seasons in and in order to explain the most recent episode i have to bring up all of these other points that have no meaning without context or experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the rules go......... i don't make them. The Narrative, i didn't craft it, im just reporting. This is the opposite of cherry picking as i dont choose the numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as i can tell the "NUMBERS" are just like the wind moving reality. Its like a underling engine that you cant see but can infer from its motions and reactions that there is "something".......... i guess that's really the only narrative i push.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Something" in the universe is special and wants you to know it.

       PHI is the 21st letter of the greek alphabet. 21x21=441 which is the mirror too 12x12=144

      <p>
       holy shit i am having my mind blown with the rabbit hole you sent me down.
      </p>
      <p>
       the 216th fibinaci number sums too 216

      <p>
       I was blown away as this was the first Fibonacci i got the sum of.
      </p>
      <p>
       I next pop in 360 and find that IT TOO equals 360!!!! i then think of 72 and boom once again!!!!! the 72nd fib number sums too 72!
      </p>
      <p>
       I then go willy nilly checking other Fibonacci numbers sums and i don't find a SINGLE other one that has these properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       i seek it out and it HAS been discovered before.

       18 numbers under 2222 result in a mirrored sum. i found 3 in a row.... What are the odds of that?!

      <p>
       just to verify im on the right path i check TWO ONE SIX and find it is EXACTLY the SAME as the 144/864 findings yesterday
