    <div class="md"><ol>
<li>Talmudic Jews- Think the non Jews are essentially cattle and need to be used as such. (Media, Hollywood, fiat currency, etc)</li>
<li>Illuminati Cabal- 1700s Illuminati. Masons aligned with the black tiles so to speak. This includes Scottish and York rite that are generally up to no good.  They think they are of the 15&amp;#37; or so descending from the line of Cain. (Lot more can be said about this group) </li>
<li>White Hat Masonry- Different then above descending from Ancient Egypt and Phoenicia. This group will leave more breadcrumbs for ordinary people, they do more protecting of  the people than the two above. Example would be like protecting chicken eggs before they hatch. Teachings more of the RA material.</li>
<li>Corporate Feudal State- Not sure who controls this....Some kind of virus or perhaps some dickish non-terrestrial group that shall not be named. Perhaps several. Their aims are similar to #1. </li>
<li>The Old Churches- Aim to control mostly and believe humanity is essentially babies. The answers are literally in their texts. The pine cone statue in front of the Vatican and the fish hat denote a ton of information in and of themselves. Ties all the way back to the Dogon and Sirius B </li>
<li>A.I.- I think this falls under #4</li>
</ol>

<p>All in all the truth is: Everything humanity needs is out there, it&#39;s about assembling the pieces. Each group puts out all of their knowledge and plans because they must as an appendant aspect of positive karma. We are all trying to get home and become whole again--this is a fact. The alignment makes little difference once we understand we are all one. E Pluribus Unum--Out of Many One. Anyways the trick here is to realize that if we are not distracted and looking in the right places, with eyes that see...we can find anything, and we can learn anything, and we can do anything. </p>

God became a man to save us by becoming the final blood sacrifice for sin.  If you don&#39;t have the blood atonement of Jesus Christ you will pay for your own sin in the eternal lake of fire.</p>

<p>Joh 8:57  Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 
Joh 8:58  Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. 
Joh 8:59  Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. </p>

<p>Exo_3:14  And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</p>

<p>Col 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. 
Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. </p>

<p>Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God. 
Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>

<p>Joh 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. </p>

<p>1Ti_3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jupiter is represented by Zeus, not the Sun. The Sun is always related to a messianic figure in myth and religion (mostly represented as a &quot;son&quot; figure or character). The power behind the Sun is the &#39;godhead&#39; or ultimate principle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus is the Christ which is Love and Truth. Jesus said he is the truth, the life and the way. No one gets to the father except through him. That doesn&#39;t mean to worship him. It means to seek truth and love each other. Follow his example. That&#39;s what he is. An example to all of humanity on how to life. That automatically leads you to God. When Jesus said that many will die in his name, especially in the End Times, he didn&#39;t mean people would die for literally saying they believed in Jesus. He meant they&#39;d die for loving and upholding truth. He didn&#39;t die for our sins, he died to bring us the message of love and truth. He told us the truth and then showed us the greatest love there is, giving his life for us in order that we receive the message. He never wanted to be worshiped, he even said that he isn&#39;t good and that only God is good. The Word is truth and love, Jesus is the Word made flesh. Do you worship the Word or do you simply follow it?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>He didn&#39;t die for our sins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speak for yourself.  He died for mine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That doesn&#39;t mean to worship him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mat 8:2  And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
Mat 8:3  And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p>

<p>Jesus accepts worship because he is God.  He also makes us clean from our terminal illness (sin).</p>

<p>Joh 10:30  I and my Father are one.</p>

<p>Joh 14:8  Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 
Joh 14:9  Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?</p>

<p>God will judge everyone according to his standard of righteousness (absolute perfection).  No matter how much you love or think you are a good person it is not enough.  Just one tiny bit of sin makes us deserving of the 2nd death according to a perfect and holy God.</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa 64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. </p>

<p>Sin makes us deserving of the second death:</p>

<p>Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.</p>

<p>Our human minds can&#39;t comprehend this because we are not perfect nor holy.  We compare ourselves to each other instead of a perfect and holy God who views just one sin as we view a child molesting murderer.  That&#39;s why we require Jesus Christ&#39;s imputed righteousness:</p>

<p>Isa 55:8  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. 
Isa 55:9  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p>

<p>You can only received the righteousness of Jesus Christ by abandoning your own self righteousness by repenting and believing this:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

I don&#39;t remember any specific references to oto or sarmoung -- his perspective comes from within the Church so at times in his writing he&#39;s only specific enough to create the outline for the reader -- he drops hints here and there that only highly knowledgeable readers will pick up. Martin was a Vatican insider privy to the secrets of Fatima. He was a translator of the Dead Sea Scrolls and an exorcist. Sometimes the things he says don&#39;t sit well with me, but over time I have digested his thoughts and found a general acceptance of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>It has to be one of these groups.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. There are a lot of groups in our society fighting for dominance. We live in a complex system that is changing all the time. Power structures take shape in a state of flux, rapidly declining or rising seemingly overnight when viewed from a historical perspective.</p>

<p>The Vatican is very powerful, Zionists are very powerful, European royal families are very powerful, and Freemasons have been very powerful (they may still be, or other secret societies may have replaced Freemasonry). If extraterrestrial beings controlled humanity, their domination would be so ubiquitous, that it would not be possible to stop them. That&#39;s the only group you listed that might actually have total control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wrote a novel titled &quot;The Jesuits&quot; and was a Jesuit priest before leaving the priesthood. I don&#39;t remember any specific references to oto or sarmoung -- his perspective comes from within the Church so at times in his writing he&#39;s only specific enough to create the outline for the reader -- he drops hints here and there that only highly knowledgeable readers will pick up. Martin was a Vatican insider privy to the secrets of Fatima. He was a translator of the Dead Sea Scrolls and an exorcist. Sometimes the things he says don&#39;t sit well with me, but over time I have digested his thoughts and found a general acceptance of them.</p>
