    <div class="md"><p>My problem with the guy is that he seems to really run with the Nazi-Antartica-Ufo tale and it feels more like a card trick because the targeted and mostly US audience will just buy it as it fits their preconception.</p>

<p>A believe which was created by a century of Hollywood propaganda/movie antagonists as the boogeyman who wanted to conquer the world.</p>

<p>It became a meme almost nobody questions.</p>

<p>Why I don&#39;t buy the particular Ufo/Antartica story during the 40s is simply logistics. Even if the German Navy managed to build a long term base there I don&#39;t see how they would have managed to install and maintain the necessary infrastructure for R&amp;D, engineering <em>and</em> supply while Germany itself was bombed to ashes. </p>

<p>To pull that off for some isolated Germans in Antartica makes no sense to me and I have seen <em>nothing</em> from Farrell outside of &quot;German&quot; name droppings to ride this established preconception. Just entertaining spun yarn in my eyes.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean I wouldn&#39;t disbelief some post war Gestapo/SS/Friends network dipping their hands into the military/intelligence/drug business to make a living. Like ex US military people trying to profit from their skill/contacts/opportunity after their official military time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problem imaging some feudal/fascist group started a breakaway civilisation over the last few decades which used Paperclip scientists/intelligence to jumpstart it. That wasn&#39;t the point.</p>

<p>My point was that I just don&#39;t buy the 19<em>4</em>5+, Antartica base+Nazi UFO tales for the mentioned reasons. Just look how many resources the USA allegedly invested into the Apollo program. Why should a new and radical different technology need less effort?</p>

<p>Was Jupiter in the exact right place to vacuum up these mythical fragments ?</p>

<p>Did the fragments wait around in Jupiter&#39;s orbit to be vacuumed ?</p>

<p>How did this mythical planet &quot;explode&quot;  ?</p>

<p>You do realize that planets cannot explode, right ?</p>

<p>You do realize that a planetary body has significant gravity and an explosion would have to be large enough to counteract that gravity to split the planet into little pieces, that force would propel those pieces out of the solar system...</p>

<p>LOL, you have no clue what you are talking about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Throw pluto into Neptune and guess what happens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pluto would break up due to Roche&#39;s limit and Neptune would swallow it, no explosion would occur.</p>

<p>No mechanism exists for there to be an explosion in that scenario.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let your fantasies run wild and make you look foolish, go learn some simple science and then you will understand that planets do not blow up and they cannot blowup because there is no mechanism that would make a planet explode.</p>

<p>Like a I previously stated, if your alien gods had a bomb big enough to destroy a planet any remaining fragments  would be flung out of the solar system by the ridiculous force that would be required to accomplish such a thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a story, all fiction and bad science no matter how hard you try to make it real.</p>
