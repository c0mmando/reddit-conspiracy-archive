       This isn't a fact-based, source-based post at all, I'm just curious of what others think about it. Why is it that SO many pedophile  stories/cover-ups/rumors/etc we hear of come from those in powerful industries - politicians, Hollywood, financers etc? I know other average joes can be pedos too, but they are probably lower level professionals at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at is clearly being in power is the way to go as a pedophile - you meet other similar friends, get the hook ups, get the cover ups - so do these people only aim for these types of positions to be able to live their pedo life more freely? They don't become pedophiles later in life, clearly they go into it as such. Is there some pedo network teaching these tips early on, and how early on is that? You have to know well in advanced to plan this type of future. It's not a coincidence how prevalent pedophilia is in those industries. To me, it's some sort of common pre-planned agenda - like how some common people may have
       <em>
        high school, college, job, marriage
       </em>
       What is theirs and how early on are they taught this plan?

       Maybe it's because more "professional" pedophiles tend to also be better manipulators in other parts  of their life? They can manipulate the people around them to get better positions and such?

       Also, I’m sure someone else can word Smith this better.
But the people in power now, are not the first to be corrupted, they are hundredth in an extremely long lineage and culture of corruption and nefarious deeds. These are the people who pick those below them, those that may take their places one day.

       They secure loyalty by blackmail. All these guys are pedos because they have to be, if they weren’t already, that’s how TPTB secure loyalty. Nobody will speak out against them, you’re a filthy pedophile rapist, who would listen to you, scumbag? Nobody, and if you’re lucky enough to find an ear, it will not be an easy road.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s systematically flawed and this quagmire needs more than a drain, it needs complete redesign on a fundamental level. It needs to be re-evaluated over and over and over again for any progress to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have had to opportunity to talk to people on multiple fields, musicians, actors, and business people, have all told straight up,  or heavily implied many different things that go on behind the scenes. Specific points a person will come across on their path, that determines if they stay local, or move into the big scene and become famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s plenty of videos on this, especially rappers talking on sexual abuse and conduct within the game, and it’s true to a major extent.

       Are you suggesting that, when someone becomes rich or gets elected to a powerful position, they have to become a child absuer? That someone, somehow, forces them to commit heinous criminal acts and they all just go along with it? This is ridiculous.

       When does this "extremely long lineage" of corruption finally fall?

       I just a pissed off ex rapper, but I know the TWO times I met someone truly capable of drastically changing my situation (read: putting me on THE Big Stage) they both asked me for homosexual sex. I noped outta there, and then I started hearing about the illuminati and the gay underworld of the music industry.

       Psychopaths, without any conscience or scruples of any kind, which is what we are actually talking about, come in a lot of different flavours including some which are fixated on illegally molesting and having sex with little children and doing whatever is necessary in order to satisfy that desire and just as importantly... to be able to consistently get away with it, which heightens and makes doing it all the more gratifying for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bold demonstration of just how superior they are compared to everyone else which they also interpret as giving them licence to manipulate or use anyone else in any way that it pleases them to do for their own ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       With no sense of conscience, guilt, or remorse for anything that they do they are consummate liars and actors, certifiable monsters that move among us putting on a flawless impersonation of the very last people we would ever suspect of harbouring the kind of desires and ambitions that actually drive them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suffice it to say that satisfying their personal desires is the only thing of any importance in their lives and everything else is simply a means to that end and they will choose the route that's most likely to succeed, no matter how hard or difficult and put every possible effort into it while manipulating and using anyone along the way to obtain the kind of advantages that they need to get what they're after.

       Look at the West-backed coups in developing nations. (Literal) criminals are the ones appointed into positions of power, for a few reasons: 1) they select criminals to overthrow the existing government, since this base is most inclined to do so, and 2) the West has constant leverage against the new govt's administration. Kosovo's current president Thaci was described by the US State Dept as a narco thug, until Europe's leadership convinced the US to back him instead of Albania's other (slightly less) criminal leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haiti is another obvious example of supporting criminals in the coups and then helping them rise to long-term power, but it's been done throughout Central America, former USSR countries, the Baltics, etc. Pedos and those with unusual sexual proclivities make for the most blackmailable. They also help run the covert human trafficking businesses, not all too different than appointing drug lords as presidents for covert drug ops in/out of the country.

       Well... I think it's true, but
       <em>
        only among

       the types who seek power and control in the first place. They're people who lack empathy or a conscience in the first place.. they're not like you and I, and anyone else who could never in a million years hurt a child.

       With endless power and money comes boredom, and deeper and deeper down the sick rabbit hole they go to relieve that boredom. This is how psychopaths operate, I've seen it in person on a much smaller scale.

       Psychopaths are more likely to be pedophiles....but not in the sense of they're attracted to children, in the sense that they're dominating and destroying an innocent thing. God complex, most psychopaths have it. Psychopaths also more likely to seek out and acquire power positions.

       I believe everyone feels its morally wrong at their core to do such acts. Power corrupts and you feel invincible and untouchable. Vast amounts of Wealth and Power create a self-proclaimed different breed above others with no power or wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dark forces in the world are in control of such acts. Most of these children are murdered  after. Children are pure souls who are innocent from the worlds corruption and they feed off of these childrens energy for occultist, spiritual, lecherous, depravitous, wicked, and narcissistic reasons.

       It seems less about sexual gratification and more about bullying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bullying is stealing spiritual energy from other beings by making them feel negative emotional states and absorbing the negative energy they radiate. If they don't suffer, the bully does not gain satisfaction and the more they suffer the more satisfaction the bully gains. Children are easy prey and also yield a lot of negative emotional energy because they are more sensitive.

       The elites are being used by their counterparts in space on a larger scale. They are being sold the devil's trick. Enslave and exploit others to enhance your own lot in life. As they do they facilitate the enslavement and exploitation of their own race. They are tools driven by pleasure and fear. The entire lot of this evil hive buys that trick and is enslaved to be enslavors.

       Being a pedophile is a prerequisite to power. In this system, blackmail is the best way to control people. They pick people, the elites, who have are sexually deviant and are child molesters, and they have them perform 'rituals', tape it, and hold it over them so that way they have complete power with these people. It's in every area of business, education, religion, and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then you have child molesters that pick jobs where they can be close to children to prey on them, hence teachers, daycare workers and so forth, have been found recently to engage in these predatory behaviors. So it's two aspects to it.

       It is simple, they to keeping a conspiracy under wraps is making sure nobody squeals, and the best way to ensure nobody squeals is to have blackmail on them, which pedophilia is the most powerful blackmail because pedoz get murdered in jail. Basically a conspiracy is a network of blackmail, no way out. 
Tldr; you are only allowed in if you have blackmail on you already.

       The people with all the money don't want anyone to know they also run the show. So they find a nice-looking guy or girl, then figure out a way to blackmail them. Maybe they really are a perv, maybe they were given a drug or told that the prostitute was older than they really were. Maybe the video itself is fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have the blackmail material, you approach the nice-looking guy or gal, and tell them that you want to support them running for office. If they object, you let them know about the video. And the nice-looking guy or gal does whatever you say for their entire political career.

       If I rember correctly most sexual crimes against children is not done by actual pedophiles but people who have power over the children (teachers, fathers, uncles etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also another possibility I want to add that there are far more pedophiles or people who have interest in stuff like this in the world but we only see the real outliners that actually do it (so people who have a very high pedofile desire) or people whos Position allowed them to be pedophiles.

       Yes, most child abuse is perpetrated by people known to the child and in positions of power over them, but they don't abuse the child because they're in that position, they abuse the child because they're a paedophile or a sadist or a psychopath.

       I think these powerful people are used to having everything. Money, power, luxury, beautiful women, that they only thing off limits to even them, the forbidden fruit, must be tasted in order to remind them that this is their world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's less about being attracted to kids as it is more about being attracted to power.

       A pedo has developed skills in manipulation, building trust, grooming behavior in others to serve their interests, how to be an asshole while making the victim feel responsible, how to be charming, how to maintain relationships for selfish purposes.  In the obvious absence of morals, the same skills can lead to success in business, social circles, etc.

        Why is it that SO many pedophile stories/cover-ups/rumors/etc we hear of come from those in powerful industries ...?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because people love making up and spreading scurrilous gossip over famous people. If you claim that some A-list actor is a child abuser, that's going to get a much bigger reaction (and more page views, if you have a website) than accusing some teacher that no one's heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when it comes down to whether the powerful industries are more represented in actual proven instances of child abuse as opposed to allegations, I've not seen any figures that show this is the case. (And, as you note, your claim is not fact based or sourced.) I would actually expect that organisations like schools, sports groups, and youth groups are more represented than "powerful industries", because child abuse is generally committed by adults known to the child and in positions of power over them (teachers, sports coaches, priests, etc).

       Psychopaths are more likely to both seek positions of power and molest kids even if they aren't pedophiles. Psychopaths get off on doing bad shit, so molesting and raping kids is something they do whether they're pedophiles or not.

       I think a better question might be how do powerful people become (insert messed up fetish’s).
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect there is a history of all sorts of people throughout history who realized it’s easier to corrupt the powerful, and or blackmail them, then to grasp for power themselves, directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Favour hoarders are probably a common starting point. Crassus, way back in republican Rome was one. So is Epstein. I hate to say it, but it follows a fairly logical progression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wealth can bring moral degeneration. Ancient Persia in one generation (maybe 2) went from men eat only once a day to funk it, let’s have an all day/night feast. The mongols saw this and kept sending their men back to the steppes. Yo keep their edge. Those who didn’t acculturated and lost that hard edge.
