<p>I mean idk why you&#39;re being downvoted and I can&#39;t claim a bunch of intelligence when I cant give an out of context explanation but it&#39;s not a difficult concept maybe it&#39;s been explained poorly?</p>

<p>Like metaphysical is the intangible laws of the universe and physics is the tangible laws. Both are supposedly laws that govern the universe and such. Idk if that helps</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what I found on Wikipedia from 2007:</p>

<p>“This appears. to be a bad translation. English is not Bhutto&#39;s first language and I believe her grammar was mixed up. I believe that she meant to say &quot;The man who murdered for Osama Bin Laden&quot; Please note that in the video she stutters the sentence several times, and I think that this is likely because she was having trouble with the grammar. Omar Shiekh has been in U.S. custody since 2002 and there have been several Bin Laden tapes since then where he mentions current events. Therefore, it is not possible that he could have murdered Osama Bin Laden. Also, by examining the context she was describing someone who had dealings with Omar Shiekh in an attempt to discredit the person she was talking about. It&#39;s doubtful that she would expect to gain any sympathy to her cause by saying that a friend of Bin Laden&#39;s killer would be a bad guy. This video has popped up on youtube and has been used extensively with little explaination by conspiracy theorists to confuse people and to try to suggest that the US government knows that Bin Laden is dead and is covering it up to continue waging the war on terror. I know that certainly Bhutto, being a politician would have known that Sheikh was in US custody, and that Bin Laden had been seen on tape since then. I think perhaps a seperate article or section would be appropriate to explain away this phenomenon, as it appears to be a bad translation.”</p>

<p>Bhutto spent as much time in the UK and US growing up than she did in Pakistan, and she spent most of her career speaking English. Her own children (now in politics) only speak English.</p>

<p>Whether she was correct or not, meant it or not, it would not have been a language issue that caused what Bhutto said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They clearly don&#39;t need an excuse to continue operations 7 years after. As of 2016, we had the lowest amount of deployed troops since 1957. And yes, the amount started to decrease somewhere around 2010/11, but I can&#39;t seem to find numbers on the amount of military attacks/incidents/deployments on a timeline. It&#39;s possible we&#39;ve had more operations continuing or starting since the reduction in actively deployed troops. We certainly ramped up the drone program since it&#39;s introduction in the mid-00&#39;s.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx">https://news.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx</a></p>

<p>According to Gallup, Obama&#39;s approval rating just barely scraped past 50% directly after the raid and while it hovered there for two months, it was quickly back down to around 44-45%. June 2011 saw the controversies of John Edwards and Weiner and Democrat polling took a hit.</p>

<p>My point is, I can see the long con of slowing military operations in the middle east, but according to polls and surveys from the time, a majority of voters didn&#39;t need a reason to be against the &#39;anti-terrorist&#39; wars; we were already convinced it was fruitless. And if the point of &#39;killing&#39; him was to drum up support and increase military influence, well, we didn&#39;t do that. At least not til years later. There were no <em>major</em> reductions or increases in military presence following May, 2011. The one that stands out the most is the death of Gaddafi in October. If anyone can point me in the direction of military presence in early 2011, that&#39;d be genuinely great because I can&#39;t find anything specific.</p>

<p>As for the other point, Obama wasn&#39;t particularly unpopular at the time, at least to a good portion of moderates and obviously a majority of the left. What would he have to gain by going through this whole charade? I can&#39;t find any significant Executive Orders or policy pushes following the incident that would have benefited from this exercise. The election was still 1.5 years away. Romney hadn&#39;t even announced his candidacy at this point.</p>

<p>The Patriot Act following the increase in nationalism seems like a pretty good example of government actions benefitting further government control. This whole decade-long con though doesn&#39;t make any sense, especially if the supposed cover-up begin under a different administration. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Timing wise, the killing makes some sense when you take the invasion of Libya into account. OBL was killed in May 2011, after the invasion of Libya had begun in March of 2011. Gaddafi was killed in October of 2011. Perhaps the military thought that the killing of OBL would provide a morale boost needed for the unpopular Libya invasion. Perhaps they intended to set up an Iraq-style puppet government and stay in Libya long term but decided against that because of the lack of public support? Idk but all that happening at the same time is a bit fishy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree that it&#39;s fishy. Multiple military exercises happening in different countries in the same general time frame happens all the time. Libya was a multi-national, NATO-led intervention following the Arab Spring. Killing Gaddafi was seen as a win in the public eye as well. It just seems so unnecessary to conclude a decades-long conspiracy regarding bin Laden in order to win public perception regarding something the general public either didn&#39;t really care about or were in favor of. Why stage a whole ordeal in order to gain public favor when you&#39;re still in the early throes of the intervention? Usually that sorta idea coincides with the lead up to more military presence.</p>

<p>Idk, even if it is fishy and is related, the purpose of keeping bin Laden&#39;s &quot;real&quot; death under wraps is the more important aspect. Why decide back in 2001 to keep it close to the chest? And if they did in fact do so, using his death in 2011 seems real strange. It would have carried over from another administration; an administration who could have used the morale boost a lot more at the time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you’re not seeing the bigger picture; public perception of the invasions of the Middle East ties all these stories together (and they are all related due to US foreign policy). Killing Osama will have an effect on perception of ongoing operations in Libya. </p>

<p>Also- I disagree that the killing of Gaddafi was viewed positively by the American public. Many thought it was barbaric (he was impaled up the ass in the streets begging for his life). 
The public wouldn’t be fooled for the third time - they knew that the invasion would cause yet another country to descend into chaos and sectarian violence. Libya is considered the largest stain on Obama’s legacy and played a major role in <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgcd1ghag5Y">Secretary Clinton losing the election.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>47% of Americans disagreed with the whole Libyan intervention in March, 2011. You&#39;re right. Public opinion was not in their favor. </p>

<p>Despite the video of his death coming out the following days, the overall international response was positive. Many disagreed that he should have been killed and instead tried for his crimes, but the reactions were still overwhelmingly positive. It&#39;s the aftermath of and subsequent mishandling of Libyan rebuilding that Obama claimed was his biggest failure. He of course had reservations about the initial conflict, but following Gaddafi&#39;s death was pretty confident that &quot;the shadow of tyranny over Libya has been lifted.&quot;</p>

<p>So what we&#39;re dealing with here is the proposed idea that &#39;killing&#39; bin Laden was done as a means to boost morale during the Libya intervention. At this point, the American people disagree with our involvement in Libya because it&#39;s further conflict we don&#39;t want and because of the way Obama seemingly pushed it forward without a deadlocked congress.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/libya-conflict-reactions-world">https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/30/libya-conflict-reactions-world</a></p>

<p>So we go into Libya in March 2011. We don&#39;t have the foresight to examine possible outcomes and we certainly don&#39;t have the foresight to plan pretty much anything post-combat. This is an operation carried out by several countries. And yet, a small sect of the administration has not only the resources but the ability to carry out a conspiracy whose only real purpose is to boost public opinion? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right in that it puts out a name and a face for us to rally against. However, why go through the supposed charade of &#39;killing&#39; him? Conspiracies are risky, even for powerful people. Why go through all the effort of keeping people quiet (for a decade preceding as well) for such an insignificant thing? They didn&#39;t need public opinion to further (or withdraw) military involvement. Especially following the economic collapse in 08, it&#39;s been pretty clear that the government doesn&#39;t give a shit what the overwhelming majority think in regards to military operations.</p>

<p>Saying that we need a boogie man so that we can kill him and move on to the next boogie man doesn&#39;t make sense. ISIS would have become the next boogie man regardless. Why wait around to destroy the head in the eyes of the public if we&#39;re still openly attacking the body? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful you cant use sound logic or question the conspiracies here.... But you are exactly right I feel the same in the end result doesnt match what the conspiracy says. A lot of this comes from national security and doing illegal shit in war. Like doing a military operations in a foreign country without even letting them know. Also if this wasnt true as a sailor myself to there would be far more evidence that it was faked. No secrets on a ship.... Plus the people involved with the operation once they get out of active duty.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By biggest issue is with the idea that it was done to sway public opinion, whether it be on Libya, Obama himself, the administration, whatever. Could you imagine if public opinion actually swayed the way the government does things? Obama didn&#39;t need us to see him as the bin Laden-killing hero to do whatever this would have been used as.</p>

<p>It seems very strange when conspiracies are brought up that have no motivation. At least give us a theory as to why it would be done. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you’re not seeing the bigger picture; public perception of the invasions of the Middle East ties all these stories together (and they are all related due to US foreign policy). Killing Osama will have an effect on perception of ongoing operations in Libya. </p>

<p>Also- I disagree that the killing of Gaddafi was viewed positively by the American public. Many thought it was barbaric (he was impaled up the ass in the streets begging for his life). 
The public wouldn’t be fooled for the third time - they knew that the invasion would cause yet another country to descend into chaos and sectarian violence. Libya is considered the largest stain on Obama’s legacy and played a major role in <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgcd1ghag5Y">Secretary Clinton losing the election.</a></p>
