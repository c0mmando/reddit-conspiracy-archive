<p>A lot of people said the same about why weed is illegal, yet it&#39;s becoming increasingly legal... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money is a huge incentive, both in terms of direct taxation and the creation of a &quot;new&quot; industry which creates its own economic growth through ordinary economics -- jobs, capital spending, business-business spending, etc.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the idea that politicians, especially Republicans, see legalizing pot as a way of politically co-opting some segments of the population.  If pot is legal and it manages to reduce police harassment of minorities, this could in theory make Republicans somehow more appealing to some subsets of the minority population that are more conservative, church-going types. </p>

<p>You would think Democrats would go all-in for legalization to steal the issue completely from Republicans, but my guess is they fear looking too liberal if they support it.  It&#39;s funny how Republicans could improve their image by supporting legalization but Democrats are too worried it will damage their reputation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s address this. The reason that cannabis is legal in eight states plus Washington D.C. and very soon Canada is because of grassroots activists- like me and many people I know- working really, really hard to make it happen. Not because the Drug War creepballs woke up one day and decided to be nice. Psychedelics will be a tougher battle; the powers that be desperately don&#39;t want them legal, as they open people up to rebellious thoughts and were seen as partly responsible for the uprisings and counterculture of the 1960&#39;s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the age of 14-18 I was into Magic Mushrooms and LSD, both substances allowed me to see through the cloud of bullshit that is life. </p>

<p>Within the last week, I met my weed man, he happened to have tabs of LSD, I&#39;m thinking fuck me it&#39;s been over 20 years since I dropped, I said let me have 10 tabs pls. </p>

<p>On the way home, took half a tab, got to be safe with LSD take your time and feel your way into in. </p>

<p>1 hour later, I forgot I dropped the LSD, was sitting on my balcony in the evening, sipping a cold beer and smoking a Joint. The trees and clouds took on a different texture, I was blowing away by the beauty that was all around me, I could hear every animal, every bird, could hear silence it was magical and a nice small trip. </p>

<p>I felt grounded, my vibrations with everything around me was in tune, I can calm, my mind was still everything around me had purpose.</p>

<p>The next day, i dropped about 2 tabs, I made up about 3 Joints and jumped into the car and drove out to the forest / rivers and spent time in Nature, man, 2 tabs hit me hard at one point, as it peaked I felt out of whack, I grounded myself, took shoes off and waded into the river, the water was so cold and beautiful, everything around me was sparkling, shinny and beaituful .</p>

<p>After 20 years from my last trip, I enjoyed having my mind opened once again. I feel being more mature enhanced the trip for me. As I said, my vibration changed and felt in sync, meditation was a natural instinct to watch my breathing and to be mindful of everything around me. </p>

<p>I still have about 6 tabs left, stored away for the next time, not sure when that will be nice its nice to have some LSD offside to use when the time is right.</p>

<p>For younger inexperienced folks, be careful, LSD is no Joke and I have see many people slip into a bad trip when their EGO is stripped, they are vulnerable and can&#39;t handle it, watch out for your friends while experimenting with LSD. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a drug so like all others the whole gamut of negatives and positives apply. I hate the judgemental attitudes that are unfortunately quite common in regards to drugs, Weareone2 described it really well though.</p>

<p>I think people would be surprised at how many normal, functional, hard working members of society their are at levels that could be considered at addiction level. I realize LSD addiction would be rarely seen at treatment centers and I&#39;ve gone off topic but maybe, one person might read this and be aware of the high horse they perhaps they sit on. Drinking 12 beers and hitting the bong every night doesn&#39;t make you any better than someone who may like amphetamines etc.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy into the whole &#39;spirituality&#39; crock pot, bullshit, spin that some LSD users love to put on it. It&#39;s a bit of fun for x amount of hours in my book. Mostly laughing like a kid, chatting away, colors being brighter and slight visuals. 250ug is the largest dose I&#39;ve done at once with the most common being 150ug. A mate will do 700ug....fuckedif I know what out of space entities he bumps into, but I&#39;ll always ask him to say g&#39;day for me if I hear him and his missus are getting on it.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief LSD will not absorb through your skin and cause you to trip, David Nichols is a well respected chemist who has synthesized lsd and talked about this, one of his graduate students even painted his arm with a solution of DMSO and LSD.</p>

<p>So what happened to Hoffman then? Apparently he had another&quot;mystical&quot; experience as a kid, so he may have been predisposed to them, but what are the odds that would happen while he was working with lsd? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a few good trips, some of them really expanded my outlook. On another trip I was convinced I understood how it all worked, how to play the game, followed by sitting quietly on a couch trying to prevent reality from falling apart or ending up in another parallel timeline. And my worst trip, long story short, I thought I died, and I stood in a closet for over an hour trying to decide what to do. Then, after I exited, it certainly didn&#39;t help when I asked my friends if I was dead and they said yes. Fuckers lmao.</p>

<p>Interesting shit LSD is. Still haven&#39;t tried it just alone in an ideal setting. That&#39;ll be good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It matters what your state of mind is when you use it. My opinion is that its not a party drug and using it for &quot;fun&quot; is a misuse. I think it opens your brain to new possibilities in terms of <em>how</em> you think. With your perceptions skewed in ways you would never have dreamed up on your own it can create opportunities to break out of your programmed way of thinking about the world other people and yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a problem with LSD, but I don&#39;t consume it anymore. I have a problem with all the research chemicals people/young adults are consuming. We don&#39;t know much about some of them and a lot them get passed off as Acid or L but in reality they could be something far more sinister. </p>

<p>I tend to stick to mushrooms or stuff that is more obvious or testable by kit. </p>

<p>People should always be careful what they consume and should be aware of their surroundings during these extracurriculars. </p>

<p>Its use made soldiers more likely to question orders, it made society at large more prone to thinking outside the box.....</p>

<p>A country where substances like LSD are legal is also a country that is an infinitely harder one for our government, and for the interests that control it, to control. </p>
