       There are a lot of knowledgeable souls in this sub in regards to ancient history, and vatican history. I am curious about your guys opinions into Pope Francis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does he signify the end of Rome? There are so many scriptures/prophecies and manuscripts detailing a last pope and the times we are in currently. I really truly feel we are at a cross roads as a species, about to make the harvest into a higher dimension of consciousness. (Look into the Law of One if you are curious, it is amazing stuff)
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to hear your guys opinions. Feel free to share links or articles. I am doing research on this right now and trying to connect a few puzzles and could use your guys opinions on Pope Francis occupying the throne. Also, I have always been pretty disturbed by the symbolism within the Vatican itself... That deserves a whole different topic but I am convinced that the luciferians got a pope into the vatican. Let me know what you think.

       In The Fatima Crusader article, Malachi Martin, a scholar, Vatican insider, and best-selling author, said, “Anybody who is acquainted with the state of affairs in the Vatican in the last 35 years is well aware that the prince of darkness has had and still has his surrogates in the court of St. Peter in Rome.”

       Of course the popes are part of the club... just look at them! Empty your mind of all thoughts and stare at any pic of the last pope for a few mins and tell me what you see. Pure evil. Also notice how the American media glorifies their parades, if they weren’t part of the club they would criticize them and not show even a clip of their stuff.

       Well, not everyone is on the same page and I was hoping this would spark some discussion and maybe help people get up to speed or atleast researching this
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not done much study into christian theology as you can probably tell I just know the basics and was hoping someone more informed may discuss the matter with their own expertise and experience.

       I totally forgot about that sub, i appreciate the reminder. Going to browse through now :) In regards to the power preists hold, its pretty ridiculous, it also pisses me off how molestor preists get shuffled around and never face justice. Seems pope francis could do something but hasnt yet (as far as im aware)

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”  They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”  Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”

       I don't know if Jesus would believe a pope should exist, but that's the biblical underpinnings for the existence of a pope.

       To answer your question, yes and no.  I'm personally somewhere on the agnostic spectrum about it all, personally, so I don't give much credence to them as far as my personal spirituality is concerned, but they are interesting from a historical perspective.

       from a historical perspective, the texts are incredibly interesting, as well as informative in regards to what the roman church would have you not pay attention to. enoch for example illumines to why god keeps referring to himself in third person.. he's not alone.

Also notice how the American media always treats his visits and parades, always in a positive light. Yet they trash Jesus and call his mom a whore any chance they get.

        Is Pope Francis a false pope?
        <br/>
        No
        <br/>
        Or even a false prophet?
        <br/>
        He's not a prophet at all.
        <br/>
        Is he the last pope that has been rumored about?
        <br/>
        Probably not.
        <br/>
        Will the fall of Rome follow after Francis?
        <br/>
        Probably not.
