       According to their link in the sub it was started by Brandon Straken a failed actor.

       #WalkAway reaction in a nutshell
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, some democrats have used the hashtag, circulated a video of some guy who was saying why he was leaving the democrats etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       The response was to call them all bots regardless of whether or not the campaign was grassroots or not, a couple "russian linked" accounts was enough to run articles calling it a russian op
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was one of the people walking away, this kind of doubling down and alienating of a position would just make me run

       MAGA and drain the swamp have been nothing but dogwhistles and buzzwords since day 1. It’s like the 76ers “Trust the process” but instead of embiid simmons fultz you get corporate tax cuts, deregulation, and a bigger military budget

       This seems to suggest there's a point in the past being looked at as "Great".  Assuming the country isn't great now, for whatever reasons you feel like, then when exactly was it great and for what reasons?

       Democrats blame everything on anything but themselves. They still can't believe they lost so they blame everything on Russia. It's pathetic, just like how they blame their lack of success on racism or whatever other bullshit excuse they can come up with.

       Pretty obvious I think. If you're leaving the Democratic Party because of racists and xenophobes being publicly shamed, then I doubt you were ever a liberal to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only ones walking away from the party are those who don't think it's acting in the best interest of the progressive cause, not because it's not conservative enough.

       walking away from being a democrat. I did it in 2016 and many others have done so even prior to thw walk away movement. Recently Canndace Owens and Kanye West have walked away and told others as well to stop living on the mental victim card plantation that Democrats use to keep their followers enslaved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The walk away movement might be a psy op, or might be legit considering many organic folks have walked away from DNC

       Jesus christ. You think people dont like Trump simply because hes a dude? That's hilarious. And would you like me to dig up a couple links to show how racist some people on your team are? Then I could pretend it applies to all of you. And I could easily do the same with xenophobia. Then I should just use those few links to apply it to every single one of your right?

       That's literally what the study found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know that signs denying liberals don't want to believe in it. But the study for those that didn't read it. It swapped the genders of the two candidates in a perfect reenactment of the debates. They matched everything from the tone of the voice to the hand gestures to how they said each word.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing different was Trump was played by a woman and Hillary was played by a man. And the liberal audience ended up preferring the female version of trump to the male version of Hillary Hillary

       You can tell Tulsi is the real deal by the amount of hit pieces that pop up everytime she pops into the spotlight. I spent 20 minutes talking with her about issues and she basically lines up with me nearly 100%. She doesnt play the bs dnc game. She actually represents her constituents and probably could easily win a general election. She is attractive. Her views line up with a majority of independents and she is a veteran with a combat medic badge. Shes left where she needs to be while not selling out to identity politics.

       They use her opposition to gay marriage back in the day against her while giving every establishment democrat a pass.  Progressives in this country suck chowder. They dont stand on principals just whatever the actual enemy tells them to ve angry about.

       Bernie ran againat the tpp and ot was a major selling point for him to actual middle class progressives.

       Yeah, I was born and raised in a major city and this is just what you always were, and the GOP were always the bad guys. Dems were always for human rights, equality, etc. However, I watched nothing change in my city under democrats, and watched my city fail with budgeting, having to take out loans to pay the pensions, sell out their Parking meters to Saudi Arabia (selling out local infrastructure to foreign powers) and not do anything about the struggling neighborhoods and high crime rates, and this Democratically controlled city now has the highest number of people moving out in the entire country.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, there is a major exodus of people moving out from Democratic Cities/States because Democrats always fuck up everything thy are in charge of:

       And because of the Exodus, they will have to raise Taxes on everyone who stays, and I am already living in a state with the 2nd highest real estate tax rates in the country, plus they are talking about raising them more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary was the nail in the coffin for me to leave, and now just hearing Maxine Waters talk, Diane Feinstein, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, etc just hearing them talk, and the victimization mentality of Democrats where everything is always complaining, always a victim, always negative, and now attacking GOP cabinet members at restaurants, Antifa, wanting wide open borders, and so on....its all over for them. I will never ever go back and many people are waking up to this and leaving

       The DNC would rather use white noise machines, kick out those who don't kneel at the alter of their chosen, gift super delegates, gag order friendly media, organize paid "grassroot" movements than just face the fact that they have lost the left.

       No, I voted for him and felt sick because I intuited he was a Manchurian candidiate and that nothing would change. That same year after he won I found out about him being born in Kenya and being funded by the Saudis and I wanted to fucking puke and from there on was anti-Obama

       most dems are stupid, especially the ones that are born into it and dont do their homework. Once you really dig in and see that Dems were once the parts of slavery, are owned by Saudi and Israeli interest, Banksters and Lobbysists, and hear idiots like Maxine Waters, Diane Fienstein, Pelosi, and Schumer open their stupid manchurian cake holes, it all starts to make sense how this is the party owned by the globalists, corporations, banksters, and New World Order.

       When you figure that out and read supporting books, documentaries, and watch appropriate videos  lining this all out, its impossible to ever be for the party of victimization mentality and zero change.

       They rigged the primaries against Bernie Sanders, changed the rules to Sanders cannot run as a Democrat again.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is good for the DNC. Once their party is completely destroyed in November, they will be forced to purge their corrupt leadership and adopt a more centrist position.

       This knee jerk reaction and lack of reasoning is really ugly.  Donald Trump is president right now because of idiots like you.  You've got to get a grip on reality.  The DNC is corrupt.  How many times have people had to stop down in the last few years from the upper echelons?  At least 6 people that I can think of.  Did you read any wikileaks?  You are disgusting.

If you want to treat Wikileaks like it's a neutral source, you can't ignore the numerous times it's opted to redact or even outright rail against information that struck a nerve with a certain benefactor of theirs.

       No.  It's time to call bullshit on the corporate owned dual party system.  Use your head!  Why do you settle for two flavors that both taste like shit?  You know Sanders was screwed.  That means we no longer have a democracy.  We didn't have one anyway, if you look at the left's electoral college.  I think you have a simpleton's view of what is going on.  What is needed are people in prison who deserve it, war mongers especially.  But if you look around, no one is ever held accountable for anything.  Just fuck off.  Please.

       You aren't calling out the dual party system by only looking at one of them. If you want to address the problem it's not to burn down the side that most aligns with you, it's to make a third alternative an actual viable choice. We already see what the third party split does to places like Maine, where a jackass is governor despite his misalignment with the majority of voters.

       We already knew the right is corrupt.  That has been obvious since Reagan.  Jesus.  I'm done with you.  Jesus, it's like you have no criticism of the left, at all-- now why is that?  I brought up at least a half dozen factual, pertinent things, and you simply ignore them.  Pelosi is ancient, and her ideas are ancient.  She's very rich for some reason.  Doesn't that bother you?  Perez is a pathological liar.  The lies just pour out of his mouth.  I know more about the left, because they previously "represented" me.

       This conversation is boring.  Trump will be gone, but the left is still hot garbage, from top to bottom, all war apologists and Israel lap dogs.

       I walked away into a fuck everyone position. I will never associate with the Democratic Party again after the fuckery of 2016. I voted Jill Stein as a fuck you, no regrets.

       That being said I plan on voting Trump 2020 if he continues doing what he is doing. Some things I like, others I don’t. If nothing else he has opened my eyes to how politics really can work. No excuses, just does what he says.

       Can you talk about how you were a Democrat before Donald Trump of all people showed you differently?
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise what's there to drag you back from? It's easy to be a Trump supporter and merely say "I was a Democrat" but few of the #walkaways seem to be able to talk about how liberal they were prior to Trump.

       Well gee, I voted for Obama. I donated a lot of money to Bernie, ummm I fucking organized and funded a Bernie rally in my college town. I have always been an equal rights proponent. My roomate of 3 years was gay, so im not virtue signaling. I am a large proponent of implementing more science and removing religion from government. I am all for LGBTQ rights. I think it has gone too far when it comes to kids. I don't think anyone should be able to undergo HRT before the age of 18. But if you are a well informed adult, you should be able to chop off your dick and attach it to your forehead and call yourself a unicorn for all I care. I am all for rational feminism. I think racists are disgusting pieces of shit. I am in every way a moderate liberal(STILL) when it comes to social issues.

       The republicans still suck, but as far as I am concerned...they suck just a little bit less than the left.

       The GOP is literally headed by a guy who hates that there aren't libel laws preventing people from making fun of him. His supreme court nominee thinks ISPs, those gigantic media behemoths who also conveniently produce a massive amount of content, should be able to dictate what content you have access to, because hey, they're people too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that it's fashionable to hate Tumblr liberals and their cries for censorship of things that don't align with their views, but Tumblr doesn't represent the party.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty to criticise the DNC for but I'm not going to pretend the alternative is better with the Republicans, because its not. The fact that they allow for Trump to run amok only makes them complicit in the harm he does, they don't get a pass because of their inability to do anything about him. He's a distillation of the dog whistle politics Republican media like Fox News has no trouble producing.

       Then what represents the party?  You have your most senior leaders calling for harassment of Trump officials and supporters.

       Short term -&gt; I make more money, so fuck yea tax cut.
Long term -&gt; I would like to see them made permanent. The resulting deficit is pennies on the dollar to what cuts corporations have benfitted from the past several decades.

      </p>
      <p>
       No. Know how I know? the current lobbyists running the EPA are undoing everything done before :) Turns out the energy companies dont want restrictions on things like the "environment" because it hurts profit. I don't really want the EPA to be worried about the viability of coal going forward. I'm kind of a traditionalist, I like the EPA looking out for the environment.

       I don't like Clinton, but I don't hate her either. My support for Sanders didn't put me in direct opposition to everything Clinton stood for, I just don't agree with her on everything. They still put forth a more agreeable candidate than Trump would ever be.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'll say this as a Sanders supporter, he had an uphill climb in 2016 no matter what help the DNC provided Clinton. The system inherently favored her from the start, and Sanders being a relative unknown in the party meant starting from nothing. He did an outstanding job with it, but I can't pretend that the DNC gave the South to Clinton; she was far better known there than Sanders could ever hope to be. They also got to vote first, so despite the South being utterly useless to us in the general, they still had an outsized influence in the primary.

      <p>
       There is no free market for internet service. Most operate as de facto monopolies with incredible hurdles (and occasionally outright laws) that prevent competition. There's a reason why we don't just have private roads everywhere, there's a limit to how much infrastructure is practical, so centralization of key components like roads and internet connectivity are inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot tell me as a proponent of free speech that you agree with being limited to internet access that only aligns with say, Comcast (or whichever of the big three happens to dominate your market, and if it's not the case, then congrats, because it was in everywhere I've ever lived in the country), finds acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an argument with television, because the bandwidth to provide channels is limited, but it doesn't work the same for internet access, where your bandwidth goes has no effect on Comcast's ability to provide you with unhindered access to it.

       Nothing entitles a member of the government freedom from being criticised in person. Threats are unacceptable. Violence is unacceptable, but your actions as a member of the government doesn't mean you get a shield from your conduct being criticised.

       They don't EQUALLY suck, which is a very important distinction. I'm all for change within the DNC. They're far too fixated on internal bureaucratic nonsense for their own good, there's still a hierarchy of sucking that doesn't look too favorably on their opposite number.

       Half of Bernie's campaign wasn't backing out of the TPP. If Trump wants to run on improving social welfare, improving minimum wage, securing socialized healthcare, and helping more Americans get into college, then sure, we can pretend half his campaign was a mirror.

       Bernie soent his entire campaign trashing the dnc and trashing Clinton. Why would a single sanders supporter vote for her or any other corrupt establishment democrat?

       Christ dude, you've got me. His criticism of the Democrats totally aligns him more with Donald Trump now.
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, it's one of the biggest problems of the Republican party that it demands fealty to the party even when someone like Trump wrecks it from within.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bunch of cowards represent the GOP establishment who are too scared to risk upsetting their core base (which continues to shrink as fewer Americans choose to call themselves Republicans) by addressing the problem that is Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sanders criticism of the DNC is valid. The party should not shy from criticism and it's one of the things that aggrivates me about Clinton supporters in that they refuse to accept any failures of her or her campaign or the idea that Sanders might have a point in the failings of the DNC. But that doesn't put Trump anywhere near aligning with Sanders just because they both took issue with the TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is in Brussels today attempting to dismantle NATO from inside, seemingly for no gain but to promote his relationship with Putin (a country with a GDP lower than Italy.) He's spurned our relationship with our closest neighbors, our most dedicated allies, ripped up deals and offered nothing in their wake. And you want to pretend that makes Sanders more in line with Trump than Clinton? Talk about drivel...

       That's what happens when the dnc pushes establishment bullshit and bullshit identity politics. Burn it down. Idgaf. Maybe next time they wont rig the primary for a coerupt establishment center right candidate. The dnc is more right than democrats are.

       Third party is such a hard concept I know
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to reward people that screwed me personally over by voting for them. Thats retarded. I will however laugh as trump wins again until the dnc learns. Ive changes my local party members and pulled more to the actual left than we have center right here any more. Ive done my part. The dnc continues to fail to see why hillary lost nd perpetuate some false russia bs narrative and dozens of otger excuses instead of fixing their shit. So fuck them.

       Third party in a first past the post system inherently rewards the party main party most opposite your views. You cannot fix the two party system by burning down the one closest to you, not without addressing the way we vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not surrendering the future to the Republicans because of my problems with the Democrats. If you want to advocate for ranked voting or something that addresses the lack of nuance in two party voting I'm all for it. But understanding the consequences of a third party vote is critical in a system that will never allow for one to win.

       Same boat. Democrats are almost as annoying as trump supporters at this point no we shouldnt abolish ice that's retarded. No we shouldnt just allow anyone and everyone to come into the country illegally. No we shouldnt join the tpp. Theres so much wrong with thedemocratic party's platform it isnt black and white to sit there and say oh youre a conservative bc you are against establishment democrats and identity politics.

       That's why he totally didn't sell them United States uranium!
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Obama totally didn't support lowering tariffs on Russia or have secret meetings with him!

       Russia's plan is to sow dissonance, and to get Trump elected --- even the senate has admitted that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But okay, maybe it's just a coincidence that Trump almost always does exactly what Putin wants and everybody in the world is wrong.

       You do know that Russia once ruled Ukraine, right and that many in Ukraine supported Russia returning to rule them? You do know that the Ukraining government was so corrupt that their President had to leave the country because he was facing an uprising, right?

       I admit, I have never met with "why the fuck should I care about other countries being invaded?" before and I don't know how to explain world diplomacy and relation to you and why we don't want to set the precedent that it's okay for bigger countries to invade smaller countries just to take their land, and the implications that precedent might have in the long run and the historical reasons why that's a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, let's say that the UK was a superpower and the US wasn't, but it had the same corrupt government it has now. If the UK would invade the US, seeing that it once ruled it, you might think "why the fuck would anybody care about the uk invading the us? fuck everyone that isn't me." Now, the reason why the rest of the world cares, is because COUNTRIES AREN'T ALLOWED TO FUCKING INVADE OTHER COUNTRIES AND ANNEX THEM YOU FUCKING SELF CENTRIC MORON.

       The talking point on reddit to marginalize the movement has been to point to that sub and their mods as proof the whole thing is a psyop… Which is disingenuous honestly.  #walkaway has been all over the news for the past 2 weeks, and the take over of that sub was 5 days ago.  So sure, Trump supports may have taken over that sub, but to act like the entire movement coming from Russia or T_D is kind pathetic.  It's is possible to realize the DNC isn't offering anything besides "we're not trump" and have been center right for years.  I'm always surprised when I hear someone claim to be a liberal or progressive but supports the DNC... The same way I'm surprised by people who claim to be libertarian and support the RNC.  These parties don't represent ether party and are bought and paid for.

       Many people seem to think td is mostly russian bots so it was a bit unclear. Also any proof its russian bots driving the hastag? Russian bots boosting the hashtag doesnt mean that it is a russian psyop that originated in some secret troll base in russia

       This guy gets it. Russia is the msms way to doublespeak about Israel. They can't say Israel without being "anti-Semitic" and their backers would prefer anti Russian propaganda. Still no doubt that Russian intelligence interacts with US politics regularly.

       If you walk away from the Democrat Party generally become more conservative

       And considering the left will even call Sanders a right-winger for not supporting the abolition of ice we can't really take them seriously.

       Wow that’s so crazy. I’m ready to #walkaway right now because an article you read said something bad about Bernie Sanders. The left universally loves Sanders and one person talking bad about him makes me way to #walkaway and become a conservative like Bernie would want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again I heard a republican say that Donald Trump is a bad guy and not a true conservative the other day. (Did you know he just registered republican a few years ago?) Are you ready to #walkaway and not vote republican in 2018 and 2020?

       I wouldn’t say the left “Universally loves Sanders” I feel he has a lot of the same problems as Trump, in that a lot of his views are very Isolationist (he wants to leave pretty much every major trade agreement) - all of the crazy hate fueled bullshit. That being said I wouldn’t say he’s not “On the Left”, because I’m not a moron.

       I just had to look this person up.  I've never heard of her or "The New Republic".  What you don't seem to understand is that, while the left has our share of nut bags, we don't celebrate them like conservatives do.  Shit like this article gains a lot more traction with people like you than it does with the average liberal.

       You have to be careful with those blanket statements.  It's not like it would be hard to find some random idiot who's made a comment like this.  As we all know, some wacko leftist rando's comment on the internet is an exact representation of how every liberal believes.  Obviously, the same rule doesn't apply to conservatives, even when the wacko is Trump.

       What do you mean by culture? Can this term really be applied to an overweight, overmedicated, and overindebted carceral, welfare/warfare slave society?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps the culture whereby men can amputate their testicles and become women, where men can get pregnant and give birth, and where the lower intestine is confused for a sexual organ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I'm trying to make is that culture (civilization, truth), has started being systematically destroyed in the USA a long time ago already. The process is almost complete. It is sad really, as the US is indeed the only nation ever founded on the natural principle of individual liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and the destroyers aren't best described as
       <em>
        Russian

       This hippy liberal walked away from the Democratic party months into Bill Clinton's tenure.  Most of my mainstream liberals walked away this election cycle.  Nifty hashtag but the walkaway has already happened.  Anybody still clinging to "Democrat" is not gonna walkaway.

       Concern trolling would be warning people would walk away, not people walking away and testifying about it.   I want you to keep crashing and burning, I want to hear your cries of impotent rage as you find out you are in the minority except on window licking echo chambers like redditt.  I want to see you learn first hand that when the right reacts it is due to your own overeaching stupidity and unwillingness to leave people the fuck alone.

       It's so funny that every anti-democrat comment on this thread is getting massively downvoted. Even vary mild ones just offering a mild change in opinion. If their are

        Boogie men
       </del>
       "Russian bots" anywhere, they're pushing down any conservative sentiment.

       Bernie soent his entire campaign trashing the dnc and trashing Clinton. Why would a single sanders supporter vote for her or any other corrupt establishment democrat?

       Try harder.

       I really don't get this. You see the walk away thing, so instead of any sort of introspection or considering what they are saying, you immediately attack anyone who identifies with it. To what end are you doing that?

       I don't have to justify myself. Although, I have gone out of my way to with u/zherok.
