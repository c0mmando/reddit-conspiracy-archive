<ol>
<li>Anti Civil rights democrats switched to republican because they suddenly changed their worldviews on racism and identity politics.

2.Anti Civil rights democrats switched to R because of failed economic policies of the D&#39;s.

<li>The demographics of the southern populations changed.

    <div class="md"><p>Not interested in changing your beliefs, I merely responded to your information in a good faith in attempt to explain why the few states altered their voting patterns, hence the word &quot;interpretations&quot;. Just because a few states changed how they voted does not mean the parties switched. Did all blue states turn red and all red states turn blue? Did party platforms swap? No, of course not. So to restate the obvious, there was no party switch.  Also, Nixon was a tool and I wont excuse any racist dumbass regardless their party. (I&#39;m an Independent btw)</p>

<p>Emphasis Mine. I don&#39;t think this will apply as generally as you think. Is trick-or-treating infringing on someone&#39;s protected rights? </p>

Technically it was illegal to wear a thick scarf in winter if it covered your mouth. They fixed that in post, but the hilarity continued with several mascots and advertising costumes prompting police calls.<br/>
In Austria, the police came, checked whether the <a href="https://images.derstandard.at/img/2017/10/20/LegomannKLEINER800pix.jpg?tc=12&amp;amp;s=ecb287ca">culprit</a> was a danger to society and left again...
