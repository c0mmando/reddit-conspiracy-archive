<p>Bill Clinton didn&#39;t do this. DTC advertising by pharmaceutical companies has been going in some form another for decades. [It really took off in the 80&#39;s](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-consumer_advertising">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-consumer_advertising</a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that the first DTC drug ad appeared in 1983, but the government actually asked them to remove the ad immediately. Within another two years the FDA had strict rules on pharmaceutical ads, among which was that the company couldn&#39;t claim a drug treated a specific symptom.</p>

<p>This changed with Clinton, who changed the FDA rules to eliminate the specific symptom rule. </p>

<p><em>Nominal</em> sales for medicines in the US (2017) was 450bn of which Cannabis only accounts for 3.2bn (total).</p>

<p>Thats still a depressing figure.. although its still better than Cannabis being 0.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the 3.2 bn from prescription weed sales only?</p>

<p>I totally get and agree with your point, but in a way, I hope to see the prescription sales of weed super low, aside from CBD.  In CA, the new rules are closer to an alcohol distribution model, moving away from the doctor/prescription choke point.  That model has it&#39;s own problems but at least nobody needs permission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your point, but I don&#39;t think that is always the case. Especially with the present economy and industry, it is difficult for entrepreneurs to break into capitalist markets because of the ubiquity of monopolies and necessity of advertising and marketing. Even when the product is positively revolutionary for millions of people, it can be bought out, drowned out, sabotaged, or flatly ignored. What incentive does a monopoly have to innovate? A government can at least be legally held accountable by its people. </p>

<p>Your reality depends on other people spoon-feeding it to you?</p>

<p>Researchers find that nearly 70 percent of Americans are on at least one prescription drug, and more than half receive at least two prescriptions, reports CBS Atlanta.
Researchers from the Mayo Clinic, a non-profit medical and research center, report that antibiotics, antidepressants and painkiller opioids are the most common prescriptions given to Americans.</p>

<p>Twenty percent of U.S. patients were also found to be on five or more prescription medications. </p>

<p>That&#39;s ridiculous.  People can disbelieve claims or believe a conflicting claim.  You can&#39;t operate  under the assumption that people who don&#39;t know the same things as you are being obtuse.  If you&#39;re trying to make a claim, what the neck is wrong with providing a source?  There&#39;s no good argument for claiming that other people should source your own arguments, that I can think of.  If a shill was doing as you suggest, you would probably find it dishonest or .  It&#39;s just common sense.  You make a claim, you back it up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Demanding a source from someone else while simultaneously refusing to do any searching is just as lazy and irresponsible as OP not posting a source to begin with. </p>

<p>The user you were so passionately defending was claiming that OPs Statement was fiction because:</p>

<p>1 OP didn&#39;t offer a source</p>

<p>2 The user himself didn&#39;t want to bother learning anything for himself</p>

<p>Neither of these address the point that the actual numbers from a credible source more than backed up OPs claim.   </p>

<p>Standing behind the idea that facts aren&#39;t facts just because OP didn&#39;t link to them <strong>is</strong> gaslighting.</p>

<p>Whether OP links to them or not,  the facts remain facts. Whether a user wants to investigate it for themselves or not, the facts remain facts.
Supporting the idea that OP must link to facts or they are fictional is gaslighting,  because the facts in this case can be easily found and neither the actions of OP nor the user he butted heads with will change that. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really care what your personal opinion is,  because you seem quite content to ignore facts if that action bolsters your debate position.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still ridiculous to ask other people to research your own claims. It&#39;s a stupid way to go about things:  I get to throw claims out there, it&#39;s up to everyone else to research my claims.  That sounds like a perfect environment for shills and liars.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s better to do things in a way that works for everyone.  If you are honestly trying to make a point and disseminate accurate information, you can provide a source.

    <div class="md"><p>Not all medications are poison. I&#39;m all for keeping folks that dont need them off of them, but some of us require them to function properly. A lot of the time, misdiagnosis of psychiatric &quot;issues&quot; happen because people are too afraid of someone being outside of the norm, so they slap a label on it and medicate it. Many times, however, the person legitimately has issues and needs the medication to improve their quality of life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder why certain ailments seem so commonplace that nearly everyone has them.</p>

<p>Why is self harm such a common practice now?  It seems like in the early 2000&#39;s suddenly most teenage girls started cutting.  All but one of the girls I&#39;ve been in a relationship with has at least a few scars from middle school or high school when they cut briefly.</p>

<p>Do any older people have stories of that?  Was it just some weird cultural fad in the West?</p>

<p>Why do so many have depression?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, if someone offers a source, I check it out and I admit I&#39;m wrong if I believe it contradicts my position.  I&#39;m very proud of myself that I can usually admit when I&#39;m wrong, because my natural reaction is to be an asshole. </p>

<p>It&#39;s still ridiculous to ask other people to research your own claims. It&#39;s a stupid way to go about things:  I get to throw claims out there, it&#39;s up to everyone else to research my claims.  That sounds like a perfect environment for shills and liars.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s better to do things in a way that works for everyone.  If you are honestly trying to make a point and disseminate accurate information, you can provide a source.  You can&#39;t assume everyone should have the same knowledge or even be able to find the same sources that informed your argument.  </p>
