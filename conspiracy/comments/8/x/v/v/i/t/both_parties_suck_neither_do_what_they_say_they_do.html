        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I‚Äôm reading all this #walkaway stuff, which is clearly at least partially artificial, like anything we read. And it‚Äôs getting me depressed. I just screenshotted three posts that painted Trump 10x worse than Satan. Like every negative adjective you can imagine. At the same time people are painting him as a hero when it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs just as influenced as any other politician. He‚Äôs human just like the rest of us. Which is to say, shit. I really see the divide growing and it‚Äôs scary. Two different imaginary worlds ready to actually fight in the street. It‚Äôs true really, I live in a big city and people are crazy mad. I have friends that also secretly think he‚Äôs some time traveling hero with meme magic. It‚Äôs so bizarre this divide. I don‚Äôt want to say it‚Äôs the Russians but anyone, probably the entire rest of the world, that wants to see the US weakened, it‚Äôs happening. I just wish we could all come back to reality and see how close we are to one another in policy and thought. That our lifestyles and standards of living are almost identical. The left isn‚Äôt going to take your guns and the right isn‚Äôt going to put you in concentration camps. Seriously thank fucking god for the constitution and this excruciatingly slow version of government our forefathers built. One side thinks we are living in fascist Germany and the other thinks Soviet Russia. For fucks sake it‚Äôs neither. Yes there are powers at play and we need to be aware and I‚Äôm all for this heightened level of scrutiny that both sides have seemed to have adopted. BUT ITS NOT US THE PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE WHO LEAN RIGHT ARNT ALL RACIST FASCIST AND THE PEOPLE WHO LEAN LEFT AREN‚ÄôT ALL GLOBALIST COMMUNIST. Fuckkkkkk. Let the politicians do there thing. Be aware and involved. But don‚Äôt tie these power hungry maniacs to the rest of us. AND DONT BLINDLY SUPPORT SHIT EITHER! That should go without saying. Forget about what party you hate. Build your own fucking platform. Mines called fucking bitches and making money. We are in this together people. Come back to reality. I know I‚Äôm preaching to the choir, for the most part. Sadly I could only say this in a place called ‚ÄúConspiracy‚Äù for some reason. But im scared and I just want people to come to there senses. Are we too far gone? Can we ever talk again with out bring up Russians bots or share blue shills? How can we get back to a place where we live in the now, how things are now, and how we might want them to be in the future? /rant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been left my whole life but I&#39;m so disgusted at what the general voice of the left has become over the past few years. The left used to pride (pretentious or not) on how they were generally more about equality, more capable of rational debate, anti harassment, don&#39;t make fun of people&#39;s physical appearances, acceptance, etc etc. Since Hillary, the left still claims to be all those things but their actions are so much more toxic and vile than anything they reprimand the right for. Doesn&#39;t mean I lean right now, but I&#39;m going to continue to boycott these disgusting mindless mobs on the left. They&#39;re going against all the ideologies they claim to support. They don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re supporting, they just blindly follow and worship whatever &#39;team&#39; is mentioned by trend pieces and twitter celebrities, all the while acting like linch mobs. They&#39;re too irrational to talk to, just gotta dodge them and hope they burn out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are mindless mobs on both sides here. Since when has the left decided making fun of people is off limits?

<p>Lol, so, since the 90s? </p>

<p>OFC, there are insane SJWs on the left, but if you think they represent any sort of plurality or majority, you&#39;re just wrong man. They are just super vocal, same as the rabid Trump supporters. I mean seriously, do you KNOW anyone irl who behaves the way you described? I highly doubt it, so don&#39;t buy into the false narrative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, on phone and was trying add an edit for clarity but deleted by accident. Watch as you tin foil that one. Actually pretty mad my it&#39;s gone, I thought it was very coherent. Oh well, it was up long enough to get scraped, so easy to find if anybody cares. </p>

<p>I obviously meant since the Hillary shitstorm that was in this last election. The emails, dirty on Bernie, Trump, social media sports team style politics explosion, all of this recent shit. That&#39;s when it started. It wasn&#39;t anywhere near this level of toxicity pre emails. Like I said, I&#39;m still left, I just want to be so far detached from the majority of the top voices yelling the loudest &#39;for the left&#39; who I disagree with. </p>

<p>You bring up Trump. We all know. We all fucking know. The whole point of my post about my issues with the current image of the left, yes my left, was my frustration of them failing to even get as far as to look at what they&#39;re doing wrong before looking at what others are doing wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the sake of transparency, here&#39;s a scraped copy of the deleted top level comment: </p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been left my whole life but I&#39;m so disgusted at what the general voice of the left has become over the past few years. The left used to pride (pretentious or not) on how they were generally more about equality, more capable of rational debate, anti harassment, don&#39;t make fun of people&#39;s physical appearances, acceptance, etc etc. Since Hillary, the left still claims to be all those things but their actions are so much more toxic and vile than anything they reprimand the right for. Doesn&#39;t mean I lean right now, but I&#39;m going to continue to boycott these disgusting mindless mobs on the left. They&#39;re going against all the ideologies they claim to support. They don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re supporting, they just blindly follow and worship whatever &#39;team&#39; is mentioned by trend pieces and twitter celebrities, all the while acting like linch mobs. They&#39;re too irrational to talk to, just gotta dodge them and hope they burn out.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people fail to realize that their job is MEDIA deconstruction and criticizing. So when someone like Trump comes out and talks about fake news and how the media is the enemy of the people, they don&#39;t really have any choice but to agree with that. They don&#39;t agree with his policies, and have criticized him on many occasions. But if your attention span doesn&#39;t hold up, you&#39;d never know that. It&#39;s a lengthy process twice a week. </p>

<p>More than partially, it&#39;s the same as all the people who claimed to be ex-Bernie supporters who moved onto Trump, which made less than 0 sense. </p>

<p>Also, just a heads up, but Trump is far, far, worse than the average person. He has built his brand on lies and cons, his entire image is a disgusting fabrication. Whatever you think of the state of this country, or the direction it&#39;s headed, remember that the people are generally good, and simply wants the best for his/her fellow citizens and nation, but we&#39;ve been bombarded by so much shit that we have become ADAMANTLY convinced about what the cause of our problems are, to the point that we are essentially attack dogs, acting on the whims of those who control the narrative.</p>

Look i know most of you guys here are paranoid but cmon if you cant see the difference in Trump for DECADES then any effort to change your mind is wasting my time. I dont even care if you believe it or not because I do and I have watched all his moves since his inauguration.

<p>Weird how they tricked all these people who believed in all this stuff to be on the other side of it. The NRA wasn&#39;t an arming people to fight against a tyrannical government, they were arming them to fight FOR a tyrannical government. That&#39;s why year after year they whipped up the frenzy about Democrats wanting to take your guns. All this did was boost gun sales. What a genius plan too. All the people who are afraid of NWO, they tricked them into initiating the plan themselves. </p>

<p>The difference in Trump is that he is a pathological liar and a malignant narcissist. I have watched all of this from the beginning and I have learned all the psychology behind all of this. My experience tells me those that speak the way you do and have have undying loyalty to Trump are delusional narcissists themselves. They cannot see their own flaws so they cannot see flaws in Trump.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t read their minds just by looking at them. I can assess certain things about them by the words they say and how they say them by observing how they respond to information, especially information that paints Trump in a negative light. It&#39;s such a giant tell that I can already assess several things about them. They&#39;re either completely ignorant, delusional or they&#39;re a narcissist. Or more likely, all three. They&#39;ll use certain defense mechanisms to avoid cognitive dissonance. When they start using those mechanisms in regards to information about Trump, boom, I&#39;ve most likely found a delusional narcissist. And looks like I&#39;m talking to one right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People cling to their side despite what a lot of the vocal minority spout and when they do, that minority starts to grow.</p>

<p>If you separate our two political parties by their most fundamental ideology, the divisiveness is easy to exploit. We have a side that wants less federal control and one that wants government to be an extension of society. You start throwing in taxes and budgets and, god forbid, immigration and the arming of civilians, people tend to see every issue as an assault on their own core political beliefs. Especially when the ones they&#39;ve chosen to represent their community are openly and gleefully corrupt. It&#39;s constantly &#39;us vs them.&#39;</p>

<p>The core principles of each side are getting skewed and each side has their own mouthpieces for what represents themselves at their worst. Trump is intentionally divisive. He uses rhetoric and fear mongering to energize those that agree with him. Other candidates on either side were never intentionally divisive. Corrupt to their core, unlikable, out-of-touch, elitist, unqualified - absolutely. But all of them tried to bridge the divides because that&#39;s the only thing that gets them reelected.</p>

<p>Populism works because it angers people. It emboldens people. Trump didn&#39;t run on policies, he ran on the supposed idea that he was giving power to the people. Even people who don&#39;t agree with the specifics like that idea. It&#39;s the same reason religion is still around (regardless of the existence of a god) - it makes people feel part of the greater good.</p>

<p>As long as everyone feels important, they&#39;re gonna feel like their opinion is too. And for the opposition, it only angers them because now their validation is on the line. We managed to work, politically, as a country because of checks and balances. Populism at its core isn&#39;t about that.</p>

<p>If we get into a spiral of more populist movements, it&#39;s going to take a lot of time and healing to restore any normality, regardless of party or ideals. It&#39;s historically happened on both the left and right; all it needs is people to be divided in order to thrive. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What about continuing the illegal drug war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the DNC Platform:</p>

<p><em>The &quot;war on drugs&quot; has led to the imprisonment of millions of Americans, disproportionately people of color, without reducing drug use. Whenever possible, Democrats will prioritize prevention and treatment over incarceration when tackling addiction and substance use disorder. We will build on effective models of drug courts, veterans‚Äô courts, and other diversionary programs that seek to give nonviolent offenders opportunities for rehabilitation as opposed to incarceration.</em></p>

<p><em>Because of conflicting federal and state laws concerning marijuana, we encourage the federal government to remove marijuana from the list of ‚ÄúSchedule 1&quot; federal controlled substances and to appropriately regulate it, providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization. We believe that the states should be laboratories of democracy on the issue of marijuana, and those states that want to decriminalize it or provide access to medical marijuana should be able to do so. We support policies that will allow more research on marijuana, as well as reforming our laws to allow legal marijuana businesses to exist without uncertainty. And we recognize our current marijuana laws have had an unacceptable disparate impact in terms of arrest rates for African Americans that far outstrip arrest rates for whites, despite similar usage rates.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>as well as the illegal wars America is involved in overseas?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>147 Democrats voted against the Iraq War. Only 7 Republicans did. </p>

<p>Yes the majority of house democrats voted against the Iraq war, but the majority of senate democrats voted for the Iraq war. There is a bit of a difference here, but not enough to matter. You probably know the AUMF had full bipartisan support.</p>

<p>Wall St</p>

<p>Sure dems have some token regulatory bodies but did they not bail out Wall St when the time came? Obama took tons of Wall St money, they all do.</p>

<p>Israel</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if one party supports a two state solution and the other doesn&#39;t. The foreign aid is never questioned and all partisanship is forgotten yearly at AIPAC. Only Sanders in 2018 is finally starting to talk about Palestinian human rights. And how much backlash has he taken from dems?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are too far gone man. Im sorry to say. Both sides even got chances to redeem themselves with a very special candidates who attracted millennials and crowd sizes that made TPTB shit bricks. Ron Paul and Bernie Sanders were the only two people who genuinely brought REAL issues to the debate floor and wanted to fix them for sake of the country and the people. Thats what made them admirable. The care to actually talk about the elephant in the room and not distraction dog whistle topics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this. Both parties intentionally sabotaged those candidates: I wasn‚Äôt out there with Bernie because I was already a bit jaded by then and knew the fix was in. I went out there for Ron Paul. I campaigned and protested, and we couldn‚Äôt make any headway. The party rigged the 2008 and 2012 primaries. The republican media made Ron paul look and sound crazy and we were all ridiculed for supporting him. </p>

<p>The talking points I see across all media outlets are too powerful. They are created on such a high level to bring the viewers down to the lowest level possible. What‚Äôs more, day to day the points are inconsistent and meant to make the people who repeat them look bad. You can make headway with someone one day then they go listen to the news and the slate is wiped clean the next day. </p>

<p>We have also lost allies. At one time alex Jones was pretty useful, now he sold out to Trump for a payday - the 2005 alex Jones would hate the 2018 alex Jones. </p>

<p>The democrats rigged their primary for Hilary Clinton to win. Trumps primary was rigged too because it was flooded with 17 guys many similar to each other to divide up the demographic pie chart so they canceled each other out. The media focused on trump and he won easily. Trump was there to make Hilary Clinton look good by comparison and he couldn‚Äôt even do that. We forgot he was friends with Hilary and a long time democrat (most of his cabinet and advisors are neoliberal democrats). Ivanka and Chelsea are friends, and he and his family are neoliberals pretending to be patriots. </p>

<p>Through each step many of us have lost friends over brainwashing, and it is a very sad thing. I don‚Äôt think this country can be salvaged without going through absolute hell in the form of austerity and a brutal authoritarian state. That might be the only way people will learn. The media is far too powerful. </p>

Yesterday myself and two other roommates were talking about the soccer kids being rescued and somehow got on the subject of 911.</p>

<p>First a little back round. . in 45yo and grew up in suburban Chicago....
My two roommates 51yo and 58yo both grew up in the inner city projects.....</p>

<p>So, we start talking 911 and i started with ...</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t comprehend the fact there are people who think some cave dweller plotted the greatest attack in history...
John looks at me and says what do you mean?
I respond with...its ridiculous people actually believe 2 planes destroyed 3 buildings and believe planes crashed into the Pentagon and in PA with zero wreckage at the other 2...</p>

<p>The both of them looked at me like I had six eyeballs and horns sticking out of my head.</p>

<p>I knew from this point on shit was going to get real.</p>

<p>I start going over molten steel, multiple explosions, dancing Jews and Larry.</p>

<p>Both of them wanted to fight me around the 10 min mark</p>

<p>They had zero clue what I was talking about and for 15 years not once had either of them heard of anything I was talking about.</p>

<p>I just changed the subject as I knew there was no hope for them no matter what I told them or showed them.</p>

<p>How are people so far from reality?
I just don&#39;t get it...however... I finally started to understand how and why our country is in the pitiful shape it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As some one who grew up in foster care and was separated painfully from their family, I feel for these kids more than most. However to call them internment camps is disingenuous. And exactly what I‚Äôm talking about when I mention using hyperbole to describe the other side. At least say ‚ÄúTrumps Admin‚Äù and not the ‚Äúright‚Äù. Just because someone wanted the next Supreme Court judge to be conservative and voted for Trump, doesn‚Äôt mean they themselves have been putting kids in camps as you put it. At the very least let‚Äôs stop conflating everyday people with the worst versions of their party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is calling them internment camps disingenuous?  How do they differ from an internment camp?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t say that people who voted for Trump have been putting kids in cages.  They didn&#39;t know what Trump would do when they voted for him.  They know now.  So, if they continue to support the Trump Administration with full knowledge of what he&#39;s doing, it&#39;s reasonable to assume they support kids in cages.  The right supports the Trump Administration at rates of 80-90%, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hyperbole to say that the right supports kiddie internment camps.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See it&#39;s this dehumanizing aspect that I can&#39;t wrap my head around. How you can honestly believe that ~30% of Americans are literal monsters that want kids in internment camps.</p>

<p>I think people generally want good, but that often comes with the bad. And like adults they take the good with the bad and try to maximize the good and minimize the bad.</p>

<p>To give a horrible example: No one want&#39;s to hit kids or make them cry, but parents do all the time to teach them discipline and life lessons. </p>

<p>This is a shitty outcome from a complicated issue. But to think that people literally want children in cages is just ignorant. It&#39;s propaganda dehumanizing the enemy. </p>

<p>And for real dude if I thought there were literal concentration camps for kids I would go do something about it. You seem content to use it as a talking point however. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t honestly believe that.  I believe that 30% of Americans are, to some degree, and quite few of that 30% to a large degree, willing to compromise on child internment camps.  What they individually feel they&#39;re getting from Trump, in their minds, is worth turning a blind eye to kiddie internment camps for.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m doing the best I can do about it.  I call my Congressman about it.  I call my two Senators about it.  I volunteer whatever I can, in time and money, to politicians who oppose this policy.  And yes, I do talk about it.  I&#39;m not going to fight, what I feel is criminality, with criminality, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re implying I should do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a German, and these aren&#39;t anything close to concentration camps, as were done by them.  These are American-style internment camps and I&#39;m an American.  And in America, we fought Internment Camps through the legal method.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with that, but for one, I&#39;m not on Reddit to politic.  I&#39;m here to give my individual point-of-view on any topic I come across, like every other jackass here.  And for two, the Stalinist, communist, tree hugging, latte&#39; sipping, unamerican, unpatriotic, terrorist sympathizing, SJW, Feminazi, cuck, Neville Chaimberlain, snowflake, part of the political spectrum didn&#39;t create this climate of &quot;extreme politicking&quot; you see currently.

<p>These &quot;camps&quot; to me see more like holding cells for newly arrested prisoner&#39;s children. Complicated by the fact that they are not US citizens and that we obviously don&#39;t have the resources to house them all appropriately. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like we rounded people up and through them in camps because of their race or possible political affiliation. That&#39;s how I feel they differ anyway. We probably agree 100% and just like different names for them. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an equal amount of derogatory terms for the right as well. I&#39;m asking both to disarm unilaterally. I don&#39;t care who started it. </p>

<p>You realize you just typed this out, right?  In what world is &quot;holding cells for newly arrested prisoner&#39;s children&quot; okay?  Especially when they&#39;re in holding cells for months, without even contact to their parents, not allowing the press in, sloppy record keeping, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/11/us-immigration-family-separations-doj-us-citizens">not even ensuring that all the children in holding cells are immigrants.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve honestly been in a holding cell as a child after my parent was arrested. After about 12 hours I was sent off to a home not knowing where my mom was and her not having a clue. I didn&#39;t speak to her until 3 months later and she was not allowed to know where I was. This is not uncommon. </p>

<p>I agree it&#39;s worse for these kids than for George Takei. But it&#39;s not rounding up people for political or racist reasons. </p>

<p>I agree the zero tolerance policy is dumb and has exacerbated this situation. These kids are getting screwed and I really don&#39;t know why we aren&#39;t sending them off to foster homes. But it is a situation that has always existed and will always exist as long as there are borders and people try to cross illegally with children. </p>

<p>I would say it&#39;s the &quot;rounding up&quot; aspect that makes it a clear distinction. Otherwise wouldn&#39;t prisons be considered internment camps? Wouldn&#39;t foster group homes where conditions are absolutely shit and abuse is rampant be considered internment camps? </p>

<p>Either way I&#39;m just explain how this ~30% is thinking. They are not okay with internment camps like you think. Maybe you think it&#39;s just mental gymnastics, but take solace in knowing that these people aren&#39;t purposeful monsters. </p>

<p>No one ever considers themselves bad guys. Even the guys waving around nazi flags literally believe they are doing the right thing. Obviously they are confused. But come at them as if they are confused and mislead individuals and not psychopath killers. &lt;- Not saying you have been, but know that these ~30% don&#39;t hate brown kids and that they are not okay with internment camps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand both sides. Both sides have valid concerns and both sides, generally speaking(as far as normal people go) would intend and choose to do good than bad.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m not talking about the normal people if I bash either side. I&#39;m talking about the career politicians, the red carpet for ugly people.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not the democrats fault. It&#39;s not the republicans fault for why this country is collapsing and why nothing has been fixed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <strong><em>our</em></strong> fault. And I&#39;m the weird one, because I point that out.</p>

<p>The United States is not and has never been owned by the govt, the banks or the military.</p>

<p>This country is owned by the people.</p>

<p>And if there is a problem it&#39;s stated explicitly that it&#39;s up to the people to fix it. Does anybody really expect known liars and crooks to fix the problem they are part of? Does anybody really expect the system to fix this when it&#39;s the system itself that&#39;s flawed?</p>

<p>The only way this chances is if those that are in power have genuine, healthy fear for their own people. That&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be. The police forces, the military and the govt are all supposed to have real fear of their own people&#39;s wrath for dishonorable behavior. Period. It&#39;s one of the reasons why the 2nd amendment exists.</p>

<p>So all of this bitching about trump, about this side or what or blah blah blah, you&#39;re all tugging the same &#39;two party system&#39; line that is clearly designed to not work. This is not a problem we can vote our way out of.</p>

<p>And the common response is, &#39;well what can we do?&#39;. Taking action is step 150. We&#39;re all on step 2. Getting people to acknowledge there is a real problem and the system is not going to fix it. Until that point, we&#39;re gonna be spinning our wheels pointlessly.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean Trump isn&#39;t flawed.  but he&#39;s doing something different and we can Love him for it</p>

<p>And more importantly don&#39;t engage the left with hyperbole and name calling. There are so many things of substance to argue about and to figure out together. Why waste time comparing them to Mao or Hitler where that is so far away from the reality we live in now? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you do this personally. But love your guy and then still engage in professional, polite, patient and kind discussion with the other side. So we can actually get stuff done and maybe one day come to a place where everyone is sorta happy lol. </p>

<p>But we know the Democrats aren&#39;t perfect. And we know the Republicans aren&#39;t always 100% wrong. No matter what there is some middle ground and overlap there. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not making the argument that they are equal in there shityness. I&#39;m just saying neither party is as bad or as good as everyone is making them out to be. So let&#39;s not rage at each other like the other side are monsters and your side angels. Nothing is so simple. Both parties have issues. No one has a moral high ground high enough where they can ignore and discount the other side as evil or idiots. </p>

<p>I obviously meant since the Hillary shitstorm that was in this last election. The emails, dirty on Bernie, Trump, social media sports team style politics explosion, all of this recent shit. That&#39;s when it started. It wasn&#39;t anywhere near this level of toxicity pre emails. Like I said, I&#39;m still left, I just want to be so far detached from the majority of the top voices yelling the loudest &#39;for the left&#39; who I disagree with. </p>

<p>You bring up Trump. We all know. We all fucking know. The whole point of my post about my issues with the current image of the left, yes my left, was my frustration of them failing to even get as far as to look at what they&#39;re doing wrong before looking at what others are doing wrong. </p>
