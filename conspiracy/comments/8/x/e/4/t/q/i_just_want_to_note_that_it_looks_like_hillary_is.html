       With the recent articles regarding her running again and then her flying commercial to get some "working class" credibility, it seems that she will run again. So "whataboutism" or "Hillary lost so quit talking about her" are probably going to not be good deflections any more.

       They are actually, because it's been an absolute joke. The only people who believe trump saved the world from Kim are idiot cultists. We accomplished nothing in nk but a photo op and legitimization of a mass murderer on the world stage. Thanks trump! Did you not hear the news that satellite surveillance has shown construction at one of their nuclear research facilities, as well as ramping up activity in their ballistic missile facility? Oh they're not telling ya that in foxnewsland?

       Wow I’m so glad that your propaganda keeps you well informed! Did you not notice that those photos your gods of truth and justice have served you are just photos of buildings and trucks?? (There are NO signs that they’re involved in nuclear weapons productions) Did you happen to miss the destruction of multiple nuclear sites by NK before and since DJ Trump had his summit??
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you used the cultist line which is just a projection of the nonsensical faith you fools have in the establishment. Bad news friendo, regardless of the way you want to view them, the facts remain the same. North Korea IS denuclearizing, and you’re promoting fake news which was an attempt to jeopardize us all in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike you, I do not simply seek a source of news. I thoroughly vet ALL news and then research the facts for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       ;) You’re the cultist in this scenario buddy, but I’m glad I could give you the opportunity to learn something today!

       <em>
        article
       </em>
       just shows photos, every country in the world who engages in satellite surveillance of nk must be conspiring to just pretend nk is continuing it's nuclear program because they just hate trump, peace, freedom, and America! Good lord it's pathetic. The pictures are there so they know what facilities are being referred to. It's reports coming from all over the world that provide context. But sure, go on with your fairy tale believing self. We got nothing out of this, and we gave too much already.

       Yeah,  "you people" should just accept your sham primary election.   Who cares that the DNC influenced things far more nefariously than Russian memes? Oceania has

       There is a .0001% Hillary runs in 2020.  That shouldn’t be a reason to not post a Hillary Clinton related conspiracy, nor is that a reason to bring her up in an effort to deflect.

       Hillary Clinton is definitely a huge criminal and deserves every ounce of flak she gets, regardless of if she ever plans to run again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton should be mentioned every day in this sub as she was instrumental in creating the fucked up regimes and terrorists that we’re dealing with today. Hell, the POTUS just told everyone to look into John Podesta. Her and her cronies are pretty relevant today thanks to his shoutout.

       If there’s a Hillary Clinton conspiracy that merits investigating (and there are plenty) it shouldn’t be pushed because there is speculation she may run in 2020, nor should it be pushed because her political opponents are randomly tweeting about it.

       It’s a stupid term given to a logical fallacy.  You can’t discredit an argument by shouting hypocrisy.  Argue on merit.

       If the DNC does something corrupt, it isn’t a valid defense by pointing out that the GOP also did something corrupt.

       The way it's most commonly used, it's not even a genuine logical fallacy. If someone were to say "group A does it too, so it's ok that group B does it", that would be a logical fallacy. What's been happening is any time someone even
       <em>
        mentions
       </em>
       the hypocrisy and double standards of the Dems, they trot out this dumb propaganda term whataboutism to try to deflect rather than addressing the point.

       She is still a public figure, she still gets up in front of crowds and tells people who they should vote for and what they should support... that makes her a politician by my reckoning.   She makes no bones about her wishing the demise of the Trump presidency, and Republicans returning the favor is completely appropriate.

       I try to recognize ideological possession in my friends and remind myself that I was that way too.  I've known most of them since long before the current political climate.  Now that it's the majority of my friends bitching about the president (rather than the minority when Obama was in), I can recognize when the behavior is so deviant from the core of who they are as a "fellow human."

       She may run - and I hope she does.  It's going to take more than the Democrat establishment to prop her up this time.

       There are plans for her to run again.   There is a very recent uptick in the CTR-like brigading here.  Coincidence?

       That would be hilarious. I hope they try it.

       Ditto. It would definitely put an end to the "who won the popular vote, illegally or not" arguments. It would be another Mondale vs. Reagan election for sure.

       I don't care for the Clintons, but it would just be cruel watching Hillary  lose again. Can't someone who cares for her talk her out of it? Is this the best that the Democratic Party can muster up? Come on DNC.

       If there’s a Hillary Clinton conspiracy that merits investigating (and there are plenty) it shouldn’t be pushed because there is speculation she may run in 2020, nor should it be pushed because her political opponents are randomly tweeting about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories aren’t meant to discredit people, they’re meant to uncover the truth.
