       Former Director of the NHI Bernadine Healy spoke publicly about the links between vaccines and autism.

       She has impeccable credentials and is about as high up the ladder as you can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidentally, after speaking publicly about Autism and Vaccines, she developed brain cancer and died.

       The CDC themselves used to admit it on televised interviews, they backgracked we saw a CDC whistleblower admit the cover up and destruction of incriminating evidence, so it seems reasonble to assume that most CDC doctors are confident that there is a link but they are being told to embargo the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many top doctors and researchers are calling for the necessary research to be carried out, they are demanding it as they know the current publically available studies are completely inadequate to prove vaccine safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an example of a top professor who is confident of a link between the link between the aluminum in vaccines being associated with autism

       I am not an expert in this, but have dealt with autism for a long time. (one of my kids has it).  I hav spoke with scientists in the field, and its
       <br/>
       all hogwash. virtually the entire autism and vaccines thing goes way back to one guy who made the shit up and then went to jail for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       then the thing is, are we having more autism births? or just better healthcare and more babys are surviving?  and what about, all the junk foods people eat, things like soda and other crap foods that have all sorts of bad shit in it? thing is we dont truly know and trying to pin it on something with out real data, is assnine.
      </p>
      <p>
       and even if vaccines cuase autism in some really low &amp;#37; of the population that does not negate the positive effects vaccines have had on human health.  we still need to vaccinate everyone... period. dont want to be vaccinated? go find somewhere like a remote island to live where you cant mess everyone else up.

       It's also a fact of now we're detecting it more... Because there used to be absolutely nothing known about autism.  Getting vaccines does not, in any way, cause autism. Vaccines have been around for a good enough amout of time, and people think that now, in the last 10yrs it all of the sudden causes autism?

       Again, autism hasn't necessarily been increasing. It just went undiagnosed for the most part... And that leads to under-educated people clinging to "vaccines increase autism!" Because they don't understand how to look at the entirety of the situation. Autism is something genetic. Something that you are born with. Not something that a vaccine will change. Vaccines do not change your DNA.

       this is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       the official view is that it is caused by genetics and environmental factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       which means that genes alone can not cause autism and environmental factors alone can not cause autism either. You need both.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know for sure that autism rates are increasing there are well designed studies over many years that show that autism was in fact fairly uncommon in the past.

       it is still increasing and increased in the past decade as well.

      <p>
       The people who think it is genetic did not take the time to study this problem neither did the people who think autism is as common now as it was 40 years ago.

       Ohhh... So there MAY be... Lol got yourself again. And you even added another one in there: "Biological". Do you even read any of the articles you post?
And the "most convincing" piece for environmental factors is what? That's right... Prenatal Viral Infection is known as the most convincing principal non-genetic cause. Because of what virus? That's right... Rubella. While the baby is in the womb. But guess what? People SHOULD be vaccinated against rubella when they're kids, right? Sooooo you're kinda kicking yourself in the dick with this one. And it's still not even proven, it's one of the ONLY likely causes for non-genetic autism. Because the mother's immune system attacks the little one, because of exposure to something that she should have already been vaccinated for. Therefore, not getting vaccinated can lead to congenital rubella syndrome, which could possibly lead to autism... Again... Get vaccinated, and it won't happen.

       honestly you do not seem to understand what you are talking about. To develop autism you need both genetic and environmental factors as described above.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not either genes OR environment. Both factors need to be present. You think it is 1 factor that is needed because you do not know what you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       many different environmental factors have been proposed including rubella but so far the it is not understood how the environment triggers autism. That does not mean that it is not relevant quite the opposite.

       ... soooo earlier when you said there was three things that can cause it, you naked one, both, and one again? That doesn't make much sense... And neither does your statement of "may be caused by". May isn't a definitive term. You might want to consider doing some research OUTSIDE of your biased articles that SUGGEST something MAY cause something else without any real scientific proof.
Just my $.02 though.

       That's what i said from the get go. They said that's LIKELY the cause. But they can't rule out it getting worse, however they have no evidence to support it has gotten worse. Like i said: "they've only recently started being able to actually test for it"
People have been autistic for thousands of years. And it's only RECENTLY that it's begun to be diagnosed. Causation, and correlation are two completely different things.
The only CORRELATION here, is that we've been vaccinating before we started detecting/testing for autism. But again, there's no CAUSATION to suggest that vaccines are causing Autism.

       yes indeed recently some of the CDC monitoring sites have indeed shown that there was a  at least 100&amp;#37; increase in the past decade that could not have been due to better diagnosing or more people being aware. Please do your homework.

        from above article, links embedded in article. 
1. From Canada, 2012: “Aluminum (Al) is highly neurotoxic and has been shown to impair both prenatal and postnatal brain development in humans and experimental animals.”
2. From France, 2013: “However, continuously escalating doses of this poorly biodegradable adjuvant in the population may become insidiously unsafe, especially in the case of overimmunization or immature/altered blood brain barrier…”
3. From France, 2015: “Thus alum and other poorly biodegradable materials taken up at the periphery by phagocytes circulate in the lymphatic and blood circulation and can enter the brain using a Trojan horse mechanism similar to that used by infectious particles. Previous experiments have shown that alum administration can cause CNS dysfunction and damage, casting doubts on the exact level of alum safety.”
4. From France, 2016: “We conclude that Alhydrogel [aluminum adjuvant] injected at low dose in mouse muscle may selectively induce long-term Al cerebral accumulation and neurotoxic effects.”
5. From England, 2017: “The amount of aluminum in the brain tissue was, I would say, extraordinarily high. Very high. My group has measured the aluminum content of probably more than one hundred human brains, and these brain tissues taken from the individuals with a diagnosis of autism were some of the highest we’ve measured bar none. The only ones we’ve seen that are similar were a recent study of familial Alzheimer’s. This in itself is a very important finding.”
