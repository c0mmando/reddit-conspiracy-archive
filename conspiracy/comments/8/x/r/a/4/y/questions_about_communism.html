<p>Why is that you can hold a Communist flag and shout communist slogans on the streets and get away empty handed and if you do the same on Nazis you will be caught in thought prison by thought enforcers? I&#39;m not saying Nazism is good but this is hypocritical.</p>

<p>Why is the EU constantly hiring people with Soviet ties, Communists and degenerates such as Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Emmanuel Macron to high positions? Note that nothing good ever comes when these communists become world leaders, they create poverty, uncontrolled immigration and social collapse. </p>

<p>Why is the fact that all entertainment such as Art, Gaming and Music descending into Marxism and &quot;Sexual Liberation&quot;? If you want an idea just go to the museum of modern art in nyc.</p>

<p>Also why is the alternative media all siding with Russia, China, NK and Venezuela and those who don&#39;t and criticize both sides are nonexistent?</p>

<p>AND FINALLY, Why does every electoral candidate in the us election of 2016 have communist ties? This includes Trump, which was married to a communist cezch during the iron curtain, then to cia agents and women with communist ties.</p>

<p>The questions don&#39;t add up...And doesn&#39;t look good either.</p>

<p>Except they didn&#39;t. I would have expected r/Conspiracy to be a bit more aware of the Venezuelan situation. The US has been interfereing with that country for almost 7 decades now. </p>

<p>They even funded and pushed a coup in 2002, as well as funded the opposition to the tune of almost 100 million dollars. Never mind the fact that they were planning to invade them last year. </p>

<p>Incorrect.  </p>

<p>Engels suggested that in time government would become obsolete (through the glories os socialism), and in time it would &quot;wither away.&quot;  I have yet to find any real explanation from Engels of the mechanism by which this withering was to be implemented.</p>

<p>It was more like a paper promise.</p>

<p>the same policies that caused that to happen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a big stretch bucko.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>communism killed more people than world war ii</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Death tolls for communism are routinely inflated, but you&#39;re also forgetting that communism lasted for &gt;10x as long as world war 2.  Even the most rabid anti-communists aren&#39;t saying commies killed a billion people (~10x ww2 death toll).  Also, you&#39;re forgetting the millions killed by capitalism each year that the msm refuses to properly attribute.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>people with Soviet ties, Communists and degenerates such as Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande and Emmanuel Macron</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These people aren&#39;t communist, and are in fact pretty far away from it to the right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they create poverty, uncontrolled immigration and social collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The EU has much lower poverty than the US, US/NATO invasions and destabilizations created uncontrolled migration (not anything the EU did), and despite the narrative that&#39;s desperately being pushed, EU society is not collapsing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is the fact that all entertainment such as Art, Gaming and Music descending into Marxism and &quot;Sexual Liberation&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think its a fact that all entertainment is descending into marxism, you need to see a neurologist.  Sexual liberation is easy: women have rights now, and so more media is going to a) acknowledge the shift that&#39;s already happened culturally, and b) cater to audiences that weren&#39;t there, or were far smaller, in the past.</p>

<p>Communism ruled large parts of the world for 70 years, and still nominally controls the most populous and 2nd largest economy.  Lots of people have tangential ties to that without having any ideological connection.</p>
