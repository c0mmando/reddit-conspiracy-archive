        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Eating meat gave humans bigger brains. Eating meat makes humans smarter. Vegans are known to be deficient in essential amino acids like creatine carnosine and carnitine, which make you smarter and help your body detox from heavy metals. Those amino acids (and Histidine) along with Vitamin A, Vitamin B6,B12, Vitamin D, and Vitamin K2, CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN ANIMALs. The vitamin A found in plants is not bio-available. Unsaturated plant oils are a modern invention and are the real cause behind the increase in heart disease. Cholesterol and dietary fat are absolutely essential to brain health and intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now we&#39;re on the right track!</p>

<p>So we&#39;ve got...  11 posts over three years...  Let&#39;s see... 6 of them are from the last 12 months...  Two(!) of them were made in the last one month.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got an epidemic of vegan talk here, for sure.  This shit gets astroturfed here once every... 3.6 months on average!  That&#39;s alarming.</p>

<p>Are you sure you don&#39;t want to narrow down your date range a bit?  I don&#39;t want to nitpick your research techniques, but wouldn&#39;t it be more thorough to start from new, and just work your way back a month or three?  Even a week?  Or a day?  Your statistics may even improve this way.  I didn&#39;t think you had the ambition to comb through three years of posts, to come up with 11 posts.  Over three years, we&#39;ve had enough vegan posts to fill up... almost a half hour of conspiracy posts on any average day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  <em>Two</em> is the bare minimum required to reach &quot;multiple.&quot;. Two in a month.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to discourage you from your research endeavors.  But it&#39;s kinda hard to make a conspiracy out of 11 posts over three years.  At this rate, vegans will take over the world in...  Maybe 700 years or so.  Optimistically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The body does not need any carb glucid intake, because of its capacity to break down and convert protein into glucid, if needed.</p>

<p>Fat has a low metabolic burn rate, as is &quot;burned&quot; last, if ingested alongside carbohydrates like bread-products or sweets. </p>

<p>There are diets like the Keto diet, which induces the body into a state of ketosis, by taking away all its carbo-intake making it switch priority to burning fat, since there&#39;s nothing else to &quot;burn&quot;/absorb for energy.</p>

<p>Fat and carbs are like coal and paper;  one is hard to ignite, but gives you a long lasting energy burn, the other can ignite from a single spark, but the fire last but seconds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your analogy, but how about this: protein &amp; fat are quarters and dollars. Alcohol &amp; carbs are pennies and nickels. Our body can stack up pennies and nickles very quickly, so it spends those the most if they are available, while the dollars stack slowly and usually don&#39;t get spent at all, eventually ending up in the bank (fat body). Take away all that loose change and our bodies start making better transactions. </p>

<p>I was visually distinguishing betwen the burn rates of each element,but yours works better in context, since enough paper can still be used to ignite the coal, using carbs to get rid of fats is the opposite of what you should be doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried that vegan diet before. I found it like I had more energy, but for less time. Like cycling a 10-speed, on the highest gear; peddling fast, but not going very far. As opposed to a meat only diet, it would take a while to get my body moving, but it was moving much faster once things got into motion. I think a balanced diet with meat and veggies and fruit are okay.</p>

<p>Whenever someone says that humans should only eat this or that, I simply turn to nature. Are there any animals who only eat fruits and veggies? I can&#39;t think of too many. On the other, there are many animals who primarily eat meat.  And that&#39;s that.</p>

<p>The best argument I&#39;ve heard against eating meat is by Bill Carr. He basically says that it is unnatural for humans to eat meat. Why? Because if it were natural we wouldn&#39;t have to season it (cook it?), and basically eat it as is and enjoy it. If eating meat was natural and good, why do we need to prepare it, and not eat it immediately? Where as fruits and veggies can be eaten without much preparation. Carr also pointed out that in the animal kingdom, lions and other primarily meat eaters were very lethargic as compared to their primarily non-meat eaters. </p>

<p>I still do what I want and what makes me feel good. Personally, I think humans are at the top of the food chain. With that in mind,  I don&#39;t eat every living thing on this planet. I don&#39;t eat rats, pigs, horses, and bats, and a lot of other things. That is just me. People do what they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fresh/healthy meat doesn&#39;t need to be seasoned. Japanese will eat fresh fish, beef, and even chicken raw.
The vast majority of fruits and grains and some vegetables are not natural. They have been breed/gmo&#39;d. The strains of wheat in the bible for a historical example are not the same strains of wheat we eat today. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t make any sense. Appeal to nature fallacy. </p>

<p>Humans are humans, not other animals, so why would you base what you eat of other animals? Plus, we don&#39;t live in wild nature, do we?</p>
