       Only 24% of the US is unaffiliated with a religion while nearly 70% is still christian.  All other religions make up roughly 5%. No one's persecuting religious people,  no one's forcing anyone to give up their values and principles (unless of course those values are at the expense of other people's rights)

       doesn't make it any less of an intellectual and rational crime. Who knew 70% of Americans were dumb as fuck. How in the fuck did religious tendencies and beliefs manage to manifest themselves in rational people. It's absolutely appaling that intelligent minds like Jordan Peterson gloss over the proof necessary to make a scientific argument about the supernatural.

       Like I said only 24% of the us is unaffiliated with a religion.  Religion has a huge supermajority, something like 50% of the nation attends a religious service at least once a week.

       OP is right, according to Pew the number of people who go to a religious service every week is dropping (from 39% to 36% (2014 &amp; 2009).  Statista has a 2017 study that puts that number at just 23% in 2017

       I realize it's a contentious issue, but nonetheless I believe that religion is a form of mental illness.  I say that not to push people down, but in the hope that they can recover.  I did.

       I recovered too. But only when I really stopped and really thought about it. Most people are taught their religion from birth, so they never really stop to think about it or question it. They are so busy with their life (kids, work, etc.) that they just don't think about it. (That was me.) But one day they will really think about it, don't worry, and realize the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't necessary think they are mentally ill. Although, some of them are, but not the majority.

       It's psychosis, plain and simple.  Belief which has no basis in evidence, and which usually runs contrary to the evidence available.  In most cases it's a fairly mild disorder, but in more serious cases it leads to a lifelong pattern of irrational decision making.

       Okay, I see what you are saying. I believe in reincarnation, but there is no proof of it being real. But I like to think it is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, NO ONE knows what happens when we die. I believe there is something after this life, but I can't prove it and I really don't know what it is. I'm not mentally ill. I'm just honest.

       Well, from my perspective you are mentally ill to some degree because you believe in something for which there is no evidence.  I don't say that to be offensive, because I have a great deal of respect for you, but in my opinion any belief which is not evidence based is mental illness.  Generally, its probably a fairly harmless psychosis, at least up to the point where that belief starts to factor in your decision making processes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree.  No one knows, and furthermore there is no basis for speculation.  I suspect there's nothing after death, because all the available evidence points toward the universe being mechanistic and utterly uncaring, but I don't
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       there is nothing after death because there is no evidence for that either.  There may be a God of sorts, but as their is no evidence of such I make no statements of belief or disbelief.  These things are inherently unknowable, and there's no point wasting thoughts on them.

       Yes.  Rational belief is based on evidence.  Faith is belief in the absence of evidence, i.e. religious belief.

       Yeah, it shows their gullible idiots. Only an unintelligent person would think that there must be some higher power than themselves. We have no proof other than scientific evidence that we are at the top of the food chain and intellectual chain on Earth. Beyond that, it's ridiculous arguing a creator or a god. We are the only gods in the universe as far as we know. We best not misunderstand the grandiosity of human conscience as a second-fiddle to some god-figure.

       I don't think so.  Being attracted to the same sex isn't really psychotic, there's no disconnect between the perception of attraction and the fact of attraction.

       At worst one could argue that it might be an evolutionary disadvantage, as one would think that gays likely have less offspring on average than straight people.

       How is believing in a religion a mental disorder, but, believing you are attracted to the same sex, not? Believing in the latter, goes against biology/reality (dicks and vaginas go together to create new humans), whereas the former... does not. Furthermore, there are far more cases of sexual abuse from Homosexuals, than there are for religious people. How many Homosexuals were abused by male figures in their lives? The numbers are through the roof. Right there, shows sexual trauma/damage to the brain (ie. mental disorder).

       Because religious belief has no basis in reality.  There is no evidence whatsoever to support the belief that a god or gods exist, and less than no evidence to suggest that such a being would be anthropomorphic or give two shits about the human species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Belief in a god is completely arbitrary.  If a person told you they were being stalked by giant invisible pumpkins which were controlling your mind you would think they were insane (and rightly so).  Well, that belief has every bit as much reason and evidence behind it as does belief in any of the myriad gods humanity has invented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that count Catholics, lol?  This isn't an argument about whether homosexuality is socially harmful (I don't really think so, but I can understand the arguments to the contrary), but about whether it's psychitic.  Psychosis means a disconnect between a persons beliefs or perceptions and the actual state of the real world.  I don't really see that in homosexuality.  Transgenderism, on the other hand, is clear cut psychosis.

       I believe in Intelligent Creation. Nothing more, nothing less. Could be one, could be many. I'm not religious, I'm spiritual, and I truly do not know what the hell is going on in this realm (nor do I claim to -  I have opinions, though). We are creators for the Creator(s) created us, imo. My Spirit Being chose to be here,

       As for Homosexuals? I honestly could not care what two consenting adults do. That said, it's not normal, and in my opinion (and in the opinions of others - based on reality/biology), it's a mental illness/disorder/perversion - all one in the same, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a slippery slope, because many Homosexuals
       <strong>
        are victims
       </strong>
       of sexual abuse, who continue the cycle. Bestiality, and pedos, are most certainly in the same category, imo. It's just a bit lighter for the former (ie. Aspergers compared to full on psychosis).
      </p>
      <p>
       Should they be persecuted? No. They need help. What's the help? I have no idea, maybe we should actually look into it.

       I hadn’t considered the abuse angle, and it makes sense.  Sometimes to defeat a monster, even inside you, it becomes necessary to become the monster.  I make that assessment only on my own experiences, and admit they have nothing to do with sex, but on some level I think I can understand.  The problem is...ok in my opinion, there is no real help for the individual, no changing them, only the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a child is exposed to something like that it’s done, like an imprint in wet concrete.  We can help prevent the further abuse, educate, and bring awareness, but that’s all.  You can’t remold concrete after it’s set in adulthood, so to speak.

       This is tough.  I know gay people, and they are excellent people.  They deserve a place of respect if they treat me the same way, and so far most of them have.  I don’t have all the answers either.

       Gay men and women have kids all the time. Nothing about being gay hinders them from procreation unless they were completely unable to get it up for a female or unable to spread your legs as a female. Not every sexual encounter needs to end with children being born.

       You keep saying this and it's so wrong. Religion absolutely is based concretely in reality. It is social by nature, and people are able to forego evidence in favor of the confirmation of their peers. As long as one person can lie with conviction then the rest can believe with conviction.

       Believing in God is not a psychosis in that sense at all, it's inarguable. What you're saying is totally absurd, you're just messing with definitions to get your point across.

       Because you're not just believing the same thing as your neighbor. I have no interest in speaking to someone like you, who warps beliefs to suit their own personal narratives.

      <p>
       Happening to believe the same thing as your neighbor is distinctly different from believing a thing because
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       your neighbors believe it as well. We are social creatures it's one of the best ways we adapt to our surroundings. That belief isn't irrational or arbitrary because it serves a social function.

       I don't need to "show you evidence" because this isn't a tangible thing. You need to get your head out of the gutter seriously, if you can honestly assert that religious beliefs are no different than believing in the tooth fairy you're being assinine.

       It can be both irrational and serve a social function.  Religion has certainly been one of the primary methods of social control over the last few millennia.  But powerful people exploiting common delusions to control the herd doesn't make those delusions less delusional.

       Your whole argument that religion is a psychosis stems from the idea that the belief has manifested irrationally or abritrarily but here you can see that it's clearly not arbitrary. There is a social function to believing in God for many people. For many people,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       believing in God would he irrational as it would lead to their ostracization.

      <p>
       You're right, like you saying religious belief is irrational over and over doesn't make it more true. What I'm saying is already true, if belief in a religion serves to benefit you socially then participation is a rational choice. If a believe has a verifiable and concrete source, it is not abitrary it did not just pop into someone's head. It's an idea that came from peers, most likely peers they respected. No sane person with a working understand of these concepts could honestly call organized religion a psychosis.

      <p>
       How on Earth does your pee brain consider this a valid line of reasoning? We are not discussing whether or not God exists and to do so is pointless. I can just as easily say there is no evidence whatsoever that God doesn't exist (because there isn't, it's not "provable" in any sense) and therefore God exists. Both that and the inverse are totally vacuous statements and besides that they are besides the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       No evidence for the existence of God does not mean believing in God is a mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said believing in God is psyschosis because it's irrational and arbitrary. I'm saying that religion is an extremely common social institution that many people choose to participate in for social benefit / to maintain status quo, and that the source of that information (the modern religious institution) is not arbitrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've laid these points out several times and it seems your only counter is willful ignorance or saying God doesn't exist, both of which are inappropriate. I'm done with this conversation now unless you want to formulate a real argument for why engaging in group behavior with peers is suddenly irrational because you said so.

       This is exactly how the bigotry is accomplished. Belief in more than the physical is equated with a rejection of almighty science, and it’s easier than ever just to collectively mock and scorn those who profess a religious view, stereotyping them as extremists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ‘love your neighbor’ types are rarely portrayed in popular culture, only the fringe types that are easy to demonize. No, religious people aren’t being openly persecuted in most cultures. They are being shamed into keeping quiet by a collective sneer, which is similar to the way sexual subcultures were treated until recently.

       Believing in anything arbitrarily is a form of psychosis (belief which does not match the evidence.  Belief in God is every bit as arbitrary as belief in magical elves that steal underpants.

       Perhaps because the exertion of creative force is required for complex life? Even the oft-celebrated Higgs Boson didn’t materialize on its own. A team of intelligent people had to plan and construct the collider, just so they could try to ‘recreate’ one small facet of a theorized universal origin.

      <p>
       The evidence for a creative force is revealed daily in all creative output that you and I undertake. To label that common sense realization ‘psychosis’ seems short-sighted.

       Actually, you can see it for yourself. Look around the room that you’re in right now. Count the number of objects in that room that required a creative force in order to be constructed. Now count the objects that simply materialized over any amount of time. There’s some common sense evidence. We can argue about raw material origins and how much time to put on the universal clock, but we cannot argue that all creative output requires a creative and intelligent force. This is what leads many to seek the source of creative energy, even if mocked by those who prefer the notion of accidental order.

       Respectfully disagree. The belief that science may one day ‘rule out’ an intelligent creative force does not preclude my present belief in such a force. Contrarily, believing that there is no evidence for an intelligent origin requires astronomical faith in random occurrences and the willing disregard of all creative energy.

       I have no interest in discussing science. What you're saying is that anyone who doesn't believe in intelligent design is taking a big leap of faith? Who's intelligent design? For what purpose? Are any religions true? Which and why? Why all the other bs? Why do i have allergies? Why does my mom have dementia? What kind of an asshole invents something that can have all of the developmental disorders like aspergers or the neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's? "That thick clump of cells that i made you special because of? Not today!" is it a 'lesson' to teach children before they're born? If you know everything and control everything then W. T. F. is with all the suffering. It takes a supreme ego to think they're not random chance and an even bigger sadist to look at the suffering in the world, the unwarranted and undeserved suffering of the truly innocent and worship the 'intelligently designed plan'. I'm a cunt, i get it, but the infant children deserve a god far greater than whatever 'creative' nonsense you're espousing.

       It might seem like nonsense,  but my goal wasnt a science discussion or a itemized breakdown of how a deity fits in with all of our existential crises. It was to address the one redditor who was saying that anyone who believed in more than unobservable science was crazy/psychotic. If you as a human are capable of creativity and complex intelligence, there’s no sensible reason to chalk that up to an undirected gas explosion. Why someone gets Parkinson’s is a whole different convo.

       You failed then. Your argument is just a rehash of "how could nothing create something". You can put it in a pretty dress, you can call it sensible, and you can even believe it. If you as a human are capable of creativity and complex intelligence, there’s no sensible reason to chalk that up to intelligent design. I bet that whole different convo is even more convoluted. It's either about judgement for perceived transgressions rom the thing that actually designed you to transgress it or suddenly science knows something.

       Hardly. I don’t care to sort through the minutia of why you choose not to believe in anything more than what scientific theory allows for. But the profound contradiction in your statement ‘If you as a human are capable of creativity and complex intelligence, there’s no sensible reason to chalk that up to intelligent design.’ tells me that common sense in this discussion is lost. I’ll stick with my antiquated notion of creative=created.

       Look dude, I don’t want to be an asshole or come off like I know everything. Sorry if I’ve made that impression. I just believe that intelligence is required for intelligent production, whether in origin theory or everyday life. It’s clear we don’t see things the same way, but I don’t think you’re an idiot for choosing to believe differently. I’d ask that you extend me the same deference.

       I don't know you as a person and wouldn't assume i can judge you as such. This argument you have is an awful one and you've so far propped it up by insulting me, insulting my intelligence, and attempting to prop yourself up as the moral superior. Meanwhile, you completely ignored any of my questions as to why is the human race so hereditarily (is that a word?) fucked up if we were intelligently created. None of this conversation has been rational from your end. It's repeated over and over though by many people smarter than us because it's an irrational belief based on old books from a time when people were on average irrational and terrified and working more from instinct. I still stand by my statement that I'm a cunt. I don't think either of us deserve a pat on the back for being subscribed to a specific sub.

       The sub description’s first line says that we respect all religious beliefs, and I’ve learned now that is not the case. I wasn’t insulting your intellect, and you aren’t a victim. Attempted to throw out an olive branch, and you rejected it. I haven’t yet heard a good reason to believe that intelligence is an unguided accident. You’re chasing me down over what you see as a fallacious argument, but I will stand by the common sense notion that all creative processes require a creative force. It’s okay than you don’t agree. Seriously.

       i don't have to make a good argument for not believing what hasn't been proven. You keep wanting me to be in a box and bringing up what you assume must be the counter argument when all i ask is you to defend your own argument with more than blind belief. This isn't a discussion about what belief is right, I'm not touting a counter argument, you stated a belief - we must have been created to be creative. I asked you - then why all the suffering. Your response is that I'm supposed to argue an opposing belief and i haven't provided a good argument against your belief. It's your soap box and you just keep spending it taking about me.

       Just because you think that you are right doesn't mean you are thinking rationally or logically. You have told yourself a story you need to believe and so you believe it. But as an adult you should find pride in knowing some of your deepest beliefs have nothing to do with truth.

       A creative force doesn't mean an intelligent one. There's no "plan" as evidenced by the fact that evolution is very much a process of trial and error packed tight with extinct evolutionary dead ends.

       I’m at work, but it seems like you just want to argue. Is what’s being asserted not clear? Im not aware of anything complex (indicative of intelligence) that can be observed materializing on its own. A child can’t be formed without existing human actions, nor can a computer or desk or anything else. The starting point is that human activity and creativity reveals itself in the things we produce/replicate. Both living and inert. Scientists make a machine to detect what they hope will prove that no intelligence was needed to generate. Is that not ironic? If your baseline is that no creative force is required to make things, I’d be curious to hear your rationale. It’s one way or the other.

       While acting as judge and jury, you’ve falsely conflated evidence and proof. If you don’t see the connection between observation and the formation of theory, that’s on you, friend. Take care.

       OP states that being religious gets you insulted these day.

       Then you come in and insult religious people. If you can't debate the topic at hand without slinging insults like a 12 years old, that's ignorant and proves OP is right.

       I’m not sure what world you live in, but the rest of us live in a world where the overwhelming majority of people are religious.  Depending on who you listen to, between 76% and 85% of the world is religious.

       Theres nothing mentally wrong with being gay. It's a difference in sexual attraction. These people are just as same as straight people. It's just some old school bigoted shit to call them crazy.

       They aren't crazy and what they are doing isn't wrong. But there must be a biological reason people are attracted to the same sex. You are just arguing over what to call it. What you call a 'difference in sexual attraction' is what someone else would call a 'mental illness'.

       There are no laws on the books against religious people.  Religious people aren’t denied rights that non-religious people have.  People aren’t physically assaulted or murdered in America because they’re religious.  Religious people still make up about 75% of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       The persecution of religious people in America is mostly in their minds, much like the fictitious War on Christmas.

       It was against the law to be gay or lesbian. You could be arrested and jailed for having sex with a person of your same sex.  Urban police departments ran regular sting operations to catch gay men.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was legal to refuse to hire a gay person and if discovered after  you were hired you could be fired for being gay.

       This. Religion should be studied and understood by everyone, though, and I have no problems with personal faith so long as it's not encroaching on anyone's rights. It is organized religion that I have always and will always regard as a cancer.

       Historically we derived our morality from religious doctrine. We have adapted as society "evolved". The foundation and fundamental morality is still essential to society. It is basically observations about human nature.

       One look at the upvotes (50%) and the comments is enough to make me accept that OP might be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look around you. What's the new dominant social force? Which way are the winds of change blowing?
      </p>
      <p>
       The politically correct people talk about tolerance. But what's really going on is a promotion of a new set of values, and repression/intolerance for the older set of values.
      </p>
      <p>
       Old value set = Christian, heterosexual, white.
      </p>
      <p>
       New value set = Anything but Christian, everything but hetero, anyone except white.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's a deliberate plan against people who are white/christian/hetero. It's more a form of ineptness on the part of the PC's and SJW's. They want to bring about change, but they just don't know how to do that in a civilized way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they push for tolerance and rights by doing the same old thing that people have been doing for thousands of years. Instead of making all people equal and accepted, they're replacing one group of favorites with another.

       Maybe take a break from twitter mate. As always the most extreme (and in the minority) voices are the loudest. In reality no one is persecuting you for being christian. People might disagree with you and actively oppose any kind of legislation that comes from a place of faith but that's a far cry from being beaten or killed for being gay.

       How is believing in a religion a mental disorder, but, believing you are attracted to the same sex, not? Believing in the latter, goes against biology/reality (dicks and vaginas go together to create new humans), whereas the former... does not. Furthermore, there are far more cases of sexual abuse from Homosexuals, than there are for religious people. How many Homosexuals were abused by male figures in their lives? The numbers are through the roof. Right there, shows sexual trauma/damage to the brain (ie. mental disorder).

       They aren't crazy and what they are doing isn't wrong. But there must be a biological reason people are attracted to the same sex. You are just arguing over what to call it. What you call a 'difference in sexual attraction' is what someone else would call a 'mental illness'.

       Yes it does, it absolutely does. It absolutely makes that belief NOT arbitrary.

       Your whole argument that religion is a psychosis stems from the idea that the belief has manifested irrationally or abritrarily but here you can see that it's clearly not arbitrary. There is a social function to believing in God for many people. For many people,
       <em>
        not

       believing in God would he irrational as it would lead to their ostracization.

      <p>
       You're right, like you saying religious belief is irrational over and over doesn't make it more true. What I'm saying is already true, if belief in a religion serves to benefit you socially then participation is a rational choice. If a believe has a verifiable and concrete source, it is not abitrary it did not just pop into someone's head. It's an idea that came from peers, most likely peers they respected. No sane person with a working understand of these concepts could honestly call organized religion a psychosis.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How on Earth does your pee brain consider this a valid line of reasoning? We are not discussing whether or not God exists and to do so is pointless. I can just as easily say there is no evidence whatsoever that God doesn't exist (because there isn't, it's not "provable" in any sense) and therefore God exists. Both that and the inverse are totally vacuous statements and besides that they are besides the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       No evidence for the existence of God does not mean believing in God is a mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said believing in God is psyschosis because it's irrational and arbitrary. I'm saying that religion is an extremely common social institution that many people choose to participate in for social benefit / to maintain status quo, and that the source of that information (the modern religious institution) is not arbitrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've laid these points out several times and it seems your only counter is willful ignorance or saying God doesn't exist, both of which are inappropriate. I'm done with this conversation now unless you want to formulate a real argument for why engaging in group behavior with peers is suddenly irrational because you said so.
