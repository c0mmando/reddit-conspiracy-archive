<p>So let me get this straight, you think Democrats are walking away because they are mad at the DNC for moving too far left. Then in the next breath you say the DNC has no intention of moving left. </p>

<p>Clearly the DNC isnt yoite concern because you have no intention of voting democrat. So you&#39;re on here just hoping you can convince Democrats to stay away from the voting booth. </p>

<p>It&#39;s about the actions taken. When Trump is done, no one will remember or care who he hire or fired. They will only care about what he accomplished. Read Machiavelli. Or don&#39;t, who cares. </p>

<p>Nope, you&#39;re misreading my statement and construing everything I said as the party &quot;moving far left&quot;. They&#39;re moving in every direction at once, like chickens with their heads cut off. Makes you wonder what&#39;s going on under the surface. </p>

Attacking people vandalizing property setting fires basically being a bunch of thug assholes. Then I showed her the protests in l.a. where they were burning American flags while waving communist flags and Mexican flags. She was already aware of the blacklivesmatter riots, looting, arson and cop killings. She said today&#39;s Democrat party doesnt even resemble the Democrat party she joined along time ago. And doesn&#39;t represent her and her values. She&#39;s not going to vote republican but she said she can&#39;t vote Democrat anymore she&#39;s just not going to vote. And alot of older democrats I&#39;ve talked to feel the same way. Today&#39;s Democrat party has alienated alot of the older democrats and alot of the younger ones are just insane. </p>
