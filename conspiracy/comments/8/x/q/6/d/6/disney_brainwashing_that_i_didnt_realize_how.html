<p>I never questioned food &amp; wine being there until i started reading on Walt Disney, and the disney theories. But why would they host an event where adults get drunk in a place where there are so many children at? </p>

<p>food &amp; wine in both Miami and Colorado are not in a kids place. I always assumed it was for them to make more money, but they already have other events&#39; (star wars month) that bring in a ton of money why have one that will have drunk adults in a place where kids are easily lost. it wouldn&#39;t make sense in any other kid place but in Disney no one questions it. </p>

<p>If i went in to chuck E. Cheese with a few friends and no kids and started drinking, we would be kicked out and be looked at like weirdos. </p>

<p>i&#39;m upset i was brainwashed by Disney, I was never obsessed but I never questioned them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah i know that, i also know that food &amp; wine you go to drink and eat and then drink. Epcot sells alcohol by the way all year long so you can have a beer with your burger so i&#39;m not sure what your point is about that. </p>

<p>normally when you go to epcot or any disney park you go because you&#39;re enjoying the place, ppl go to food &amp; wine specifically for food &amp; wine. </p>

<p>have you attended food &amp; wine? have you seen how many drunk ppl are there, you&#39;re right most people aren&#39;t weirdos and can get drunk and be normal but i feel like having an event geared around drinking all day is asking for trouble. </p>

<p>there are wayyy more drunks during food &amp; wine than most days at epcot. because it&#39;s not about having a beer with your burger, while enjoying your day at the park, it&#39;s getting fucking drunk and drinking at every station there until you&#39;re drunk. if you have one drink at every station by the end of it you&#39;ll be drunk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that I am not taking a vacation in some dry park or county.  </p>

<p>I have not been to Disney since 1980 or maybe it was 1981.  Wasn&#39;t really my thing.  And once they started the paying extra to go to the front of the line, they made sure I would never return.  </p>

<p>Never understood the point of Epcot, so a place to drink makes as much sense as any other reason it has to exist.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Made for children to pay $120 and up to hangout in a swamp.  </p>

<p>I doubt most adults are drunk.  I&#39;ve been to many all you can drink events and most people at them are not drunk.  Even at the drunk fest that is the Preakness infield party, there is not a majority of drunk people.</p>

<p>Segregating alcohol away from normal life just adds to the problem with American drinking culture.  Having drinking fenced off encourages the binge drinking mentality.   </p>

<p>no one is saying to segregate alcohol so again your point is dumb. you have not been to food &amp; wine so again don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;ve been there twice and yes a lot of ppl are drunk. </p>

<p>by the way i don&#39;t think all the Disney parks sell alcohol, but that&#39;s not the point. i never mention alcohol being sold there, i&#39;m talking about Food &amp; Wine. </p>

<p>if you have been, you know that most ppl by night time are wasted, because that&#39;s why you go to food &amp; wine, to drink and eat and then keep drinking. </p>

<p>there&#39;s a difference between going to a disney park and then having a few drinks than specifically going to Disney for Food &amp; wine so that you can drink. </p>

<p>exactly they have a drink limit at these places, because they don&#39;t want drunk adults there. which is what you get at food &amp; wine events. </p>

<p>and everything at Disney is expensive because you have no choice, most people aren&#39;t going to leave the park to eat and then come back. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Have you been to Epcot? The only thing that may be geared towards kids there is some characters (I think Elsa has been in Epcot lately.)</p>

<p>Epcot is a worlds fair. There&#39;s a couple of rides, but it&#39;s definitely not fun and magic and fairy tails like the Magic Kingdom. Every culture they have at Epcot is essentially a gift shop and alcohol they have in that country. Like for example, the Mexico part is a giant Mayan pyramid full of tequila and blankets and margaritas. Not exactly the same as the Magic Kingdom.</p>

<p>In my opinion Epcot is much more geared towards older teens/young adults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wording this weirdly I think.</p>

<p>Epcot seems geared more towards education than fun. It&#39;s all about science and culture instead of rides and fantasy. So while older teens probably overlap into their target market, Epcot is probably the most adult-friendly Disney park I&#39;ve been to. </p>

<p>I mean the German place sells steins and German beer other stuff, but doesn&#39;t have any rides or anything that would be kid friendly at all. </p>

<p>I get where you&#39;re coming from, but Disney is about much more than children these days. Disney has their hands in absolutely everything. What they&#39;re doing with GMO is fucking nuts, and obviously isn&#39;t to cater to kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for sure that&#39;s the problem! Disney has their hands in everything and they have so much money who&#39;s going to go against them and win? </p>

<p>yeah I would agree, Epcot is the most educational one than the others, in my opinion Epcot just sucks, it&#39;s boring for kids and expensive for adults. </p>

<p>even if ppl don&#39;t agree that they&#39;re pushing a pedo agenda, they are still powerful enough to be able to push what ever they want without anyone getting in the way which is very scary. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disclaimer: I mean this as a genuine question and not to be condescending.</p>

<p>Has Disney done anything recently that would need to be gone up against? I try to pay attention to as many headlines as possible, but some things are bound to slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about Epcot as I&#39;ve never been or done much research on it, but I have to strongly disagree with your insinuation that Disney is &quot;pushing a pedo agenda.&quot; They are definitely a force with all of their money and resources, but I think it&#39;s more that Disney is trying to broaden their consumer base to try and be as inclusive as possible, to &quot;milk to cow,&quot; so to speak. To me, it makes sense that they would want to have some events or parks that cater to the likes and vices of adults on top of the ones they have that cater to those of children. It would seem to me that Disney is trying to broaden their horizons in a way, in an effort to make as much money as efficiently as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo, Disney is actually geared towards people of all ages, not just kids. There are several jokes across Disney movies that are very tongue-in-cheek that the parents or adults will get that go right over the children&#39;s heads. There are a lot of adult themes and adult humor in Disney movies that I understand now that I&#39;m older that I never noticed when I watched them as a kid. Not to mention that California Adventure, a sister park of Disneyland, is more geared towards older kids an adults and to the best of my knowledge alcohol is served in a few places within that park.</p>

<p>The interesting thing about Disney, I think, is that it is fun for people of all ages. There may not be a ton of rides in the park and a lot of areas might be more themed for toddlers, but I for one really enjoy going to Disneyland as an adult, walking around taking pictures and going on a few of the rides that are a little more interesting (Space Mountain has always been a favorite of mine and probably always will be). Just because a lot of it is geared toward kids doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s ONLY for kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>for sure! and i&#39;m totally on board with that, how else are you going to handle the heat, sticky dirty kids, and those long ass lines. </p>

<p>i&#39;m talking about food &amp; wine, the event that they have that is really a place ppl go to drink, i don&#39;t think it&#39;s right or normal for a kid place to host an event where the majority of ppl are drunk. I don&#39;t think drunk adults and a ton of kids who get easily lost mix. I know most of us get drunk and do normal drunk things but how many places have we gone to (bars, clubs, parties) where there is at least one drunk person who gets out of line or a little too handsy. </p>

<p>most people go to Disney for Disney and then they have a few drinks, food &amp; wine, ppl go to drink mainly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iâ€™m at Epcot every year for the food and wine festival. I assure you , there is a low in children attendance during that time. Epcot is not really geared towards kids, there are only maybe 3 attractions geared specifically for kids. The rest is not.  If there are pedos around it is at Magic Kingdom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Selling alcohol does not necessitate promoting getting drunk. In fact, there are a lot of liability concerns with over serving. I&#39;m not saying Disney doesn&#39;t over serve, but your claim that &quot;getting people drunk&quot; is the goal of selling alcohol at Disney defies logic. They&#39;d much rather sell you as much alcohol as they legally can stretched out across an entire day, carefully making sure you don&#39;t get too intoxicated so as to limit lawsuits, and extract as much money out of you as possible. If the goal was to get you drunk, they&#39;d sell jaeger bombs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chuck E Cheese is geared toward small children. I highly doubt you&#39;d find many 10 year-old&#39;s flipping out to go to Chuck&#39;s like they would for DL or DW. Disney is geared towards children of all ages, even those who may no longer be kids (in capitalism, why leave out any person you can fleece money from by limiting your audience/patrons? It&#39;s only advantageous to include everyone so you can make the most money, which is probably why Disney does so damn well).
I know 25 year olds who flip their lids to go to Disney because they like it. I have a 43 year old friend who still loves Mickey Mouse and everything Mickey. She&#39;s married, cannot have children, and Disney and Mickey are her thing. Hell, she named her cat Mickey. Further, she really loves food, and her husband likes to drink. I could see her dragging him there so she could be at Disney, and eat, and he could drink to deal with the fact that he&#39;s not into Disney, but both enjoying the food and her gladly enjoying Disney and Mickey and him gladly drinking beer and eating. Hell, I, too, would need all the food and wine/beer/alcohol-in-general available at Disney just to deal with everyone else&#39;s screaming me-me&#39;s and underfoot children that do not belong to me.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re failing to remember that practically everyone grew up on Disney, and some people enjoy Disney and what it&#39;s all about; the fantasy, the innocence of having the childlike imagination, the magical-ness in it all, etc, and they never outgrow that.</p>

<p>Some adults actually retain a bit of the innocence that, far too often, many of us completely shed when we become adults. Many of us see evil where it doesn&#39;t exist because we train our brains to be vigilant, and others are innocent to the point where they don&#39;t see evil right in front of them.
It doesn&#39;t make them pedos, nor does it mean something is geared toward pedos. It&#39;s geared toward making the most money possible, which honestly, is what any corporation is going to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Have you been to Epcot? The only thing that may be geared towards kids there is some characters (I think Elsa has been in Epcot lately.)</p>

<p>Epcot is a worlds fair. There&#39;s a couple of rides, but it&#39;s definitely not fun and magic and fairy tails like the Magic Kingdom. Every culture they have at Epcot is essentially a gift shop and alcohol they have in that country. Like for example, the Mexico part is a giant Mayan pyramid full of tequila and blankets and margaritas. Not exactly the same as the Magic Kingdom.</p>

<p>In my opinion Epcot is much more geared towards older teens/young adults.</p>
