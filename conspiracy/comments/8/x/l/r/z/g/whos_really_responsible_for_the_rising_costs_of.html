       i'd like a monetary policy perspective on this, if anyone has one-- is it big banks or the fed dictating costs to colleges and universities? it recently came up in a lame, required, 2,000 dollar class i'm in, and the professor said something about the matter that i found ridiculous--that it was possibly due to rising health care costs. i graduated from a top 10 public university in the us in 2005 and had 4,500 in debt. now it seems people are paying upwards of 30,000 ? what's really going on ?

       It's more along the lines of critical thinking results in noticing when shit is wrong. It's why republicans want to slash education funding and bash college constantly for being liberal brainwashing.

       it's crazy that every single college would do this. something i've been considering is; do you think the schools are actually getting all of that money, or might it be possible that they are receiving percentages and sharing it with other entities--because i don't know where all that money could even be going.

       i didn't mind having a few thousand dollars of loans for a solid 4 years of reading literature and learning a foreign language among intelligent peers and phd professors. i definitely do mind paying much, much more, later in life, for a 'certification' education. i feel so bad for high school grads now who want the intellectual experience of college and simply can't afford it.

       Because once one college does it, and uses all that surplus money to build new labs and attract new researchers, other colleges have to step up their game or they lose out on all those government grants.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of affordable colleges out there, but the prestige research institutions are constantly competing for talent and money, and see undergrad students as the bottomless pit of money that they are.

       i would agree, but it seems that many if not most of the schools have all raised prices and continue to do so year after year. i know it has to do with the amount of loans that are allowed to be approved to young people with basically no credit at all, i'm just trying to figure out the purpose behind allowing all these people to take out loans that they will not be able to pay. one idea is literally creating debt slaves, morbid as it sounds...

       It's basically the mortgage situation leading up to 2008, except the bubble can't pop when they just keep dragging the country into endless debt. This goes for QE and banking in general, healthcare, education, and more. More or less it's a loophole to print money for various rich people and the politicans they buy.

       How is it their fault? The Government created the atmosphere for it to happen. With out it, they couldn't do it. So, who's fault is it really? Student loan debt (ie. Government) debt, is the only debt that you cannot get rid of via Bankruptcy.

       The colleges could have kept tuition where it was and not given their employees raises. How could that have backfired? You tell the employees 'we're not giving you raises because that would require the students to pay too much' and that's the end of the conversation.

       Your statement necessarily stipulates that man is a slave to the market, that he lacks agency and autonomy. 'Gee Bob, I would have liked to give you a great deal on this, but according to the market price, I just physically can't.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Free-market capitalism is not a natural phenomenon like gravity; it is artificial, man-made, just like communism and every other system. It's not something that has just always existed to which we adjust ourselves, it's something we've consciously created.
      </p>

       A landlord has the ability to keep prices where they are despite the wealth of people looking to rent; only greed would raise it, and greed, despite being natural, is not an inevitability, just as the natural instinct for violence is overridden by self-control. Saying 'the money was too good, I just couldn't refuse' shows the same kind of lack of agency as 'she was too beautiful, I just couldn't refuse'.

       Best of luck tracing where the fuck that tuition money goes.  Yet, next year tuition will rise more than inflation, mysteriously.  Maybe books went up?  Nope, kids have to pay interest on the books separately.  Maybe the staff is just rolling in money?  Mmm nope, state college professors make jack shit.  Dollar for dollar, where is all this higher ed money going then?

       This is true. Higher-ups in the administration, however, get paid far more than they're worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The median pay for a college president is over 400k. The University of Chicago pays their pres. over 3 mil per year. This is fucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       At a certain point, colleges shifted from a pure education business model to a straight up business model with a side of education. Colleges are brands and students are consumers of those brands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Colleges therefore spend the money they make (in part at least) on increasing the value of that brand. This means: providing students with an attractive "college experience," which has absolutely nothing to do with getting a college education.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to this that the American public thinks that this 'college experience' is indispensable to becoming a viable adult, so you've got a captive consumer base. Queue the jacking up of tuition rates and scams involving loans... Academic journals and publishers jacking up the cost of access to information... and corporate food providers demanding space on campuses to sell kids a $10 sandwich every day of the week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the actual educators - professors - get budget cuts and hiring freezes. Unless they bring in extra bucks for themselves and their departments through grant applications and the like. But don't be fooled, colleges only like these because they increase the brand value of the school. It's fucked.

       i get you on this, but i contend that, if you're willing to devote a few years to it, it's absolutely amazing to get to go to college for 'fun.' i went in knowing that i hadn't received the level of education i wanted in high school, and it was amazing to go to a big, respected school and have a huge roster of classes to choose from, many of which were really well-taught. it's not always about just getting a job; you choose to defer and work that out later. it's about developing as a person, and making ties with others who are somewhat on your level. it didn't lead directly to a job, but i'm doing just fine and i very much appreciate my cheap college experience. sorry for the terrible caps/grammar, left the computer in humidity.

       really interesting thoughts. it's sad to see learning, one of the most sacred things about being human, being turned into a cash cow. and you're very right about the actual educators getting screwed worse and worse every year, as tuition goes up and up. this is definitely going to bite everyone in the ass.

       That could have more to do with donations being earmarked only for certain improvements.  Same thing happens everywhere.  A few million dollars will be donated but only if it's used for x purpose.  The budget isn't just a giant pot that all the money is thrown into to be used however the college wants.

       That's what they tell me, that high-end donors want their bust in bronze in an athletic building, not a blurb in the student newspaper about generating 'x' number of scholarships. Either way, that's messed up and the rouse of "student-athletes" need to end.

       They bloat up the administrative staff and wrap more and more red tape and bureaucracy around the school. Everyone has secretaries or juniors and then you add in interns and it's just massive.

       Better yet, ask your professor this. Ask him or her WHY they think the cost of education is justified. As a species, wouldn’t it make more sense to have education be one of those things thats easily obtainable or better yet free? Especially if its for the betterment of humanity? People will say its his or her loss that they didn’t pursue an education. But if said person didn’t go to school because of lack of funds or resources, then the people actually missed out. If there is a starving child that has potential to be a doctor but cant develop said skills because of they’re environment/upbringing. Isn’t that on us? Why would ANYBODY want to hinder anybodies education if its to serve the betterment of humanity? We have a rare moment in time right now with a technology that has never been on the planet before. The internet. With this , education should be significantly reduced based on the reach of this technology alone but its not.....why? Technically a teacher could teach even more students then they could before. Just take the absolute smartest person in said subject and have them do lectures and teachings online and then if their is any hands on development that needs to be done, you can just go to a resource/learning center. These centers could be filled with the leftover teachers that weren’t able to teach because said expert now does it through the internet reaching thousands of people. These teachers would not be left out in the cold, they would still serve a purpose but it will be more along the lines of what a tutor would do. It just seems really stupid to me that I could connect with someone on the other end of the globe, potentially learn anything i want whether it be physics, computers, science or otherwise but then still be denied an apprenticeship or job because I “don’t have the knowledge or certificates to do said job”. But if you’re some crazy savant at something like rain man was, you would probably get a pass with any sort of agency that wanted you and therefor probably wouldn’t care whether you had a piece of paper authenticating what you know. I think of how the CIA or FBI ask previous criminals that turned good how to catch other criminals like them. They didnt go to school for any of this crime stuff, but the alphabet agencies know they sure are the best at what they do and therefor trust them. Talk about a backwards world we live in.

       it has to do with the money. ppl are profiting off of selling dreams. the world you describe would involve a lot of people willing to work together to make it a better place for just that reason. but if it's not financially lucrative to those doing it, it naturally falls to the wayside.

      <p>
       Universities found that thanks to student loans, demand for a college education was inelastic.  They could keep raising the price and it would not affect the demand for a college diploma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Student loans are magical for lenders because they aren't able to be wiped out by bankruptcy, it's almost quite literally a form of indentured servitude.  A property mortgage is secured by the property itself, an education is secured by your life -- you can walk away from a property, you can't walk away from your life.  So lenders can keep loaning ever larger sums to match tuition increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's more.  Sociologically, there are strong forces in our culture that "you need to go to college".  It's considered the key asset in raising your long-term wealth accumulation, an increase in status and a vocational requirement for a "good" job. This was probably a transitory truth, for some generation or so, it really was kind of a guarantee of a good middle class lifestyle to get a college degree, opening the door to a quality white-collar occupation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations also are partly to blame.  At one time, screening applicants for a degree was a simple and often effective filter to find worthwhile employees.  People who had them were generally higher intelligence and a degree represented something of delayed gratification.  Rather than grab a fairly high paying job after high school, someone who put off that added earning to gain a degree demonstrated a willingness to hold off on short term gains for long term gains, a valuable personal attribute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time as colleges cranked out more graduates, a college diploma became a less valuable signal of a valuable employee but employers kept it anyway.  Colleges also diversified the vocational aspects of their education ("Business", "Marketing", and myriad other subjects largely devoid of any tie to traditional liberal arts subjects but also not connected to serious disciplines like engineering which required advanced subject mastery).
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations began to abandon their own internal vocational training.  So now we're in a situation where it's nearly impossible to get any job without a college degree, which forces students to pay whatever the university demands which is mostly easy to do because lenders will lend you any amount of money with the knowledge that you're stuck with that debt permanently.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's any good news, it's that we're about at the economic limit of this system.  Even though student loan borrowers are stuck with their debt, there's a practical limit on how big this debt can get and actually get paid off in a real working lifetime.  A college education isn't an inheritable asset that can be passed onto heirs, so we can't make it multigenerational like the mortgage on a family farm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employers are also equally hungry for workers with very narrow and short-term technical knowledge.  Unlike engineering where the basic principles boil down to mathematics and physics, web programming and other common computing tasks don't have well-defined mathematical formulas and constants that don't change.  Programming languages come and go, computing infrastructure changes rapidly, etc, and I think that employers at least in some areas are figuring out that these skills don't require a degree and those that are good at them obtain them in non-traditional ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The down side is that we have an entire economic system built around it.  Lenders making major interest income, an entire class of University bureaucrats built around expanding empires, as well as people with degrees who don't want to see their signalling value eroded to zero while they still have major loan balances.  We're also still stuck with a class system that people believe in and that class system depends heavily on sifting people by whether they have a degree, where they got that degree and what kind of a degree it is.

       The more difficult the qualifications are to obtain, the more a company knows it has someone who delay gratification.  Ideally they want a slave who will be happy just doing work and not gaining any gratification.

       Yeah but requiring 10 years of experience + 3 college degrees for a minimum wage entry-level job is it going to find anyone. Because the people with those qualifications will already be in the industry and have a better higher-paying job job

       I mean there are employers who just don't get it and have trouble filling positions because their requirements are totally unrealistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there are others with requirements that are just marginally too high that wind up not keeping the position filled.  They get people with the qualifications they want, but the people realize the job is BS or the employer sucks and then they go elsewhere with their qualifications.  I've seen this in action before, the revolving door.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very difficult convincing employers that ultimately most of their employees are basically just good enough not to get fired and bad enough to not get hired elsewhere.  And usually the lower the pay or worse the job conditions, the more true it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had this discussion with business owners who didn't want to pay adequately for positions and they get pissed when told that people aren't there because the owner is a super-duper guy who's super-duper proud of his company which is a super-duper place to work, they're there for the money.  They have to hit bottom somehow and realize that their company is just another little shithole that people only tolerate because it pays them well enough.  Usually in owner-run companies they're blinded by the fact that they siphon all the profits off and live in grand fashion and think because they've got it good, everyone else must, too.

       student loans backed by uncle sam and awarded to anyone whether they intend to actually give college the old college play have a huge role in the growth of tuition rates.

       The government created the environment for it to happen in and schools took advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no economic incentive for State U to keep tuition at a rate where an 18 year old working part time and over the summer can afford to go to school there if the government is willing to loan that 18 year old thousands of dollars to go to school.  Schools raise prices because those students can "afford" it, then the government freaks out when the cost gets too high so it loans out more money so that people can afford to go to school, so schools can now raise prices again...
      </p>
      <p>
       No need to stay affordable to that 18 year old when someone with much deeper pockets is footing the bill.

       It was when the US Government started backing all (or close to all) student loans.  Suddenly, outside of a hurt credit score, there was nothing lost when defaulting on a loan.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to be that if a student defaulted, the banks wouldn't get their money.  Now its all through the government.  If a student defaults, the banks still get their money.  The colleges still get their money.  Money comes out of the US, not the student.
      </p>
      <p>
       So charging more only means that college earn more money.  There's little risk to putting these high cost loans on the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of those ideas that seemed well intentioned, but ultimately hurt 18-25 year olds who don't have any money to begin with.  Or, since this is a conspiracy sub, this was designed to put students at a disadvantage, make them poor and dependent on social programs, and change their voting habits.

       Lol. I had to drop out because I had 7k debt after FAFSA fucked up my forms. Had a back and forth with them until they told me funding ran out. Campus gave me a defferment loan, but it had to be paid in full by the end of the year. I went to the hospital and couldn't finish class nor work for some time. Now I cant enroll anywhere till I pay it, and yesterday o went to the ER. They said bill is 4k if I pay in 120 days or 1400 if I pay in 2 days. Debt is terrifying

       You (all) really should. Thankfully, I dodge that whole bullet. Never got loans, and just got an Associates. Worked out wonderfully, for me.
