       We know that the powers at be want to significantly reduce the population, and that’s not hard to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between these manufactured wars, fluoride in our water, all these chemicals in our food, the shit they spray in skies, the propagating of abortion, the embracing of neuterizing yourself with transgenderism, squashing natural cures from everything between the flu to freaking cancer, the bullshit in vaccines, and more...
      </p>
      <p>
       They clearly want to cull us.
      </p>
      <p>
       A smaller population is a much more manageable population, and it is then easier to control/implement their end goal of a one world government.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO WHY ARE WE NOT TALKING ABOUT AUTISM?
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don’t mean the “quirky” high functioning Aspergers. I mean the disabling shit in diapers bashing your mothers head into the wall kind of autism, the severe kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rates are always measured based off current 8 year olds. So when they say it will be 1 in 2 by 2025, that is of kids being born RIGHT NOW. Or how about the fact by 2050 it will be 9 out of 10?
      </p>
      <p>
       And tell me...are they going to be actually caring for all of these kids with government funding? Why are these kids entered into registries upon diagnosis? What’s the plan here guys?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s just say I think there is a reason they are trying to amp us up so much on being pro abortion and now pushing pro voluntary human euthanasia. If right now the push is to let us make these decisions...maybe the government will be making it for us when it’s 9 out of 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind the Georgia guidestones call for 500M population, that is a 90 percent reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don’t want to hear any bitching here about my being insensitive to autism. I have Aspergers and I have an autistic toddler.

       I tried to look it up just now, not sure exactly where I read it as I literally constantly am having to research autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you however just look up the current rate of change every two years (about 17 percent) and extrapolate it out to the year 2050 having a nuerotypical child will be very rare.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact there is such a massive increase (better diagnosis is bullshit do you recall seeing kids flapping arms and rocking back and forth in grade school) shows it’s not a sudden genetic blip. This is a result of an insanely toxic environment, putting things into our bodies we shouldn’t be, and lack of nutrition, it’s only going to get worse.

       I rarely saw autistic kids more than 20 years ago.  You see them all the time now.  I didn't know a single friend that had an autistic sibling, but I have multiple friends that have autistic children now.  Something is definitely causing an increase in autism.

       It has gone from almost unheard of to common.

       It has gone from
       <em>
        undiagnosed
       </em>
       to
       <em>
        diagnosed
       </em>
       . The autism spectrum is now considered quite wide and covers a lot of symptoms. Saying “I didn’t know anyone with autism growing up” is dumb. Surely you did, but they were never diagnosed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s like after the identification of schizophrenia you said, “weird, there were no schizos when I was growing up...just your occasional crazy!”
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the OP, for claiming to “research” autism so often, is pretty uneducated about the topic.

       Especially girls with Aspergers, since it manifests differently in girls than in boys, girls' special interests are often more gender-typical and girls frequently learn to 'mask' it better.

       I fully agree with you that the environment we live in now causes it. Not the actual environment but just the fact that pretty much all the food we eat is not natural, and is processed in some way. Im pretty sure its not only autism thats increasing, but all kinds of mental and/or physical disabilities.

       New Jersey actually has the highest rate by far that recently tripled  (hmmmm most polluted state) at 1 in 34

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cincher there is when the overall rate is 1 in 59 that’s an average taken of girls and boys with boys being at 1 in 38, girls 1 in 152. So New Jersey boys is scary high...
      </p>
      <p>
       And remember this of CURRENT 8 year olds. The rate of babies right now is much, much higher. Looking at videos of my toddler he had it from the beginning.

       actually the real rates might be closer to 1 in 34.
      </p>
      <p>
       that is 1 in 20 boys. Autism is not the only effect. if this continues  there will be few normal boys left within 1-2 decades.

       At the moment they are more interested in hiding the problem than admitting that we are in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the UK they stopped reporting Autism rates over a decade ago. They still quote the old numbers from the early 2000s.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is no longer politically correct to point out that rapid growth of Autism cases is a problem and it is absolutely forbidden to talk about vaccine injury in the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       On social media it is getting harder and even here on r/conspiracy you will see a lot of downvotes and attacks if you suggest than vaccines are anything other than perfectly safe.

       With autism specifically you get SLAMMED for any mention of wanting to help your child recover, because “why can’t you just accept that poor child the way they are!”

       The fact that black Americans are generally under the poverty line that necessitates the most encompassing health care and mental health resources is the reason young black children aren’t diagnosed with autism at the same rate as other races. It is also still considered an extreme disability and embarrassment by some lower income communities, and it is seen as a curse and a burden, because the resources to help the individual aren’t readily available. Some people don’t
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       their kids to be diagnosed, and others just never knew it was a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many people just think back to their personal experiences and try to make broad scientific conclusions from them, this problem is overabundant in discussions about autism, I find.

       Do the Math and look at the number of blacks in US/UK (wherever you likely reside). The odds of seeing one dramatically reduce. Also, the odds of seeing a kid being openly autistic when you're about isn't exactly 100&amp;#37; either.

       My mom said when her generation was pregnant, the news told all the pregnant women to drink bottled water. Now a considerable amount of our generation is gay. My mom drank bottled water during pregnancy and both me and my brother have autism and are in special education, also my brother is dating a transgender and dyed his hair green and he likes to hang out with the LGBTQ folks. I've not had a girlfriend or a boyfriend but my Reddit name is fatgay100 and I precame while cuddling with one of my male friends and getting belted by another male friend.

       I wouldn’t be surprised at all with the bottle water thing. With all of these transgender kids they need to be checking their current hormone levels...not pumping them full of new ones

       My take on autism is that the government/corps want worker bees.  Autists usually have social problems.  You get a hyper fixated employee that has no social life. No family, more time and energy to work. The fact that some are genius types and some require 24/7 care is part of hit or miss meddling.  China is working on manipulating DNA to give their populations higher IQ's. You know if they are doing it, so is US. They have to keep up.  BTW ever pregnant woman gets the RH factor shot during pregnancy. The doctors said 1/3 of patients name the wrong father, so they just atomatically give the shot.  Who knows what's really in the vaccine.  All I know is something major is affecting the health of  Americans, not just with autism, but with autoimmune illnesses also. I've even read that some consider autism to be  an autoimmune illness.

       Healing is extensive, best bet is check out TACA or Generation Rescue. Start off with removing dairy, gluten, and soy. Even trace amounts will regress them a week. From there eat as pure as possible. If you can find a DAN! Doctor that can run tests to specifically address your child’s individualized health issues

       So true about gut-brain connection. I found gliadin/glutenin and the opiate effect on people with gluten intolerance (not mentioning casein in milk) plays a big part in brain / gut health in all children with autism. They will become addicted to bad food if allowed to, as anything with wheat/cows milk will be really addictive due to their opiate-like effect in the stomach once consumed.

       I don't know where you're from, so maybe it's different there, but where I am in the US, the Rhogam vaccine is only given to mothers who have RH negative blood. The father's blood type does not matter in this equation.
       <br/>
       If the mother is RH positive, there is zero need for the shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been a huge push recently to get every pregnant mother vaccinated with the Flu shot. Maybe that's what you were thinking of?

       No, it was Rhogam. My daughter had it 2 times with her kids. They used to test both parents, but now just give the shot. I'm in  the US.  It could be that they give it to only RH neg mothers, but Dr didn't specify that.

       I'm about 99% sure it's only given to RH negative mothers. I am RH negative, and have 4 children. I am very hesitant to allow any interventions without thorough research, when I am pregnant and after the baby is born, since my oldest son was diagnosed with non verbal, severe Autism, after hitting all of his developmental milestones ahead of schedule up until around 16 months of age. 
I made my Dr. test my husband before I would allow the vaccine, and I do not get it while pregnant unless there is bleeding. (you can only be sensitized to the RH factor if your blood, and the babies blood mix) I got the vaccine after my babies were born, and they were also tested for their RH factor. I only "needed" to get it twice, during all 4 pregnancies, once for bleeding, and once because the baby was RH positive like Dad. If I hadn't done the research, and allowed the Dr. to make my medical decisions for me I would have "needed" the vaccine 8 times.

       The powers at be don’t give two shits about “women’s rights”. If they did they would be helping pregnant women not making them think their only choice is to kill their child in utero. If it were actually about women’s rights they would be closing the wage gap, eliminating FGM, and doing a whole lot more for women in the Middle East.

       the system is not empathetic, it's mechanical.  war and dystopia can only exist where there's a lack of empathy and compassion.  i'm always asking myself why people don't care about others and why they can't see things from the perspective of others and it comes down to empathy problems.  autism is a variant of psychopathy.  empathy makes us human- without it we're the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       people with aspergers need to work hard to learn empathy because it's becoming a problem- communication is getting very difficult and empathy is slipping.  the logic is myopic and doesn't consider the human element.

       Originally "autism" was a diagnosis that was reserved for children who failed to develop normally with indications of that problem beginning to appear not long after they were born.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they are presently calling and referring to as "autism", however, is very different and is actually happening to children who were developing normally and then suddenly started to regress and lose motor, mental, and communication skills they had firmly developed and already acquired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite being treated as some kind of a "mystery" that like what was previously identified as "autism" was, this too has been presumed to be due to some unidentified genetic flaw when it is actually far more symptomatic of neurological damage that has been directly caused by "poisoning".
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course no one wants to admit, let alone investigate the possibility that the neurotoxins in vaccines could possibly have anything to do with that or that the number of such cases has grown apace with the steadily increasing number of vaccines being mandated and administered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like no one wants to draw any attention to or investigate the number of sudden infant deaths among otherwise completely healthy babies that have all occurred within 24-48hrs of those infants also being given a vaccine or multiple vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the tremendous resistance to even the suggestion that there could be a connection and that it should be thoroughly investigated it's far harder to believe that there
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       , rather than is one.

       The thing is that something like 98 percent of kids with autism have the MTHFR mutation. This impairs the bodies ability to detox.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you introduce vaccines, sure it is easy to say they don’t “directly” cause autism, but in a kid with this mutation that is increasing common...if they can’t detox out the adjuvants of the shots...it’s not going to go well.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why SO many parents have recovered their children with chelation (detox heavy metals, before something slams me a more gentle chelation exists google ACC).  The fact recovery exists shows this is something to be recovered FROM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t get me started on antibiotics, Tylenol, etc- two other massive causes. Bottom line if you focus on getting your kid truly, truly healthy the autism begins to disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell its amazing what dietary changes alone does with removing dairy gluten and processed foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Autistic kids are kids with significantly health problems that have a buzzword label put on it and told to be dog trained with ABA.

       There is only one cure for Autism, MONEY, money for therapies, money for detox, money for expensive food to keep them detoxed, money for caregivers, and above all HEEEELLLLLPPP!!!!!!!!~!
      </p>
      <p>
       The irony of it all is that my severe son, is such a handful that I'm forced to work from home in order to help my wife care for him and our other kids.  Therefore I cannot find a better paying job (being forced to work from home), and therefore cannot afford the treatments, and therefore there is no change, it only gets worse.... and messier.

       I'm sure the government will come in though any day and give us all the assistance we direly NEED /s

       As a father of two boys with Autism, one being severe and non-verbal (the severe one pretty much as you described above for the most part) THANK YOU!  It gets really REALLY infuriating watching the diagnosis rate skyrocket, and then see the CDC etc just shrug their shoulders as if there is nothing wrong.  Its too early and not enough coffee for me to go on a rant right now, so just remember, this is new, this isn't how it has always been (another wonderful lie propagated by the news, etc) and its only getting worse.  The ONLY way we're going to find a solution to this EPIDEMIC (calling a spade a spade is all) is by taking off the blinders of our society, and addressing the causation of it.  Is it GMO food?  Vaccines?  Both or something else entirely interacting with genetic quirks that cause Autism to present itself?  I do not know, but what I DO know is that we are NEVER going to fix this problem until we allow ourselves as a society to re-evaluate EVERYTHING we think we know and solve this epidemic!

       Btw I get to look forward to my retirement, caring for a severe 40 yr old with the mind of a 3 year old (at best) when I get to be the age of 70.  My wife and I are sentenced to groundhog day for life and I am so looking forward to the future /s

       Mercury and Aluminum salts are used as preservatives and adjuvants in vaccines. Mercury and Aluminum salts dissolve in fat (e.g., brain, liver) and combine to form an amalgam. Either one alone is fairly benign. Combine them, and you get this:

       Imagine that reaction taking place within the human body -- specifically, within an infant's brain or an adult's liver. That would explain both "autism" (brain damage) and "auto-immune disease" (liver damage).
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts are that the salts cross the brain barrier more easily in infants. For adults, the liver is more fatty and is the target organ.

       I couldn’t agree more. Also need to look at Tylenol and antibiotics though it’s not just the vaccines alone.

      <p>
       In Cuba they don’t use Tylenol and have a very low autism rate, Tylenol deplete glutathione.

       Antibiotics destroy the gut and autism is being viewed more and more as a gut thing.

       I have an interesting theory about autism that i thought of while i was high. I feel like technology and medical advancements have helped people who normally would not have survived back in the day a chance at survival. Take glasses for example. Someone who has really bad eyesight back in the day (before glasses were invented) wouldnt have survived. But with the medical advancements aka invention of glasses these people are able to breed. Take a person like that and breed them with another person who wouldnt have survived and then you are basically breeding genetic malfunctions that SHOULDNT have been passed on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like take someone who wears glasses (wouldnt have survived back in the day) and someone with severe acne (someone who maybe wouldnt have found a mate back in the day) and then they breed. They werent meant to breed. So then these weird mutations just get passed on and on and on creating a severely disabled child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically we are preventing survival of the fittest bc of medical advancements.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that ive written it out it seems like a really dumb thought.

       That’s actually pretty interesting and not dumb. Like the MTHFR is a gene mutation that has exploded in recent times and impairs the body’s ability to detox. Something like 98 percent of autistic kids have this gene, and what guess what they can’t detox out the adjuvants in vaccines.

       Thanks! i will have to read about that gene mutation. I'm scared to death of having an autistic kid to the point of possibly not having kids because of it. So I like to hear about the topic.

       Well if you do have one they are recoverable. It takes time and a lot of effort along with the patience of a saint, but it’s doable.

       Just to play devil's advocate, what if TPTB know they fucked up by releasing something that causes Autism, so they are intentionally culling the population to reduce the number of people who procreate with Autists? Once this genetic deformity dies off, it will undo the damage they did and they'll let us breed again.

       No Iceland did it for Down’s syndrome, there is no way to detect autism in utero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Abortion is a massive slippery slope, today it is in our control, what about as they put it into the governments control? Did you know there are instances like Charlie Gard of the government forcing people to take their toddlers off life support and don’t let them try alternative treatments? Or how about the push in medically assisted suicide? If things are like this now, combine with some groups thinking you should be able to “abort” up to age 5, it’s not outside the realm of possibility to consider the government may eliminate all “useless eaters” in the future the way hitler did

       I dont think that the world needs billions of people. Maybe a lot of people hate life. Maybe a lot of people use up the air and pollute the planet and spread negativity because they don't live well. I don't think the Earth always had billions of people on it and I don't think we need billions of people. I dont know what happens to billions of human beings who arent born but I dont think they need to be here lol

       I don't know where you're from, so maybe it's different there, but where I am in the US, the Rhogam vaccine is only given to mothers who have RH negative blood. The father's blood type does not matter in this equation.
       <br/>
       If the mother is RH positive, there is zero need for the shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been a huge push recently to get every pregnant mother vaccinated with the Flu shot. Maybe that's what you were thinking of?
