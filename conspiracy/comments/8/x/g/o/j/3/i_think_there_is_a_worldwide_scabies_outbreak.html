       I do see it come and go in severity, and I’m pretty sure they are putting medication in our water supply to try and control it. I have pondered the idea that I’m fucking schizophrenic, until I brought it up to other people and they agreed. Nobody wants to admit they have scabies, which I think plays a big role in why it hasn’t gone mainstream as well. Anyway I would love peoples opinion.

       Scabies can be a pretty serious skin condition.

       There’s all sorts of irritants in all the different environments worldwide. It’s hard to say if they’re all the same condition as the causes involved are a part of vastly different factors.

       The only other explanation I have is a pollutant or maybe even radiation. But it’s pretty almost completely consistent to scabies. They are itching their legs and wrists and between their fingers. Some people are itching so bad if you look at their hands they have sores.

       I believe scabies is caused by a mite.

       Unless all these people are accurately diagnosed with scabies, it’s just hearsay.

       It would be a boon for the pharmaceutical industry so I don’t think it’d be covered up or censored.

       Yeah I’ve had it twice and it’s not fun. You have to get a cream and wash all your clothes then bag them for like a week. But if so many people have them in a large population, it’s almost impossible to get rid of. You are just going to keep getting it from the people around you. And big warehouses don’t want to make it public because if people claim they got it at work they could potentially be paying the bill.

       Ivermectin is only used on people-scabies if the regular treatments have failed, and requires two well spaced not insignificant doses. It wouldn't work well or at all really diluted in the water supply, most drugs would be impossible to dose people effectively

       I read somewhere that furniture companies vans can spread them. People buy new furniture, have it delivered and have the company take their old stuff and infest the moving vans. Here in Texas the vans probably get hot enough to kill them most of the year but cooler climates may harbor them longer.

       For bed bugs, roaches, etc, use boric acid [drug store] on the carpets, crevices, mattress, counters, etc. Also diatomaceous earth, it is a natural product and can be purchased in pool supply stores since it is used in pool filters. Both are inexpensive white powders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't breath the DE. It is the skeletons of single celled algae and formed from silica. You don't want that stuff in you lungs. Like boric acid it does a number on the exoskeletons of insects and spiders and is mostly non-toxic to mammals. Sulfur powder is also effective, but it can be explosive, allergic, and it is highly toxic to fish and aquatic life.
      </p>
      <p>
       An effective scabies control paste can be made out of vaseline and powdered sulfur [garden section, fertilizer], but vaseline all by itself only makes the scabies mites spread. Do NOT get either in the eyes. For that area use a greasy make-up type concealer and/or a sticky, shiny lipstick. Scabies REALLY don't like lipstick. I don't know why but it kills them better than just about anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also to control scabies you have to bathe Every Single Day, no exceptions, and use clean towels. And change your bedding and your clothes daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you can sleep in a bed dosed with powdered sulfur, which is possible unless you get it in your eyes. Then it isn't. Sulfur is VERY irritating.

       I read that they have a synthetic diatomaceous earth called Cimexa that works better. I have a room mate that works for the airlines and he brought home a little present a while back. Had to throw out my bed and sofa. Now I have the legs of my new bed inside little plastic cups with a bunch of Cimexa in it after having the exterminator come out to treat the apt. Now I itch all the time but I am pretty sure it is just my anxiety disorder getting the best of me. When we had the bugs I had bites and a really bad allergic reaction rash. I guess we got lucky and caught it early. The bug guy sprayed once, came back and sprayed again after two weeks. Two weeks from now he is going to come back and place traps to detect them to make sure they are all gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say we now have strict decon procedures for when that room mate returns from a trip!

       You’ve been awake too many days in a row. Those aren’t scabies, it’s just the drugs. Meth and other amphetamines make you see things that aren’t there. Seeing bugs and itching and scratching are common side effects.

       Thank you! Now it will be worse. But I'm actually pretty certain it's not scabies in my case, but I react to pesticides from vegetables. Ate bell pepper and (mild) chillis. Happens sometimes, but usually only lasts one day or rather night. Took me few years to figure what causes it...

       I had scabies 30 years ago. I don't have scabies anymore. Scabies feel like bugs are crawling all over you, but you can't see anything there. You know it when you have it.

       In the good old days, when people
smoked cigarettes and pipes everywhere,
you never heard about scabies epidemics
or bedbug infestations.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that airborne second hand smoke and 
nicotine kept the mites and bugs 
under control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both scabies and bedbugs are more
prevalent in countries with low rates
of tobacco consumption.
