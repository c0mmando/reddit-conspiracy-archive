       Seems there has been another recent departure besides Boris. On mobile so hard to get to links.
      </p>
      <p>
       May was recently pushing for a softer Brexit than originally planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can someone with more knowledge weigh in on what Boris's resignation means and what impact it will have?

       I saw similar speculation in the UK thread. I don't quite understand how or why her position is at risk. Is this just an internal political maneuver for Boris to resign? Sort of forcing the issue with May?

       It's now four key resignations in less than 24 hours. She's going tits-up soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brexit Secretary David Davis, junior Brexit ministers Steve Baker and Suella Braverman resigned yesterday. That's three of the five total Brexit executives! Now Johnson, who is an idiot but could've been a useful idiot for May (who is an idiot herself).

       Plus she ranked that election about a year ago. That didn’t end her but it really seems to have started her major spiral. I’m a yank so perhaps my input on UK politics is not worth much but that’s a lot of resignations in the short term and a lot of fuck ups in the last few years

       I'm not from the UK so I can't really comment on what is being focused on. But, it does seem like they have a long history of poking fun at politicians. I'm not sure they are laser focused on Trump. This type of news may just steal the attention back towards domestic matters.

       It isn’t. Short term could be bad due to the uncertainty. Over time Brexit is / will attempt to undo the layers of EU which changed it from solely being a trading union

       Calling it "suicide" is perhaps melodramatic, but perhaps not. Here's a good article on why Brexit is a bad idea:

       It's going to hurt them short term for sure. The main issue people have though are the long term options that could go either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It certainly opens up possibilities for more favourable trade deals with non EU markets as the UK can do things on their terms, but it may be harder to get good deals with the EU markets as they are unified and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the UK is largely a financial hub and it makes up for most a significant amount of their GDP. However the main reason the UK is a financial hub in the first place is because of the EU.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically things could go either way and many people prefer the devil they know so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leaving the EU does remove some stability from the UK, and some fear it could be a cain reaction that leads to other large EU powerhouses leaving too. This could lead to some of the smaller countries having a really hard time and Euro nations that are struggling tend to be ready to throw down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it removes some options for work etc. Currently you can live and work in any EU country if you are part of an EU nation. This would end and it tends to affect young people more as they can't opt to move as easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically the short term is going to suck either way for the UK, but long term it kind of swings to one of two extremes. Either it's going to be the best thing the UK has ever done, or the worst.
      </p>
      <p>
       The younger generations tend to value options and have a greater sense of thinking as humanaity as a whole, thus staying in the EU seems logical. Older generations tend to lean towards caring only for their own nation and thus see leaving as logical. I guess it largely comes down to where you want to see the world in 100 years time.

       You say this yet -
Brexit is exactly how democracy is supposed to work. The Brexit campaign started at grass roots with farmers and the countryside alliance . They gained momentum and support in cities , arguing the case and went on to democratically  (by votes) win EU elections . This led to the farcical situation of the UK representation in the EU of the UK by Farage and co who wanted the UK to leave for a decade.
Voters then put pressure on gov for a referendum, which was one again democratically won.
      </p>
      <p>
       How on earth can you call it a scam ?  What is you evidence that this political movement had any more corruption than any other?

       Admittedly, I'm an American, so I'm an outsider looking in, but from what I gather, there's a lot of shit going on behind the scenes on multiple fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
       For starters, I think a lot of people are starting to realize how this is all going to have a very negative impact on Britain going forward and it's not as easy a split as they initially thought. This is scaring some away, or making them agree to concessions, and is creating rifts among the Brexiteers. Supposedly Johnson left because he doesn't like that May is conceding to the "soft" Brexiteers.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, and yes, many are going to attack this, but it's still the truth, there is more and more coming out about how much of an impact Russia had on the Leave campaign, and also the same organizations and people that were behind Trump in the US and UK.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://twitter.com/carolecadwalla/status/1016120637100879872">
        Here's a good tweet from the Observer's Carole Cadwalladr
       </a>
       who is leading a lot of the reporting about what's going on there:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Brexit-Trump-Russia. Same Cambridge Analytica. Same Steve Bannon. Same Robert Mercer. Same Facebook. Same Russian ambassador. Same undisclosed meetings. Same offered business deals. One difference: you’ve got Mueller
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Eventually (and hopefully), the British Government is going to be forced to look into all of this, and it's going to get ugly. So it seems like a lot of the people jumping ship are trying to get ahead of this.

       Of course there are people that support both naturally, and I'm not at all saying "it was all Russia!!", there are tons of factors. Both Brexit and Trump are responses to trends going on in UK and US society. My point is that there was a strong Russian influence into the Brexit campaign that involved tons of shady shit, possibly and likely illegal, that is just coming to light now. Was that the deciding factor that pushed the vote to "yes"? No. But it was definitely one factor that should be scrutinized, and I would feel the same if there was the level of influence coming from France instead of Russia.

       Then why did you ask only about their motive? Seems like you're shifting the goalposts. Anyways, the "execution of the plan" has been discussed ad nauseum over the last couple years. The short version is that Russian bots waged targeted propaganda campaigns.

        Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because "Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"
       </p>

       Another that needs no explanation.

       No idea about any of this or what the relevance to the topic at hand would be, and I expect that clarifications from you aren't coming. I asked you to stop obfuscating and deflecting. This is the exact opposite of what I meant.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The cash was explained many, many times. It was not tax payer money. It was Iran's money to begin with. The agreement freed up Iranian assets that had been frozen under sanctions. The agreement only affected sanctions imposed to punish Iran for its nuclear program. Iran has other assets that remain frozen.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was an additional payment of $1.8B. That was the amount that U.S. and Iranian negotiators settled on to resolve an arms contract between the United States and Iran from the 70s. Iran had paid us for military equipment, and it was never delivered. As of 1990, there were $400 million in that account. Negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the total.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad we could clear that up.

       What do you mean? You've moved the goalposts again, by the way. Originally you were arguing that no explanation was given for the payment. Now that I showed that wrong you move onto something else. Not a good look.

       As I explained, we owed them $400MM plus interest. How much interest is appropriate is a somewhat subjective question. The issue stood before a panel of nine judges, including three independent jurists, who were reportedly near a decision on binding arbitration. The U.S. was concerned that the tribunal would mandate an award much larger than what was ultimately agreed upon. The Iranians were asking for $10B in arbitration.

       Difference is that we've got Mueller and we voted Trump in for 4 years, not forever. Trump will have his mark on America for a long time (if only through his Supreme Court nominations), but he doesn't have to be re-elected. He downright can't be re-elected in 6 years.

       In terms of governance, it means that May's Cabinet is now one useless deadbeat lighter. In terms of the Foreign Office, it means that the next incumbent will have to screw up spectacularly to look worse than their predecessor.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of Boris Johnson's career, it means he is preparing to run against May, painting May as a feckless traitor and himself as the true blue guardian of the "Hard Brexit" that he sold to the electorate during the referendum.

      <p>
       (The version of Brexit that Johnson sold to the electorate was a pack of lies and nonsense, but lies and nonsense are his stock in trade and there's no reason he's going to abandon them.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to think that even in modern Britain, politics aren't so debased that we could ever end up with an individual like Johnson in charge. Now, I wouldn't even put money on that idea.

       It will only take 48 letters from MPs to the 22 committee to trigger a leadership challange @- May.
The UK gov is in deadlock , May does not have enough votes to pass her Brexit turd and those that oppose her do not yet have enough votes to get rid of her.
      </p>
      <p>
       This won't last long , May and her Brexit plan are dead in the water.
The next leader should be a leader that supports Brexit and is not trying to quash / delay / brino /brexitinnameonly it.

       Even if a new leader comes in, how much of a "hard" Brexit do you realistically think the EU will agree to? The EU apparently basically laughed at May's plan, do you think they'll respond better to a harder Brexit?

       Evidently there is background fuckery at work here.  I think at least Johnson and Gove have been playing a role the whole time.  Both goofy unpopular characters who along with Davis were put in place to throw a spanner in the works and destroy the momentum of the Leave vote and UKIP.  These "resignations" now probably mean May's part in the narrative is over.  The next step will be the soft Brexit line to get Britain back on track to accepting more Muslim refugees like a good European country should.  Populist credibility will be in tatters and we will never again think about silly ideas like independence or self-governance.

       Of course there are people that support both naturally, and I'm not at all saying "it was all Russia!!", there are tons of factors. Both Brexit and Trump are responses to trends going on in UK and US society. My point is that there was a strong Russian influence into the Brexit campaign that involved tons of shady shit, possibly and likely illegal, that is just coming to light now. Was that the deciding factor that pushed the vote to "yes"? No. But it was definitely one factor that should be scrutinized, and I would feel the same if there was the level of influence coming from France instead of Russia.

       Even if a new leader comes in, how much of a "hard" Brexit do you realistically think the EU will agree to? The EU apparently basically laughed at May's plan, do you think they'll respond better to a harder Brexit?

       Difference is that we've got Mueller and we voted Trump in for 4 years, not forever. Trump will have his mark on America for a long time (if only through his Supreme Court nominations), but he doesn't have to be re-elected. He downright can't be re-elected in 6 years.

       No the cash when it happened was not even known to have been approved.  We didn't owe them shit.

       Look, you are so anti Trump that you even shillang on the New England Patriots sub because Kraft supports Trump.  You shared your theory and I shared mine.  You cannot debate without sending bullshit PMs.  Putting effort into reading your shit is a waste of time.
