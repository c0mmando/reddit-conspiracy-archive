<p>Robert Mueller was appointed by Bush and was vetted and took over the leadership of the FBI one week before 9/11.</p>

<p>The subsequent investigation into 9/11 cost around $17 Million.</p>

<p>Last week Mueller&#39;s Russian Collusion investigation just passed $20 Million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a fishing expedition, and the crimes discovered don&#39;t seem even remotely related to the scope of the investigation</p>

<p>Specifically I have not seen any evidence of Russian &quot;hacking&quot; of anyone&#39;s emails, haven&#39;t seen evidence of a credible attempt by Russia to interfere with US election. The Russians indicted by Mueller showed up to court and Mueller wasn&#39;t prepared to face them.</p>

<p>Mueller should be preparing for his own criminal defense, to defend against the FISA abuse that he was absolutely involved in </p>

<p>But in h real world, only little people like Martha Stewart go to jail, while the kingpins like the Clintons get off scot free </p>

<p>If you are conspiracy minded you might want to look into areas where its very likely he did shady things </p>

<p>If you are not conspiracy minded you may want to spend your time looking into proven cases of money laundering, or Richard Nixon&#39;s attempted cover up of Water gate to see if you can notice any patterns and similarities. If you cant see any you just might not be cut out for this sub, but thats fine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&gt; They are wasting money on a fake investigation that they know will never  &quot;bring him down&quot; it&#39;s a show. That money could be used for actually  fucking helping people </p>

<p>How come you&#39;re not making this argument when Trump spends millions to go golfing? Just wrap your head around how much effort goes into a federal investigation and it&#39;s only costed $20 million. But Trump has spent 3x that by flying to his own property every weekend and charging the government for all the Mar-a-lago services. He&#39;s not only spending your taxpayer money but he&#39;s profiting off it.   </p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t care how much money they spend on investigating <strong><em>another countries</em></strong> influence in our political campaign. They need to show what they find, and Mueller is going to do that. Weather Trump likes it or not. </p>

<p>Further, if Trump is so innocent like everyone on the right claims, why not let Muller exonerate him and make the dumb libs look like idiots. Let him finish up and show us what he has. What&#39;s wrong with that? Do you believe Mueller is going to falsify evidence? </p>

<p>The Russia conspiracy has absolutely become unhinged. Anybody that goes against the establishment narrative is said to be influenced by Russia. Even on reddit I get called a Russian troll allllll the time</p>

<p>It is a fact that Russia actively interfered with our democratic election. Multiple people from Trump&#39;s campaign have been indicted and/or flipped.  </p>

<p>maybe things that werent such a big deal when he was just a real estate developer. We already know that big business is shady, especially new york real estate and ESPECIALLY casinos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by Russian foreign policy?</p>

<p>I do not wish to focus on Russia. It’s a problem when any country corrupts our political institutions whether it’s Russia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, or any other nation. </p>

<p>I do not think we should limit these conversations to just Trump or just Russia. In fact, the most egregious example of political figure/Russia corruption is Hillary’s Uranium One deal.</p>

<p>But again, it’s not just Russia. When it comes to foreign corruption in American politics there’s probably no country worse than Israel.</p>

<p>this is the same Mueller who was in charge when the FBI was investigating the Anthrax murders. do you remember how that investigation turned out?</p>

<p>Why you shouldn&#39;t trust Muelller. </p>

<p>For five years, the bureau pursued as its prime suspect a virologist, Steven Hatfill, who at no point had handled anthrax, which is a bacterium. It was not until late in 2006 — when Mueller replaced the leader of the case — that Hatfill was dropped as a viable suspect. Two years later an Army anthrax scientist, Bruce Ivins, committed suicide as prosecutors prepared charges against him in connection with America’s worst episode of biological terrorism.</p>

<p>We&#39;re about 30 days from Mueller having to give over all his alleged evidence due to the 13 indicted russians narrative. To say his prosecution attempt is Soviet, would be kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So given inflation its actually got 5 million dollars to go before it equals the 9/11.  Fair point.  Wonder how long it will take before it catches up or surpasses.  But lets just say it stopped today.  The findings better really indict the president and Russia if this happened.   Also it should end in impeachment and more.  </p>

<p>So lets say it does.  Trump is impeached because Russia put him there.  That is definitely a big deal.  But is it as big of a deal as 9/11 was?</p>

<p>Thats debatable.  I would say no, but I am sure people feel different.  </p>

<p>So basically  until the findings and results come out its hard to argue, but this either illustrates the incredibly small investigation to a very big deal or the incredibly large investigation that so far has gotten nowhere.  And if its a situation where there is guilt has allowed an illegal president to hold office for nearly 2 years.</p>

<p>Its relevant.    </p>

<p>Not all of that increase went specifically to investigate 9/11, but nearly the entire FBI was retargeted after 9/11 to focus on terrorism, with 9/11 being the main investigation. So, really the FBI spent <strong>billions of dollars</strong> investigating 9/11.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$9m was spent by DOJ workers outside Mueller’s team. Which is a little deceptive when calculating the cost of the investigation. These are full-time Department of Justice employees. They would have been paid anyway. That $9 million isn’t an extra cost to taxpayers for the investigation, it’s just how the department allocated its existing resources.</p>

<p>So, $8m then, actually.</p>
