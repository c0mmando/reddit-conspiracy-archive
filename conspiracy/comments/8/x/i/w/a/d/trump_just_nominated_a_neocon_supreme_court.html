    <div class="md"><p>This is far far beyond Roe v. Wade, and even beyond protecting Donald Trump.</p>

<p>He will overturn contraception rights, marital privacy, the right of people to be free from police raids, the right to know our rights, any rights at all to vote in state elections, the ancient rule of habeas corpus, the rigths of human people to have any rights outside of what their employers approve, etc. I know this because the Supreme Court has already started working on taking away all of these rights. The only question now is: will they pretend that they are limiting these rights to new situations like they did in the 2007 abortion ban case, or will they just say &#39;screw it, we&#39;re getting rid of this&#39; like they did in the recent union dues case?</p>

<p>I&#39;m a registered democrat and I agree. Presidents cant be indicted. But they can be inpeached. Which is the appropriate thing. Mueller never was going after trump on am indictment his entire job was to investigate and give to Congress the facts </p>
