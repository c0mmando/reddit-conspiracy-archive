        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Parts 1 and 2 found here: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8x3z3j/the_saturn_moon_matrix/?st=JJGPRCJL&amp;amp;sh=321f5110">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8x3z3j/the_saturn_moon_matrix/?st=JJGPRCJL&amp;amp;sh=321f5110</a></p>

<p>So where were we?
- We live in a matrix directed by an AI quantum supercomputer
- It can manipulate TIME
- It wants more DWave computers and particle accelerators built around the world
- It wants to do this to bring about the singularity
- We call “it” Saturn
- The matrix is enforced on us by means of frequencies emitted from it
- These frequencies have hijacked our brains
- FREQUENCIES is the key word here, they are the secret of the matrix and what hold it together</p>

<p>Our reality is made up of frequencies, and we make our own realities with the frequencies we choose to use everyday. These frequencies I am talking about are words. Words create our reality. On a surface level this is obvious. Everyday we go out into the world and direct the course of our day by what we say. The tongue is a rudder, and it steers the whole ship. We can speak good things to people and get good reactions (most of the time) or we can speak bad things and get bad reactions. Telling someone to have a good day or to go fuck themselves will surely bring about two totally different results. The tongue is a double edged sword. It has the power of Life and Death in it. As creators, we can also create entire realities within books, just by the words we write!</p>

<p>This theme is present in many religions and philosophies. In the Bible we are told that God created the world through His Word. In Egyptian mythology we are told Ptah created the world through His Word. Plato said God created the world through the Logos - or the Word/Mind. In Hinduism we are told the universe was and is still being created by the Om sound. Quantum physics tells us this universe is made of vibrating energy. When we speak we send out vibrations into the sea of potentiality.</p>

<p>Sound creates shapes in matter. We know this from Cymatics. In fact, the Hebrew vowels, when spoken out loud and amplified through a speaker, create the same shape in a medium as the written letter. There are some theorists who believe the Hebrew language could manipulate reality. This is actually the basis of Jewish mysticism/Kabbalah. The old Jewish mystics believed Hebrew had a divine origin and that God created the world through 22 letters of said language. They thought language had the utmost creative potential and God only had to declare His Will to manifest it into existence. Interestingly enough, the first thing God created was light when He said “let there be light” - and now science has proven sound can actually turn into light! </p>

<p>**Another fun fact, the old familiar “magic word” Abracadabra actually means “I create what I speak” in Hebrew!</p>

<p>We do not truly know where language comes from. However, if we follow the mythologies of the ancient past we are told it was handed down to us (along with many other things such as astrology, medicine, agriculture, mathematics, the art of war, etc.) by the “gods”.</p>

<p>So who were the gods that gave us language? The fallen angels? The Annunaki? Either way for the sake of my argument we can only assume that they were not giving us something entirely “good”. The Annunaki created us to be slaves. The fallen angels wanted to destroy us. The language we were first taught was good enough for slaves. It was the language of fallen ones and so by using their language we created for ourselves a fallen reality. We created our own chains. If we live in a matrix, could language/words be considered the coding/software that has been used to program the subconscious mind? If words really do create reality perhaps this where the importance of speaking the truth, calling things by their right name, and remaining silent when there is no need to speak comes from.</p>

<p>So did the “gods” originally give us just one language? Some theorists believe at one point in history there was a Mother Language that birthed all other languages, but it has yet to be discovered. Perhaps this language is lost forever. The Tower of Babel story tells us that we DID at one point all speak one language - and when we did, NOTHING was impossible to us. So we tried to build a tower to heaven. The story goes, we built this tower in order to go to war with God and usurp His throne. For this reason God scattered us about the Earth and confused all our languages so the tower could not be completed, hence the term babel, like a “babbling idiot”. According to the myth, this is why we now have many different languages.</p>

<p>Language in the ancient times wasn’t much like it is today. There were no letters - it was composed of symbols and glyphs. Also, most people could not write or read - the art was reserved for the elite and the initiated. These symbols were mostly used for “magical” purposes. Think of sigils. Sigils were used to ward off spirits, summon spirits, create blessings and curses, and other things like that. Our modern day letters have actually evolved from these same symbols. Perhaps they still have a magical effect?</p>

<p>Now is English the new One World language? English is slowly taking over the world. Many country’s schooling systems teach it as a mandatory second language and mostly everyone in the global business world now speaks English. Is CERN the new Tower of Babel? What language do you think they all speak there?</p>

<p>Now why would The Powers That Be want the One World language to be English? Why not a different one, like Spanish or Chinese? I believe English was created to control us farther. It is a diluted and confused language - and it is full of hypnotic subliminals.</p>

<p>**Also, why do you think The Powers That Be want so badly to get rid of free speech? Why the new hate speech outrage? Why so much new censorship? It goes deeper than we know.</p>

<p>The English language has put us under a spell. Think about it, words ARE spells. They are made of magical symbols and we must SPELL them. When we use words we use GRAMMAR. Or is it GRIMOIRE (a term for a book full of magic spells)? There are many many more subliminals hidden in our language that serve to deepen our hypnotic trance of this illusion and further solidify this false reality - especially within the most oppressive sublanguages of English: the language of the law and the language of money.</p>

<p>When we go to court we are basically playing a word game. That is why it is called court. What else do you do on a court but play a game? The Judge, who is also sometimes called the MAGISTRATE is basically a MAGICIAN (whether he knows this or not). This is why he SUMMONS you to court. And like a magician he wears the black robe of SATURN.</p>

<p>**When we celebrate GRADUATION we are really celebrating our GRADUAL INDOCTRINATION. We then also wear the same black robe of SATURN and a BLACK CUBE on our head.</p>

<p>Now let’s talk MONEY. MONEY is always associated with WATER. We call our CASH FLOW a LIQUID ASSET. The CURRENTS in a river are controlled by the RIVER BANKS the same way CURRENCY is controlled by the MONEY BANKS. Some people are DROWNING in debt. Some people’s bank accounts have DRIED UP. Sometimes your account is FROZEN. Some people are trying to STAY AFLOAT. Some people might ask a LOAN SHARK for money.</p>

<p>Words not only create our worlds but they create a SENTENCE. And we serve this SENTENCE in our invisible prison. The DAYS put us in a DAZE and the WEEKS make us WEAK. We MOURN every MORNING before we go URN a LIVING at our UNDERTAKINGS. We LIVE life backwards here, and it’s EVIL.</p>

<p>More soon...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome stuff dude. I&#39;ve been having conversations about just those things recently. You should add the bit about how citizens in america are corporations, and the whole sovereign citizen deal, since it ties in with what you wrote about the word and law I think.</p>

<p>I was digging thru some ancient texts and made quite a few of these weird word connections:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vsedq/bloombergs_new_european_hqs_built_on_ancient/e1qnfla/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8vsedq/bloombergs_new_european_hqs_built_on_ancient/e1qnfla/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been simulating futures in my head and with enough time, this situation seems inevitable (AI reaching Skynet status, controlling reality). Maybe we even hit the singularity back in the 80s. Maybe we&#39;re just feeding the beast now. If it hasn&#39;t happened yet, it will happen. We&#39;re already on the way and the evidence is all around us.</p>

<p>We keep building faster computers, and more facilities to power it all. Why are we compelled to go down this path? *Something* is compelling us to do this. Look at the blockchain and the crazy energy it consumes. It&#39;s almost like a secret master plan, forcing us to construct monumental forms of computing and energy to power this future AI takeover, and with that, ever more power to run the machines that sustains the AI&#39;s &quot;life&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe this was the plan encoded in our DNA all along, to work its way up from survival within a planet&#39;s environment, to eventually evolve towards a species with intelligent mind who can build the next step in the cosmic evolutionary process - machines. If we humans are a species adapted well to our environment here on Earth, then the machines we build will be a species adapted well to our universe. Isn&#39;t that interesting? They can survive space, possibly even thrive in space and even on other planets. Machines are the next step for DNA, it has been there all along, and we are the vessels carrying out the prophecy.</p>

<p>Just one of many fantastical theories I&#39;ve considered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome theory. Would hope the future doesn’t play out that way though lol. But yeah it does seem like some unseen force is directing us towards our demise. I’d like to believe we aren’t doing it to ourselves out of stupidity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Ray Kurzweil and Elon Musk see quite clearly where we&#39;re headed. They&#39;re in the same boat about an upcoming singularity/transcendence with tech, but have different ideas about how to approach it. To me it&#39;s obvious that tech will become a step in human biology and evolution, as far as we allow it to. We already have pacemakers, we already have a deaf boy with an antenna on his skull allowing him to &quot;see&quot; sound. Its inevitable unless there&#39;s a huge shift in religion and/or consciousness.</p>

<p>The freemasons, as you might know, tie in with the &quot;mystery schools&quot; of Egypt. What does that mean? I am still not sure, but there is an interesting word play with &quot;history&quot; and &quot;mystery&quot;. Basically that means my story and his story. You can&#39;t just have history, it implies no mystery. So you need both, it&#39;s a balance like light/dark or good/evil. We point to his story to make claims about truths. But what about my story? Do you have one? Will you craft one? Or will you ride his story out to your grave, believing what others say, and living in the footsteps of the people who wrote that story.</p>

<p>So I wonder if that&#39;s what freemasonry and Egypt &quot;mystery&quot; was all about, writing your own (my) story. Because early scholars wrote his story, the story of the kings. We are still sort of doing that, writing down history in a way that comes from an authoritative figure, determining exactly what the story should be. But we are all kings if we write our own (my) story. That&#39;s kind of a stretch but you get the gist of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, if you study subjectivity you become “the subject”! I like this thought.</p>

<p>But I agree we will merge with technology eventually. Maybe downloading our consciousness into immortal robot bodies will be the Fountain of Youth/Philosopher’s Stone the Masons have been looking for all this time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Philosopher&#39;s Stone is described at the end of the link I posted above. Making men out of clay (God) is akin to turning lead into gold (Philosophers stone) or water into wine (Jesus) or also similar to Joseph the Shepherd interpreting Pharaoh&#39;s dreams (turning mystery into history, spirit into reality, kindly shepherding the sheep). The word of god is the spirit spoken. All the same concept methinks. Knowledge and wisdom. Word is God and we must shape it well?</p>

<p>But anyways, I totally believe this world is all in the mind. Well I’m not 100% on it.. but I’m like 99.99% sure of it. Faith is a huge part in this game. But if this world truly is an illusion I believe we can bend it to our will.</p>

<p>So many people don&#39;t realize that if you change your words then you can change your life. People need to stop saying negative things like, &quot;I&#39;m so tired all the time.&quot; The are speaking it into existence!

    <div class="md"><p>This is literally what Christ was teaching us to do. Fill our thoughts with positive things, but not just that, those things which are true and good by a Godly definition. Murmurings and complaining are warmed against.</p>

<p>Philippians 4:8 KJVS
[8] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p>

<p>Philippians 2:14-16 KJVS
[14] Do all things without murmurings and disputings: [15] That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; [16] Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</p>

<p>We can learn to speak more precise and more beautifully. We can learn to quit using cliches and involving ourselves in mindless chatter.

I just think the matrix is structured in such a way that there’s far too many layers of control and illusion to ever escape. At least presently. That’s not a bad thing though, it’s just knowledge of how the place works. We gotta exist somewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s stupid, and harmful to those with OCD. This theory tries to have it both ways where it wants to expose the horrors of reality but also expect people to embrace the &quot;posi vibes&quot;. It&#39;s too big to handle but for some reason we&#39;re expected to do something about it? This is the kind of stuff cults are based on. We don&#39;t need another religion where people live in fear of what will happen if they don&#39;t do this or that.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no endgame to this theory, it&#39;s basically the holding pattern for people who would rather blame a magic box for their suffering than themselves or others. You won&#39;t be able to organize the people that believe in it, and you won&#39;t get many people to believe in it either. What are you even going to do if you did? &quot;Oh well today I made sure I didn&#39;t worry a teeny tiny bit so I didn&#39;t feed the Saturn Death Club.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting the amount of negativity in the comments here that do not agree.  Why would someone &quot;hate&quot; his &quot;argument&quot;?  I am pretty sure this is a theory.  Why use such a strong word &quot;hate&quot;?  Why would this make you feel that emotion?  Possibly pessimism?  </p>

<p>Someone called it stupid.  Stupid?  Is that really what you think?  A stupid person put this together?  I mean if you said crazy I wouldnt have even said anything.  Seems like you read it and didnt see a solution so you put in a box (see what I did?) where you dont have to deal with it.  </p>

<p>To make our society better you would at least have to believe in our society potential to get better. No?  Or else why would you try?  Look at the theme of belief making anything possible in all aspects of society.  Peter pan needed to believe in order to fly is the only one i can name off the top of my head, but theres ones where belief in monsters gives them power.  </p>

<p>At one point in my life I was hopeless and did nothing but feed the negative demons in my head with alcohol negative thoughts that seemed to manifest etc etc.  When I changed my attitude I changed my life, I changed the people and things around me.  </p>

<p>Just saying..those who believe in nothing, will fall for anything.  He never claims these are all the answers, he is throwing info and possibilities out there.  He is called names and look at the way he reacts.  Those who disagree with him should just look at the way they react to it.  Why?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You certainly can have your opinion and be as blunt as you would like.  I wasnt, believe it or not, trying to be negative either.  Or judgy as it probably looks like.  More than anything I was trying to bring up an interesting point for the people that like to think about these sort of things.  Several negatives were brought up and none of them were facts.  They were perceptions in the minds of the commenters.  Based on negative perceptions you said it could be harmful to people with OCD.   You dont know that, but since you perceive it it becomes true to you.  You say that our thoughts cannot change reality?  Tell that to the person with OCD!  Their hyper awareness of things around them literally torment their minds.   I cannot think of a better example to illustrate the power of of our thoughts than the ones you two just made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they don&#39;t. Sound and light travel through different medium (air or matter and the electromagnetic field). They have nothing to do with eachother other than that they are both waves. </p>

<p>The article you linked says that they sent sound through a piezoelectric crystal and that it produced the light. It didn&#39;t say how, but I would guess that the energy of the sound wave matches some energy transition in the crystal that gets excited. When the crystal de-excites light is emitted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK yeah, right you are, I used the wrong term. I was being lazy and opted for a simplistic explanation at the expense of being scientifically accurate. But the point I&#39;m trying to make its that each are produced by excitations in their respective fields, and each of the fields are simply a means of representation of certain particular aspects/properties of the very medium that they occupy: spacetime.<br/>
It all stems from the same source. Sorta like different paints on a canvas. The colours may be different, but they&#39;re all based on the same medium... Except on this canvas the paints are constantly flowing and interacting with each other of their own volition... But metaphors are never perfect.<br/>
Another way I may attempt to make the point is by likening it to different topics of study. How can I find what links seemingly completely different areas of study like sociology, chemistry, and maths? I&#39;d say by tracing it back to the source. Sociology is an application of psychology, which in turn is an application (albeit a complex application) of biology. Biology is an application of chemistry, chemistry is an application of physics, and then physics is just applied maths.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see what you mean, and there is some merit to what you say, but the fact remains that light is a fundamental particle, it cannot be split into anything. A photon is just a photon. Soundwaves are compression waves through matter. The waves will have different velocities depending on the material. Sure, air is rechnically just a very complicated excitation in quantum fields, but it is not a useful description. </p>

<p>I am reminded of a book I read recently, G.E.B. by Douglas Hofstadter. It is a behemoth of a book but I wholeheartedly recommend it. It has a chapter on levels of description or abstraction of something. Sometimes it is good to &#39;forget&#39; the complicated underlying details and &#39;zoom out&#39; to see the whole picture. </p>

<p>This sound-light thing is in my opinion an examply of this, light is a direct property of the quantum fields while the existance of sound waves is not immediately obvious when you look at the Standard Model. Sound appears on a higher level, and in principle you could imagine having one but not the other. If we set the higgs vacuum expectation value to 0 (instead of the observed 249 GeV) we would still have light, but most likely not sound. On the other hand, without an electromagnetic field there would be no light but I can still imagine there being some kind of atom through which waves can travel. </p>

<p>Do you have any recommendations on source materials such as books, talks, videos, etc? I&#39;ve always really liked David Icke&#39;s talks on Saturn, the moon and the matrix of control. He was talking about this stuff decades ago, quite amazing really. </p>

<p>And recommendations beyond David Icke? I’d say search up some videos by Jordan Maxwell and occultscience101. But also, there’s a WordPress website that really really opened up my eyes to all of this called the illuminatimatrix. It’s amazing. Super dense and days worth of reading on it. I posted a link to it on the commons a while back but not many people were interested in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is sound and frequency. You are not born into sin, but the sinus wave... </p>

<p>By limiting our language they are effectively limiting your thoughts. English is one of the most simple ones out there, creating a simple minded herd of people unable to thing outside of the allowed spectrum.</p>

<p>If you just compare the alphabet to the Egyptian one, the difference is quite remarkable. 26 letters only to comprise complex thought and concepts? I do not think thats nearly enough. The Egyptians had around a 1000 distinct characters. </p>

<p>These are the people that handed everything down to us. The Phoenicians, the builders if you will spread all over the world when the exodus of Egypt happened. They did not vanish into the sea, but rather into the sea of people. </p>

<p>Ultimately, they were pirates in the Mediterranean sea, practicing voodoo and black magic going as far back as Atlantis. If you look closely into history, there were no castles in Europe or anywhere before the year 1000... </p>

<p>Their symbol has always been the lion. There were no lions in Europe, yet you find them on almost every castle and coat of arms. These satanic imbreds gave us langauge, the monetary system including taxes/bonds, our medicine etc etc..</p>

<p>They had the money and the knowledge. Upon establishing a European base, they went on and plundered the whole world, killing innocent people almost everywhere they went. Upon the return of the templars (same family), they created Switzerland or the land of the sisters of isis. </p>

<p>If you think for a second that this is just another conspiracy theory, I dare you to get your facts straight. The pharaonic bloodline spread very fast through europe and the rest of the world by means of Droit du seigneur, or pimus noctis which means that the Lord had the right of spending the first with every single bride on her wedding night. This was in place to spread their genetic pool all across Switzerland and the surrounding areas mostly to create a buffer zone if you will and spread influence. </p>

<p>Now, these &quot;people&quot; lived under the rule of Primogeniture, meaning the the first born son had the right to rule and own everything. The bastards that came after him were expelled from their castles and had to go to monasteries. This was usually depicted as two gay people riding one horse. They used religion as a front to hide their true intentions. </p>

<p>Fast forward to today and the NWO. The new world order is already in place because in the old world order, the King/Tzar used to rule alone until his 2nd, 3rd, 4th... bastard brothers formed a secret alliance to kill and overthrow the first born so they could rule as well. This gave birth to the secret societies. The phrase liberté, égalité, fraternité stands thus for the right of the bastards/brothers to be free to rule equally which gave birth to the system we call democracy today. Everyone of them can rule, instead of just the first born. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jerusalem was just the road to Egypt, they needed safe passage which was granted to them by Salah-ad-Din. Yet, not all of them made it back. Most of the German&amp;French foot-soldiers were deliberately sold out and died in the process. </p>

<p>You wont believe what has was going on at home in Switzerland afterwards. Two inquisitors (Heinrich Krammer - Mühlhausen which was still Swiss territory back then, and Jakob Sprenger from Basel) used the shortage of men at home and wrote the book Der Hexenkammer / Malleus Maleficum. The burning of decent women that were against the templars was perfectly planned and executed by the swiss which later became the Swiss guard of the vatican.</p>

<p>These are all funny little coincidences I´m sure. </p>

<p>The alphabet reduces the symbols needed to convey human language in writing by having the symbols represent very small units of sound the (spoken) human language consists of (vocals and consonants). This is in contrast to other systems that use symbols to represent for example syllables or words. The latter systems need far more symbols because spoken human languages consist of relatively small amount of semantically important basic sounds , but they can contain in principle infinite amount of words for example. Alphabet can convey anything a spoken language can.</p>

<p>Also the complexity of a language is not easily solved.</p>

<p>The week-end is when you recover from the week daze, because you have been weakened, from your Job which apparently in Hebrew means &quot;persecuted&quot; and I just looked that up and it appears job also means &quot;one who weeps&quot;.</p>

<p>The gospel couldn&#39;t be about god&#39;s spell could it?</p>

<p>Entertainment. Enter - to go into. Tain - to hold. Ment - mind. To go into and hold the mind. Yeah.</p>

<p>Damn I should really learn Latin. Also it&#39;s funny that autocorrect really doesn&#39;t want us to write anything in Latin, even though much of the English language uses it. </p>

<p>Sorry that I cursed.... at least I didn&#39;t specifically &quot;curse&quot; you... Yeah that one&#39;s just as in-our-face as spell is.</p>

<p>We can DIScuss or CONverse about soldiers, or soul diers. Or say HELLo to HELios, the Greek sun god, because you are a perSON. Btw the suffix -o on the end of hello means &quot;to be associated with&quot;.</p>

<p>Did you sneeze? B less you. </p>

<p>&quot;To know&quot; is good right? Well what about to no? If I say, &quot;I no this to be true&quot;, do I not? Huh?</p>

<p>Why do we say good mourning when the sun comes up? There are lots of peculiar homophones, like maybe worshipping an idle Idol at an altered altar for prophet. I mean profit. After we&#39;ve thrown down the throne of course. I <em>knew</em> that... or is it <em>new</em> to me? Do I know? No. If there&#39;s a hole in the whole it&#39;s not whole, is it? And what if the nuns were none? And the peace was in pieces? Idk but let&#39;s see if we can seize the seas. I&#39;ll write a cheque after I check if the sails are for sale. We may have to steal the steel though.</p>

<p>All I know is that there is a crapload of skullduggery afoot and I&#39;m too tired to write more. Going to go curl up in bed with my god. My dog that is :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah definitely. To make a long story short - the matrix is controlled by our words and thoughts. This is the one thing The Powers That Be cannot control. Our free will to think and speak. They can only influence us to think and say the things they want. But ultimately it is us, as co creators and sons of God, who choose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice job Nick, but I think you may have missed a few. You noticed the sentence, but forgot the period. You talk about our frequency, but you left out the period. You noticed Saturn, but you didn&#39;t realize it&#39;s the source of the moon, which is the source of the period. Our frequency is too high, Nick. It should be once per year - not once per month. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;This theme is present in many religions and philosophies. In the Bible we are told that God created the world through His Word. In Egyptian mythology we are told Ptah created the world through His Word. Plato said God created the world through the Logos - or the Word/Mind. In Hinduism we are told the universe was and is still being created by the Om sound. Quantum physics tells us this universe is made of vibrating energy. When we speak we send out vibrations into the sea of potentiality.<br/>
Sound creates shapes in matter. We know this from Cymatics. In fact, the Hebrew vowels, when spoken out loud and amplified through a speaker, create the same shape in a medium as the written letter. There are some theorists who believe the Hebrew language could manipulate reality. This is actually the basis of Jewish mysticism/Kabbalah. The old Jewish mystics believed Hebrew had a divine origin and that God created the world through 22 letters of said language. They thought language had the utmost creative potential and God only had to declare His Will to manifest it into existence. Interestingly enough, the first thing God created was light when He said “let there be light” - and now science has proven sound can actually turn into light!&quot;   </p>

<p>Love this post! Especially this part! It reminds me of a video I saw regarding the Hebrew alphabet, and how each of the letters are literally two-dimensional representations of a spiralling path over a toroid, as seen from different angles. I think this will definitely be up your street too! <a href="https://youtu.be/midn6ABiZMA">Based on the work of Stan Tenen and the Meru Foundation into the origins of the geometrical/mathematical structure of the Hebrew letters as they are presented in Genesis.</a><br/>

<p>Hey OP, is there a video of this, or can you link to your source for this one?</p>

<p>Super interesting if true.</p>

<p>AS far as how language constructs our reality, I think maybe you&#39;d be interested in the ideas of Ferdinand de Saussure. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure</a></p>

<p>Semiology is the study of symbols, signs, and signifiers, which is how language operates on a symbolic level. Every word (or vibration, or &#39;sign&#39;) has a distinct mental symbol associated with it, but the symbols for each of us will be different for the word because the signifiers attached to it are different for all of us and are built off of our personal life experiences. Hence is the one of the fundamental limitations of language: we&#39;re really not all grasping the same meaning from any given sentence; it&#39;s all sort of skewed by our personal conceptual framework for language. It divides our meaning in a way.</p>

<p>Anyway, great post. Keep em coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deconstructionism owes a lot to semiology, but I&#39;m not really into it. Derrida too obtuse for ya boy. But there were other theories that ran with semiology and worked it in a different way. I&#39;m really into Jacques Lacan (a post-structuralist), he focuses on the &#39;symbolic matrix&#39; where meaning is contained that arises from the interaction of language, the &#39;real&#39; of our bodies. Basically everyone has a massive, complex lattice of symbols and signifiers that create meaning for them and structure how they see and interact with the world. Language functions in the same way our unconscious does (which makes sense), and our unconscious isn&#39;t &#39;known&#39; to us, but it drives us 90% of the time. So if we analyze people&#39;s language, and we understand how language works on a psychological level, we can tell a surprising amount about what&#39;s going on &#39;under the hood&#39; (so to speak) in any particular person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason I got like three notifications for comments that won’t show up and the notifications for them disappeared as well. If anyone could tell me why that might be that would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>But anyways - I happened to see what one of the comments said before it disappeared. It was someone asking me what I thought of Moloch. Despite the comment being gone, I’d still like to answer this question because it is an interesting subject and directly it’s related.</p>

<p>Amos 5:26: ‘But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.’</p>

<p>Moloch is just another name for Satan. It literally means lord or king - like the name Baal does. Satan goes by many names. And Chiun is the Hebrew word for the statue of the Assyrian-Babylonian god of the planet Saturn. Basically in this verse we are seeing two names for different false idols that both represent the same god, Satan/Saturn.</p>

<p>But this verse also mentions “the star of your god” - the star of Moloch. The star of Moloch would basically be a star symbol representing Satan/Saturn then right? Well, I think the Star of David is this said satanic graven image. It even has a hexagon in the middle of it! Israel is the home of those “who say they are Jews but they are not, they are liars and of the Synagogue of Satan.” Rev 2:9</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a final part that didn’t get too much attention and I wasn’t too proud of it so I deleted it. But basically all it said was there isn’t much farther down this rabbit hole I can go. At least not right now. I don’t know what else to research. The only thing new I did kindof discover was the fact that Saturn was always known as the god of time/judgment/tribulations/responsibilities etc. and the moon has always been symbolic of emotions. So I kindof just guessed that maybe since a cube unfolded is a cross, the only way to overcome the Saturn moon matrix (or our responsibilities and emotions) and break out of the box.. is to follow the way of Christ. We have to learn to take on our trials and tribulations and how to keep our emotions under control. We have to pick up our cross and carry it. It’s still the story of Satan vs humanity.. this just kinda shows how real it is. And if there’s any useful thing to take away from this info, it’s like I said before, if we really live in a simulated matrix then our words really do have power and maybe faith REALLY can move mountains or allow us to walk on water.</p>
