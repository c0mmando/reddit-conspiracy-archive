<p>This has got to be one of the most narrow-minded position to hold.  Aliens are most certainly not &#39;fake&#39;.  Whether they are visiting us may be up for debate, but their existence is pretty much guaranteed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to believe aliens exist, but I wouldn&#39;t go as far as to say their existence is pretty much guaranteed. That equation is very theoretical and doesn&#39;t really do much to guarantee anything. </p>

<p>I feel like we are special because as far as we know, there ain&#39;t shit else out there (that&#39;s a terrifying thought). And if you really wanna lose your mind A little bit, I feel like it could still be up for debate that WE even exist. All of perception could be a collective dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s almost definitely alien life out there in the universe. Somewhere. And probably NOTHING at all like life here too. </p>

<p>I will agree that stories of extra terrestrial intelligence visiting earth in interstellar craft are probably fake though. I would say that all instances of UFO sightings that involve actual aircraft can be explained in mundane ways, like secret government tech. Claims of alien sightings are useful to discredit these sightings that might expose government secrets, and association with ideas about aliens are also used to discredit &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; in general. For example, I&#39;ve seen trolls claim that aliens destroyed the Twin Towers in NYC using directed energy weapons. They do things like that to undermine more mundane explanations, like accusations that the US government was involved and that all three towers going down were actually controlled demolitions. Consider also the wild ideas of shape-shifting reptilians from another dimension, these accusations of intelligent aliens undermine credibility in other &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; by mere association. If I say &quot;I&#39;m a conspiracy theorist&quot;, someone might assume I believe the ruling class is actually reptile aliens. And bad actors push extreme conspiracy theories like that on purpose to make us look crazy for thinking that the psychopaths running corporations and government do harmful things behind closed doors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens are actually fallen angels, or demons.</p>

<p>I remember seeing this testimony of a guy who was abducted by &quot;aliens&quot; and then got in contact with these &quot;aliens&quot; or &quot;good energy&quot; then he got onto the new age cult and had these &quot;trips&quot; where he would see and talk to then, because he asked about Jesus they got angry and told him to stop. The entity said their leader is &quot;natas&quot; which is satan backwards. hidden in plain sight Eventually he found out the truth and went to a pastor.</p>

<p>The video is like 3 hours long but it&#39;s really interesting it would make an awesome movie.</p>

<p>tl;dr the leaks were nothing, he&#39;s in the clouds and surrounded by yes-men. </p>

<p>If you want to entertain a conspiracy, maybe he had real evidence and tptb force him to release junk instead, but I think he&#39;s just lost it a bit sadly, he doesn&#39;t even have a financial agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly what he is doing. Hear a long interview with him last year on Coast to Coast, and basically he says how he wants to be open, unlike everyone else who deals with UFO&#39;s, but whenever they question details, he says that line, &quot;that he knows things but is not allowed to say anything, or that we wouldn&#39;t be able to handle the information.&quot; He had a minute of credibility, but he lost it by acting like we couldn&#39;t handle the crazy facts he knows. Fuck him, he&#39;ll be begging to back in Blink 182 soon enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grant Cameron has a Youtube channel where he analyzed the tapes alongside one veteran pilot. He&#39;s been hunting UFOs over 30 years and has seen the same event replay over and over: take a schmuck with an interest in UFOs, promise full release and official documents/videos, hype it up and release half-baked stuff to discredit the individual.</p>

<p>There were some official incident tapes released during Tom DeLonge&#39;s presentation but the lingo used in the audio portion didn&#39;t match what combat-trained pilots should be saying, &quot;Dude, did you see that?&quot; etc. Also, the markings on the video were off.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all doctored and meant to mess with our heads, just like the Moon landing material where the landing module and its 100k pounds of thrust produced no visible crater or a dent in the Moon surface or how their chest-mounted cameras outperformed even the manufacturer&#39;s expectations.</p>

<p><em>None of it makes sense because it&#39;s not meant to make sense</em>, it&#39;s all an elaborate counter-intelligence plan mixed in with just so much truth that it can&#39;t be dismissed as an outright lie. When a Russian or Chinese analysts look at this footage they&#39;re not supposed to know the real extent of US capabilities but that implies US citizens get the same treatment and will never be told the truth, only fairy tales. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should hear the stuff we said on the radio when I was in iraq. Its a solly thing to say &quot;oh theyre trained not to talk that way&quot; when everyone in tge military is trained the same way and yet we all talked similarly on our internal comms. Sure when we were calling on spot reports to the toc we used the proper way but talking amongst my squad or platoon? It was super informal.</p>

<p>I would think a pilot would understand that. </p>

<p>The visual comparisons of <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/2004-uss-nimitz-tic-tac-ufo-flir-footage-flir1.t9190/">the Tic Tac with infrared cam footage of fighter exhaust profiles</a> [from biased metabunk.org, but sometimes they get things right, as in this case] was enough for me. Delonge&#39;s association with &#39;that one&#39; political fixer,  transparent ulterior aspirations for $ and attention, and plain skeeziness, in general, narrows this down to pure bs, at best. Frankly, I think it&#39;s a red herring psyop to derail any actual disclosure &amp; the most likely scenario.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, the story of the encounter has been around for awhile. Slow wind-up, maybe. IIRC, there have been similar vids released - from the ATS link you provided, circa 2007: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread265835/pg9#pid2943664">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread265835/pg9#pid2943664</a></p>

<p>but unfortunately the vid&#39;s been removed, and it&#39;s virtually impossible to find links older than the TTSA releases because of the saturation. Maybe that&#39;s one of the objectives?</p>
