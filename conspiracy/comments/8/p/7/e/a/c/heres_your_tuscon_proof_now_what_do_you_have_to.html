       It's not that it's fake.. it's that it's not evidence for what you think it is. That's a makeshift shank knife. Definitely something you would find at a homeless camp. Why are you guys trying so hard and reaching so much? It's almost like you want this to be the place you think it is. Why do you want such an evil place to exist?

       It's the fact he told everyone that it was hidden so everyone wanted to see it. Now you guys see it and still doubt it. It means you guys will never wake up to the fact of this being legitimate and rather doubt it till it makes headlines everywhere. There's a reason it's not, but you guys rather not investigate and believe what the media tells you.

       I never doubted that a knife existed. If you guys want to go on this crusade nobody is stopping you but stop pretending this is evidence for what you think it is. Look up the definition of confirmation bias. There are thousands of other homeless camps that you can start investigating too. Better get crackin. Doesn't matter where you live.. I can slay guarentee that a homeless camp like this exists if you want to go check it out. Don't expect to be welcomed though, even if you look the part.

       I don't watch the news and only vaguely know what's going on. Is this even on the MSM? I'm just being completely honest.. that kind of shank is exactly the kind of item you would find in a homeless camp.  Why are you jumping through hoops to make whatever narrative it is that you're pushing work? When you are looking for something very specific that you want to exist you.. will find and connect any things at all cost to each your predetermined conclusion. It's the definition of confirmation bias. That's why I'm asking you this question.. why do you want this to exist so badly? The evidence you're presenting actually hurts your case I just want you to know that. It's definitely a shank.

       Which threads? I haven't been posting in any of the threads except for a thread yesterday where someone was complaining about this sub being in a war about evidence. I didn't even know that thread was about this bullshit until they started fighting about it and he kept complaining about down votes.  Feel free to check my post history.

       It's like ghost chasers who see faces in windows or hear voices in EVPs, when you're expecting to see/hear something you most certainly will. It's the placebo effect and how some magic works - just by planting the seed that you've "cursed" someone can make that person believe just enough to subtly mindfuck over time. It's weird how Native American art motifs on a casino can be turned into "that creepy casino with a pedo logo!" and 60 pairs of shoes turns into 100 then 600 (as seen in other threads).

       I am FAR more inclined to think that the flamboyant transsexual who claims this site is telling the truth over these opportunistic vets who may have set out with a noble cause but descended into self-aggrandizing pseudo-heroism to stay relevant. I mean this sub SHOULD be extremely skeptical when it comes to those so indoctrinated (see the multiple instances of propagandized "heroism" vis a vis the vaunted SEALs and bin Laden and the whole American Sniper debacle, not to mention 4star Gen. Petraeus and his antics the list goes on.) Since WHEN are vets immune to scepticism? How did they as a group come to be unassailable IN THIS INSTANCE? There's a well being poisoned here, and some are j just so desperate they're drinking it up.

       What makes you say that so matter-of-factly? Do you have expertise in such matters? Because I would assume a shank would definitely be found in a prison. Homeless camp? Not so much.

       Shakes aren't just found in prisons. But I guess movies would tell you otherwise huh? I'm not an expert but I have seen many homeless camps and even helped some homeless people. Over here in California it's hard to miss them because they are everywhere. You cannot imagine the environment they live in and what they have go through every day in their fight for surviva. Why do you think homeless people almost always so timid and scared. One women and her boyfriend I helped ended up in the hospital because they decided to group up with a few other homeless people for safety reasons and ended up getting beaten up and robbed while they were sleeping by those very same people they grouped up with.  The woman also had diabetes and ended up dead a few years later. Real knives have a lot of value and either get targeted by thief's or pawned so shanks that can be easily crafted and sharpened become a very real issue. Care to ask me more about this topic? I would be more than happy to answer your questions. If I can't I can always ask my wife who has her degree in criminal justice and part of her coursework involved this kind of shit.

       Agreed. Hey we agree on something! Anyone protecting pedo's should be buried under the prison if they're not in it. Fucking Monsters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know you were trying to subtly suggest there that I'm protecting pedo's. That's a real shitty thing to accuse someone of my man. Probably the worst thing you can accuse someone of. I just don't believe this Tuscon/Cemex/Hilary/Soros horseshit. Doesnt make me some kind of an apologist and I'm pissed at the suggestion. Fuck you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't throw accusations like that around lightly asshole. It makes a mockery of real victims and real crimes.

       It's hard to believe anything is going besides some mass Blue Whale Competition that now has camping out in the Sonoran Desert for over a week in the hottest time of the year and your telling me to trust a Convicted Felon who is safeguarding the evidence (bloody knife and 60 pairs of childerns shoes) until he decides who he can trust.

       A Felon is sitting on evidence of a massive child smuggling ring and I'm not supposed to trust the police?

       he may not be, he just has a rap sheet and was one of Bundy's group that took over that campground in Oregon a couple of years ago.  The rap sheet charge may only be about him being naked up the flagpole.

       Because they don't know who to trust. We live in a corrupt world where this will never be true to the public. If the FBI tests for DNA they will lie about the results to protect the corrupted. No matter what this will always be labeled fake unless they find someone they trust to run DNA tests

       I don't have a link but they are trying to argue that this shank is evidence of a child prison used for pedophilia. Supposedly in regards to an elite peso thing but for some reason the ultra whisky chose a dirty homeless camp to base their operations.

       Im familiar with the Pizzagate/Podesto theory.

       I dont doubt this could be real, but this sort of thing is very hard to prove, and not something you really want to prove.

       Shakes aren't just found in prisons. But I guess movies would tell you otherwise huh? I'm not an expert but I have seen many homeless camps and even helped some homeless people. Over here in California it's hard to miss them because they are everywhere. You cannot imagine the environment they live in and what they have go through every day in their fight for surviva. Why do you think homeless people almost always so timid and scared. One women and her boyfriend I helped ended up in the hospital because they decided to group up with a few other homeless people for safety reasons and ended up getting beaten up and robbed while they were sleeping by those very same people they grouped up with.  The woman also had diabetes and ended up dead a few years later. Real knives have a lot of value and either get targeted by thief's or pawned so shanks that can be easily crafted and sharpened become a very real issue. Care to ask me more about this topic? I would be more than happy to answer your questions. If I can't I can always ask my wife who has her degree in criminal justice and part of her coursework involved this kind of shit.
