       One thing that has always bothered me is what would have happened in the case that Hillary had won the elections. As you may know, Syria has It's own currency and with Iran they are both seeking to develop their own economies without the influence of the US. That's the reason for the US getting involved in the armament of ISIS to take down Assad, however the US can't go all out against Syria or Iran without Russia fighting back which would lead to a conflict between the US and Russia and at least Turkey, Iran, Israel and Syria also getting involved in a fight. This didn't happened because of Trump and Russia making a ceasefire, but in the case Hillary had won, then not only would have Israel got involved in the fighting, but the Jews and the Arabs would have probably ended up killing each other. Althought I have my reasons to be skeptical about it,
       <a href="http://www.threeworldwars.com/albert-pike2.htm">
        this scenario is very similar to Albert Pike's letter about the outcome of WWIII
       </a>
       Since the Jews would not only probably end up losing Israel but get a bunch of their own killed, then how could greater Israel ever be the final plan of the NWO?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is that greater Israel is obviously not it. Considering that the Rothschilds have a lot more knowledge of what truly happens behind the scenes than we do, then I'm pretty sure they are also aware of this... So why are they fine with a bunch of their own dying?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've thought about many possibilities, but I'm pretty sure the Jesuits are involved in this whole mess and not only that but I'm sure that the NWO is in fact, their plan to create a world communist regime for the black pope. What I know so far that leads me to this conclusion is that the Jesuits were
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8akyyz/the_jesuits_were_responsible_for_the_creation_of/">
        responsible for the creation of the anti-semitic myths that started with their anti-semitic writings in La Civilita Cattolica.
       </a>
       even their name is symbolic, the original name of the Rothschilds was bauer but it was changed since the romans used to use Red Shields. The two of them got to the current relationship they have some time after Carl Rothschild was turned into a knight of the pope. Back in the mid 1800's the Roths and the vatican were on good terms but eventually for some reason the jesuits started with their anti-semitic propaganda around 1880. After this one of the most signifant events involving Jews is the Holocaust and WWII and a very important piece of data is that both Hitler and Mussolini got their views about the Jews from the Jesuits, in fact, Mein Kampf wasn't even written by Hitler himself but by a Jesuit. Now about what truly happened in WWII, it remains a mystery even for me. I was confident I knew but I just can't ignore the huge similarities between a lot of the symbolism the National Socialists used and the Jesuit's own. But I'll find out sooner or later either way, it also explains why there were records
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6esmzp/jewish_6_million_holocaust_number_symbolism_from/">
        of the word holocaust and the 6 million number being used before WWII in different places from Germany too.
       </a>
       Most likely, the Jesuits were pressuring the Roths into killing them all if they didn't do what they were told. I also know that some regular Jews were being kept in terrible living conditions by the Jesuits for some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now going back to the present and the Roths position about the possibility of another holocaust being very likely to happen, these are my two theories about the why and how they feel:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The Rothschilds care about the other Jews in their own, insane, twisted way and actually see the idea of another Holocaust as a neccesary evil for the future of the Jews. (Think about their writtings on the Talmud about 6 million Jews having to be sacrificed)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Rothschilds don't care about the common Jews but still feel they are the ones who should control them for the sake of tradition.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The Rothchilds are just allowing another Holocaust to happen because the Jesuits happen to have them under a lot of pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The Rothschilds don't care about the common Jews at all and they are allowing a purge of their own to happen just so they can get the Jesuits off their backs, in fact, the creation of a secular Jewish state isn't part of the NWO at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this explanations are very interesting to say the least, there may even be others, but if we assume the first ones are correct and the creation of a secular Jewish state is still part of the NWO then a good example of where the Roths could make a new home for the Jew survivors would be in
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andinia_Plan">
        the Argentinan Patagonia,
       </a>
       for those of you who don't know about the Andinia plan. They would just blame everything on Assad and take advantage of the pity they would get from the incident after losing Israel in order to make their new country. In the case that the creation of a Jewish state is not part of the NWO, then the reason why they chose to move the Jews over there is because of the historical value that place has to a lot of the people over there. Since the destruction of history is part of the NWO, they could destroy both those aspects of Israel and Syria at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other reasons why I think that the Jesuits are more powerful is that the "Rothschild controlled banks" meme is in fact fake.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8c8x5d/the_federal_reserve_bank_the_bank_of_england_and/">
        The biggest and most influencial banks of the world are controlled by the Jesuits.
       </a>
       The Jesuits also control the CIA, which has a bunch of influence in the media and a lot of the richest people in the world are Jesuits too:

       So surely, whatever happens in the coming war will be very important. I'm sure what the Jesuits want is for the Arabs and the Jews to kill each other in a "Double Holocaust" of sorts, but It's kind of hard to tell how things will turn out since the Syrians and the Russians have been beating the US backed mercenaries for a long time. I hope Assad makes it just fine. Despite having been a follower of Putin for quite a while, even I have been forced to become skeptical of him. It's not so much because I think he has made mistakes or anything like that It's just that these are insanely powerful people, so I gotta at least accept the fact that he could be involved in the mess or may as well be neutral to everything that's happening and is only in power for the sake of his own fame. Either way, I'm interested about Russia because if Putin is the real deal then if the US is defeated then it could create an opening for other nations to go rogue too. If I want
to free Venezuela from the hands of the international bankers then I would need a military in order to rival that of the US and Russia could support me to some extend in a similar way to what Assad did. But if Putin or whoever follows his legacy turned out to be fakers in the end, then whatever, I'll just think of something else. Since central banking isn't as centralized as the memes like to tell us, then probably what truly determines if a country will be intervened by the US or not is just how rogue a politician proves himself to be, if you try to get a new currency going that the dark occultists don't like, they will surely try to JFK you, if you try to oppose the international companies and such then the same thing happens, the CIA keeps an eye on everyone this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure I'll find a way for my country whatever happens and since things will be revealed sooner or later once the fighting starts, I won't get too obsessed trying to think too hard about what happens behind the scenes and I will just continue following Putin for now as I think about what to do. Let me hear what you guys think about my speculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since greater Israel isn't the thing, I liked this theory about the EU turning into something like a modern Roman state, I think it fits perfectly considering recent events and if we assume Putin is part of the NWO, thanks to

       Most communist countries have been atheist. This included persecution of other religions like the USSR sending Jews and Christians to education camps and not allowing Jews to relocate unless they switch religions.

       Where do you get that from. It started with the Bolsheviks, which regarded all religiom as counter science, however at first Jews coexisted peacefully. It wasn't until Stalin was manuevering against Trotsky and later when the Jewish Oblast was formed in an attempt to gather Jews there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't fully succesful, and at first The Great Purge targeted those accused of conspiring against Stalin and Jews were not specifically targeted, many were Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon meeting with Nazi Germany, Stalin promised to get rid of Jews in the inteligencia. He acted by purging Jews from the ministry. While they lost representation, soon afterwards after WWII Stalin saw an opertunity in forming a Jewish State in Israel that he hoped would be communist to stem the influence of Britain in the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, he also began purging Jews from his war time allies the Jewish anti-facist Committee after Israel did not become communist. In 1948 a campaign was begun to purge Jewish culture. Jewish institutions were closed down, prominant Jewish citizens were executed, and all Jewish members were dismissed from inteligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       While not anything like the Nazi party did, I would hardly call that "the joys of having their very own autonomous state". I assume you refer to the Oblast where purges were done at night.

       Well the issues with jewish persecution are always incredibly complex and there's always, in my view, the possiblity of blatant lies as well as the possibility of orthodox chabadnik neo-pharisee type jewish persecution against jewish moderates. I'm not sure what to think now, but you've given me some interesting clues on what to explore. I had no idea there was an effort to make Israel embrace communism, that's quite fascinating.

       I think the USSR was one of the first nations to recognize Israel. Keep in mind thats a quick synopsis of what I've read and it covers decades and WWII. Theres a lot more intricacy out there that muddies the water. There's conflicting views whether Stalin hated Jews, used them politically, or else.

       That’s not entirely true. Popular history has claimed that most communist countries have been atheist. What you’re forgetting is that the victors always write history. Communism and Socialism are constructs of ancient religion that dates back centuries.

       This is so off target imo. If that goal was anything close to what is wanted why all the endless wars and separatism about practically everything. From the time were born we are taught statism and separatism with whatever  we learn, people outside the country don't matter, homeless people don't matter, your health doesn't matter unless you can afford it. 
The more the wealth is divided amongst the wealthy and poor the more unlikely your suggestion is. The more corruption the more unlikely it is. The more people care more about themselves than others the more unlikely it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the goal to just force world domination and then all of a sudden become the good guys and spread wealth to everyone? Unlikely.  Not that communism or socialism will fix anything remotely connected to the way people are goverened.
       <br/>
       Sorry I don't mean to come off rude I just don't see how this is close to an end goal.

       Even if we assume the Jesuits and the black pope are interested in those holy lands, it still wouldn't be a "Jewish" conspiracy like we are always told it is. The new "holocaust" is coming, you can't ignore that.

       Agreed, but I've yet to hear a good reason why Rome would be so concerned with Greater Israel. I have heard stuff like Israel will give Jerusalem to Rome to make it an international city state, but I don't know.

       When it comes to his sub, I think he did it with the intention of specifically documenting the influence the jesuits have in the NWO, but that by itself doesn't mean they aren't involved.

       What I've seen is that the RomeRules theory basically does say no Jews were involved. They say the Rothschilds are stooges for Rome and give them no credit for founding Israel and all of the WWII manipulation. Zionism's effect on US politics and media has no place in their theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem I see with it is they are not presenting a unified conspiracy theory. It's a binary choice theory where the Rothschild/Zionist conspiracy is wrong and all power comes from Rome and their theory is right. They do not attempt to show how Rothschild ties into anything, and instead say no Rothschild doesn't have power, but Rome does. And where do they make this argument? On posts about Zionism that reach the front page. They're not cross posting interesting Rome Rules posts or making their arguments here, just trying to shoot down the Zionist focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it is very likely that the black nobility and the zionists work together and they are all part of the cabal, but this is not the RomeRules message. I feel like it's a huge wedge in this community that keeps us from getting anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try searching Zionism or Rothschild on their sub, you get hardly anything. When people ask for these dots to be connected, they get "this has already been covered here in this post" and that post will barely address the concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the answers but I feel like RomeRules has a weird counter productive agenda. I'm left with no dots connected because I have to pick Jesuits or Zionists, when it seems pretty clear that it's both.

       It could be. But pay attention to them trying to bridge the gap, you've already done more to bridge the gap than they do. We need to know how the Rothschilds and black nobility are related.

       Greater Rome and the OJC (Organized Jewish Community) are in league together, and have been for hundreds of years. The fact that Greater Rome holds massive power doesn't invalidate the Jewish element at all. The Organized Jewish Community made its riches by being the bankers for Greater Rome, and have become so rich in that time that they have become top two world power in their own right.

       <a href="http://www.tldm.org/news3/impostor.htm">
        Paul VI switcheroo
       </a>
       and Vatican II).
      </p>
      <p>
       Traditionalist catholic movements (such as St Pie X) reject Vatican 2 and are still to this day extremely judeoskeptical.

       Excellent question. I see about 40 things wrong with this post. And nothing wrong with that, guy's allowed his theories. But this is bad. No reason for the sticky.

       Seems to me the Israeli goal to mostly get

       to do their fighting for them has worked pretty well. Not sure a ton of ground troops would be required, nor the death of a slew of Israelis.

       This Jesuit and “it would have been even worse with Hillary” argument is (imho) a last-stand attempt to defend the (preposterous) idea that “Trump is an outsider” and “Trump was never meant to become President”. It is a sign of cognitive dissonance. It is necessary to absolve Zionists/Jews as Trump is surrounded by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I’ve been explaining the “Trump reverse psychology/psyop” since early in the campaign. It has been clear for a long time he was going to be “elected” and that Hillary was playing the role of the despicable scarecrow everyone (correctly) hates.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is quite literally in plain sight; no need for highly exotic theories. It is difficult to accept though, as it goes against several generations of propaganda.

       I assume you're referring to saidit.net. That's my website. Not his. I'm staunchly anti-Zionist. He is simply a user who posts there. I've done podcast interviews exposing the zionists and the Rothschilds. See here:

       He simply has some good points to make from time to time. He thinks the Jesuits run the Zionists. I think it's the other way around, that the Zionists control the Jesuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, it's a debate worth having. There are many very high-ranking Jesuits for how small an organization it is. The pope is Jesuit. Many US politicians went to Georgetown, which is a Jesuit college.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious the Jesuits have some serious influence. But from my perspective it's clear the Zionists have more. However that doesn't mean that this "Jesuits vs Zionists" discussion isn't worth having, if anything quite the contrary.

       This is one of the most heavily censored subs on Reddit. I think it's amazing that if you present a conspiracy theory to the conspiracy sub about astroturfers infiltrating, you WILL be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a certain guy who was named top 50 most influential people in DC who happens to have a boyfriend who hangs with Rothschilds and loves young Italian pie and table tennis and also runs progressive propaganda media outlets funded by Nazi collaborating, ball sack eyes Soros who actually bought out a very active sub about politics right here on Reddit for $2.8 million to astroturf and disseminate fake news to the stupidest people of our society. But I guess that's none of my business. I'll just sit back and shut my mouth or there will be consequences!

       My theory it is a test of the userbase.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is obviously shit and they are trying to see if anybody who votes here or who comments here cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       (A few conspiracy theorists think this is at base of much of what the government does--sort of let's try and see if we can get away with
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       . They do it during lull periods to see how far they can go if and when true crises arrive.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So in this respect this stupid post could be a
       <em>
        real-world
       </em>
       experiment of the question of whether this particular theory might have validity.

       great question.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the answer is self-evident:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         one of more influential
         <a href="/r/conspiracy">
          /r/conspiracy
         </a>
         mods stickied it
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Why?  One of two reason:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         naiveté
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         agenda
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <em>
        (Doubting an influential mode would be the former.)
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTE, i very simply google search for "the greater israel" returns (first result):
      </p>
      <ul>

        </a>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The article quotes several influential zionist leaders:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          "According to the founding father of Zionism Theodore Herzl, “the area of the Jewish State stretches: “From the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates.”

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         According to Rabbi Fischmann,  “The Promised Land extends from the River of Egypt up to the Euphrates, it includes parts of Syria and Lebanon.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         According to Stephen Lendman, “A near-century ago, the World Zionist Organization’s plan for a Jewish state included:

        Other reasons why I think that the Jesuits are more powerful is that the "Rothschild controlled banks" meme is in fact fake. The biggest and most influencial banks of the world are controlled by the Jesuits. The Jesuits also control the CIA, which has a bunch of influence in the media and a lot of the richest people in the world are Jesuits too:

       NWO/"media" has presented China as "the model" for a long time now, and it's easy to see why. Complete Government censorship and controlled people monitored with the new "Social Credit Score" system. This is testing for the future. They already have ALL the info they need, thanks to Google and Facebook... and now Reddit has thrown its hat into the ring as well.

       Step 1: Massive global depopulation with WW3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 2: Communist government with the rich bankers at the top, no more religion, with massive control over the "citizens"(read:slaves) with involuntary social monitoring.

       I think the Huxley model is more effective than the Orwell model.

      <p>
       The cattle produce better when given land to roam and the freedom to choose their slave occupations. The US (Huxley) model is pretty effective in that respect.

       I mean, I agree, but I'm not so sure that's how the people at the top will handle it when presented with the opportunity. I don't doubt the Georgia Guidestones are a legitimate plan that has been in place for a long time, even though we didn't have this technology when they were placed. We're pretty much at the point technology-wise now that it can be a reality. The only thing stopping it from becoming reality is the forced depopulation.

       this is what i think as well. China is an experiment for what the elites want world-wide.

       I live in china and while i would love to see the world follow the chinese system, we think you are the slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In america the government may allow you to say whatever you want but you are still forced to work 2-3 jobs, you are still being crushed under a mountain of debt and your society milks you for every dollar you got. Your costs of living are incredibly off, that is no life. Thats just Surviving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here Speech is limited on some minor things but you know what? We just have to work one job. Normal 8 hrs a day, 5 days a week. We can pay our rent and society doesnt force you into debt if you go to college.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a slave is a person that basically works from hand to mouth, bound by debt and laws, unable to break free from enforced poverty and labour, then that is exactly what happens in america.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happend is that your Corrupt government slowly takes more and more away from you. To see how far they can push. You have the illusion of choice because you can say whatever you want, and make a binary choice every 4 years to choose your owners. You let it happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       In china the government Kills corrupt politicians. In America the Corrupt Politicians make a Killing.

       It isn't really important who exactly stands behind enslaving humanity since we know precisely what tools they are using and all that is needed is removing these tools from them. Since time immemorial they are simply using taxation and inequality before the law to achieve their goals. E.g. we can bitch about the big banks till we are blue in the face and it will amount to nothing as long as only selected few can control money in economy (no matter who they are) - every-fucking-body should be able to issue every money they wish, with no single money and individuals having legal precedence, and you will see organized theft go poof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, Christian Orders and Catholic Church itself do have a history of abusing children - David Stannard in "American Holocaust" writes about Franciscan Missionaries in California who were stealing Native children from their families to sexually abuse them, so in a current context of pedophilia it's possible that Christians do occupy significant role in maintaing status quo. But do not let this distract you - it is also possible that "Jews" are stealing from you, while "Christians" are raping your children - remove tools from these handful of degenerates and do not willingly fall for their trickery to make them harmless.

       Honestly, I think this is exactly what's happening.  The power is shifting from west to east, and the US is being purposefully destroyed from within.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Putin,Trump or any other prominent, public eastern or western leaders/politicians have much to do with this - it is something that is being done from the shadows, while these "leaders" act as puppets.

      </p>
      <p>
       I have had it with this sub. Its totally Ultra Right, borderline terrorist propaganda. Stickying a post like this clearly shows what side the Mods (who are supposed to be impartial) stand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will no longer be part of a Community that glorifies and gives a home to blatant Racists. Its one thing talking about UFOs, Bigfoot, CIA fuckery or Reptilians. But this sub has turned into something uncanny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that continued contribution here is just indulging the Enemy.

       Ban me if you will. Im on my "last warning" anyway.

       its a joke. But Altrighters such as yourself REALLY love to use dirty tricks such as quoting things out of context. Because you have no arguments, you use dirty tricks because thats the only thing you can use.

       Are you really that easilly fooled? Stick a man on tv and suddenly you think he must be a saint? Either you're quick to be manipulated, or you're blinded by your worship of a guy. Probably both, but either way its not a good look.

       "From Axis Rule In Occupied Europe", by Raphael Lemkin, would be a very good book for anyone seeking to understand genocide.The US  and Canada restricted the application of the UN Convention on Genocide to anything but physical genocide, when there are multiple ways/levels in which it is carried out.

       Great post u/HibikiSS reminds me of the old days on this sub. All roads lead to Rome, but Zionists are the illusionists that create our reality through their monopoly of media and influence of currency, so this line of thought and discussion is important to the big picture. I do believe the Zionists retain more control over banking than you expressed though. But at the same time I don't do not believe the greater Israel project is the ultimate goal of the NWO, not even close. The Catholic church has ruled this planet for a long time and should always be considered.

       The Rithschilds are not Jewish and Israel is not a Jewish state.

       The Rothschilds are Canaanites.  They believe they are descended from the bloodline of Nimrod.  Maybe they are.

       Lucifer was the first to attempt a one-world government takeover, and this failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nimrod made the second attempt after the flood, and this also failed.  Nimrod is the one who had the Tower of Babel built.  Nimrod is considered to be the first Freemason.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going on today is the third attempt to implement the on-world government.  They call it the New World Order, but I believe it is really the Nephilim World Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who is currently sitting on the throne of Lucifer and Nimrod?  Where are they located?  I suspect they are in Switzerland.  This person is the Pindar of the Draco, or the Penis of the Dragon.  The Dragon is Satan,  but some authors claim that Satan is really an Annunaki named Enki.

       The first 16 pages of the Curse of Canaan by Eustace Mullins also explains a lot.

       Wow, do you history much ? How can you take Genesis literally ? It was meant to be allegorical, recycling old Mesopotamian and Uggaritic myths (i.e : the Flood, which can be found in the Epic of Gilgamesh), which were reinterpreted by the Israelites along Exodus and Deuteronomy during the exile to Babylon after the destruction of the First Temple, to try maintaining a form of identity and explaining their origins. If you look closely, proto-judaism created itself by reverting myths of their neighbors by 180 degrees and having rites at the opposite of theirs.

       I guess there's nothing supporting the genesis / noah flood being real, but there seems to be enough floods to explain different cultures naturally having their own flood myths, fwiw. I'm sure there's lots of myth borrowing that happened too.

       "It was meant to be allegorical, recycling old Mesopotamian and Uggaritic myths (i.e : the Flood, which can be found in the Epic of Gilgamesh), which were reinterpreted by the Israelites along Exodus and Deuteronomy during the exile to Babylon after the destruction of the First Temple, to try maintaining a form of identity and explaining their origins."

       This is so off target imo. If that goal was anything close to what is wanted why all the endless wars and separatism about practically everything. From the time were born we are taught statism and separatism with whatever  we learn, people outside the country don't matter, homeless people don't matter, your health doesn't matter unless you can afford it. 
The more the wealth is divided amongst the wealthy and poor the more unlikely your suggestion is. The more corruption the more unlikely it is. The more people care more about themselves than others the more unlikely it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the goal to just force world domination and then all of a sudden become the good guys and spread wealth to everyone? Unlikely.  Not that communism or socialism will fix anything remotely connected to the way people are goverened.
       <br/>
       Sorry I don't mean to come off rude I just don't see how this is close to an end goal.

       What I've seen is that the RomeRules theory basically does say no Jews were involved. They say the Rothschilds are stooges for Rome and give them no credit for founding Israel and all of the WWII manipulation. Zionism's effect on US politics and media has no place in their theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem I see with it is they are not presenting a unified conspiracy theory. It's a binary choice theory where the Rothschild/Zionist conspiracy is wrong and all power comes from Rome and their theory is right. They do not attempt to show how Rothschild ties into anything, and instead say no Rothschild doesn't have power, but Rome does. And where do they make this argument? On posts about Zionism that reach the front page. They're not cross posting interesting Rome Rules posts or making their arguments here, just trying to shoot down the Zionist focus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it is very likely that the black nobility and the zionists work together and they are all part of the cabal, but this is not the RomeRules message. I feel like it's a huge wedge in this community that keeps us from getting anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try searching Zionism or Rothschild on their sub, you get hardly anything. When people ask for these dots to be connected, they get "this has already been covered here in this post" and that post will barely address the concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have the answers but I feel like RomeRules has a weird counter productive agenda. I'm left with no dots connected because I have to pick Jesuits or Zionists, when it seems pretty clear that it's both.
