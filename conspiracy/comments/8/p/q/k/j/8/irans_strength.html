    <div class="md"><p>That first article you linked does not provide proof Iran is technologically superior to the U.S. We got sloppy and they hacked a drone guidance system, possibly with some help from hackers and equipment from or trained by another nation. As soon as they have their own drones, a nuclear arsenal, a space program, satellites etc, etc, then you can start to make a comparison. Right now it&#39;s not even close.</p>

<p>The second link does not provide any evidence that their military is more strategic than us. From what I have read they are certainly no dummies when it comes to strategy but to say they are more strategic than us or Israel is just too simplistic.</p>

<p>Regarding your third link...did you really just link a 300+ page .PDF file without a proper .PDF WARNING! Bad form dude. </p>

<p>From the little I know, I&#39;m not military strategist, a big part of why they haven&#39;t been invaded is their very defensible location and formidable military as well as their cooperation with Russia. I don&#39;t know how much truth there is to it there but supposedly, historically speaking, if we had ever invaded Iran the losses would be great enough that we would then be vulnerable to Russia or China. Pretty sure that&#39;s why last time we invaded it was with a coup or internal revolution. It&#39;s not very common for nation&#39;s to start wars with countries that are their equals, the costs simply outwirgh the benififts. Nation&#39;s that invade other countries tend to do so only to countries they think can be taken easily and with a tangible benefit to the cost.</p>

<p>Iran is no push over, they&#39;re not stupid or a bunch of incompetent cavemen, the have a formidable military and lots of money and natural resources, but if they were that much better than us they probably would have been running Iraq as well as other places in the middle east including Israel and probably even tried to invade the U.S. The fact they haven&#39;t tried the latter but have also managed not to get invaded by Western powers means they arent stupid and do have at least a somewhat realistic outlook and formidable level of sophistication though.</p>

<p>Next time include that .PDF warning!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I’m not oblivious to our overwhelming superiority in those disciplines. I am definitely oversimplifying a lot, but those are legitimate examples of when they’ve outperformed us. I just think that nation is severely underestimated in general and your stab at the complexity of its existence in this post-modern imperialist world is a good one. </p>

<p>PDF warning edited in, I added a shorter reference as well, sorry about that man. It’s Friday night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool man. Hope you didn&#39;t think I was trying to pick you apart simply for oversimplifying the points you were trying to make. Because other than the oversimplifying, your points do have merit and the examples you put forth could certainly use a little more recognition on this side of the globe, especially at a time like this when so many are rattling the sabers and calling for war. Whenever certain sectors start trying to paint an invasion of a place like Iran as potentially necessary and easily winnable it&#39;s good to take a step back and say &quot;Whoah there, wait a minute, it&#39;s not that easy.&quot; Whether you say like u did or like I did, at least we&#39;re talking about it in terms of a measured response, not just &quot;Hell yeah Murica gonna kick Iran&#39;s ass!&quot; Anyway, have a good weekend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s a country of 80 million people, with one of the richest cultures and histories in the world. Iranians are in average highly educated (more so than Americans), and very civilized (unlike the parasiticial barbarians immediately east of the sea, or even most Sunni Arabs ever since WW1).</p>

<p>Btw. that is mostly why they are hated by the enemies of civilization: precisely because they are developped and refined (something even the mullahs couldn’t erase). One’s own depravity and barbarity becomes manifest when put in contrast with an age-old culture.</p>

<p>They are strong because of their level of development, imo. Savages remain so, even when covered in paper wealth - while developped and proud humans also remain so, even when confronted with adversity. You cannot erase/destroy Iran easily, as you cannot erase/destroy France easily (although they’ve been trying hard).</p>
