    <div class="md"><p>Populism¬†is a¬†political philosophy¬†supporting the rights and power of the people in their struggle against a privileged elite.[1]¬†</p>

<p>Political parties and politicians[4]¬†often use the terms &quot;populist&quot; and &quot;populism&quot; as¬†pejorativesagainst their opponents. Such a view sees populism as¬†demagogy, merely appearing to empathize with the public through rhetoric or unrealistic proposals in order to increase appeal across the political spectrum.[5]</p>

<p>Populism in Europe is basically a party that is against Islam and mass-immagration and most of the times the populist party wants to exit the European Union (for example see England, brexit)</p>

<p>It is becoming increasingly popular in Europe, because more and more Europeans are done with the shit that is being pushed upon us. Populism is rising in a lot of countries. In the Netherlands (where I live) a populist party is the second biggest party. In Italy a populist party just won and is now leading the country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In September 2017, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) won 12.6 percent of the vote and entered the Bundestag with 94 seats, upsetting Germany‚Äôs post-war political order. In October, anti-immigrant businessman-turned-politician Andrej Babis led his ANO Party to victory and became the Czech Republic‚Äôs prime minister. </p>

<p>Also in October, the Freedom Party of Austria won 26 percent of the popular vote, up from 20.5 percent in the previous election, and joined the governing coalition.</p>

<p>In January 2018, Czech President Milos Zeman‚Äôs forceful anti-immigrant stance contributed to his narrow victory over a liberal internationalist challenger.</p>

<p>In March, the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement scored significant gains and became Italy‚Äôs largest party, while the virulently anti-immigrant League jumped from 4 percent to 18 percent, surpassing Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs Forza Italia to become the dominant force on the right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with mass immigration is that it provably does <em>not</em> destroy the cultures of the host country!</p>

<p>Just look at the UK f.ex. Probably the most multi-cultural place, and there is still very much such a thing as &#39;britishness&#39;. The immigrants assimilate over several generations. 
The immigrants also enrich the culture with their own customs. So f.ex. one of the most popular fastfoods in UK is ..&#39;curry&#39; which comes from the Indian immigrants. Is it a bad thing that the most popular food is curry as opposed to fish&#39;n&#39;chips f.ex? I don&#39;t think so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They preplanned the tension by purposefully <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/22/libya-and-the-myth-of-humanitarian-intervention/">destroying Libya</a>,  attempting <a href="http://markcurtis.info/2018/04/26/how-britain-engaged-in-a-covert-operation-to-overthrow-assad/">to overthrow Assad</a> by using proxy fighters. Now it&#39;s going to be false flag after another to use US troops directly, there are 2000 boots on the ground. That&#39;s why Netanyahu is touring the world, he&#39;s bullying these <em>&quot;allies&quot;</em> into doing his bidding. It&#39;s also to drum support for an Iran invasion down the road, they really want to destroy the country but need to perception manage to make it happen.
Our <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/uk/ian-sinclair/britain-s-collusion-with-radical-islam-interview-with-mark-curtis">establishment colludes with Radical Islam</a> to bring out this tension so that everyone is divided in Europe.</p>

<p>The rise of populism will be stage managed by our leaders so that the voices that rise to the top are the ones they pick.
They know it&#39;s a great risk that they get overthrow by an angry population who are sick of being slaves to enrich slob shareholders and fund wars fought with no end is sight.
Gotta make sure it&#39;s pointed at the immigrants rather than the greedy executives who made it happen.
They have think-tanks that can palm events years in advanced yet they still do seemingly irrational things.</p>

<p>The fakery involved in making Russia evil is an attempt to scare people into increased defence spending in NATOz they&#39;ll do whatever it takes to get more power. A new cold war based on the poisoning of 3 people who made magic recovery? Lmfao they think we&#39;re so thick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing about Bilderberg that makes me wonder if any big decisions are made at that time. It&#39;s public knowledge when they convene nowadays thanks to the internet. Do you think that Bilderberg is kind of like an Area 51 in the sense that it began as a legitimate site for something conspiratorial but eventually became metaphorical because the common people knew of these locations/events? Basically I&#39;m saying that I have no doubt these elites do convene at some point and place to make important decisions, but I am not sure if it&#39;s at something as publicly known about as Bilderberg. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously, officials of democratic governments shouldn&#39;t be having many secretive meetings, but if you look at the <a href="http://www.bilderbergmeetings.org/participants.html">list of attendees,</a> most of them are former government officials, corporate execs, acedemics, journalists, etc..   They have every right to go to private meetings.  Journalists have some obligation to report on that kind of thing, but they probably have to sign an NDA to get in. </p>

<p>The weirdest part of it all is how quiet the media used to be about it.  I remember one happening near me and finding a leaked list of attendees online with royalty, current defense secretaries, half a dozen heads of states of various countries, execs of huge corporations, Rockefellers, etc. on it, and not a single word about it in local media.</p>

 If this continues I expect a big civil war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing with mass immigration is that it provably does <em>not</em> destroy the cultures of the host country!</p>

<p>Just look at the UK f.ex. Probably the most multi-cultural place, and there is still very much such a thing as &#39;britishness&#39;. The immigrants assimilate over several generations. 
The immigrants also enrich the culture with their own customs. So f.ex. one of the most popular fastfoods in UK is ..&#39;curry&#39; which comes from the Indian immigrants. Is it a bad thing that the most popular food is curry as opposed to fish&#39;n&#39;chips f.ex? I don&#39;t think so. </p>
