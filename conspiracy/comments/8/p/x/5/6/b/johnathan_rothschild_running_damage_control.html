<p>Rothschild declaring the immigrant children separated from their families is a tragedy 2 days ago in letter to Jeff sessions. </p>

<p>I really love how many people are getting behind what is happening in Tucson. Although the added attention surely means they are sweating bullets and doing everything possible to cover their tracks. Absolutely nothing has been proven and no one in law enforcement is investigating.  People are attaching him left and right on twitter.  They see us coming from a mile away and probably burned all the evidence on the site. This is probably already over before it even began. One thing for sure is they are scared. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the video he put up before this one (sorry not bothering to find), he suggested that while no actual children were found there, there were restraints tied to trees, children&#39;s belongings/gear, and that hole that we all saw on video. He suggested that the evidence was troubling at the least and needed to be investigated. Now he&#39;s saying, &quot;It&#39;s been investigated by the PD; nothing to see here.&quot; Maybe more of a 150° turn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea really, but Sawyer and that advisory board are well placed to protect and obfuscate the trafficking. Whether they are or not remains to be seen. Operation blue m&amp;m rounded up 7 people; other operations reported on this sub and elsewhere have rounded up tens of thousands. So, I&#39;m just sayin... and I think the OP of that was rightly concerned that people associated with Booz Allen, the DOJ and &quot;high-level dignitaries&quot; should get a second look.</p>

<p>Personally, that pic of Jack Farmer creeps me out. He looks like the same ilk as Lindsey Graham (yes this is full-on surface bias and conjecture).</p>

Just because someone has the last name Rothschild does not mean I can not say or write the name. Maybe if they weren&#39;t involved with a bunch of shady shit their names would not be brought up. You yourself say you can look all this up and I can see where they are associated with it. I refuse to not write the name Rothschild simply because you think that is being anti-Semitic.
