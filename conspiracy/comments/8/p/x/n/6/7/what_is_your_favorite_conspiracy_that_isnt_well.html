Also this is how you wind the clock back to see what is shared by various forms of life to determine that single cellular life predates multi cellular life and is a foundation of all later life.</p>

<p>There is a ridiculous amount of evidence to support this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that random genetic mutation or non-random adaptation can&#39;t explain biodiversity from the single-cell evolution model. Both of those things happen, but always moving from the complex to the more simple. Environmental variables can&#39;t adequately explain even the differences in human races as clustered on different continents – let alone why one prehistoric organism would find an evolutionary track to become a human being while another would be a giraffe. There&#39;s also a profound absence of transitional fossils to support things like a T-Rex evolving into a modern chicken. I snarfed my granola when that idea came out. </p>

And back to humans, the variations can&#39;t be explained by environmental/geographical differences, nor adaptive or random mutations. Even Darwin had a problem with this at the end of his life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly not trying to &quot;have fun&quot; with my beliefs or I&#39;d just become a Rasta. I&#39;ve made it a personal goal to &quot;learn something&quot; about this planet and humanity, to the extent that I&#39;m capable, or it&#39;s not worth it. It&#39;s certainly not easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually you were also talking about the human races which are all part of one species.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re making a big deal about speciation but reproductive incompatibility is not some magical thing. You change in ways that prevent you from sharing your genes, you&#39;re not going down the joint path any longer. But a pair from one species can differ more genetically than 2 individuals from separate species. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that we might not at this time be able to precisely trace the origin of literally every human variation. No shit natural selection is complex. It&#39;s nonetheless a very strong theory that&#39;s only getting stronger, as well as the best we&#39;ve had for nearly 2 centures. Divergent evolution might be difficult for you personally to get your head around, but it&#39;s totally sensible and well-evidenced, and the parallels to artificial selection are clear, which distinction is ultimately arbitrary anyway since we (and thus any selective pressures we drive) are part of nature.</p>

<p>The species mapping is in the DNA, and DNA itself may have an irreducible complexity to it that strongly suggests intentional synthesis; the alternative is that its structure and the nucleotide pairings happened by chance (within a friendly environment, of course), but when you introduce the variations that DNA have found that can&#39;t be explained by environment (and explaining them by chance is off the statistics charts), then the single-cell evolution theory is on life-support.

<p>Except you weren&#39;t only talking about single-celled organisms. I was able to quote and respond on-topic to other points of yours <em>because</em> you weren&#39;t constraining yourself to the origin of life on earth. That you only raised those issues in service of another point is irrelevant. Wrong is wrong. If you&#39;d only been talking about directed panspermia, I wouldn&#39;t have commented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its just a fake conspiracy theory that&#39;s designed to mock actual conspiracy theories. Its kind of informative because it draws parrallels to how the human mind can be convinced to question even things that we know to be true, but it&#39;s really not that intriguing. The best conspiracy theories arise out of things that are impossible to truly verify like who killed JFK. These allow for endless speculation and intrigue. But Finland isnt even funny or interesting. You can go on a plane to helsinki. Theory refuted.</p>

All of the resources we are mining (with the exception of Granite and Volcanic rocks) from the ground are transition metals and minerals from the dead bodies of these creatures.
This work is not widely known but a lot of very hard work by a certain Roger Spurr has uncovered the enormity of these creatures.. some up to 900miles in length. He has 100% lab certified dna results from a fissilized homo sapiens human that was over 200 ft tall! Checkout the Mudfossils &amp; Mudfossils University channels on youtube</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intelligence agencies flood cities with street drugs then use said drugs on the local population to test out their agents and surveillance tactics in the field.</p>

<p>A lot of the crazy/homeless people you think you see are actually actors and police informants.</p>

<p>Certain pharmaceutical drugs are designed with the express purpose of causing damage to people of high intelligence in order to prevent them from becoming successful or influential people.</p>

<p>Most attacks that happen are false flag operations, they are staged and entirely planned out by law enforcement/intelligence agencies as drills to test out not only their agent&#39;s ability to stage events without getting caught but then the follow up response and cover up of events to control the narrative ensuring that their deception tactics are untraceable. </p>

<p>Mindcontrol and body control is something very real and a large proportion of the population is microchipped or implanted with devices  by intelligence agencies and the elite to control the cattle like population that can be activated by wifi or blue tooth which can do anything from make you have heart palpatations to a full blown heart attack, force you to have a bowel movement, mimic the effects of a drug overdose, read and download your thoughts and memories, cause targeted and specific hallucinations, track your movements without hacking into your cellphone. They can see what you see and hear what you hear, imagine being without any control or privacy over your life.  etc They can do literally anything and everything to you if you were a person of interest or just someone they wanted to fuck with.</p>

<p>Advanced technology like smart phones were only approved for release to the public once law enforcement and intelligence agencies had perfected back door techniques which were given to them by companies like apple. The shit about passwords protecting you was a rouse meant to promote public trust. In reality your service provider or phone manufacturer would violate your rights in a second if law enforcement asked them to or someone with the right connections. Essentially if someone with power really wanted to mess with you or someone really wanted to monitor your actions they could very easily do it unless you live in a shack in the woods out in bumfuck no where and never used a piece of technology or visited a hospital in your life. no amount of encrption or security services could  protect you from them because they employ the best of the best to ensure you cant hide your online presence in any form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we’ve experienced a lot and i mean a lot of shillls over at ME.  The ME searches do not bring up anything real just stuff about bad memory.  As soon as a big ME happens (fruit loops change to froot loops) we see more shills out in force.</p>

<p>X files does an episode and it’s all about memory.  A new film out soon and it’s apparently all about memory and how some guy thinks is real and there is a gov cover up. (He’s crazy of course) </p>

<p>You tube searches generally come up with total nonsense.  Some silly teen girl with pointless mandella effects. Just to make it look silly </p>

<p>Yahoo did a price the other day how everyone got the lyrics wrong to the friends themes tube (when the rain begins to Pour / fall) I’ll be there for you.   And how we all got it wrong  etc. It then gets designed to how we are silly and we didn’t remember it properly pages. </p>

<p>Fox News and other media run peices on how our memory tricks us. And isn’t it interesting. It’s a finally balanced act. They can’t totally dismiss it but give it jut enough expensive as to look interesting but in the end nothing in it.  So when someone recalls Statue of Liberty being on Ellis island. Or the Lincoln memorial has changed. Or there are now six people in the JFK limo. They go to chat room and the shills are here to explain how they got it wrong. </p>

<p>Tho h is how many of us really would think history is changing ? It’s crazy and insane to think that. So it’s a bit easier to divert people away as they already are predisposed to think that way. Another big ones are bible changes. The lion lays down with the lanb. No longer there. Unicorns mentions seven times or so. There were chat rooms exploding with this. Someone noticed the higher echelon coming in and saying it was always like that (well they are right it was always like that) </p>

<p>Walkers crops have their first faq as we have never changed crisp packet colours. Yet so many in the uk recall it.   There were even newspaper articles about it.  </p>

<p>Nestle have an faq how there was never a dash in kit Kat and it’s a common mistake. </p>

<p>A team van videos from the series. I can hardly find any now from the series on you tube. There used to be loads. Why ? The van has a grey top now. </p>

<p>It’s only over a period of time you start to see this cover up and how brilliantly executed it is. Try this. If you dont see all the effects (some people don’t see all the changes in fact no one sees them all it’s strange, but I can give you hundreds of examples. ). Take for a second you know it’s real.  Now do an internet search with that in mind as a potential beloved and see what you start thinking about it.   </p>

<p>You may find some tit bits but in the end you’ll start coming a blank. Or even think it’s rather silly.  See what you think </p>

<p>What&#39;s more likely: Some people heard &quot;they&quot; rather than &quot;he&quot; in those whispers, perhaps because it made more sense to them, and then that entered the public consciousness via quotes and parodies so that people were exposed to and influenced by the misquoted line before they ever even saw the movie....

<p>Answer to question: the ones i have seen personally but no one will believe</p>

<p>There are festivals and gatherings and concerts at which the police infiltrate with undercovers and sell fake hallucinagens, think ghb or truth serum instead of what you asked for.  </p>

<p>Then they bait those people into crimes, like vulnerable teenage girls will appear in their vicinity while police watch from the bushes/cams/drones.  </p>

<p>and the camera/mic tech has gotten incredibly difficult to see, the cameras must be super small, they may even have contact lense displays.  </p>

<p>and you can say so much on reddit and the internet that you will be followed nearly everywhere you go in public.  you don&#39;t have to be important, planning any crimes, a pedo, nope.  just saying political stuff like what i say as mindhawk is enough to be followed by secret police.  </p>

<p>all questions answered but ones that are not earnest, check my comment history back at the beginning, i tried to get attention to this but not a single real person responded.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude, the fusion center is privatized and they habituate any public area you are going to end up at if you are travelling or living in your car.  wal mart parking lots, safeway parking lots.  </p>

<p>so 50% of the time i ran into them was in the middle of an ongoing daily operation at a public place</p>

<p>but when i wanted quiet time in the middle of nowhere, they came to me.  and when i leased a room, somehow it was them too.  </p>

<p>im telling you they have that many people and if you have any radical political views, or a lot of radical political views like me, then you should expect to encounter them at public places, especially counterculture events and concerts, at universities, and campgrounds.  Gas stations and shopping centers.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there is someone following me 24-7, but when i go to a public place, i have seen repeated signs of surveillance operations on myself.   And they set me up with roommates.  They do that to terrorism suspects, even set you up with co-workers, then someone suggests you do something stupid or they try to increase pressure in your life so you might be more likely to go crazy or commit a crime.  </p>

<p>Do you think it was just chance that my roommate turned out to be after i signed the lease a former army demolitions expert?   Then they lost their minds when for 3 days they couldn&#39;t cash a check and texted me 50+ angry texts while i was delivering pizza on a saturday night?    </p>

<p>The usa has changed, or maybe it was always like this.  I don&#39;t consider myself some malcolm x character, I thought you had to be popular for them to think I&#39;m a threat.  </p>

<p>So much of it is privatised now, if you don&#39;t know that you need to read up on stratfor and what cambridge analytica actually does.  when someone becomes interesting to someone or something with real money, they run operations on you.  </p>

<p>Anthony Bourdain mentioned it, Jacob Appelbaum talks about it.</p>

<p>Look at the volume and ssubject matter of my work, I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be surprised.  I&#39;m just not at all popular so it&#39;s odd getting attention, how can I be that important?  </p>

<p>Especially if all the &#39;conspiracy&#39; stuff i write about is off the wall bonkers?  The summary of what I write about is &#39;Privacy must be a protected write&#39; and &#39;Pizzagate is real.&#39;  Maybe also &#39;ecology is important&#39; and &#39;financial interest is ruining earth&#39; and maybe &#39;the d rug war has to end&#39; and &#39;the military industrial complex shouldn&#39;t run the country&#39; and &#39;i don&#39;t want to be ruled by cultists&#39; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, you tell me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the alarming things are </p>

<p>-they use bait children
-they drugged me by putting substance on something i was handed
-they sell/trade/gift fake &#39;acid&#39; and it turns out to be a date rape drug/truth serum type thing, then you are baited into multiple situations where you might hurt someone if you were so inclined
-they do these things at festivals, concerts and gatherings, 
-the national rainbow gathering is operated by police now beware
-if you are on their list, and you try to camp in the woods, someone will be by to check up on you.<br/>
-the fusion centers are real, if you are on their list you may have coworkers or roommates set up to check up on you, they must have large number of private citizens, former military to hire to take part in such things
-they know where you are all the time, they may have tracked my car, there were planes and drones that flew over my location frequently, they may have broken my car computer remotely 2 times that put me in danger</p>

<p>2017 was really wierd, it made me question everything about people i had even known for a long time, or used to know a long time ago.  Another 20 or so people in hindsight now I think were cops.  </p>

<p>I was toooooo trusting.  I believed there was NOOOO WAAAAY I could be that important or that the police had enough time and manpower for someone like me.  </p>

<p>So much gaslighting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look, in that situation the only way to know for sure was to take it</p>

<p>i kindof thought the guy was a cop, that something was off, but it&#39;s difficult to assume that 30-100 people are putting on a show pretending to be hippies?  This wasn&#39;t some dude, this was an entire campsite of people pretending to be hippies.  </p>

<p>if i hadn&#39;t taken it and hadn&#39;t found out it was a date rape drug, then you would be saying, how can you know for sure?  </p>

<p>I made sure I knew for sure because I otherwise couldn&#39;t believe it</p>

<p>If you want to know the truth there may be some risk, this was a big truth so there was some big risk, and now I know once and for all that the united states distributes fake drugs to people it thinks it can get away with drugging</p>

<p>and it is an epic gaslight what they are doing, evidenced by all the people who come here saying &#39;your story doesn&#39;t make sense dood, you need to see a dr.&#39;  &#39;the cops would never do that, cops are nice guys&#39; etc etc</p>

<p>if you think about it, unless you know who actually made it personally, you&#39;re almost always getting drugs from strangers due to prohibition.  and even the legal drugs are frequently not what they say they are, as in you can&#39;t trust pfizer very much now either can you?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well i wouldn&#39;t be a free man if i had any intention to hurt people, so duh</p>

<p>but i dont believe in pre-crime policing and that is what this is.  </p>

<p>in the interest of fighting child trafficking i understand it, but if they are after me like this for political reasons then we are at an impasse, i can&#39;t condone or aid what they are doing with silence. </p>

<p>if i had ever in my life a single time downloaded cp i believe i would have been caught, i have no interest in it, so from my perspective it has to be political.   i have tech skills and take moderate measures to not use a naked connection but i have never done anything that i think is truly absolute anon.  </p>

<p>it has to be political.  about half of what i saw i actually don&#39;t think is bad, but they had to drug me, they had to follow me everywhere, they have to still be following me now.  they had to remotely destroy my car&#39;s computer, twice, in traffic, which costed all my savings.   stuff like this pisses me off.  and if this is the future of technology and human rights in &#39;western&#39; countries </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yanni vs. Laurel</p>

<p>This, to me, has huge implications. People rolled their eyes at this as another blue dress vs. gold dress which, it is. And also has implications. My one thought to showcase the possible (probable?) real-life effect: how many people on a witness stand swore under oath -- and meant it, because it actually IS true for them -- they heard the man scream &quot;Laurel&quot; before shooting someone or testified the perpetrator was absolutely NOT wearing a &quot;blue&quot; colored shirt? </p>

<p>The Laurel vs. Yanni thing is <em>one</em> example, what are the others? How many variables contribute to the way we perceive Yanni, Laurel, blue, gold and the next viral, eye-rolling mindf+(&amp; that comes along? Do some people hear something ELSE other than Yanni or Laurel? This has HUGE implications to me in that they are demonstrable physiological/biological differences among us that shape the way we perceive what we call or reality. </p>

<p>How many more of these variables are there? Why aren&#39;t we discussing them and exploring them more in an effort to get people to chill the fuck out, stop hating each other and arguing or killing each other over what we perceive to be &quot;right&quot; because it&#39;s our own reality that others can&#39;t see? Why this is boiled down to an eye roll and dismissed as something petty has me both baffled and unsurprised at the same time; the &quot;conspiracy&quot; angle of this is if you believe the MSM being used as a tool to manipulate the masses (duh) and the powers that be would rather have you eye roll this away rather than think about how important the Yanni vs. Laurel exercise is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely like how you think man!!! Take a small thing and be able to expound and see the larger implications of said event. </p>

<p>I think one answer to your question is because it takes a fundamental shift in perspective to realize that reality isn&#39;t conclusive. That isn&#39;t an easy thing to actually intellectually come to grips with.</p>

<p>Great post...</p>

and there exists a method that some1 is telling you truths. as i said, if you detach someone mentally from his psyche. he will tell you the truth (his truth, remember every brain has a probability to make shit upand thinks it&#39;s real. if you never did drugs, you can&#39;t understand what i mean</p>
