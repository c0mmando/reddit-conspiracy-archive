<p>Drip, drip, drip.  TPTB seem to be slowly leaking ET disclosure info bit by bit.  They know they can&#39;t keep the lid on ET existence on and around planet Earth forever, and they&#39;re starting to lose a bit of the grip they have on that quarantine moratorium, so they&#39;re beginning to give a bit of serious mainstream airtime to some legitimate, not-easy-to-discard UFO/possible ET craft information.</p>

<p>Drip, drip, drip...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.  <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8g6oll/tom_delonge_steven_greer_bill_moore_all_have/">I OPed a video about this very thing about a month ago</a>, and now that I&#39;ve come back to reference it for you here, I&#39;ve found that the account that uploaded the video itself has been deleted.  I don&#39;t exactly remember which video it was, but I <em>think</em> it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc7Q9hgcukw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=26s">this one right here</a> where Grant Cameron lets it be known that DeLonge, Greer, and Bill Moore (Moore being someone who I honestly wasn&#39;t familiar w/before - and barely still am now actually) might likely all be complicated psyops that each have <em>aspects</em> of the ET picture, but none of which have the real, full picture that they seem to claim they have.</p>

<p>All that said, yes.  I also agree with you that it is indeed a good thing that the topic is at least being discussed in a real and not-marginalizing manner by the MSM.</p>

<p>However the disclosure they will give us is and will remain fishy. We are talking about the mainstream media, intelligence agencies, government officials. .. involved in these conspiracies now suddenly wanting to &quot;inform the public&quot;. It is possible this is becoming necessary because the whole thing is becoming too big and it just might blow up completely, yet any disclosure that will happen will likely be partial and controlled. It cannot be ruled out that such disclosure would also be spun to fit the needs/desires of the ultra rich cabal/ TPTB.</p>

<p>We shall see. We can&#39;t rely on aliens to help us fix this planet. Perhaps somewhere along the line benevolent ETs might help, but I doubt it will happen before we get our shit together as a species and as individuals. That is the main thing the focus on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of this analogy.</p>

<p>Your at a park, with your children, and a group of parents with their children, and see someone&#39;s child acting bad toward another child, who isn&#39;t your own, you can take the chance to go remedy the situation or help, but it can be possibly seen as confrontational, controlling, etc, and the child and parent is freaked out.</p>

<p>Second part of analogy:</p>

<p>Imagine the child being mean to the other was stealing, lying, fighting, etc, and the child listened to the advice, and so did the parent, and both agreed and the situation de-escalates, your suggestion is that they become friends, and you go on your merry way. </p>

<p>These 2 friends have in-fighting, and something very serious happens between them, the parents will blame the kids and all, but if that person who gave that advice/help and told them to be friends is around, they will likely get a portion of the blame themselves.</p>

<p>Its hard to help when there&#39;s a possibility it will NOT help, and no one wants to help and be considered the root cause of our problems, even if we created them before they came. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great analogy.</p>

<p>It is also always important to remember that you can&#39;t really ever help someone that doesn&#39;t want to help themselves. I have learned this throughout my life when at times trying to help those I love disengage from various self-destructive tendencies and attempting to push them towards growth. </p>

<p>You always have to use your intuition. If they are ready your push will be welcomed, but even then only to the degree that they are ready. If they are not you will encounter intense resistance and will do little help. Being present and aware for them, listening...etc. is often the best way to help.</p>

<p>Ultimately again, these are humanity&#39;s challenges. The only way for humanity to truly grow is to take them on themselves. Sure, some help can be given and might be given, but ultimately we can only do it ourselves.</p>

<p>Call me a crazy optimist but I believe in us. We&#39;ll do it. We are doing it already and the fire is only going to burn brighter as we move on.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However the disclosure they will give us is and will remain fishy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  That’s why we need to not rely on “their” disclosure.  We need to slowly keep spreading the word and doing it ourselves.  TPTB here don’t want full disclosure for the 99% - but the 99% can acquire disclosure on their/our own if we keep digging for the truth of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is possible this is becoming necessary because the whole thing is becoming too big and it just might blow up completely, yet any disclosure that will happen will likely be partial and controlled.

<p>Again, agree with all of this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We shall see. We can&#39;t rely on aliens to help us fix this planet. Perhaps somewhere along the line benevolent ETs might help (it seems likely there are both positively and negatively oriented ETs... I usually tie this into their spiritual development, but even otherwise this diversity is likely) but I doubt it will happen before we get our shit together as a species and as individuals. That is the main thing we should focus on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re going over it again because even though it might have &quot;hit headlines months ago now&quot;, it didn&#39;t <em>really</em> &quot;hit headlines&quot; because it wasn&#39;t given any real press.  It was given a tiny blurb that came and went and that&#39;s it.  That&#39;s how headlines go.  Even if something <em>is</em> a &quot;headline&quot;, it doesn&#39;t really mean it&#39;ll get seen by too many unless it A) gets <em>repeatedly</em> talked about and addressed over and over again, and B) gets done so by major msm outlets.  Otherwise, headline or not, it won&#39;t really get paid attention to too much and will get quickly forgotten.</p>

<p>In this case - again, regardless of whether it was a &quot;report that hit headlines months ago now&quot; or not - it&#39;s getting aired out <em>again</em> because, as I said in the OP text, TPTB are actually realizing that they are beginning to lose a grip on the ET disclosure narrative.  More and more people are beginning to <em>slowly</em> - ever so slowly - wake up to the fact that we are in absolutely <em>no</em> way alone; that we are not only not alone, but ETs are <em>here right now</em>.  They are (and have been) in and around our airspace, and are pretty common in our solar system (to say nothing about our galaxy and cosmos).  TPTB are, again, realizing that more and more people are waking up to this truth, which means that the people will soon wake up to <em>the reasons</em> why it is that the information has been kept secret from us for so, so very long...and those reasons will be looked upon by many as being absolutely, unbelievably, unimaginably dark and evil by many, many people once they start finding out why it&#39;s been held back.</p>

<p>Soooo TPTB are doing damage control and beginning to let the information of ET existence trickle out.  They&#39;re trying to control the narrative now before it gets too out of hand from them.</p>

<p>Fuck them though.  The real truth really needs to come out independent of them and their shit control of it.</p>

<p>All that said, it&#39;s still a good thing that at least <em>some</em> MSM outlets are covering this topic in a not ridiculing, not marginalizing manner.</p>
