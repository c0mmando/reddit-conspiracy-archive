        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I feel that way a lot. Like, I can feel like I&#39;m potentially a genius, I feel like I was understanding things as quickly and deeply as certain real and fictional people, and it got restricted at some point once I started having certain plans for my future and the future of the rest of society.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t used to have trouble doing and thinking and remembering certain things. But now, no matter how awake and alert I am, or if I&#39;m on ritalin or coffee or tea or a Monster energy drink, or just water and healthy food, day or night... I cannot read certain things for too long at all without wanting to pass out. Useless shit, I can read for days. The minute I try to learn physics, chemistry, programming, law, any of the things that I planned long ago to master to fulfill my ideas, it gets stopped. My brain has a huge urge to either fall asleep, or something erases every word I read from my memory, even if I keep reading a single line over and over again.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like something knows what I want to learn and what I want to do, and either consciously monitors and stops me, or something else is programmed to do it automatically.... or I&#39;m programmed to sabotage my own mind. </p>

<p>Lately it feels like ever since I got that idea, my health has been declining. I&#39;m not even middle aged yet. Roughly a decade away. But it feels like something inside me is going to kill me at just the right time, probably before I can speak to the right people in person whom I planned on meeting by the end of the month.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll make it to then. Or maybe an active shooter will show up at our meeting. It&#39;s an event held in an open area with no law enforcement nearby at all.</p>

<p>Even if I live, it feels like something really is preventing me from knowing certain things and being able to act on it. It feels like I reached level 100, like in an RPG, in my ability to learn and understand and work on things, but I am eternally prevented from &quot;equipping&quot; anything anymore. They or it saw what I had planned, and decided to eternally handicap me to prevent me from ever doing it.</p>

<p>Does anyone else here feel the same thing has been happening to them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a handful of hobbies. Believe me, I use every bit of effort to keep my mind and body sharp and stimulated. I can learn anything artistic with ease, I used to learn calculus like it was algebra. Now, for some reason, I get these huge urges to pass out or I forget everything I read as I read it, ONLY when it comes to academic stuff. Art-related stuff, it doesn&#39;t do that. Useless political and media news, it doesn&#39;t do that. Anything related to expanding my education, my brain forcefully craps out on me, and drugs won&#39;t fix it.</p>

<p>I see them in my dreams. Sometimes it&#39;s a group or just one person. They know what I wanna do, and they&#39;re always restricting me. And it&#39;s when I dream about those people in particular, do my dreams seem the most real. And I can feel it when they catch me, and they always do, but only when I&#39;m dreaming about trying to do the things I&#39;m trying to do. Not when I&#39;m dreaming about random stuff or even lucid dreaming about flying or using magic powers. Only when it&#39;s about me escaping particularly from them so I can hide and do those things I wanna do. And they always show me just how easily they can capture me, and how powerful they are with their surveillance. They come to me in the form of powerful agents and  UFOs with tractor ships, and massive bombs, in my dreams.</p>

<p>In reality, it&#39;s perfect coincidences of people sabotaging me, financial problems from out of nowhere, family crisis, roommates suddenly leaving, and the daily battles of trying to study academics on my own and not being able to retain any of it. Every semester, something stops me from going back to school. But I can do anything else I want to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d cut out all the caffeine and booze and any other stimulants or depressants and take it easy. Chill. Meditate. Find a hobby, like the-the other comment says. </p>

<p>There are both good AND bad spirits around us everywhere. You&#39;ve got to cultivate the good ones and sent the bad ones away. They have to listen. Say out loud to them: &quot;GO away! I reject you! You are not welcome here. Only good spirits are welcome here!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t read the body of my post. I made an edit to make it clearer, please actually read it.</p>

<p>And what if those spirits I&#39;m talking about don&#39;t give a shit about what I have to say? Exactly like I said in the body post you didn&#39;t read. They are specifically waiting for when I try to learn or do certain things, and then prevent me from doing them.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a certain agency of humans or aliens doing it, there&#39;s nothing I can really do to stop them. They&#39;re not simply my &quot;inner demons&quot;. This isn&#39;t ADHD or procrastination. I&#39;m a very active and proactive and healthy person. I get a lot of stuff done, I have a career, but I&#39;m trapped in it and literally every time I make an effort to learn the things I wanna learn to fulfill my plans, it stops me from doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would not put anything out of the realm of possibility. While it&#39;s on the fringe of likelihood, a dark spirit that has attached itself to you for some reason, a curse, a &quot;binding spell&quot; by a coven of witches out to get you, all of it is within the potential supernatural reality you are facing. </p>

<p>I have felt paralyzed in the past, and it sometimes still weighs on me, though not now or then in the extreme fashion that it seems to have anchored you. While you don&#39;t ask for advice or assistance, please permit me to offer a couple more suggestions, because if you do have the inner potential you sense--and you probably do--it&#39;s important for you to tap into it, and we are trying to help.</p>

<p>1- When I got fired from a great job by assholes who were taking over our company, I was paralyzed. Couldn&#39;t write, couldn&#39;t think straight, it was bad. Finally I went to the huge library in the city near where I lived and spent all day there for a month. I was around books, other book lovers, the writing of many of the greatest minds in the world. Very quickly my writing--and my love of writing--came back to me. I had a new job in weeks, better than the one before. </p>

<p>2- Years later, when I finally put the last pieces into place about the global cabal, it sent me into a downward spiral of depression. Again, I was paralyzed. Didn&#39;t want to work, didn&#39;t want to see people, felt full of despair. Ultimately, one horribly rainy day, I just walked out and found the first church and went inside. It changed my life. I realize a lot of churches are false fronts, but perhaps if you pray for guidance you&#39;ll find the right one.</p>

<p>3- Pray. Pray pray pray. Ask for help. It&#39;s there. </p>

<p>You can dismiss all this, and I understand if you do. But I would also ask if perhaps there is a weight upon you that you think you deserve somehow, that there is something from your past that makes you feel guilty, that makes you think you don&#39;t deserve to win. </p>

<p>Good luck! You know we&#39;re all pulling for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense, but you sound like someone who hasn&#39;t slept in weeks and is having grand illusions of &quot;something&quot; is holding me back. What it sounds like, is you, and the a large part of of the world at this point, have had their brains fucked by the internet and the advancement of technology. Instant gratification has pretty much become engrained into our society. What seems like something holding you back, sounds to me like your brain is wired in a certain way now. Before, you were in school and actively learning, that&#39;s what your brain was used to, that&#39;s what it was wired for at the time. Years later, after you&#39;ve worked in the same job doing the same thing over and over for years your brain has become wired for a different lifestyle. Of course you don&#39;t want to fucking study and learn, your brain wants to do what it&#39;s used to, so when you try to &quot;learn&quot; your brain is saying, fuck that, let&#39;s go do what we&#39;re used to! Let&#39;s go play games! Let&#39;s go read quick little interesting stories or look at sexy pictures online! </p>

<p>Or you could be right, and there are aliens out there actively watching you, waiting for you to &quot;want&quot; to learn and then blast you with radio waves.</p>

<p>At the end of the day you&#39;re gonna believe what you want anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go in nature were engery flows freely. Tell your self when you feel bad engery that this to shall pass.  Dont hold on to hate and like other have said caffeine break  is great idea. A new hobby is other another way to gather new positive engery. Also sometimes it&#39;s the people you hang out with or  Associate with that can bring you down. Having plants around your home is another great way to help  Cultivate positive energies in your household. Also hang your  Goals on your wall so you always have it In your subconscious.

    <div class="md"><p>I read it. Your giving your self to little power and making this way more powerful then it needs to be. You have a mind a very power mind we all do but at a young age they put in us that we are nothing powerless just another brick in the wall. The only one that can free your self Is you. If you believe you are powerless then you are powerless. If you feel  something sabotaging you then it will sabotage you.

    <div class="md"><p>God (or some asshole at the end of a transmitter... same difference) lives in your head.  Figuratively.  You have to kick that asshole out, and take control of your life.</p>

<p>I struggled with self loathing and self sabotage for years.  Decades, I guess.  It was triggered by severed family ties in youth, by religion, being duped into &quot;serving&quot; after 9/11, etc.</p>

<p>One day, I got through a bad spell that had lasted some months, woke up, and said to myself &quot;<em>WHY</em> do I self destruct myself like this?!  I&#39;m not an asshole to anyone around me, but toward myself, I&#39;m an unrelenting cunt.  Why do I just shut down when I&#39;m on the verge of achieving something?!  It&#39;s not <em>me</em>, and I&#39;m going to track down the source of this bullshit and put a stop to it!&quot;</p>

<p>Or something like that...  :)</p>

<p>So, whether you veer spiritual, scientific, superstitious, whatever...  Your issues aren&#39;t going to match mine necessarily, but find that psychological hangup that lives in your head, and kick it out.  You already know what you need to do.  Make it happen.  </p>

<p>And don&#39;t do experimental psych drugs.  That&#39;s probably half the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m experiencing some of the same things as you, I found out 2 years ago about technologies that can influence the mind from a distance and ever since then they&#39;ve harassed me a lot worse. They induce pain in my body when I&#39;m doing something that requires me to focus and sometimes while I&#39;m reading or talking in a conversation they will erase my memory of what I was just thinking about. This is experienced by many targeted individuals. I read a comment by Bryan Tew who is probably a fake T.I but some good information can slip through, it was pretty long with bullshit mixed in and his main point was the program ruins people&#39;s working memory. </p>

<p>Not trying to show off, it&#39;s just an interesting similarity in school I was one of the brightest students, I could learn any subject really well but I always loved art and was naturally talented in it, I noticed me and my family&#39;s targeting get lot worse after high school. I was really optimistic about my future and had great things planned mainly wanted to help the world heal more than anything, they destroyed almost everything with organized crime against my family in Iran and US that drastically changed my life&#39;s course. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted about my targeting here many times and I try to be as modest as I can about myself cuz trolls say things like why are you so special or no one cares about you to target you so I say I believe everyone is targeted at different levels, which imo isn&#39;t false but people need to understand there&#39;s a deeper reason our brightest minds are targeted. </p>

<p>IMO they&#39;re making people destroy themselves by removing critical thinkers, abstract thinkers, dissidents, people with high IQ and empathy from society or forcefully making them comply. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you tried to do your reading away from any electronics? Get a book you want to study and go be alone with it in the sunshine? At times I have felt Something similar as you describe. I generally lean towards explaining it away as self sabotage and depression on my part. However, my first encounters with this feeling starts in early childhood, it used to motivate me to pretend to be a regular kid in my head, singing nursery rhymes on one track, while trying to understand the big things on a deeper track. I used to think that my mind was being searched for, and I would be in danger of targeting buy some powerful entity(s) if my truths and abilities were known. I had a safe, fairly conventional late 70s childhood. I have never been medicated, do not believe I have any mental disorder, and was given a completely clean mental bill of health the couple of times I was seen by a psychologist in my early and late teens.  Even had a full coring at Children’s Hospital in the 80s, which did determine that I am dyslexic. I often feel that I’ve spent most of my life “drifting laterally” while I seek a path that is safe, that causes no harm to me or the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I inherently feel this way too. I have so much potential but the only things that are pushed to me in life is opportunity to bring myself down. It all started after highschool. I was in all AP classes and excelled with a 3.7 GPA. (4.7 weighted). When I went to college I couldn&#39;t help but to find that it wasn&#39;t for me. I dropped out and started in the tile construction industry. It&#39;s almost like I &quot;showed too much of my potential&quot; without thinking of who was watching and now I&#39;m suppressed because they don&#39;t want me to end up doing what I could have done here. I&#39;m glad others see it too because it&#39;s bullshit. Like you said every aspect is being tweaked to keep me in place. So frustrating. Just because I have the potential to change everything doesn&#39;t mean I should be stopped from doing it. I&#39;ve tried multiple times to get back on the high horse but to no avail. Wish I could break thru</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God does not work against His creation, but there is an enormous spiritual battle that is ongoing just outside our perception all around us.  It has been so since the garden and worse after ‘fall’.  There are prophecies if it escalating to near total annihilation, and some of the signs for this keep aligning:  one world government, cashless society requiring a number to buy or sell. See Revelation 13. </p>

<p>Illness and wickedness are part of the broken condition of creation right now. It’s hard to say something is so directly assaulting us as you describe.  There are many indirect hits like predatory healthcare, environmental poisoning, and ineffective public services. </p>

<p>Seek God and His protection, pray for His will to be done on earth. </p>

You can become whatever you want to become. If you think you are right, maybe the aliens are just testing to see how far you can actually go. I think you are way too paranoid and need balance.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh god, you&#39;re not alone, trust me. This has been happening to me for the past 4 years, I really noticed it about a year ago. A lot of events in my life felt orchestrated but when I started to look into certain topics, it became evident that something didn&#39;t want me to reach that information. Okay so just to get into it briefly, I had experienced this strange connection to a man that I thought was my twin flame, I felt that God or the universe had put him in my path and I had so many synchronicites that led me to believe that he was the one. However, upon meeting him my life sort of went to shit, I had a very difficult and trying period but it kind of resulted an a &quot;ego death&quot; if you will. Obvisouly you can&#39;t kill the ego completely but I certainly felt as if I had learned so much from that dark period and grown from it. But still, this dark presence was there , like I just felt like was being almost harassed by this false god or this man behind the curtain. Anyway, when I looked into this topic called &quot;Alien love bite&quot; and this researcher Eve Lorgen, it became worse, worse overnight. I started to question the concept of twin flames and such. I also found this really woke podcast : <a href="https://youtu.be/A1j-dtUgops">https://youtu.be/A1j-dtUgops</a></p>

<p>upon finding this podcast and listening to it I began to feel extremely sleepy like literally just couldn&#39;t finish it because I would knock out every single fucking time that I would try to hear it and finish watching it. It was the strangest thing ever, because I could not fight it no matter how hard I tried and it was always accompanied by this strange feeling in my tailbone/lower spine, like a pulsing and hot sensation. I also had experiences with sleep paralysis after researching to this topic, but the craziest thing of all was once while I was catching myself falling asleep listening to it, I heard the woman in the podcast discuss how many people report feeling sleepy after reading her book and looking into this topic. my eyes darted and I propped myself up immediately, I knew there was something to this but have never found anyone who has experienced this themselves. Trust me, you&#39;re not alone or crazy. I think you have to experience it for yourself to see what I mean, but definitely id be trying to think about or talk about this topic or other related conspiracies and I&#39;d suddenly be very confused and feel as if someone scrambled my mind so suddenly. So If you want to message me feel free, it would be interesting to try to find any connections. </p>
