        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s not play politics right now because politics will be exposed if we keep this pressure up. First off, let me make a disclaimer. I am independently researching this and will not charge or make a dime off any of this content or any of these uploaded videos or findings. This is for the kids. For the victims. For those that have no voice or no way to speak out about this. THIS IS FOR YOU AND YOU ONLY. Fuck money.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get caught up to speed and on the same page. With new developments coming out it creates easy avenues for forum sliding and manipulation techniques. We need to stay caught up on the same page. My goal with this thread is to bring somewhat of a timeline or at least cohesion across days as more things are discovered. This will not be my last thread nor will I stop supporting these Veterans. </p>

<p>I personally am going through and watching old footage and live streams and recording relevant bits and uploading them. This is a slow process but one I am willing to do to bring awareness to this! We need your help. Send these guys supplies if you can like gas cards, water, or batteries. No cash. This is not about cash or gofundme&#39;s or any of that BS.</p>

<p>This first picture here is an up close shot of the child restraints found placed on these trees at this first camp where this whole investigation started. Notice the dried blood splatter</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/yhf3u2b.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/yhf3u2b.jpg</a></p>

<p>Here is first person perspective video shot of the FIRST camp that was found and what kicked all of this off..</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/k4dIjJwwjzE">https://youtu.be/k4dIjJwwjzE</a></p>

<p>Here is first person perspective of when 2 VOP volunteers were arrested by State Police. A father and a son. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/oIMMWT7KR0o">https://youtu.be/oIMMWT7KR0o</a></p>

<p>Here is a mission statement by VOP and what they stand for. This is not a stand off. This is not hostile. This is cooperation and unity between all parties regardless of career, sex, politics, ethnicity, or whatever. This is a call to the victims that have no voice and no boots on the ground. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/FEXF8l_iBSc">https://youtu.be/FEXF8l_iBSc</a></p>

<p>Here is first person perspective of VOP interaction between Law Enforcement (local) and a guy that keeps lying and changing his story (guy with cow boy hat, confrontational and hostile stance and behaviour) watch everyone involved</p>

<p>(still uploading as of this posting, will update this with a link once it is done)</p>

<p>Here is footage from today of the child&#39;s skull and parts being found. This is a recent development (as of today, Thursday, 6/7/2018) This is a rather big piece of information and deserves its own thread in its own right. Here is video (jump to 4 minute mark to see skull)</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PYMAgzFap9A">https://youtu.be/PYMAgzFap9A</a></p>

<p>Here is a photo of the skull with water bottle for comparison:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/hsLC3al.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/hsLC3al.jpg</a></p>

<p>This is all the video I have uploaded for now. I have much more saved and being uploaded as this is being posted, and more that needs to be edited and even more that I need to capture and archive. There is no shortage of footage, trust me. For those looking to find live streams of this page, go to Facebook and search for the group - VOP - Team Pulaski. I can&#39;t link directly to facebook without automod deleting this thread/post.
God bless these veterans and what they are doing. They ARE NOT accepting cash donations. They need supplies. I am not sure about rules on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regarding sharing addresses for donations, so I am witholding the address. If you need the address to DONATE SUPPLIES, NOT CASH, then PM me and I will happily give it. These are the requested supplies:</p>

<p>Items Requested:
Sunscreen.
Electrolyte powder
Water
Coconut water
Work gloves
Trash bags
Flashlights
Batteries (all sizes)
10x10 or larger pop-up canopies
Large tents (military when possible)
Paracord
Rope
Heavy duty stakes
Field shovels
Chem lights
Flood lights
Tarps (all sizes)
Camo netting
Baofaeng
BF-F8 Radios &amp; chargers
Solar units/batteries
Camelbacks
Camping tents
Cots
Sleeping bags</p>

<p>THIS IS ONLY GETTING STARTED. VOP has a 3 month stay so far confirmed, and they will continue to scout, watch, and protect/secure this area. TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT: It would take their veterans team OVER 30 YEARS. At this rate to cover all of this desert and public land that the cartels are using. THEY NEED VOLUNTEERS. Not cash. Not gofundme&#39;s or patreon accounts, they need volunteer UN ARMED boots on the ground help. The only armed individuals are trusted and respected ex-military veterans that can actually handle themselves and their weapon without emotionally reacting to a situation by pulling triggers. This is a professional operation and not some small time bs.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s use this thread to discuss updates, happenings, and more. There is A LOT unfolding. And I just saw news of 4 Psych doctors being murdered/suicided within Phoenix area, could be mop up efforts. We need to act fast and get awareness on this so cover ups cannot happen and things don&#39;t go south. WE HAVE THE POWER. WE HAVE THE NUMBERS. WE HAVE THE FUCKING INTERNET.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t stop. Don&#39;t stop. Don&#39;t stop. Keep up the pressure.</p>

<p>Thank you and god bless our brave men and woman (WE ARE ALL ONE. RACE DOES NOT MATTER. POLITICS DOES NOT MATTER. THE KIDS AND VICTIMS MATTER AND THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT)</p>

<p>I will leave comments below with more links and hopefully we can fuel more research and speculation. NO HATE. NO NEGATIVITY. NO VIOLENCE. Keep this within the love and light of your heart and the capacity of source to guide this where it needs to go. God bless us all, we are all one human race, let&#39;s come together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the scramble on the other side is real, its like watching tectonic plates shift </p>

<p>i think what is going on in arizona is such a huge mess that it is possible for two giant catastrophes to happen at the same time.  </p>

<p>this dwight guy was pissed because his kids were taken away from him for no reason and under strange circumstances, and we know this is a problem already in arizona.  there were large protests last year by parents, and multiple scandals with no change from the department besides in name.  </p>

<p>his videos were censored or otherwise taken down, an elderly couple with an odd background with no connection to him were just kindof assigned to him as the murderer without explanation.  </p>

<p>do you know how the VOP stumbled on the camp in cemex?  i am going to keep bringing this question up.  Because someone had to go in that cemex property through the gate unless there was a hole in that fence along the highway.  </p>

<p>I read there was a psychologist, 2 paralegals, this elderly couple, and someone else maybe the lawyer.   Quite a spree.   </p>

<p>Quite a strange tale, I want to know the whooooole thing.   </p>

<p>Someone give me more links....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have 2 more videos uploading right now as I type this showing interactions between VOP, an unknown group/landowner, and others. This is an important 2 part video segment that is uploading but it may take a while. I encourage you guys to download these videos if you can or find some way to archive and back all of this up. I have copies and even if my channel goes down on YouTube I have an alternative channel I will re-upload to and share links from again. If it came down to it. It should be okay though, we are all taking copies and recording what we can so nothing can be fucked with or covered up. God speed</p>

<p>&quot;Tucson Randolph Golf Course is a vile place too. The First Tee operates there at night and has several statutes on the grounds that indicate children lover, pyramids, and underground screams are heard. If you look at a map of the Randolph golf course, you will no doubt see that the entire community recreational area is packed with secluded structures with entrances to tunnels underneath. The Arroyo Chico Watershed project is a crucial area of investigation and maybe a transport service or link to more interesting leads&quot;</p>

<p>voices from underground?  more about tunnels here.  </p>

<p>Sex slaves are incredibly valuable, so anyone in human trafficking wants to keep victims alive so they can be pimped and sold repeatedly. That said, they do abuse and take their victims as part of breaking them down psychologically. </p>

<p>Awesome. Any idea why the bottom half of the jaw was removed? This is usually done to prevent medical record ID of the victim/dead person.</p>

<p>I agree, they will want to keep the sex slaves alive because it is a &quot;return investment&quot; fucking sad to say it but it is and that is the way cartels and these pimps and gangs and groups earn money over and over again.. A drug is sold once, a person whether male female or child, can be sold OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Bring it all to light, let it all burn, it is time we deal with it all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/border-trilogy-part-2-hold-line">this episode of RadioLab</a> interviews a scentist that studied why bodies disappear in the desert so fast.  He got two pig cadavers, dressed them in human clothes and placed them in positions that dead bodies tend to end up in according to interviews with illegals that crossed the border.</p>

<p>Either a man would become ill, sit in some shade and die.  Or if someone died in a group the others would bury him under rocks.  The scientist came back a few days later and the bodies were gone and only from trial cam footage was the scientist able to figure out what happened to the carcasses.  </p>

<p>Long story short vultures will carry bones away and ants will devour bones and bring them back to their nest.  so it is possible the mandible and the teeth could have been removed by the local fauna. also he learned if you bury a body under rocks in the desert the rocks will help cook the body and it will disappear faster then a body left under a tree.</p>

<p>Not sure if that is the case with this skull located today.</p>

<p>These are all viable avenues and I will not say it is either one it is good to have awareness and thank you for shining light on the process of decomposition in the desert</p>

<p>They seemed to have found other pieces of the body I am not sure if it was from the same skull that was found or if it was other pieces but it does make sense that local fauna would drag/carry the pieces around. Thank you for providing further insight </p>

<p>They&#39;re trying to make us seem like lunatics</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But there was never any evidence that the claim was anything more than the product of an overactive imagination and online conspiracists. Certainly there were no victims. And when Tucson police came to investigate, they said they found no sign of trafficking in children for sex or anything other than a homeless camp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to prove them wrong. We need to only stick to provable facts that we can easily search and pull up. Or else they&#39;re going to keep spearheading that all this is fake. </p>

<p>The update on the child skull is...that it&#39;s an adult skull. That&#39;s what they said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pima County Medical Examiner determined late Thursday that it was an adult skull. It turns out Veterans on Patrol found the skull while searching the desert west of Marana, about 20 miles northwest of the homeless camp where they claimed to have found a child sex-trafficking site. It’s in a migrant- and drug-smuggling corridor where dozens of sets of remains have been found over recent years, among the 2,800 that have been found in Southern Arizona since migrant deaths accelerated after 2000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look, they&#39;ve been looking at our sub:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are convinced they’ve found what conspiracists have been looking for since 2016 — a place where they can imagine children are trafficked for sex on behalf of villainous global elites, like “the Rothschilds.” And, yes, the fact that our mayor has a last name of Rothschild is deemed somehow significant to the conspiracists.</p>

<p>VOP is professional and is in good hands. Right now, the truth seeking movement needs to be careful how we present and share information. And for gods sake we dont need anyone monetising this or trying to get youtube fame off of it. VOP has only hit so many spots so far and this area is MASSIVE.

<p>Considering blue prints have been found for underground facilities and tunnels, I am sure there may be more structures and some may be underground</p>

Now I&#39;m not saying these businesses I selected do this. But I am saying it has been often discussed that small businesses are often used for money laundering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A common way you can use to legalize illicit funds is by setting up various businesses that exist for the sole purpose of blending dirty money with legitimate incomes. While the companies set up are legal in nature and can operate like ordinary businesses,  they can overstate their income, which comes from over-invoicing  to allow inflow of ‘dirty’ money. Businesses that are on cash basis like nightclubs makes the inflow even more difficult to trace.</p>

<p>Shell companies that are set up without any significant assets or operations can also be used for money laundering. These companies simply create fake transactions similar to normal businesses to allow inflow of cash. The funds can be cycled in a  few more companies before reaching your pocket as legitimate cash.</p>

<p>btw did you see this? </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/116357459/#q116360099">https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/116357459/#q116360099</a></p>

<p>im trying to find the comment where i clicked it but i can&#39;t lol</p>

<p>so glad to see this getting a proper discussion, i do soundly believe that the VOP are going to already be infiltrated and steered by mucky mucks, however my gut says there are some good guys there and that this isn&#39;t something the mucky mucks would ever choose to start up, as for them, it&#39;s actually an internal gang war. </p>

<p>there are a force in the usa at work that wants to make it such that the oligarchy is a permanent aristocracy that is itself held to a different law that is actually a lot like no law at all.  </p>

<p>so they build a system inside the system, a little like tor actually.  in such a big system there are so many nooks and crannies.  </p>

<p>but the problem is, the vast vast majority of people will not stand to be ruled by people who live in tall buildings and require a steady supply of children.   </p>

<p>and so we are at somewhat of an impasse, </p>

<p>pizzagate and tuscon(and for Ms Calderon, Devani, and for Lori Handrahan, her own daughter) are the spectacles that arise out of this impasse.  </p>

<p>The skeptical were right about JFK and 9/11 all along, that&#39;s the thing here, the people who believe pizzagate are the skeptical people so the national media is flipping the script, and now they sound like, &#39;c&#39;mon, why would a guy named rothchild, the clinton global initiative, an israeli concrete subsidiary, the richest man in the world who happens to be named Carlos Slim, a school and casino with long-known pedorast symbology, and human traffickers with a makeshift child prison, have ANYTHING to do with each other?&#39;  </p>

<p>This is all toooootalllly norrrrrrmaaaaal stuff.  (roflmao) </p>

<p>Just last friday bill maher mocked pizzagate by summarizing it completely, absolutely, incorrect.  They cannot talk about pizzagate on the teevee or on wikipedia except that they mutilate the factual narrative and completely ignore 99% of the actual relevant information.   </p>

<p>This all only makes it more suspicious.  I know there is something going on, I&#39;m done being trusting and giving the benefit of the doubt. </p>

<p>Done.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats what is strange</p>

<p>How can something that is developing and surfacing day by day already be &quot;false&quot;</p>

<p>Even on some of the live stream videos today he was saying how the police has been taking bags of evidence. Therefore it means it is not a &quot;case closed johnson&quot; kind of scenario this is active and ongoing. Also the area is HUGE. How can they come to one litte small break/resting point and scream false and paint a narrative OFF ONE CAMP. Cherry on top is VOP has seen thousands of homeless camps over the years and this is unlike any they have ever stumbled across.</p>

They started off as an interesting site that delved into urban myths, but around the 2016 elections, it quickly became focused on shaping the narrative around political &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. They are relying on their credibility established from the past to protect establishment politicians and their dirty dealings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you know its funny because this is a human trafficking/drug running/mule pushing corridor that even the homeless wont camp out in because its so desolate and away from town and the area is HUGE.</p>

<p>What is even funnier is these routes can and have been used to smuggle ISIS members into the USA by way of proxy through southern borders, and this is even mentioned several times on live streams.</p>

<p>Now let me ask why an account like yours, or a person like you, suddenly decides to post on this thread after 163 days of no posts and is trying to say this is not a pedophile camp. Look you can say what you want but the fact your name is slave for ISIS makes this whole interaction even funnier. God bless</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this isn&#39;t as helpful as it could be </p>

<p>what we have is one stop on the trip, what happens is the people are driven in from the desert to this location, sometimes with children </p>

<p>so if we look for the deaths of females everywhere between this location and the mexican border, give or take 20 degrees in either direction, we are going to find the path.  if they are bringing children, they are coming with women, it won&#39;t be a bunch of bros and just kids.  </p>

<p>and sometimes those women won&#39;t make it, and so anyone actually investeigating this would search for female bodies found in that general vicinity.  </p>

<p>strava is our friend...</p>

<p>but this site you have to search for people by name, it didn&#39;t accept * as a wildcard, am i doing it wrong?  can you find the list of female deaths in the last 5 years in that corridor?  </p>

<p>After watching this, IMO he does seem to have a lot of knowledge about child sex trafficking, so this lends credibility to his assessment. </p>

<p>And in this video he discusses his team&#39;s assessment of the camp further after hours assessing it along with a former Navy Seal colleague and a former CIA member / &quot;federal criminal investigator.&quot; They also had a film crew so it seems there should be better footage somewhere. He says they can&#39;t say for sure but the camp has all the signs of a waypoint on a human trafficking route. </p>

<p>Snopes won&#39;t even touch the alefantis rothchild claim, i wonder what they are going to say about this mayor now?  does anyone have links on this guys background?  this great mayor?  </p>

<p>Please understand I&#39;m not saying what was found and is continuing to be found isn&#39;t some horrible child abuse ring.  But I do remember when the shills came during the pizza gate thing and boiled down everything that was found into &#39;they have kids in cages in the basement of a pizza place in DC&#39;.

<p>From what I understand we actually can, we just opt not too because it is much more expensive.  The options we have for concrete now aren&#39;t made to be everlasting like the Romans because we don&#39;t need it to be like they did.  We have a much easier time building stuff and repairing stuff compared to them, who just wanted to build it and never have to worry about it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s not the main thing, just another sketchy thing on a huge pile of sketchy things </p>

<p>it&#39;s not like podesta&#39;s email form that lady with the kids in the pool giving their ages alone would be anything, but then you look at the guys artwork and it&#39;s all half naked minors in positions of various distress, and so why not look at his connections, past, and omfg then there is spirit cooking and the artwork on the walls of comet, and my spidey-sense is going off.  Would you let your kid hang out at a pizzaparlor with that on the walls?   Then let anyone tape them to a ping pong table like they were in a bdsm flick and laugh about it ha ha?  </p>

<p>at any rate, the blood/concrete thing just sounds like spirit cooking, like do you think if a bunch of occult sadists are going to build their temple with special powers they AREN&#39;T going to put blood in the concrete?  </p>

<p>c&#39;mon this is basic occult crap, blood magic(k) is a thing with bad people, get used to it.  hell, jesus is blood magic(k) with his sacrifice to save everyone and having us imagine drinking his blood to remember?  (i reject this btw, he just wanted us to drink red wine and hang out with friends, not ritualize anything) </p>

<p>i, for the record, reject all blood magic, as that is what is known as &#39;necro&#39; or &#39;death magic(k)&#39;, known in some popular tales as &#39;death eaters&#39;, or the grim reaper or whatever that thing was in Paranormal Activity, etc etc.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m on the pro-life side of things, pro-rationality, pro-statutory laws that protect minors from the sexual advances of adults, art, peace, consensuality, things like this.  </p>

<p>Hope this sheds some light, good question.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not just gather all interesting and relevant data and paint a picture?</p>

<p>You know what mucks up that process the most?</p>

<p>We have to consider evidence. We often do not know the whole picture. So, we cannot commit to belief nor disbelief honestly. It is easier on the mind to do so, but it leads us away from the bigger picture into tangents into which we are emotionally invested.</p>

<p>So, that they have an interest in putting blood into cement doesn&#39;t mean anything yet. It can be used as a support for speculations, but this thread doesn&#39;t seem to be worth examining too much at this time. It has plausible explanations and nothing to contradict them yet. </p>

<p>So, it is what it is. It is foolish to make conclusions with incomplete evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is the photo of the water bottle and skull so insanely pixellated? I&#39;m sorry but that is suspicious in and of itself. If you are trying to prove something, don&#39;t take a picture of it that is so pixellated that you can barely even make out that there is a skull and water bottle in the photo, let alone that it&#39;s a child skull, when we all know that everybody has a 12 megapixel camera in their pocket or at least somebody there does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah its all off the roads where it takes knowledge of the scrub land to push movements through. That&#39;s the other part of this. These are all old established routes from cartels yet this is now just kicking off. I get border patrol has a big job but they really seemed to have slipped in the area</p>

<p>also VOP is saying if they were to do what theyve done the past 3 years and try to cover all this area by themselves, they would take atleas 30 years to cover all the land</p>

<p>thats the thing is this area is HUGE. And if cartels have been operating in the area for years they know where all the trails are and where to smuggle drugs or people through. Im sure this has happened all across the border </p>
