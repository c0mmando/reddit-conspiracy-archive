    <div class="md"><p>Honest questions. Aren&#39;t there other considerations? Is federal law enforcement allowed to pull state driver&#39;s license info without a warrant? Because they are allowed to pull personal info from Facebook without a warrant if they use a shell company set up as an ad partner right? We don&#39;t have fingerprints on our driver&#39;s license here. If law enforcement, federal or local, don&#39;t like what you are doing on social media they still need a warrant to pull your personal info from the DMV don&#39;t they? </p>

<p>Anyway, despite any of the above concerns wasn&#39;t there a scandal a couple weeks ago where Facebook had sold personal info to China? User data doesn&#39;t just get sold to U.S. loyal corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they can pull drivers licenses without a warrant. Me and my associates were the target of an organized crime investigation in 2014 and since then I’ve slowly been pouring over the court documents and discovered a lot . They used IMSI catchers on us, without a warrant, pulled DL without a warrant , placed listening devices in our condos with a “sneak and peek” warrant . They came in, 1 months before the raids, found all drugs and money, took pictures of everything , took small 1 gram samples of all drugs, weighed all drugs , then left . Then 1 week later came back and re weighed all drugs to find out how much we were moving , then left . They did this process twice , the first time putting the listening devices in, and also 2 months before all of this they came in and placed hidden motion activated video cameras in the hallways (in the exit signs) without a warrant , because it was considered a common area , and all they needed was permission from property management. The cameras were facing our doors , making sure not to see into the apartment . Whenever we came and went they would be activated . They also would follow us not by waiting outside for us , but by using these cameras plus the results from the IMSI catchers on our throwaway phones to find our new numbers. They then had a warrant from the telecom provider , in their own wire room, not relying on the company . They would simply watch where we went, flood the area with unmarked cars, when they found us , follow us around for bit , take pics, then pull off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since I am not a viable organ donor anymore due to surviving breast cancer, and I am over 60, and I have certain health issues that are not being addressed, I went ahead and did DNA testing. It has been extremely helpful! Another benefit is finding and contacting about a dozen 3rd cousins, and seeing online hundreds more 4th cousins and up. </p>

<p>I do not recommend DNA testing for people under 60 since certain findings can be held against you by insurance companies. DNA is also used to find organ donor matches for wealthy people who are willing to pay for healthy organs. This is what human evolution has come to, imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, considering everyone born in a hospital has their footprints taken directly after birth, any government employee, any military employee, any contractor hired to work on military jobs, healthcare workers, childcare workers and anyone accepting any job that requires a detailed background check, on top of everyone who has ever been arrested for any reason, has been fingerprinted and are in the system. </p>

<p>Based on this, I would say that the Government has more than enough people to frame for murders...I don&#39;t think they needed Facebook and fingerprint recognizers on phones for help with that. </p>
