       The growers in California are being controlled by the cartels and are charged a “tax” for protection. The cartels are not happy about the legalization of cannbis. A large warehouse complex in California is a massive cannabis grow by the cartels.  When you get close to these warehouses large black suvs will chase you down. What’s in your area?

       It’s a local thing. I certainly don’t mind driving out and taking photos and videos. I understand your interest and I appreciate it. I’m a 48 year old 80’s kid that was a thrasher, stoner and rebel.

       At my age though I’m looking for the hipocracy in our local government.

       I’ve just received this:
      </p>
      <p>
       My nephew said, “yes it's a Full State legal grow! Security is very high for those places! Each plant all places are inspected by The marijuana division! Each plant has a bar code and is tracked from seed to sale!“
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll try to keep this thread interesting.

       He's right. It's mostly in certain areas....up north by like Redding and Weed there's a lot of cartel grows. I'm sure there's a bunch in the central valley. This isn't new; this has been happening for a long time.

       Here's a newsweek article, if that's good enough 'evidence' for you, but really anyone in the Marijuana business in California knows about this. (source: used to be in the MMJ industry in California):

       I agree! As I was being sent the info this morning (Randomly) I then recalled knowing about this (Oddly) by being told by the son of a an older grower (Now since dead) but I immediately recalled the location (Maybe I'm aware of this in 06?) so she has sent me map images and yep, this is not new even here in Riverbank.

       It is known that cartels were (and probably still are) growing on government land in NorCal. A lot of the stuff there putting into the streets was not very good. Now that legalization is here what do you think they will do? I'm going to go with what op is saying as true but that is just my opinion.

       I live in norcal myself but am surely further south than you. I am on board with what you are saying 100% but must say that of the several growers i personaly know i never heard of this. I have seen and heard of this further borth in the triangle area though. 
Even if you do find out that the place is cartel, out of curiosity, what do you hope to happen moving forward?

       Just curious mostly as it was a random text from a close contact after she spent a long time discussing he location (the person she was discussing this with needed more warehouse space in that location) but none was available for the reasons I’ve mentioned

       California had medical for a long time, is it possible that cartels got involved in the supply chain for what was otherwise up front legit medical dispensaries, running their own grow operations and then extorting new medical and now recreational grow operations?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early days of medical I can see them doing this, but the reach seems limited.  California is a big state -- geography and population, lots of demand and lots of places to run a grow operation that would be very hard to find.  Just the industrial parks of Anaheim alone seem to go on forever.  Ultimately the cartels would face the same problems as the cops -- too much opportunity and space, not enough intel and manpower.

       I live in the Chicago suburbs so the idea cartels control weed, heroin, benzos, even adderal for that matter, is an accepted fact.  I strongly believe the reason we have ridiculous entry barriers to medical marijuana, staunch opposition to legalization, and growing support for banning kratom is that the cartels have opened their wallets to Chicago, suburban, and collar county politicians. We don't need to see black SUV's chasing us down, this shit is in the open.

       I agree. You are sitting near a time bomb. One suggestion, though, is please be safe. You can be made to like lime an accident, or even worse a participant or a guilty party, with a blink of their eye.

       Be safe, you are doing good work but please dont let them know who you are or where you are. Ive seen enough of their reach to know you are in harms way.

       No they arent but that isnt OPs point. The same cartels that are from Mexico have branches everywhere. And they are the same as cartels in Mexico. They have the same power, authority, and wield the same, if not more, influence here as they do in Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not talking about Chicago gangs, I am talking about Mexican cartels in Chicago. Read a bit, maybe do some research, shit is bad here. Chicago is the heart of yhe heroin highway. I cant buy a quarter of weed without being worried ot is cartel shit.

       Chicago is under cartel control, not gang control. If you dont know what you are talking about maybe do a little research before posting.

       I have done the research, but it is you trying to push a narrative. Wake up.. Trump and the CIA are just as guilty. Decriminalize drugs and make it a mental health issue. Stop trying to push some stupid shit about Mexicans controlling the US. If you only put as much effort into Israeli influence in American politics.

       You know the sale "flavors" brand wax and flower and a lot of the  Northern California medical marijuana stores. They are a  Pretty popular brand up their. So that's kinda to much  attention from them to be cartel no?  I mean they have to have all there  Legal paper work and cards/  permits to even have there  Products sold in a  Medical marijuana shop.. just my 2 cents

       The cartels do run out here. They do big grows near the sloughs off highway 4, smaller grows in houses throughout stockton. There was a kid shot and killed almost a year ago, an older family member took him out there to rob the grow  and they killed him. I live extremely close to monte diable, you definitely dont go on the otherside of I5 near louis park if you dont need to. I have family out there too.

       It needs to be legal federally to effectively fight their involvement. It's much easier to grow in these states and ship the extra stuff out of state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its unfortunate but true. I don't need to live in CA to believe this.. the people questioning this confuse me. With organized crime intelligence, money, etc. why so hard to believe they cant get into the legal business or grow under the radar in legal states?

       I wonder how much of this is being subverted by "lone gunman" individual smugglers.  A 1 gram vaporizer cartridge can last a low-level recreational smoker a month, call it equal to an 1/8 of quality flower.  If some guy goes to a legal state and brings home 10 vape carts for himself and friends, he's now undermining the value of cartel smuggling, and its simpler and lower risk than flower due to the compact and low odor nature of concentrates.  And a LOT of people visit legal states, lots of people I know in my non-legal, non-bordering-legal state have vapes or edibles from legal states brought back by friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had to hazard a guess, a lot of leakage from legal states is this kind of "tourist souvenir" exfiltration.

       I would tend to agree with you about the vape pens and edibles, although those may actually be arguably easier for cartels to get into. The thing is theyre getting involved in the industry both above the board and below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legalization is hurting their ability to maximize profits off marijuana sales, dont doubt that. That said they just innovate and the point of the OP I think, is that they are deep into the industry than people may want to think or see.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ONLY answer is make everything above the board and regulated because otherwise there's always gonna be major revenue for them off it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you should look into those carts, while they are great and I like to keep a couple around, they also are easy to make from waste material.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is a little research would lead anyone to the conclusion that we are not at the point where the cartels and organized crime is taking a hit from legal states. I've always heard the black market options, legal state or not, are way cheaper. People are gonna stick with their dealers if they had a decent dealer. Thankfully for people youre talking about; non-frequent smokers legalization makes things safer/feel safer and they are probably least likely to get stuff that the DTO had a hand in moving around.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Lone Gunman" types arent making a dent in shit though, although their tons and tons of them. Thing is, how can someone know theyre not getting stuff they supplied to whoever theyre getting these things from.
      </p>
      <p>
       LAST, people need to be careful as fuck in illegal states taking edibles or puffing vape carts that they didnt make themselves or trust the dealer to not be getting really cheap carts. You dont want cheap concentrates of any type.

      <p>
       I've never understood this.  Some people must be enjoying the most optimistic version of "decent dealer" ever, because for most people "decent dealer" means a guy who
       <em>
        usually
       </em>
       has decent bags of one kind of bud that weigh out and aren't at the maximum black market price and can be gotten ahold of and the transaction concluded within 36 hours, all without scaring your neighbors or having to hang out at his place with his stoner friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would trade that reliable-but-annoying setup for 3-4x price increases if got me the high-line shops you find in California and Colorado with massive selection, consistent pricing and quality and normal business hours.  I mean fuck capitalism, but it's done some magical shit with pot in legal states.

       I just realized that going to another state and seeing prices drop big time housing is 25% the cost.  Time to grow weed somewhere else in the country

       That's not exactly unique to CA. There are global and historical agendas. The attack on the middle class began before we were born. The war on the working poor never stopped.

       I grew up near there &amp; things have really changed! Weed was grown by locals and there was very little violence and the cops kinda looked the other way. If u were hiking &amp; came across a patch no big deal unless u stole from it!  I knew some of the big time growers &amp; they were no problem! Now we constantly have mexican grows &amp; they dont care if they poison the streams or the people working for them!  Very sad situation!
