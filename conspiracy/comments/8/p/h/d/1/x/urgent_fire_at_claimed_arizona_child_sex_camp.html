        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is happening as you read this.</p>

<p>Approximately 4 hours ago from the time this post was made, a large fire had broken out at the same exact location of the claimed child sex camp in Arizona.</p>

<p>Whether you believe in it or not, this is incredibly odd. From an unknown source, pictures have been taken of the surrounding area. Additionally, a skull what seems to be the size of a child&#39;s has been found in this area.</p>

<p>The smoke from the fire can be seen here - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5QmczUg.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/5QmczUg.jpg</a></p>

<p>The military aircraft picture taken here - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/J8qZOHA.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/J8qZOHA.jpg</a></p>

<p>These helicopters were identified as HH-60Gs. Picture of HH-60G.</p>

<p>Road blocked off - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/x2Ltob9.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/x2Ltob9.jpg</a></p>

<p>A leash with oxidized blood was found at the scene - <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Mvm2sXy.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/Mvm2sXy.jpg</a></p>

<p>There are NO EMTs or firetrucks anywhere. There are only police.</p>

<p>They are burning the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>On Thursday, June 7, 2018, at about 1:30 p.m., Pima County Search and Rescue and Patrol deputies responded to a report of human remains found in a remote desert location near Manville Road. Upon arrival, deputies were led to a human skull. Deputies collected the remains and conducted a thorough search of the area. No other human remains were discovered and the skull was transported to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner – Forensic Science Center. The medical examiner was able to determine it was the skull of an adult.  According to Humaneborders.info, at least 40 migrants’ remains have been collected in remote areas of Pima County, such as this one, since the beginning of the year.  The Pima County Sheriff’s Department responds to and investigates all calls and *</em>would urge the public not to continue to call our department, or the 9-1-1 system, to report instances which have already been reported, as this can flood our reporting system and delay vital responses to emergency situations.** Anyone with information about a crime in progress, or with an emergency, is urged to call 9-1-1.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I was joking.</p>

<p>If you compare that akull to an adult skull, or that of a teenager, you can see the differences and similarities. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t that hard to read, compare and contrast, and make an inference. The skull top is just too short to be that of an adult. I admit, I am no expert, not even close. However, I am intelligent enough to read text, look at pictures, and decipher what I see.</p>

<p>Of course it&#39;s an adult skull, if it had been listed as a child&#39;s skull, or even a teenager, the speculation would be maddening. </p>

<p>Anyway, take a little time to do your own research. Who knows what conclusions you will come up with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am, thanks. But let&#39;s get real. Kicking a skull that has been exposed to the elements is going to change what? This wasn&#39;t a murder scene, it was a body dump. There is no fingerprints or DNA or fiber evidence that will be disturbed or destroyed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh. Ok. Well since evidence integrity isn’t important let’s discuss a different issue you’ve now raised.</p>

<p>So they thought it was a dead child’s skull and they care so much about these children that they kicked it around. So now they show a lack of respect for the dead “kids” they care so much about.</p>

<p>Kinda kills the “good guy” narrative, huh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If they really believed it was true AND had an ounce of common sense they’d have just taken video and reported it immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m just gonna jump in here and say I&#39;m a little baffled as well. I&#39;m just an average joe but I would have thought a guy who was supposedly a Navy seal (if I heard the story right) would have had the smarts not to blast this shit on YouTube until he had found some serious solid evidence that was the authorities absolutely could not ignore. I haven&#39;t followed too close and I did see where he said he took some vids from a hide (which I think he pointed out to the camera which is another wtf?) but I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t go full ninja and set the place up for surveillance to try and catch them in the act and maybe at least save some kids or even be more patient and map out more of the network. Making a big scene the way he has just chases any trafficking operation into the weeds. The low level bad guys will set up shop somewhere else and the higher ups will cut loose. Hoping there is something I&#39;m missing or something has actually happened as far as gathering evidence and tracking bad guys higher up the chain and this is just a big feint for the cameras and a bit of a psy-op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wtf? I read your article and skimmed a few others and it seems I did get the story wrong, he&#39;s not a SEAL or a vet. So this dude in the vids founded and leads a group called Veterans on Patrol and he&#39;s not even a veteran? Honestly, that&#39;s a bit of a warning flag for me right there. Even if he isn&#39;t a vet, there are a bunch of vets in his group including, again if I&#39;m not mistaken, a Navy SEAL and a firefighter that were in another video or interview with a news channel. Between a SEAL and a firefighter one of them should have know a little something about gathering intelligence and running a stake out and how to properly handle evidence. So again, I&#39;m even less impressed with this main dude Michael Meyer Lewis. This is serious shit you don&#39;t just wing it. He should have consulted with dudes in his group or someone else with expertise or even just spent a few hours googling how to do some of this shit a little tighter. As it stands, if everything is what he claims it is, I can&#39;t imagine he didn&#39;t royally fuck things up, but what the hell do I know.</p>

<p>It now being on fire is very suspicious and sort of confirms it for me, still have to stay neutral until more is known.</p>

<p>Have you see the video of the camp site? It really looks suspicious as well, people say it could be a homeless shelter but there are trees with restraints nailed into them.... It really looked like a place used to tie up humans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I got interested in Child Sex Ring conspiracies with &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;.</p>

<p>I think it is insane to think that people in positions of power are not abusing that power in many, many ways including raping children, most-likely in an organized fashion.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my problem with this:</p>

<p>1 - Fire is a horrible way to destroy evidence.  If the PTB are behind what is happening there and there was actually a child sex ring there why burn it when some back hoes and some barrels of acid would do the job much better.</p>

<p>2 - Why, the fuck, would the PTB have a child sex camp in some run-down old shitty place that looks like a hobo camp?</p>

<p>3 - What proof is there that there is blood on that oxidized leash?  What proof is there that that skull is actually from there?  You can put all these unsourced pictures together to create a picture but I want verifiable proof.</p>

<p>Honestly, I keep going back to the idea that the people who are coordinating kidnapping/abuse/torture of children would not need to do so at some dump tent camp.  These people have power and money the rest of us can&#39;t even imagine, why wouldn&#39;t they rape children in secure, comfortable bunkers or whatever?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the PTB have the power to cordon off the area, set fires and order a helicopter patrol but still have to setup a shanty town to house children like some sort of perverted underground railroad?</p>

<p>As for where they come from?  Kidnapping like Johnny Gosch and people who turn their own children over for it.  None of this needs a make-shift tent camp with tons of shoes and trash left around.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually happening and it is more sophisticated than this, which is why I think it&#39;s just another op to both distract would-be internet detectives as well as to discredit actual investigation into child sex rings.</p>

<p>If they coined the term conspiracy theorist to delegitimize us I can absolutely see them feeding us nonsense like this and #pizzagate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to shed some light.  People who cross the border do so with coyotes. The coyotes work for the cartels.  When these people come here they are subject to horrible conditions. Rape, robbery, assault etc. </p>

<p>If someone coming here illegally cannot pay (sometimes the cartel raises the rate mid way) they become slaves for the cartels.</p>

<p>The encampment was likely a cartel shortstay.  </p>

<p>Cartels pay off police and government officials.  </p>

<p>The encampment was remote but it wasn&#39;t 100s of miles from civilization. Meaning the encampment was likely known by people inside law enforcement and or local government.</p>

<p>Those peoplease likely turned a blind eye because they were on cartel pay roll.</p>

<p>Nothing I said is far fetched and everything I said has proven to be true at some point in recent history.</p>

<p>2 - Why, the fuck, would the PTB have a child sex camp in some run-down old shitty place that looks like a hobo camp?</p>

<p>Honestly, I keep going back to the idea that the people who are coordinating kidnapping/abuse/torture of children would not need to do so at some dump tent camp.  These people have power and money the rest of us can&#39;t even imagine, why wouldn&#39;t they rape children in secure, comfortable bunkers or whatever?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to have been a waypoint for border-crossing sex traffickers. The victims would do on to other locations where they would be sold and/or pimped. Sometimes traffickers rape the victims to break them down psychologically (and because traffickers are among the worst of humanity.) It&#39;s very profitable, and just like cocaine trafficking, it&#39;s likely that rogue elements in our govt are involved or getting paid to look the other way. </p>

<p>Their “stock” in this case, however, just so happens to be <em>actual children</em> - a “stock” that I don’t imagine is quite as easy to illegally house and store and transfer around from place to place as actual illicit substances.  Even though I don’t doubt that there are likely other more high end locations that illegally house this type of “stock”, I personally don’t think this location somehow invalidates the possibility of it being some sort of temporary transfer location just because it’s in the middle of the woods.</p>

<p>In response to your second statement, what I said above still very much applies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The supply line is often quite complicated and circuitous, and almost always <em>does</em> in fact go through quite socioeconomically poor channels before getting into the hands of the rich.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t always the case, of course, but it is in fact the case often enough to not invalidate the possibility that this particular location in Arizona was in fact a spot where illegal pedophilia-related activity was taking place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that evidence in this VOP situation is &quot;sketchy&quot; at best. At the same time, the, um, &quot;proving grounds/training sites&quot; are maybe not very likely to be &quot;comfortable&quot;. It costs money to keep a comfortable environment and this sh!t is about MAKING money. ROI and all that. Also, depravation and degradation are key elements of establishing absolute control and re-forming the subject/s into what is &quot;required&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m barely following this, but to play devil&#39;s advocate:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 - Fire is a horrible way to destroy evidence. If there was actually a child sex ring there and the PTB are behind it why burn it when some back hoes and some barrels of acid would do the job much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because fire is a lot more &quot;explainable&quot; than backfilling the entire area or melting things with acid.  With fire you can just say &quot;it was just a brush fire that got out of control&quot; and release that info to news outlets, etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 - Why, the fuck, would the PTB have a child sex camp in some run-down old shitty place that looks like a hobo camp?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They wouldn&#39;t, but some mexicans that knew there was a thriving industry for child sex trafficking would to make money, and TPTB might not want evidence out there that could bring attention to the subject or possibly even evidence that led directly to them as customers. </p>

<p>Think of it this way:  very powerful people probably do coke on occassion, do you think they&#39;d be running their own drug running business from mexico or do you think they&#39;d just buy it from random suppliers?  Why the hell would you risk actually RUNNING the operation as opposed to just throwing some cash at some random mexicans doing the work for you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 - What proof is there that there is blood on that oxidized leash? What proof is there that that skull is actually from there? You can put all these unsourced pictures together to create a picture but I want verifiable proof.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How exactly would you ever prove a random skull is from a random patch of land in the desert, exactly?  You&#39;re asking for proof, but what proof would actually convince you? </p>

<p>You can draw some assumptions up about it based on correlating evidence.....i can&#39;t imagine finding fresh human skulls in the wilderness is at all common anywhere in the united states, so 30 miles radius is really not that insignificant in my eyes, especially when you consider these camps are from people who trekked there from mexico, so obviously they leave behind evidence on their way there.</p>

<p>I said many ways.  I think we have very few people in positions of power who aren&#39;t abusing that power.  One of those ways is absolutely child sex rings.  See: Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>AKDKDontAskDontTell says &quot;What if the sun fades it?&quot;</p>

<p>A discussion is formed to answer his question and you think it&#39;s all TinderDoms idea despite the fact you&#39;re what I assume is a functioning human with two eyes and a brain. </p>

This guy is in every thread causing arguments and leaving shitty non contributory comments. So yeah I&#39;m going to jump all over him when he says something stupid. If he can dish it out surely he is big enough to handle it back? Though apparently not being as he is choosing to ignore my facts in place of his falsehoods and misinformation. Telling. Also I&#39;ve been instadownvoted one every comment I have made since talking to him, very telling indeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Context you silly biscuit context. Just because you read something wrong and out of context isn&#39;t my fault it&#39;s your parents for raising an absent minded child. But again here we are people, we have a bunch of users here who are trying to cause petty arguments over tiny details irrelevant to the point. You guys really suck because we all see it. r/conspiracy is what all the other conspiracy subreddits look to for examples of shills and parrots. That&#39;s what this sub is now. So you can nit pick and throw insults all you want but it isn&#39;t going to work here. If you are a shill, you are scum if you are a parrot you are just another dumbass making the same noises as every other parrot just to feel safe.</p>

<p>Now for most of the fucking shill accusations, it mostly just shows how people like you think. I&#39;m a dutch guy who&#39;s been reddit for ages now.

    <div class="md"><p>What is more likely?  </p>

<p>An elaborate larp with tons of staged evidence, enough to get police/military involved.  All to frame politicians of child rape just so they can come out and say ‘Nope, wasn’t us’ and with such outlandish claims it would be easily disprovable. </p>

<p>Or, there is actually something seriously fucked up happening here and a small group of active posters are tasked with defending these disgusting people on the internet (which btw makes the posters even worse than them :wave:). </p>

<p>I think an elaborate larp is a lot less believable because if their ‘targets’ truly are innocent, there is no conclusion other than the larpers eventually getting caught staging everything.</p>

<p>Exactly.  TPTB doing some damage control.  This screams pretty loudly in terms of this being a pretty bad and incriminating location.  The possibility of this site being a child sex trafficking spot appear to be more and more probable.</p>

<p>Craig Sawyer mentioned &quot;numerous bottles of brunette hair dye&quot;...<br/>
<em>brunette</em>  </p>

<p><strong>?</strong>  </p>

<p>are we sure the trafficking happens south to north?<br/>
why would you want to dye someone&#39;s hair <em>brunette</em>???  </p>

<p>so the question is: from dark brown to light brown? or from blond to brunette?</p>

<p>we need to get this type of thing up to 90% of what is going on around this sub...</p>

<p>what if its black to brown, so that the trafficked mexican children don&#39;t look mexican?  </p>

<p>what if its blonde to brown to disguise people with blonde hair?  </p>

<p>are there uses of brown hair dye that we would never even think of in a kind of mexican low and dirty kindof jury rigging kludge way?   is there any other fabric-y thing that would need to be recoloured? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just speculation, but if anything, the color wouldn&#39;t really matter, as long as it is something different than the child&#39;s original color.  If someone is looking for a missing kid with blonde hair blue eyes,  it makes them much harder to identify if the hair color is anything but blonde.  Especially with kids who are still growing, as their physical characteristics are changing more frequently than adults.  For example, there are significantly more differences between a picture of me at age 5 vs age 6, compared to age 18 vs age 19.  Just makes it even harder to track them down and identify them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I recall correctly, and haven&#39;t seen this talked about here, but crazy days and nights mentioned that in northern Arizona is where the ex Seattle or Portland cult guy went and is supposedly working with FDRS to run sex camps there.</p>

<p>Part of the connection on cdan was many celebrities going to one of the cities in Arizona for sex therapy only to slip further Northwood to get their freak on.</p>

<p>One of the stories from the cult guy and FDRS was their affinity to bring in Eastern European young women and kids, they would find some young gall they want to pimp out and get her in under special religious waivers and she could bring her &quot;kids&quot;.</p>

<p>This was how they smuggled young women and children to the area in Northern Arizona.</p>

<p>Hair dye is an unusual thing to have unless you are trying to make someone seem like they are someone else&#39;s kids with either the parent or children getting dyed hair. </p>

<p>When I was a little kid my great uncle took me coon hunting. He took me through an old slave cemetery ( in Louisiana). There was a random bone littered here and there. Turns out according to him that slaves were buried shallow, and coyotes dig up the remains, scattering them. It was weird because this was the 80&#39;s and most of those remains were well over 100 yrs old. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link, I&#39;ll check it out. I think I can handle a bit of religous zealotry if the poster below is correct. A lot of people who shutdown when (particularly) Christianity is connected to a fringe/conspiracy video fail to understand that it&#39;s possible to adhere to a relatively strict faith and still have an incredibly open mind. </p>

<p>A perfect example is Rupert Sheldrake who belongs to the church of england, he is a classically trained biologist who got smeared as a pseudoscientist for doing the &#39;wrong&#39; experiments (mostly inexplicable awareness in animals like homing pigeons able to consistently return to their roost after having it moved over 20 miles away while they are in flight). He also recorded dozens of &#39;trialogues&#39; with a chaos mathematician from Santa Cruz California named Ralph Abraham and the late psychedelic adventurer Terence McKenna. Point being he&#39;s the kind of guy that somehow belongs to the church of england and believes the solar system may have a consciousness.</p>

<p>I went a bit off topic but yeah, I&#39;ll check out the video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t think the police are burning evidence out there in the desert.  I wouldn&#39;t doubt, however,  that they might intentionally set a brush fire in order to have authoritative power to deny access of the public (including the veterans group) to the area. Now,  nobody can enter to see anything unless they&#39;re with fire dept. or police.  That might provide enough cover in the chaos for a small group of conspirators to slip in and remove specific pieces of damning evidence.</p>

<p>If police are implicated in this,  it isn&#39;t all of them.  It would be a smaller group within the department which would have to accomplish their cover-up without raising too much suspicion amongst the non-dirty cops. </p>

<p>Doing it during a &quot;wildfire&quot; in which public access is denied and police presence is expected kills two birds with one stone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted that this whole deal smells like a Psy-Op to me as well. This post is total horseshit. The picture is of a skull from 2012, as it is labelled on the FUCKING PICTURE ITSELF. Yet people will come on here in droves, the Q slaves mostly, and swear that this is all a cover-up. My main question about this deal is why has an abandoned camp gotten so much play on here? It is just an abandoned camp, in the middle of the desert. There is absolutely no reason for this to have gotten so big organically. When I posted about it, a guy showed me the Hamilton-68 site that tracks Russian bot accounts. The top thing they were trending was Human Trafficking, Cemex and I think Tuscon was in there. Now, why would Russian bots be trying to push this story?</p>

Showing up for 5 minutes and acting like officer Barbrady isn&#39;t convincing me that they investigated anything. VOP claim to be a group that helps homeless veterans. That means that they have seen homeless camps. They would know what they look like. And regardless of what people think of the skull, it&#39;s still an unidentified dead human being. What does this phyops accomplish if that&#39;s what it is? It&#39;s not on the news. It&#39;s barely on here.

These people clearly are not the intended customers of child trafficking and the fact that a bland hair was found and brown hair dye might mean they abducted American children from Tuscan and did their evil in the dirt camp so this might have nothing to do with child trafficking from Mexico. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re ridiculous. Lol. And it would be a camp that takes kids into Mexico. Why would they need to dye a Mexicans hair brown if they we&#39;re bringing kids north? And phyops&#39; tend to be pushed onto people. This isn&#39;t being pushed. It&#39;s quite the opposite. A lot of people are dismissing it because why? They think he just wants attention? Lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was they wouldn&#39;t need brown hair dye for Mexican children so this probably wasn&#39;t a trafficking camp. The camp was too far from the border. It&#39;s in Tuscan 70 miles away. They found the skull 20 miles away in the desert. All evidence points to this camp being a homeless camp for illegals/pedophiles/rapists. It looks like they abduct American children/women and do their evil in the camp. A brown haired girl would not look as strange walking with a Mexican man so I believe they took the victims out of the camp and possibly sold them. No need to dye their hair if you are going to rape them and kill them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what&#39;s the point of arguing semantics? Are children being used in criminal activities at these camps? Why would it be an issue at all if someone thinks it&#39;s a trafficking camp? Wouldn&#39;t we all find out together if the camps were properly investigated? I happen to believe the boarder has nothing to do with trafficking camps. I think they could be anywhere. It&#39;s not exactly legal to kidnap American children so if a human trafficking industry exists, it&#39;s going to be all over the US and places that are far away from populated areas will be used to hold children until the next move. Why do you feel like a human trafficking camp can only exist by the boarder?</p>

I would take his word for it since he has seen trafficking camps before. He&#39;s even making a movie called &quot;contra land&quot; that will shed light on the industry. The VOP has nothing to do with him but they are an organization that looks for homeless Veterans. So they know what bum camps look like. Have you ever heard of the finders?

    <div class="md"><p>I must not be explaining my position very well. Craig Sawyer said the AZ camp could be a human trafficking camp or a homeless camp. Apparently, the evidence wasn&#39;t definitive enough for him to say and he did visit the camp. I trust Craig but I don&#39;t trust the leadership of VOP because their leader is clearly disturbed. IDK if it&#39;s PTSD or what but the guy keeps looking to his left and right and rarely looks into the camera. Why? Paranoia? I&#39;m sure bad things happened at this camp but it is too far from the border to be a trafficking camp when just 100 meters away is the city of Tuscan. If you are going to traffic children that far, why not get to a safe house? I&#39;m coming out to say that I believe the leader of VOP is disturbed and has undiagnosed problems and I am NOT going to die defending his hill when the evidence doesn&#39;t show the camp to be a human trafficking center. It&#39;s just a homemade camp hidden away to cover up crimes of local evil people. We MUST investigate this camp but VOP damaged any chance of catching those involved in evil. He scared them off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes a lack of physical evidence made him say it&#39;s inconclusive but Sawyer stated that it was his personal opinion that&#39;s it&#39;s a trafficking den. IMO that should justify the investigation. The investigation could uncover more damning evidence. </p>

<p>And what chances did VOP damage? Seriously. What would happen if VOP just left? I know what would happen. Nothing. So they damaged the chances of nothing happening. </p>

<p>Now, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department is asking the public not to continue to call the department, or the 9-1-1 system, to report instances which have already been reported, as this can flood the reporting system and delay vital responses to emergency situations.</p>

<p>Lewis claimed his group discovered a child’s skull. Earlier this week, Lewis claimed his group had discovered a child sex trafficking camp approximately 20 miles away from the location of the skull found on Thursday.</p>

<p>Police investigated Lewis’ claims and determined that his group had merely found an abandoned homeless camp.](<a href="https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2018/06/07/human-remains-located-in-pima-county-desert/">https://arizonadailyindependent.com/2018/06/07/human-remains-located-in-pima-county-desert/</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what&#39;s the point of arguing semantics? Are children being used in criminal activities at these camps? Why would it be an issue at all if someone thinks it&#39;s a trafficking camp? Wouldn&#39;t we all find out together if the camps were properly investigated? I happen to believe the boarder has nothing to do with trafficking camps. I think they could be anywhere. It&#39;s not exactly legal to kidnap American children so if a human trafficking industry exists, it&#39;s going to be all over the US and places that are far away from populated areas will be used to hold children until the next move. Why do you feel like a human trafficking camp can only exist by the boarder?</p>
