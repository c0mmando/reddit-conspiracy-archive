       It just seems that in the past 2 weeks this /r/ has become a spam site for Alex Jones articles.  There are few few comments in them an usually less than 8 upvotes.  Just wondering if anyone else finds this trend troublesome.

       I find it troublesome as well. I consider it spam at this point. There is one person doing it, and from his profile history it's hard to tell if the guy even sleeps. It's just round the clock commenting, trolling, and posting of Prison Planet and Info Wars articles to multiple subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just dilutes all the content here, and yes it is very irritating. I expect people to post articles from those sites in this subreddit, don't get me wrong, I just don't expect them to submit EVERY article from those sites. Half of them aren't even currently relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just one user doing it, and it's the same person that has caused problems in other reddits. You'll notice after we had the 911Truther moderation discussion, he stopped spamming there, because it became against the rules. Now he is doing the exact same thing to this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He can change account names every two weeks, but the characteristics and sensationalism of his headlines and comments are very easy to spot.

       I am not "FemaCamper" from PrisonPlanet Forums. I do have an account there, which for my privacy's sake, I will not disclose here. I appreciate Fema's posts, though, and I wish I could blog like he does.

       Herkimer, You really need to put to rest this obsession with PrisonPlanet, Alex Jones and 9/11 Truth. You feign to disagree with them, so why don't you just take off? Nobody has chained you to Reddit (except your employer: USCENTCOM, of course). Get a fucking life, or admit the truth, you worthless loathsome piece of government refuse!

       I feel the poster's critique, but I don't read those sites other than what I see on here.  I like them and upmod them accordingly, and pretty much think this community comprises a good subreddit.  Just my opinion, but I don't view them as spam.  They are at the forefront of a lot of fresh content regarding the Fed and such.

       I personally have mixed feelings about the submissions, because one one had with out them the /r/ would be a little bit slow, but when I goto the new heading and the first 50-60 stories are from one person from ostensibly one site, I think its cause for concern.  I just made the thread to get an opinion, not to call any one out.

       He also gives little coverage to the big picture.  The root of all evil - central bankers and their global ties.  Obama is relatively unimportant, he'll be gone in 4 years.

       Stop the infighting, hommedumonde, it's getting so damn pathetic... Alex Jones has produced and hosts several movies on the topics you mention on his websites. He usually has economist Bob Chapman on at least once a week to discuss these facts about the bankers. Now if you actually spent less time backstabbing others, we might make some more progress with this movement.

       Just for the record, I've downvoted very few of your submissions.  I also am not from digg, or a member of an organized interent group.  I have however downvoted many of your comments, because hostility and personal attacks are juvenile and in my opinion have no place in an adult discussion.

       You've already been outed as a Bury Brigade member before, cyince. You can't live down that kind of hypocrisy. Once a sell-out, always a sell-out.

       As I have said about this person in the past, he not only attacks those that disagree with him, he also attacks those that do not display a sufficient amount of enthusiasm for Alex Jones.

       It demonstrates more than that, for instance, if you have -74 (down from -34) comment karma everything you say must be completely stupid or insane.
