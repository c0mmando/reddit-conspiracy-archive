<p>You suck, you should have never clicked, you&#39;re a normie, your ugly, you will never make it, you will never really figure things out, most others are better than you, got it you POS, you white CISHET male, you tard, you autist, you honkey/beaner/tranny/*igger?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you seeing the reaction from reading the above? </p>

<p>What is the Ego saying right now? How is it reacting to the above? Are you aware of it?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s do it again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re better than everyone else because you are in this sub, you are woke, smarter, intellectually taller, got it all figured out, know what&#39;s really going on, and everyone outside this sub is a sleepwalking normie/zombie who really has no clue and is just wasting oxygen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aware of the reaction? Is the reaction real, actual? Do you have a choice to identify to the reaction or not to? If I called you a POS waste of oxygen, can you let go of the reaction and not reply?</p>

<p>How about this: If I told you to imagine a fancy 5 star 5 course meal from one of the best chefs in the world, all laid out in front of you; lobsters, steak, duck, deserts, fruits, gold flake covered raspberry chocolate mousse with a 500 year old glass of wine, you have it all imagined right?</p>

<p>Now can you actually eat or fill your actual stomach with what was just imagined? Or is it simply a day dream, imagined?</p>

<p>Just like how you thought about an illusory dinner that isn&#39;t real, so too, whatever you think about yourself, whoever you think you are, is also not real. That &quot;imagined&quot; fake reality, and all of its programmed reactions, is the &quot;ego&quot; and its not even real</p>

<p>Kind of confused a little by it, to be honest. My ego didn&#39;t care when I read the first paragraph (when you said I suck, etc.). It didn&#39;t bother me and I didn&#39;t want to retaliate. So what does that say about me and my ego? (Am I a robot?) LOL!</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; this post and understand it. Maybe I&#39;m slow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but a necessary component of consciousness in this particular experience. The goal is to merge/integrate the ego with awakened consciousness, not to &quot;get rid of it&quot;.</p>

<p>It is simply a function of consciousness that slows the awakening process and allows for the identification with a particular self. This allows for the soul to merge into its formed personality and learn how to play on ALL levels (without being autistic). Earth is a training ground for Masters and we play with Christ/Luciferian/Saturn/Moon/Sun/AI/AntiChrist/Holy/Un-Whole/Yin/Yang functions of the same consciousness that simply desires to KNOW THYSELF. Just existing/playing inside of a dualistic masterpeice as a vacation from 5th dimensional reality ;) </p>

<p>Some degree of <em>perceived</em> separation is necessary and healthy for us to experience certain ways of Life. Hence the Ego is like a time-keeper/gate keeper to your own inner power, which will be received as one is ready. </p>

<p>We are the greatest ideas playing the greatest game ever conceived by an Infinite Mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You decide what is. Once you realize you&#39;re ALREADY LIBERATED, most decide to come right back to the maze of Matrix consciousness, as they see how it&#39;s just an elaborate game. The goal then becomes to awaken others to the point where we can &quot;Wield&quot; the &quot;Matrix&quot; and literally be programmers of our own realm, like training wheels for quantum consciousness. The &quot;SEEK ENLIGHTENMENT TO AVOID REINCARNATION&quot; Is an ego game. You are God playing yourself. As soon as you realize &quot;You&quot; designed the whole game, the whole matrix, the whole shindig, you realize the gift of where you are at right NOW and the amazing progression/evolution/convolution of consciousness that brought us HERE. You even see Fluoride and Chemtrails as blessings ;) Awakening too quickly ruins certain experiences of the game, and certain things slow down this natural expansion; everything has its place. </p>

<p>Psychedelics can awaken all sorts of higher awareness, but your ego doesn&#39;t know how to organize it within its dualistic point of view. We are learning how to be anchored with 5th dimensional awareness (unity), while still playing within 3rd/4th dimensional perceptions and illusions (ego/personality perspective). We are learning how to be both the Actor and Director in One vessel. Being Human is a Master&#39;s Game :) </p>
