Craig Sawyer of Vets for Child Rescue, Jun 04, 2018
- He was initially told there were children in the container and Veterans On Patrol (VOP) needed help until LE could get there - this was incorrect.
- He visited the site. When he arrived, VOP were at a gas station notifying TPD. TPD took their statements and left.
- Septic tank, very well hidden. Looked inside - hot, no ventilation, one small hole to enter, small children could not get out by themselves, if they screaming no one could hear them
- People there thought no parent would put their kids in their willingly. Not humane or comfortable. Sleeping above ground in the camp would be more comfortable.
- Children&#39;s items inside - small set of drawers for clothing, child-sized stuff, children&#39;s clothing, a fork that might have DNA on it, a girl&#39;s earring, long chain like a dog chain with a padlock, Lucky Charms cereal. Sawyer and volunteers concluded whether it was campers, homeless, or traffickers, there definitely were children kept in the container.
- Around the site (in the middle of the woods): Numerous boxes of brunette hair dye.
- Group of trees with shielding and curtains with numerous pieces of firehose nailed in a loop fashion, looked like wrist restraints according to Sawyer. Numerous other nylon ropes, straps, and other strapping materials nailed to and tied around trees from about knee high up to about 8 feet up and down the trees. Small logs and sticks were tied across two trees, and another like a handle tied to a tree at a 4-foot height. Sawyer concluded it was a rape tree.
- Tug line with rubber handles that you can pull on from the &quot;small grove of rape trees&quot; to what he thinks is a guard position outside, allowing a guard outside to notify someone inside.
- &quot;It looked creepy but we&#39;re not saying that it&#39;s a rape camp. We&#39;re just saying that it bears closer scrutiny and investigation.&quot;
- Other: Sex lube, children&#39;s toys, Barbie dolls, little girls&#39; bracelets, rock collections. &quot;Children were kept there pretty extensively no matter what it was used for.&quot;
- Another veteran said it looks like Al Quada ratlines in Africa, a stop where they refuel with water and food, and lay up for the day and then they move again at night, or vice versa depending on what time of year it is. Except they don&#39;t see rape trees in Africa.
- Border patrol say that human traffickers sometimes tie people to trees, hang their underwear on the trees, and use the trees to hold people still while they rape them.
- The location is right up I-19 from the border.
- Initially LE was not inclined to give it any serious scrutiny. There is a wealth of forensic and DNA evidence. Sawyer notified the FBI and asked them to investigate.
- Background: Sawyer founded Veterans For Child Rescue in 2017 to raise awareness about child sex slavery, rescue victims, and put child sex traffickers behind bars. Working with other veterans and police departments, he uses his military experience to run covert operations across the country, according to the organization&#39;s website.</p>

Jun 01, 2018
Video 1
- Dani Ward, a volunteer with VOP, reports a lot of children&#39;s toys and clothing, a child&#39;s kitchenette, children&#39;s luggage, backpacks. Video shows a Barbie doll. Ward says there are restraints that look like they are for small people.
- Reporter says / video shows that there are many straps holding wooden structures in place.
- Reporter describes bunker. Reporter describes / video shows piece of wood camouflaging the bunker with &quot;Hello Maddie&quot; written underneath.
- Ward says she thinks the bunker is to keep children in captivity. 
- Reporter says it could be used to get out of the heat and sleep.
- Reporter/video shows handmade ladder going up a tree, probably a lookout.
- Lewis Arthur, founder of VOP, talking to policeman says there are different car seats, strollers, a comb with blonde hair that looks like it&#39;s from a little girl. He says there is evidence they were working on extending the camp or bunker to a second location. 
- Reporter says TPD was out there &quot;several hours&quot; taking pictures, and they say they will hand info over to detectives.
Video 2
- VOP was looking for homeless veterans when they came across this camp.
- It has a mirror and a table with shaving cream, flea and tick shampoo, roach and ant killer, and area behind that where people probably slept.
- Ward notes that the bunker had an entrance only a child could fit into. Video shows her next to a container of CVS Easy Fiber.
- Video shows a baby play pen filled with rubbish.</p>

<p>Was the first site bulldozed?</p>

<p>There it is again. Liberals talking like they are spokesmen. How do you know what everyone thinks? You liberals all keep talking like you are in a room full of people. So many comments with &#39;we&#39; in it, too. It&#39;s bizarre. Watch the comments and you will see the trend. I see it on just about every social media site. And the only people that I see saying things like this are liberals. Are you a borg collective?</p>

<p>Anybody else notice this?</p>

<p>The person above you literally joked about it. &quot;No one thinks those subjects are funny...&quot; Well, obviously he did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. And umm, lol, who is the liberal you&#39;re referring to? Making quite a few assumptions about me there champ. Don&#39;t recall claiming I was a spokesman for anything. </p>

<p>Borg collective? Bahaha, have you ever visited the_donald? Now there&#39;s your hive mind if I&#39;ve ever seen one. However unlike you, I&#39;m not gonna assume what your political position is. Maybe, just maybe, you&#39;ve never seen that sub before....</p>

<p>Yes. You&#39;re 100% correct. Only liberals could possibly ever use the word &quot;we&quot; in a sentence. </p>

<p>Funny, I can&#39;t speak for anyone apparently but you&#39;re claiming to know what was in that person&#39;s heart when they made a joke.  </p>

<p>The way I read it, the joke they were making was about the astounding lack of evidence and ridiculous leaps people are making. </p>

<p>Anyone that thinks literal child rape is funny is a piece of shit. Okay so I&#39;ll change it from &quot;everyone&quot; to &quot;most decent people&quot;. You&#39;re right, I can&#39;t speak on behalf of everyone. </p>

<p>Most decent people don&#39;t find those subjects, or the fact that they do happen, funny. I certainly don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Some people, however, find this whole Tuscon, Hilary, Obama, Cemex crap to be ridiculous and are voicing that opinion, sometimes with jokes. </p>

<p>In what way is that phrase intimidating?</p>

<p>I genuinely apologize though if that somehow scared you!</p>

<p>But no, that was in no way meant to be intimidating. Just part of normal reddit discourse.</p>

<p>Because lucky charms was the only evidence found of the presence of children? Yeah, it might look silly if it were just lucky charms. But it wasn&#39;t just lucky charms. And it smacks of a tactic of isolating evidence in order to make it appear as if there is no evidence.</p>

<p>Strange that this comment is down voted. Are we not supposed to &#39;disagree&#39; in the comments section with aspects of a submission? Are we supposed to divide up at the submission level and split the sub at the top level into partisan camps?

<p>I understand you do not believe it, and have enough information to prove it fake in your eyes.

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that did I? I stated that I have no seen enough information one way or another to either confirm or debunk this in it&#39;s entirety. I&#39;m willing to search leads, check info. Honestly, OP&#39;s posts helps me corroborate where certain information is ACTUALLY coming from, down to the video. It&#39;s nice to have timestamps too, but we are working with a lot of video that 70% of users wouldn&#39;t care to delve all the way into due to time constraints, general apathy, or they are positioned in your camp if what appears to be frustration (at others who do not see this as a ruse).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think OP is saying that either, especially since his comments state that he is just compiling the purported &#39;evidence&#39; and statements provided. I don&#39;t think he is directly saying it is evidence being concealed, but that is what is put forward by VOP and thus that is partial information we have on this entire fiasco.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve actually asked for more evidence on the three black SUV&#39;s and bulldozers as well.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a big difference between compiling info, and purposely stating it as fact, and it didn&#39;t appear that OP did that in my opinion. However, opinions are horseshoes and hand grenades.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just took issue with you saying evidence doesn’t come through in a week, since it isn’t more digging that people in the skeptical camp are necessarily asking of the guys there, but honestly just to turn the damn camera around and show the supposed blueprints they found, show the bulldozed site, or footage of it being done, because those types of claims are waaay bigger than the things that have been shown on video, so it sucks to be dragged through the rumor mill when there are people calling themselves the good guys who are right there choosing to show non-damning evidence in brief flashes of video but show nothing of their larger claims. it’s one thing to be patient for more digging, but entirely to the frustration that comes with not being shown that which has supposedly been found</p>

<p>I just dislike people who feel like it&#39;s always cut and dry, because conspiracy is nothing but an offensive rumor mill until it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>My claims were more personal I suppose, your opinion of the matter is similar to mine, I just don&#39;t get as &#39;triggered&#39; for lack of a better word at users who are huffing rumors like a laquerhead. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just like voting fraud. Every time some voting fraud is exposed, the defenders come along and say &#39;this isolated event isn&#39;t proof that voter fraud happens!&#39; Perhaps, but the thousands of &#39;isolated events&#39; do...</p>

<p>In this video, Lewis Arthur of VOP says that their truck blew a tire on I-19 so they searched the area while waiting for help, and they found a spot with lots of empty backpacks (a guy counts 9 but there are lots more). He says there are no homeless people and it is not a homeless camp. Lots of trash. Arthur says it&#39;s a &quot;great turnaround spot&quot; where someone would drop off dope or people. He also notes they&#39;re an hour from the city where the homeless get food and services. He notes they could drop off dope and/or people. When the backpacks are empty, the dope has been picked up or people have changed clothes to &quot;fit in.&quot; He says they have another video that shows a homeless camp for comparison to this coyote camp. He goes to where he thinks a guard would post up away from the camp, then an area they used as a restroom. They keep an eye out for areas that have been dug up previously. He says that they&#39;ve had help to update the skills they&#39;ve learned tracking down homeless camps to find and identify coyote camps. There are old and new backpacks. He shows a lot and lots of shoes. He shows an &quot;old kitchen&quot; with a lot of cans. &quot;No women&#39;s or children&#39;s clothing.&quot; &quot;We&#39;re looking for children, we&#39;ll let [others] get the coyotes.&quot; 30-40 shoes, plus more in bags, heavy movement of coyotes. When they get picked up, they get real shoes. He finds and opens a fresh bag, says the scout probably got scared off. Samsung phone charger, purple comb, small socks &quot;might be for a female,&quot; shirt, extra shoes, graham crackers, Nestle Nutri Rindes, deodorant. He walks past female pink Nikes, says there are female coyotes. There&#39;s a camo vest on the ground. He says the original camp was bulldozed and he has no evidence a cadaver dog went through that site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are not in the wrong for documenting such reported evidence, despite the many active defenders who will seek to attack you on this subreddit. You have made it clear that are compiling info to be assessed, rather than saying &quot;here, this is clear evidence of &#39;x&#39;&quot;.</p>

<p>Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. Much of the evidence against convicted American bomber Timothy McVeigh was circumstantial, for example. Speaking about McVeigh&#39;s trial, University of Michigan law professor Robert Precht said, &quot;Circumstantial evidence can be, and often is much more powerful than direct evidence.&quot; The 2004 murder trial of Scott Peterson was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Indeed, the common metaphor for the strongest possible evidence in any case—the &quot;smoking gun&quot;—is an example of proof based on circumstantial evidence. Similarly, fingerprint evidence, videotapes, sound recordings, photographs, and many other examples of physical evidence that support the drawing of an inference, i.e., circumstantial evidence, are considered very strong possible evidence.</p>

<p>In practice, circumstantial evidence can have an advantage over direct evidence in that it can come from multiple sources that check and reinforce each other. Eyewitness testimony can be inaccurate at times, and many persons have been convicted on the basis of perjured or otherwise mistaken testimony. Thus, strong circumstantial evidence can provide a more reliable basis for a verdict. Circumstantial evidence normally requires a witness, such as the police officer who found the evidence, or an expert who examined it, to lay the foundation for its admission.This witness, sometimes known as the sponsor or the authenticating witness, is giving direct (eye-witness) testimony, and could present credibility problems in the same way that any eye witness does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just did but I&#39;ll slow it down for you so you can understand, plain English clearly wasn&#39;t enough for you but that&#39;s ok I&#39;ll lower myself just this once. The police (the men with guns and handcuffs) have already been asked for a dog (small thing with paws) asking again would get you the same results. Like if you have no dogs in your right hand and no dogs in your left what would that mean? No dogs. So now I have answered twice and dumbed it down you might understand. You are not even discussing you are just asking infantile questions that don&#39;t require an answer, if you were discussing guess what? I&#39;d be discussing to, it&#39;s called opening a dialogue and if you try it you might be surprised. It is difficult to take you seriously when you argue like a child. Hope whatever personal problems that are clearly eating you soon go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk Ron Johnson corroborated the grove thing.. I mean he&#39;s a creepy fuck but it does seem like at least some of what Alex did in the beginning was done earnestly.   </p>

<p>But yeah even his early broadcasts had a weird authoritarian tinge to them despite being a libertarian. I think he was claiming Soros was genetically modifying weed to keep people placated like at least 5 years ago.</p>

<p>And now it&#39;s like he&#39;s jumped the shark completely. Interestingly enough around election time all the liberals jumped the shark also and turned into rabid sjw Marxists, like Abby Martin and her Brother who voted for Ron Paul originally.. It&#39;s like the whole election event was some kind of karmic magnifier.. the same way Walpurgis Nacht was karmically magnified in Puella Magi Madoka Magica.. </p>

<p>Also the dude has a fucking Chiropractor, who claims to be a doctor, selling his supplements and making ridiculous claims about them. Rogan sells supplements to but he funds actual studies, or at least tries to, and doesn&#39;t make AS batshit claims about what he is selling.. maybe a little bro science but on infowars you hear the staff saying shit like &quot;I took one [vitamin] in the morning and I just felt so positive and on my game all day.. better than coffee.&quot; Lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not what he wants. He discussed how the streaming porn algorithms have ironed out a lot of chances for girls, and even listed the ages 24-27 as that grey period where no one would hire them unless they fit in the &#39;Big Ass&#39; category. He interviewed porn directors who are making less money for posting triple the content.</p>

<p>Oh come ON! Cut it with the fucking pretentious bullshit!!</p>

<p>Information property rights are totally false and not a natural right at all and you are at NO material loss if someone copies something you &quot;create.&quot; All that information already exists as white noise anyways.. There is a fucking algo that created every work of literature ever made to but you just have to &quot;find&quot; patterns. So it doesn&#39;t even have to be thought as copying but rather finding the same subtractive path to the specific pattern of zeros. </p>

<p>I ONLY jack it to amateur shit dude.. If it&#39;s produced i literally cannot get hard. LOL. Or I watch the same vids I watched when i was 13 for a little nostalgia action.. NEVER have i even sat through more than a preview&#39;s worth of high fidelity ANCIENT produced fake ass porno. </p>

<p>And one time when i was drunk i paid a cam girl liek 120 bucks... so there&#39;s that. </p>

<p>But yeah dude it&#39;s true people are ashamed about what they watch. But you know what?!?!?!? If BITCOIN and cryptocurrency were less suppressed then maybe people would have to worry about using their credit cards on a porn site or having their adult purchases make it onto a fucking list.</p>

<p>And DUDEEEE fucking girls don&#39;t even have to take off their clothes. They can literally just pose cute CLOTHED selfies on IG and get paid through patreon or gofundme.</p>

<p>It&#39;s LITERALLY never been easier to make money independently especially if you are an attractive woman!! It&#39;s fucking piss easy and authoritarian neoliberal laws like the fucking recent sex law thing and information property laws in general MAKE IT HARDER to make money at home in your underwear using the computer and the internet. Look how the free software foundation and open source have managed to get PAID AND produce a far superior product to windows and apple, IE LINUX!! </p>

<p>And he BLAMES blames blames everyone ELSE for the stupid choices of an individual and advocates for MORE AUTHORITARIANISM!!! NO one likes to be bullied but as long as there are no HATE SPEECH laws or things that they can use to fuck you over like SWATTING then what&#39;s the fucking big deal?!?!?

<p>He interviews a porn director, who states he knows the guy who invented the algorithm.

This isn&#39;t amateur porn, this is the big ones that he is bitching about. They pirate his content and put it on the free sites and the algorithm just spreads them out of range to take down. Should he just shut up about his experience because you jerk to amateur stuff? Did you hear the interview with the kid with extreme autism who cannot interact with females due to his streaming porn addiction? Or maybe the sad fucks who pay hundreds of dollars to get these niche girls to act out fetishes (which I&#39;m assuming is what you&#39;re talking about earlier too).

<p>I watched his other podcast with rogan.. more creepy queefy bullshit, and I think something on vice??? I forget tbqh but i think the latest one he did with rogan is the one where he starts advocating for violence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They pirate his content</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They copy a specific pattern of ones and zeros. OH WOW.. such stealing. Maybe he shouldn&#39;t use such an ANCIENT profit model??!? He could fucking make a patreon or kickstarter if he wanted to.. Plenty of other porn directors do it. BUT GUESS WHAT??!?!?! The fucking market is super fucking saturated!?!??! IF the star isn&#39;t connecting with fans then IP laws wont help either!

<p>You think I&#39;m some kind of fucking DINOSAUR?!?!? I fucking multi task bruh.. if it aint fucking on audio and I can&#39;t do something else at the same time it&#39;s probably not worth knowing about anyway. I live my life in the fast lane bruh. </p>

Some of us actually have more hope than to pray some asshole marxist gets into office and gives you welfare!! Maybe if you bought bitcoin you wouldn&#39;t have to twist your ego into thinking non violent &quot;crimes&quot; are legitimate as a way to fucking COPE!!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen to the actual podcast: The Butterfly Effect. Then come back to me. He doesn&#39;t advocate arrests you whiny baby, he literally interviews the guy who created the algorithm on the first episode and on the last, where he shows him all the information he has dug up.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t give a shit what you interpret from Rogan, and I&#39;m really getting sick of this strawman you&#39;ve built off my interest in Ronson&#39;s books. You hear one fucking sentence and think I&#39;m some leftist goon trying to end your good time. You seriously make the people of this sub look like fools, because they are just going to compare us to you. I&#39;m not giving any more of my time to a vapid ideologue who spews insults as if they are fact lol.</p>

<p>Have a good day dawg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bahahaha u mad?</p>

<p>IF he doesnt want to throw people in cages then why the fuck did he call it &quot;STEALING&quot; and why are you bringing up the kid addicted to porn as a rebuttal to me advocating for technological evolution of media?!?!?!?!?? Complaining implies action unless you got a different solution??? But the traditional solution that we are all accustomed with is throwing people into cages! </p>

<p>Why do you get so fucking butthurt about someone taking your implications literally?!?!?!? I was just fucking shitposting holy shit.. You seem about as queefy as Ronny boy. </p>

<p>Seriously it&#39;s like someone complaining about napster then back peddling when someone asks them &quot;should file sharers go to jail?&quot; And complaining doesn&#39;t get you anywhere. There are more robust solutions to these problems than relying on FRAGILE government... I&#39;ve worked in government.. They can&#39;t accomplish jack shit! New profit models and people taking more personal responsibility is infinitely better. </p>

<p>Also for someone that defends a queef like johnson you sure jumped at the opportunity to SHAME someone for drug use LOL.. As if I would fucking actually touch that shit.. It was fucking hypothetical to illustrate how shitty authoritarianism is... unfortunately I don&#39;t have a fast car either. And I LOVE how viciously you went for that.. I guarantee you would be one of the village people that cheers around the witches who are burnt at the stake!</p>

<p>Yeah if you haven&#39;t noticed this sub has gone to shit. It&#39;s full of marxists and authoritarians that ironically like to complain about the very thing they advocate for.. but they are still under the spell that the proper &quot;side&quot; of authoritarianism will suit them... LOL And it&#39;s full of squares like you that can&#39;t even take a joke and demand fake ass political correctness or use big words just because you think it&#39;s cool to sound pretentious. Fukken lighten up holy fuck. Trust me I literally don&#39;t give a shit. </p>

<p>Lemme guess, your voice sounds like Ron&#39;s?? That&#39;s why you&#39;re so butthurt huh?? Cause you don&#39;t like how i made fun of the way he talks??  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>bahhhhhhh god i&#39;ve wasted like 20 minutes of my time on this holy shit</p>

<p>here is a printed interview where he agrees with VOX calling it &quot;stealing&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/10/6/16435742/jon-ronson-butterfly-effect-internet-free-porn">https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/10/6/16435742/jon-ronson-butterfly-effect-internet-free-porn</a></p>

<p>If you agree with someone calling file SHARING, Stealing, then that literally implies there should be some kind of PUNISHMENT for it.</p>

<p>Vox:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>on these sites like PornHub, which are stealing porn and giving it away for free, have wildly depressed the money available for productions and the fees the performers are able to get, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jon Ronson:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes. So a lot of people are making a lot less money and are working much, much longer hours to make that money. That’s happening a lot. Whereas the people in charge of PornHub are making so much money they don’t know what to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And literally if he wasn&#39;t a tard he would fucking say in the same statement that the old way might be harder but the new ways have made being an independent cam chick WAYYYY easier. And in a fucking super saturated market nonetheless.. turns out a lot of people are willing to fuck on camera. The dude is a luddite, violent, authoritarian QUEEF. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You fucking are so daft that it hurts my head.</p>

<p>I also know you&#39;re purposely being this fucking dumb because you&#39;re aiming to rile me up.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not going to look into farther than the second page of a Google search then you can just stop because I don&#39;t have interest in your lazy research (that you&#39;re not even going to read unless it&#39;s in audio). </p>

<p>Do you even know the name of the man who invented the algorithm? Or what he has to say about it?</p>

<p>Quit using insults and explain your point. He literally says your end part in the last 4 episodes of the god damn podcast.... He literally says what you&#39;re saying but you&#39;re so determined to be as ass that you&#39;re unwilling to look into because you don&#39;t like his voice. That&#39;s the most unbelievable portion of this entire conversation.</p>

<p>He even goes into the niche market, which is why I asked if you knew about the Stamps guy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to listen to your unsubstantiated bullshit if you&#39;re unwilling to listen to a counterpoint. It&#39;s a simple as that dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one compltely ignoring IMPLICATIONS.. As in what should happen to people &quot;STEALING&quot; ones and zeros. </p>

<p>The guy&#39;s name was like fabio or fabrizio or some shit. Look dude, I found a print version of what I was saying and I am like 99 percent that i heard him say the same shit on a podcast. I know he glossed over, I think he called it &quot;bespoke porn (weird way to refer to it)&quot; but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that he was IMPLYING that there should be legal protection for the ancient obsolete dinosaur method. And he&#39;s a giant queef with a creepy whispy pretentious affected way of talking. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>yep still made the implication though</p>

<blockquote>
<p>unsubstantiated bullshit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>dude be mad implicating.. you cant deny that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not an issue of piracy either</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah well piracy is a word made up to be specifically critical like &quot;capitalism,&quot; so yeah it&#39;s not really real. It&#39;s just copying and sharing which is perfectly within someone&#39;s natural rights. But that doesn&#39;t change the fact this dude IMPLIED that there should be some kind of legal action against it. He never argues the TRUE counter point which is that even if there was no benefit from the technology, even if it really just did take money away from honest porn producers, it&#39;s within people&#39;s right to copy and share information.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think information property laws could get out of hand then you are foolish and we have to be ever vigilante about our rights. JUST TODAY there was some horrible news that came which says the EU is going to start going after people who post MEMES because they use copyrighted images originally, fucking BONKERS and they are probably just doing it so they can go after my beloved 4chan. Already they started blocking websites, or threatening to prosecute against websites with cookies if they dont follow their convoluted regulations.  </p>

<p>Check this shiz out:
<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/memes-will-be-banned-under-new-eu-copyright-law-warn-campaigners-11398577">https://news.sky.com/story/memes-will-be-banned-under-new-eu-copyright-law-warn-campaigners-11398577</a></p>

<p>I bet there is a really good chance that the only way people will be able to access 4chan from the EU soon is with a VPN and they will risk being prosecuted against. </p>

<p>It might not go through ofc but it&#39;s creepy as hell.. China does that with their internet and it&#39;s OBVIOUS this is the result of people giving up their freedoms for bullshit carots on a stick like &quot;NET NEUTRALITY.&quot; Laughable people think it would EVER be good to let govs regulate the internet.. </p>

<p>You&#39;re reaching further than a Stretch Armstrong now, grasping for whatever rhetoric you can spit up.

<p>Tribal elders and other men do sexually abuse children in Afghanistan, and other countries. It&#39;s called Bachi Bazi (which I think means &quot;dancing bpys&quot; or something) and it&#39;s really sick. I knew that some local nationals we had interactions with were doing it, and it was always downplayed or ignored by higher-ups who would acknowledge it, but write it off as a &quot;cultural thing.&quot;</p>

<p>A  special forces soldier was disciplined for <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/08/20/army-kicking-out-decorated-green-beret-who-stood-up-for-afghan-rape-victim.html">shoving</a> an Afghan national who he knew was abusing kids and his wife.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have physical evidence, but it&#39;s not hard to find info about how that goes on and gets ignored for the most part. PBS did a whole documentary on it. </p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m a bit skeptical of this Tucson situation. All of the things mentioned in this list could have another explanation, and it&#39;s kind of a logical leap to see a few straps on trees, then to immediately label them &quot;rape trees.&quot; There are also a lot of rumors added to this, like the one about how someone found bloody clothes and a knife; if that&#39;s the case, we all have smart phones, and if it were true those pictures would imply that there are victims of some type of violence, why withold evidence? Scepticism is not always cognitive dissonance, I don&#39;t think that every rumor should be accepted as truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Healthy skepticism is a good thing, and I&#39;d also like to see more of the evidence as better photos, videos, and testimony. That&#39;s why I started documenting what evidence (circumstantial and eyewitness) we have so far. My conclusion is that a much more in-depth investigation is warranted and find it unimaginable to see all this and think &quot;nothing to see here, move along.&quot;</p>

Of course evidence is not proof, and you are free to draw your own conclusions. I tend to think more investigation is needed, declaring the camp as a homeless camp was premature, and the camp should not have been bulldozed before DNA evidence was gathered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the videos show the evidence (circumstantial evidence in this case), and you can see it there for yourself. I did my best to describe succinctly what these few videos depict. If I had more time, I&#39;d add more video details.</p>

<p>Other times there is eyewitness testimony, which of course is subjective and may be inaccurate, as well as the eyewitnesses&#39; own conclusions about what they witnessed. You can decide for yourself whether you find their testimony credible or not, and you can decide whether you agree with their conclusions. My intent here was merely to capture some of the information in an easy to read and reference format.</p>

<p>There were no claims in any of these pieces about elites AFAIK. It is a fact that coyotes help people cross the border into the US, sometimes voluntarily, sometimes not. It is a fact human traffickers move people (mostly women, some children) across the border to be sold in the US. Whether you think this camp was a human trafficker waypoint in cartel territory is your call. Personally I think it&#39;s certainly possible and hope to see more evidence come out.</p>
