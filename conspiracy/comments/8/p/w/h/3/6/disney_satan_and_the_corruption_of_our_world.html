       PLEASE READ THIS AND WATCH THE VIDEOS! WAKE UP!!!
————————————————
      </p>
      <p>
       First Preface: I tried my best to both proofread and use proper punctuation and eloquence in writing this, and also to avoid all redundancies, so I apologize for any and all difficulties in reading it. 😂
      </p>
      <p>
       Second Preface: Over the decades, starting as an admittedly precocious youth (absolutely unattested to by my grades in school, but that’s for another time), I’ve studied with zeal, and eventually with learned objectivity, a lot of weird stuff, and have experienced a lot of weird stuff, both by accident and on purpose, ranging from the quixotic, though utterly mundane, to the luminous and at other times horrific, supernatural; so I say a lot of weird things, and at times probably sound at least ignorant, and as most, ludicrous. But that popular myth, promoted even in academia and  by educated professionals, that states that “crazy” people don’t know that they’re “crazy,” is just not true. Believe me, I’ve spent enough time over the last four years both living and interacting with “crazy” people at the most intimate level and experiencing “craziness” myself in varying degrees, both by drug use (OTC, prescription, and illegal)—at times taken as prescribed and at other times flagrantly abused by alternative ROI and reckless overdosing—and by the unrestrained entertainment of unhealthy, immoral—and at other times mysterious and overwhelming—thoughts and feelings derived from said studies, experiences, and interactions. Eventually, in moments of shared confidence (trust, vulnerability, secrecy, catharsis) we would admit to ourselves and to others that we knew that we were “crazy,” and were cognitively dissident because our thoughts and feelings did not appropriately correspond with reality. This myth persists due to the sometimes irrational and at other times well-deserved fear these individuals have of the standard, Western model of perception of these individuals as being “diseased,” and the subsequent treatment of these individuals with mind-numbing, mood-altering, soul-inhibiting, and often brain-damaging medications, which are at times—as a lesser evil—necessary for symptom relief, but in the long-term ineffective at treating the underlying cause(s) of their problems, which are often spiritual in nature and result from some form of trauma. So these individuals often lie and learn to suffer in silence, not knowing of any spiritual solutions to their suffering. Anyway, here’s an observation I want to share, and you can just ignore it if you want, and think I’m “crazy”, because that really doesn’t bother me. I know I’m not, but I’m compelled to help those who are, and are suffering in silence. Here we go! 😇
—————————————————-
In the alchemical “Great Work,” and in general, the occult, which has been a Biblically forbidden field of study since the dawn of creation, there is a fundamental belief and practice known as “the reconciliation of opposites,” otherwise known as “coincidencia oppositorum.” This is the belief that to achieve “gnosis” or “liberation; enlightenment” one must reconcile all opposites within the microcosm (oneself) and the macrocosm (the universe; creation). This is based on the heretical notion that there is both an absolute evil and an absolute good inherent within all things. Many religions and ancient teachings are founded on this principle, but a modern day example is that of the “Force” in Star Wars, which consists of both a dark side and a light side. The goal of the Jedi is to both study, cultivate, master, and utilize the light side of the Force, and they do this by practicing such virtues such as altruism, sacrifice, temperance, celibacy, and charity, and willing the good of themselves and others; whereas the Sith, and others like themselves, bent on a kind of Faustian pursuit of power through the study, cultivation, mastery, and utilization of the dangerous, manipulative, and ultimately possessive dark side of the Force, have but one goal, that of godhood and dominion, and foster qualities such as hatred, fear, selfishness, and curiosity to gain insight, understanding, and what they half-heartedly believe to be “control” of the dark side of the Force. At times, however, there is suggestion by the Jedi that true mastery of the Force is sought by finding a balance between the dark side and the light. This is not an endeavor sought by individual Jedi or their Sith counterparts, but more of a prophetic nature of the Force itself, which is seen as being morally ambivalent, yet possessing a will of its own. The Jedi obey this will so far is it benefits them, but reserve a certain fear of the overall agenda of the Force itself, seemingly indicating that the Force is not to be trusted in its entirety, but only so far as its benevolence is made manifest in their application of it. The Sith, however, fear not the seemingly diabolical nature of the Force but only their ability not to be entirely destroyed by it—going so far as to welcome total possession of themselves by the dark side of the Force in the hope of gaining absolute power, all the while embracing absolute corruption to the point of murdering their lord in order to inherit lordship themselves until being murdered by a future successor. There is no parallel to this practice among the Jedi.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jedi believe and look forward to the fulfillment of the prophecy of the Force to find absolute balance, whereas their Sith counterparts only acknowledge that there is such a prophecy, and loathe the very idea of such a balance occurring, due to their abhorrence to the light based on their belief in its fundamental weakness in delivering unlimited amounts of power and pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what point am I trying to make by writing all of this? Here it is. The Force, as described above, is not a work of fiction. George Lucas, a life-long student of both Eastern religion and Joseph Campbell (a prominent, twentieth-century expert on world mythology, most notably known for his writings on what he called the “Hero’s Journey,” a summation of the overarching theme he saw in all religions and myths throughout the world), learned about the “Force” from his study of the occult power known in China as “Chi,” Japan as “Ki,” and India as “Prana.” It is studied, cultivated, and used in occult activities such as Reiki, Yoga, and various martial arts such as Tai Chi. Many Westerners are taught that these activities are simply art forms, or exercises. Others, such as natives of these countries who are ACTUALLY initiated by occult adepts into the mysteries of these dark arts, hold no qualms in admitting to the direct participation of demonic spirits in these activities/art forms/exercises/etc.

       It’s no small wonder that Disney has purchased the rights to Star Wars, and is now propagating its occult themes through clothing and other, various forms of media. Disney is deeply involved in the occult, and has incorporated Star Wars into its agenda to subvert Christian values by promoting Masonic teachings such as dualism and magic(k). Don’t believe me? Here’s a video documenting Walt Disney’s high involvement in the occult, being a 33rd degree Freemason and pedophile obsessed by sex, the Devil, and the Illuminati.

       More about the reconciliation of opposites / coincidencia oppositorum and today’s Satanic agenda:
      </p>
      <p>
       Men identifying as women, women identifying as men, and the popular rise of gender-neutrality are by no means accidental. There is, and ever since the Fall of Adam and Eve, has been, a desire to “become as gods.” Genesis 3:5 — A promise made to mankind a long, long time ago that is still being believed today, except with more power and propaganda than EVER before. The sudden explosion of LGBTQ propaganda, which is nothing more than the Satanic obsession to reconcile all opposites, is indicative of the fact that we are living in the End Times, and that both Satan, his angels, and his followers among men, women, and children are fighting harder and faster than ever before because they’re running out of time. Satan and his followers have more power and influence today than they ever have before, and we’re witnessing the final success of the “Great Work” of the Alchemists that was dreamed of so long, long ago in their desire for godhood.

       “Rejecting man-conceived dialects as inadequate and unworthy to perpetuate divine ideas, the Mysteries thus chose symbolism as a far more ingenious and ideal method of preserving their transcendental knowledge. In a single figure a symbol may both reveal and conceal, for to the wise the subject of the symbol is obvious, while to the ignorant the figure remains inscrutable. Hence, he who seeks to unveil the secret doctrine of antiquity must search for that doctrine not upon the open pages of books which might fall into the hands of the unworthy but in the place where it was originally concealed.” Secret Teachings of All Ages p. 38

       “The Baphomet is a mystical figure known in many esoteric and occult circles. A creature with a goats head, androgynous human body and a phallus that is actually the caduceus often linked with the symbol for the medical profession. This figure is claimed to have several different purposes, dating back to the times of the Knights Templar and the Crusades in the 11th century, all the way to the Church of Satan today.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The LGBTQ movement is all about turning us all into Baphomet.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Baphomet is said to symbolize the ‘union of opposites.’ As represented in the image above, drawn by black magic practitioner Eliphas Levi (whose name is on the bottom), there is the image of a light moon and a dark moon. The positioning of its hands are also in opposite directions representing the motto “as above, so below.”  All these sayings and symbols point to the what is known as the “Secret doctrine” which is the union of the gods with humanity. The fusion of the “sacred feminine” and the masculine is nothing more than the desire on the part of occultists for the return of the “gods” to Earth to once again mate with human women, a topic covered in great detail in our article on the Nephilim of Genesis Chapter 6 of the Bible. This ancient secret could not be discussed and has been passed on through symbols for centuries. The Baphomet thus became seen as a “Father of wisdom” and liberator of the spirit to those who were initiated.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “Anton LaVey, founder of the church of Satan, provides a very succinct explanation (as cited on an excellent blog explaining Baphomet in detail):
      </p>
      <p>
       “The symbol of Baphomet was used by the Knights Templar to represent Satan. Through the ages this symbol has been called by many different names. Among these are: The Goat of Mendes, The Goat of a Thousand Young, The Black Goat, The Judas Goat, and perhaps the most appropriately, The Scapegoat.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Baphomet represents the Powers of Darkness combined with the generative fertility of the goat. In its “pure” form the pentagram is shown encompassing the figure of a man in the five points of the star – three points up, two pointing down – symbolizing man’s spiritual nature. In Satanism the pentagram is also used, but since Satanism represents the carnal instincts of man, or the opposite of spiritual nature, the pentagram is inverted to perfectly accommodate the head of the goat – its horns, representing duality, thrust upwards in defiance; the other three points inverted, or the trinity denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       “What is the meaning of this? It holds several meanings but in it are the keys to the “divine work” or “great mystery” of many esoteric pursuits: man becoming god. By the fusion of opposites (dark and light, male and female, etc.) man can seek godhood. This was the true goal of alchemy practitioners centuries ago. The idea of changing “lead to gold” was just a metaphor for the pursuit of godhood and immortality. Hence Baphomet having the phrases “solve” and “coagula” on its arms, which is the motto of alchemy – namely, dissolving and reforming into a new, greater being. And that is done by the return of the ancient “gods” or fallen angelic beings, to Earth. All of these references of “opposites” are really alluding to the desire for the occultist to join with spirit beings from the angelic realm. And that union is the “secret teaching.” “
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s another article about the Satanic agenda of the LGBTQ movement. The article isn’t Catholic, but a lot of it is still true:

      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, you can do your own research if you want to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: The occult agenda to reconcile all opposites and ascend to godhood through magick and science is the direct work of Satan. It is being promoted by Hollywood, the Music Industry, governments all over the world, all forms of media, modern science, schools from K-12 and beyond, and has even infiltrated the Bride of Christ, the Catholic Church.

       And feel free to comment below. And if you want to make fun of me, or call me insane, or something, then you can comment below, too. I don’t care. I didn’t just suddenly become convinced of all of this good and evil stuff overnight, so, yeah...I used to be a practicing Satanist, lived the LGBTQ lifestyle for years, and even got a Star Wars tattoo before I woke up and learned all of this, so I’m very sympathetic about all of this. Had I read this post a few years ago, I would have honestly pitied whoever wrote it and mercilessly laughed at that person in the comments. I’m just sharing the unpopular truth hoping I can help at least ONE person to return all the favors given to me by people who didn’t mind sounding insane and offensive. I’ve at least planted the seed, like the gardener my faithful dad named me after. Thanks for reading! God bless you, and Mary keep you!

       THE ANTI-CHRIST
PRIMITIVE Christians, the Essenes, fully realized and taught the great truth that Christ was a substance, an oil or ointment contained especially in the Spinal Cord, consequently in all parts of the body, as every nerve in the body is directly or indirectly connected with the wonderful "River that flows out of Eden (the
upper brain) to water the garden." The early Christians knew that the Scriptures, whether
written in ancient Hebrew or the Greek, were allegories, parables or fables based on the human body, "fearfully and wonderfully made."
These adepts knew that the secretion (gray matter creative) which issues (secretes), from the cerebrum, was the source and cause of the physical expression called man; and they knew that the "River of Jordan" was symbolized in the spinal cord and that the "Dead Sea" was used to symbolize the Sacred Plexus at the base of
the spinal column where the Jordan (spinal cord) ends, typifying the entrance of Jordan into the Dead Sea.
 The thick, oily and salty substance composing the Sacral Plexus, Cauda Equina" (tail of the horse), may be likened unto crude Petroleum (Petra, mineral, or salt, and oleum-Latin for oil) and the thinner substance, oil Plexus,  or ointment in the spinal cord, may be compared with coal oil; and when this oil is carried up and crosses the Ida and Pingala (two fluid nerves that end in a cross in medulla oblongata where it contacts the cerebellum (Golgotha, the place of the skull) this fluid is refined, as coal oil is refined, to produce gasoline a - higher rate of motion that causes the ascension of the airship.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the oil (ointment) is crucified-(to crucify
means to increase in power a thousand fold --not to kill) it remains two days and a half. (the moon's period in sign) in the tomb (cerebellum) and on the third day ascends to the Pineal Gland that connects the cerebellum with the Optic Thalmus, the Central Eye in the Throne of God that is the chamber overtopped by the hollow
(hallowed) caused by the curve of the cerebrum (the Most High" of the body) which is the "Temple of the Living God," the living, vital substance which is a precipitation of the "Breath of Life" breathed into man - therefore, the "Holy (whole) Ghost" or breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pineal Gland is the "Pinnacle of the Temple." The modus operandi by which the oil of the spinal cord reaches the Pineal Gland is described in what follows.
   "There is no name under Heaven whereby ye may be saved except Jesus Christed and then crucified" (correct rendering of the Greek text).
   Every twenty-nine and one-half days, when the moon is in the sign of the zodiac that the sun was in at the birth of the native, there is a seed, or Psycho-Physical germ born in the, or out of, the Solar Plexus (the Manger) and this seed is taken up by the nerves or branches of the
Pneumo gastric nerve, and becomes the "Fruit of the Tree of Life, or the "Tree of good and evil" -viz.: good, if saved and "cast upon the waters" (circulation) to reach the Pineal Gland; and evil, if eaten or consumed in sexual expression on the physical plane, or by alcoholic drinks, or gluttony that causes ferment - acid and even alcohol in intestinal tract-thus-"No drunkard can inherit the Kingdom of Heaven" for acids and alcohol cut, or chemically split, the oil that unites with the mineral salts in the body and thus produces the monthly seed.
      </p>
      <pre><code>This seed, having the odor of fish, was called Jesus, from Ichtos (Greek for fish) and Nun (Hebrew for of life;" - thus "Joshua the son of Nun," - "I am the bread that came down from heaven; "Give us this day our daily bread."
 The fruit of the Tree of Life, therefore, is the "Fish bread" of which thou shalt not eat on the plane or animal or Adam (earth-dust of the earth plane) but to "Him that overcometh will I give to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Life," because he saved it and it returned to him in the cerebellum, the home of the Spiritual man, the Ego.
</code></pre>
      <p>
       The cerebellum is heart-shaped and called the heart in Greek—thus "As a man thinketh in his heart so is he."
      </p>
      <pre><code>The bodily organ that men in their ignorance call heart is termed divider or pump in Greek and Hebrew. Our blood divider is not the button that we touch when we think, but it is the upper lobe of cerebellum that vibrates thought. The lower lobe is the animal (mortal) lobe that
</code></pre>
      <p>
       governs the animal world—that section of the body below the Solar Plexus, called lower Egypt--natural body kingdom of earth-Appollyon--the Devil (lived, spelled
backward) Satan (Saturn governs the bowels), etc. 
    Fire and Brimstone (the lake of fire) comes from the fact that sulphur (brimstone) is the prime factor in generating the rate of motion called heat, and overeating develops a surplus of sulphur. 
    ‎During the first 300 years of the Christian era all that has been above written was understood by the real Christians, and about the end of that time the persecution of these Essenes by the priesthood became so marked that they met in secret and always made the sign of the fish.
       <br/>
       ‎About the year 325, Constantine, the pagan Roman Emperor, called the teachers of Christianity together at Nicea.
    Constantine murdered his mother and boiled his wife in oil because they still held to the original doctrines of the Essenes. Constantine was told by the priests of his time that there was no forgiveness for crimes such as his, except through a long series of incarnations; but the anti-Christ sought to concoct a plan by which he hoped to cheat the Cosmic law.
    ‎ And so it came to pass, after months of wrangling and fighting over the writings of the primitive Christians who clothed the wonders of the human body in oriental imagery, that the council, sometimes by a bare majority vote, decided which of the manuscripts were the "Word of God" and which were not.
    ‎The very important point in the minds of those ignorant priests - whether or not an angel had wings - was decided in favor of wings by three majority. The minority contended that, as Jacob let down the ladder for angels to descend and ascend upon it was a prima facie evidence that angels do not have wings.
    ‎
    ‎ Just think, for a moment, upon the colossal ignorance of these priests who did not know that Jacob in Hebrew means "heel catcher" or circle, and that ladder refer to the influence of the signs of the zodiac upon the earth; and as one sign rising every two hours forms a circle
every twenty-four hours (the four and twenty Elders of Revelation) the outer stars of the rising suns (sons) "catching on" to the last sons (suns) of the sign ascending,
     But now we come to the anti-Christ
     The council of Nicea, dominated by Constantine, voted that the symbols of the human body were persons; that Jesus was a certain historical man, a contention utterly and indubitably without foundation, in fact, and
that all who believed (?) the story would be saved and forgiven here and now. The idea appealed to Constantine as an easy way out of his troubled mind and so the scheme of salvation by the actual blood of a real man or god was engrafted in the world. 
    Constantine and his dupes saw that the only way to perpetuate the infamy was to keep the world in ignorance of the operation of the Cosmic Law, so they changed "Times and Seasons"
      The date that they made the sun enter Aries was March 21st. Why? March 21st should be the first day of Aries, the head; April 19th should be the first day of Taurus, the neck, and so on through the twelve signs; but these designing schemers knew that by thus suppressing the truth the people might not come to realize what was meant by "The heavens declare the glory of God". Again: the moon, in its monthly round of 29 1/2 days enters the outer stars (or suns) of a constellation two and one-half days before it enters the central suns constellations that are known as the Signs of Zodiac or the "Circle of Beasts." But even unto this day whole the whole anti-Christ world (so-called "Christian") except
the astrologers, go by almanacs that make the moon enter a sign of the zodiac two and one-half days before it does enter it and thus perpetuate the lie of the pagan Constantine, the anti-Christ.
      </p>
      <pre><code>For more evidence that Jesus and Christ are in your flesh see 1st Epistle of John - 4th Chapter, 2nd and 3rd verses.
‎The Greek and Hebrew texts of our Scriptures plainly teach that Jesus and Christ, John and baptism, crucifixion and ascension, the triumph of the Ego over the "Enemy death"  are in the substance and potentialities of the body; and that these fluids can and will save the physical body, if conserved and not consumed ( or wasted ) in sexual or animal desire. 
‎All of whatever name religious denomination who teach contrary doctrine afree with Constantine who appeared in the "Latter days" of the pure Christian Practice.
‎Who is the anti-Christ? Look at a world of ruins. Does a good tree bring forth evil fruit?
‎The so-called teachers of, and believers in Christianity believe as Constantine and his priests, that the Christ is "out in the desert" of the Judean hills- out on Calvary. Do they ever look for the meaning of Calvary in Greek? Calvary means a skull, and Golgotha - the place of the skull, exactly where the seed is crucified.
‎One-half of the combatants in the world's Armageddon have been praying , as Constantine prayed, "for God's help for Christ's sake". The other half pray to the same imaginary God and Christ out in "The desert" of their own ignorance for "peace and victory."
‎Return and come unto the God and Christ within you, oh! Ye deluded ones, and the bugles will all sing truce along the iron front of war and the "Ransomed of the Lord will return to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their faces."

       Fall and Redemption of Man
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion having been based upon the worship of
personified nature, it is evident that its founders
fabricated its dogmatic element from their
conceptions of her destructive and reproductive
processes as manifested in the rotation and diversity of the seasons. The apparent retreat of the sun from the earth, in winter, and his return in the spring, suggesting the idea of a figurative death and resurrection of the genius of that luminary, thev applied these phenomena of the year to man, and composed the allegories relative to his fall and redemption, as inculcated in the Exoteric Creed. In the allegory relating to the fall, it was taught that, after making the first human pair, the Lord of Good or the Lord God placed them in a beautiful garden-corresponding to the seasons of fruits and flowers or months of Spring and Summer, with the injunction, under a, penalty, not to eat of the fruit of a certain tree. When the Lord of Evil, or Devil, symbolized by the serpent and represented by the constellation "Serpens" placed in conjunction with the Autumnal Equinox, meeting them on the confines of his dominion, and tempting the woman, and she the man, they ate of the forbidden fruit; thus, falling from their first estate, and committing the original sin, they involved the whole human
race in the consequences of their disobedience.
Then the Lord God, pronouncing a curse against the serpent, clothed the man and woman with skins to protect them against the inclemency of his, dominion as Lord of Evil, and drove them from the garden; after which they were necessitated to earn their bread by tilling the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       In, reference to the plan of redemption, the ancient Astrologers divided the 6.000 years appropriated to man, as the duration of his race on earth, into ten equal cycles, and taught that at the conclusion of each God Sol, as Lord of Good, would manifest himself in the flesh, to destroy his works as Lord of Evil, and through suffering and death make an atonement for sin. Thus having originated the doctrines of original sin, incarnation and vicarious atonement, as parts of the plan of redemption, and making its finale correspond, in point of time, to the conclusion of the 12,000 year cycle, their successors in the priestly office ultimately inculcated the additional dogmas of the general judgment and future rewards and punishments as we have shown in our introduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having based the fables of the fall and redemption of man upon the idea that he was impelled, withot his volition, to pass from the dominion of God to that of the Devil, or in other words, upon his subjection to the inexorable necessity which makes the inclement seasons of Autumn and Winter succeed the beneficent ones of Spring and Summer its authors composed the original of the text which, found in Romans viii., 20, reads that "The creature
was made subject to vanity (Evil), not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope."
      </p>
      <p>
       But for the popular teaching in favor of its being literal history, no one could read the account of the fall of man, as recorded in the third chapter of Genesis, without recognizing it as simply an allegory; or fail to realize, the force of the argument of no fall, no redemption, and if no redemption, no God to reward or Devil to punish; no hell to suffer or heaven to enjoy. The fact is that these are but antithetical ideas which came in together, and must survive or perish together. They cannot be separated
without destroying the whole theological fabric.

       That's because it's all horse shit.  The universe is what you create it to be.  This person has no idea what they're even trying to say.  Did you read it?  The universe is a reflection of you. Believe in yourself.  Love everything about you and always allow yourself to learn and better yourself.  You dont have to blindly follow anyone or anything.  "Jesus Christ" IS Satan.  There is no truth to be found in Christianity.  Or any of the religions.  Truth only exists within you.

       So, the girl ate the fruit and then gave it to the guy and they both ate it. That made the sun go away. Then the son came back for practically the last time, but he said if you believe in him, he’ll come back one more time, but this time will be the encore. Then everyone will really have to go home.

       But the serpent made the sun go away? That’s not to deny that these fuckers at Disney believe in all kinds of perverted and demented shit. And there seems to be an underlying knowledge of symbols, no doubt!

       There’s no Satan. Demons are other religions gods used as bogeymen when the conquerors decide they need a new deity to dupe the masses. Stop looking for a savior. Christ doesn’t mean what you think it does and was never part of Yeshua’s name until they wrote the stories later.
The “great work” you allude to is literally just a balancing of receptive and active energies. Be too receptive and you’re walked on. Be too active and you’re a dick (I wonder why that’s the word we use).
The occult is just a self help book cloaked in metaphor because the church didn’t want anyone messing with its control of money and power. People who don’t need a savior don’t need leaders. 
Stop being afraid and learn about the things that scare you. They won’t seem so scary. The fear is just to keep you away.
