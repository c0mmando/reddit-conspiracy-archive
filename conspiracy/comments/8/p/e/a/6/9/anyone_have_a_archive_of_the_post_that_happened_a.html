       His responses were  interesting. He came off articulate in the first half but towards the bottom I noticed a change.   His grammar went from ivy league to middle school.  He was very vague and never explained how a very planned event of various types could be orchestrated.  Also the $ to built tunnels and pour concrete to the labor would be hard to keep hide and keep quiet.  I'm always open minded to leakers but this guy came off as a troll.  The supply alone during that time would have caused shortage.

       Well this could easily be hid.  You may not know that mega tons, kilo-tons of resources are mined out of the earth at a astronomical level that does not go to major cities etc.  This is where it goes.

       We are talking about the late 70s and 80s. I'm not saying it's impossible - I am saying the supply demand for building a city from scratch would create shortages. It would be interesting to know more.

       Humanity is fucked. But I think a portion will merge with A.I. via bionics and consciousness, and will figure out a way to continue, other factions will go underground and continue.

       That's cool and all, plus I've seen it.  Excellent documentary.  But the guy from a year ago had some specifics that were past that.

       I am confident the US has developed some degree of underground operations &amp; tunnel connectivity. Several bases are acknowledged to have existed for several decades (from the SAC, NORAD era). Why wouldn’t the Pentagon invest in such capability ? And merely conjecture on my part but I suspect the US has tunneled into several nations from offshore their coastlines. More than just tapping of phone cables by submarine commandos.

       We have evidence of underground habitation (maybe tens of) thousands of years old, and the only explanation that makes sense to me is for survival from a NEO impact

       One of the challenges of large-scale impactors is that the ones large enough to approach extinction level power also are likely to cause serious seismic activity capable of compromising subterranean structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you need something like an undersea base, in deep enough water to avoid the chaos closer to the surface but far enough from the sea floor to avoid seismic events like underwater venting.

       Interesting read, but I just can't stand the self-righteous tone of the original op. Saying shit like we should be happy with what we have and not worried about what we don't. OK, I agree, but I've worked my ass off all life to get where I'm at, yet this privileged fuck probably hasn't lifted a finger for his golden spoon.

       If you've were born wealthy, that's great. But don't tell me how to live my life and fuck you for making assumptions about how 'humane' the general population is.

       I'll just point out that there is a nuclear power plant in Kansas and one in Arkansas.  If these types of things exist in that general area, underground, since the 70s, they would be near one of those.
