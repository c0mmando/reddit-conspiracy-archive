    <div class="md"><p>His responses were  interesting. He came off articulate in the first half but towards the bottom I noticed a change.   His grammar went from ivy league to middle school.  He was very vague and never explained how a very planned event of various types could be orchestrated.  Also the $ to built tunnels and pour concrete to the labor would be hard to keep hide and keep quiet.  I&#39;m always open minded to leakers but this guy came off as a troll.  The supply alone during that time would have caused shortage. </p>

<p>Well this could easily be hid.  You may not know that mega tons, kilo-tons of resources are mined out of the earth at a astronomical level that does not go to major cities etc.  This is where it goes.</p>

<p>Humanity is fucked. But I think a portion will merge with A.I. via bionics and consciousness, and will figure out a way to continue, other factions will go underground and continue.</p>

<p>The matrix movie was basically Revelations style scripture of whats coming</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am confident the US has developed some degree of underground operations &amp; tunnel connectivity. Several bases are acknowledged to have existed for several decades (from the SAC, NORAD era). Why wouldn’t the Pentagon invest in such capability ? And merely conjecture on my part but I suspect the US has tunneled into several nations from offshore their coastlines. More than just tapping of phone cables by submarine commandos. </p>
