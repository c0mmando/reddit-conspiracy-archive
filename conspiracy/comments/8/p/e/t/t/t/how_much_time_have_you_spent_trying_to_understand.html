       <strong>
        You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       For a long time, I eschewed study of the occult/esoteric elements of the 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       By 'occult/esoteric', I mean things which are not understood by the majority of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, I am talking about symbolism, numerology, synchronicity, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the reasons was because, most of the time, whenever I read or heard a 'conspiracy' outlet discussing these kinds of things, they came across as merely cherry-picking.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        'This means that! And look at this! This means this other thing, too! MUH TRUTH IN PLAIN SIGHT!'
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, it is certainly true that many people who speak about occult/esoteric concepts are talking out of their backsides.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, having now studied countless different interpretations of the event we call 9/11, I have come to realise the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        9/11 was nothing if not an introduction (initiation) into the occult
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This will only become apparent to those with the
       <strong>
        patience
       </strong>
       to learn, and the
       <strong>
        humility
       </strong>
       to reconsider their preexisting beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       For just one example, take the flight numbers that day: 11, 77, 93, 175.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you believe that all four can be directly traced back to Aleister Crowley and Thelema?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not cherry-picking:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        In Thelema, 11 is
        <strong>
         the
        </strong>
        magic number.
       </li>
       <li>
        Crowley wrote a piece entitled Liber 77, it stands as one of his most well-known works.
       </li>
       <li>
        Thelemites are known to sign off with the number 93.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is just the tip of the iceberg. More connections are explained in
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvO9-PsM2DI">
        this short video
       </a>
       , including the significance of 175.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       spent much time studying the occult/esoteric elements of 9/11? If so, what have you learned?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please share. I am sure that I still have more to learn myself, and hopefully the regular users of this sub can assist me on my path.

       George Bush was indeed reading The Pet Goat as the 9/11 event was 'going live'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an interesting 'coincidence': Liber 77 is also entitled Liber Oz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most English speakers do not realise that Hebrew has 'gematria'
       <strong>
        built into it
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Every letter of the Hebrew alphabet is also a number. This is not a 'conspiracy', it is actually part of their language.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Hebrew, 'Oz' is spelt Ayin Zayin, which have the values of 70 and 7 respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Oz literally equals 77. Oz = 77.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Hebrew, Oz can mean 'strength', and it can also mean... (drum roll)
      </p>
      <p>
       'Goat'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't take my word for it. Type Oz into a Hebrew -&gt; English translator for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the POTUS was reading The Pet Goat while flight 77 was (allegededly) flying into the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would anybody like to guess when the groundwork for the Pentagon was begun?
      </p>
      <p>
       September 11, 1941.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would anybody like to guess when Liber Oz was written?
      </p>
      <p>
       1941.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't make this shit up.

       I got a lot of ideas for further research from the Sync Book dudes.

       I have tried to promote The Sync Book several times on this sub, because it seems suited.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for some reason, many regular users of this sub seem disinterested in Sync as a concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect this may be because it is not dark enough. A lot of people here want dark or creepy conspiracies, whereas Sync is kinda the opposite.

       Thanks I love hearing about synchronicity and esoteric knowledge. My feelings on the latter are that it is like a sword or a gun - it can be used to do good or evil depending on the user.

       Hey. So i cannot tell that the book is upside down. I have looked at like 15 images of the book and watched three different 6 min videos of bush there reading. I cannot tell if it is upside down or not. But it looks the right way up to me.

       One ought to take the time to double check the major claims for himself. Otherwise, it is 'in one ear, out the other'.

       I think the emotional outpouring after 9/11 was in some way harnessed by these demonic creeps... same thing with the DIANA murder...
      </p>
      <p>
       As ever there’s a top layer reason to have performed these atrocious acts of murder but also an underlying occult reason too

       The Pet Goat was written by a promoter of 'direct instruction'.

       This is why we see the teacher leading the children with what sounds like some kind of incantation.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can it possibly teach children to read, by having them chant parroted repetitions of what the teacher says?
      </p>
      <p>
       I always found that very odd indeed. Now it all makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do you really believe 3,000 people died that day?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is strange to me that people can realise the TV is lying about 9/11, but still believe the official death count.

       incantation is the perfect word for that whole scripted classroom scene

       Never really thought about the death count - it’s possible that the number was that high I suppose

       Neithger did I, until somebody pointed out to me that In was being hypocritical:
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, I had figured out that the official story was complete nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I still believed the main part of the official story!
      </p>
      <p>
       So then I went looking for the actual evidence to verify the 3,000 dead figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I discovered shook me to the core of my miserable soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time, once I got past my own preconceived notions, it was incredibly liberating.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take the tie to try this for yourself, you'll see why.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deception goes so much deeper than most 'conspiracy theorists' can even imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is all so obvious, once one begins to base their opinions on nothing but
       <em>
        evidence.

       Thank you for mentioning S K Bain.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some good nuggets in his book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my problem with Bain's thesis:
      </p>
      <p>
       He takes it for granted that 3,000 people died that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bain therefore concludes that the mass initiation ritual we call 9/11 was a demonic/evil event.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can people realise that the official story is complete bullcrap, but STILL believe the official death count?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is like realising that Oswald was not the gunman, but still believing that he fired the magic bullet!

       I'm not saying he's 100% write and I don't take it all for Gospel. BUT...as a handy-dandy intro to all the occult "coincidences," the numerology, the ties back to Crowley, etc., etc., it's the single best one-stop-shop.

       Well sir thank you for bringing this up. The numbers are so specific across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just found a big significance too 175 recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8o40mt/abrahamkabbaantipodes_and_666/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/8o40mt/abrahamkabbaantipodes_and_666/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I was looking into 666 and found that the 666th verse of the bible is Gen 25:7 and that 25x7=175.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the product of chapter and verse equal the number referenced in the text.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got there via Rev 13 :18  Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       Six hundred threescore
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       six.
      </p>
      <p>
       13x18=432+234=666 so you add the product too its mirror. 432 has significance throughout much in reality.
      </p>

      <p>
       The distance between the Kaaba in mecca to the temple mount of jeruselum is 666.6NM 1234.5432KM
      </p>
      <p>
       The angle between these two points in relation too NORTH POLE. is 23.4 degrees the same as the tilt of the earths axis.  234+432=666 once again. but also 23.4-90degrees= 66.6 degrees tilt in relation to the equator
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i read that ABRAHAM BUILT THE KAABA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i find the antipode of Mecca is an Atoll in the ocean. I find that this area was the site of 175 nukes tested in the atmosphere...... So interesting to learn that in islam the gates of heaven reside directly above the Kaaba. so the gates of HELL would in the air on the opposite side of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah there is alot. I didnt know about OZ=GOAT thats hella good.

       heres my biggest 9-11 numerological link.

      <p>
       Seeing joan lee die and 93 and Nelsan ellis die the day before at 39 it got me curious.

      </p>
      <p>
       As you know 7 is important so seeing Joan Lee die the day before 7-7-17 got me curious specifically because i knew that Trump was 7y7m7d on inauguration and was meeting with Putin as Putin enters his 777th of life.  both men resonating 7s meet on 7717 in hebrew year 5777.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joan lees birth until 9-11-2001= 77 years 7month 7 days
      </p>
      <p>
       9-11-2001 to joan lees death = 5777 days
      </p>
      <p>
       5777 days from 9-11 too the year at which is reference in the days between.
      </p>
      <p>
       i prolly think of some more. But REALITY is synchronized its not just the esoteric numbers its everywhere.

       I have tried to promote The Sync Book several times on this sub, because it seems suited.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for some reason, many regular users of this sub seem disinterested in Sync as a concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect this may be because it is not dark enough. A lot of people here want dark or creepy conspiracies, whereas Sync is kinda the opposite.
