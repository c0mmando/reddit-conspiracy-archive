You are aware that a lot of Hollywood movies have some symbolism in it or some obscure references to the past or some sort of social engineering. If you want to convince me, you would have to come up with something better. Let&#39;s start with what do you mean by hoax? JFK didn&#39;t exist? He didn&#39;t die? He did die but differently then we have been told? </p>

<p>Correct. </p>

<p>Correct. But it does lay out the dots for those with eyes to see and an interest in connecting the dots for themselves.</p>

<p>On 22-11-63, nobody died and nobody got hurt at the Dealey Plaza.</p>

<p>It was a made-for-TV movie. A &#39;king kill&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently I am delusional. JFK was not killed because of that speech. It seems that most users here have only listened to or watched a small segment of that speech. Read the full transcript and it becomes obvious he was talking about the U.S.S.R. reading American newspapers and that the media should therefore be careful with their reporting as to not share any sensitive data that could be useful for the U.S.S.R. It was something Kennedy found difficult to ask because in a free society the press should write about anything it wishes. But in war time it&#39;s different, according to JFK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the book &quot;Disinformation,&quot; by Lt.Gen. Mihai Pacepa (One of the highest ranking Soviets ever to defect to the West.) He presents the information that JFK was indeed killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, but makes the strong case that Oswald was recruited by the Soviets when he was stationed in Japan as a
member of a military air traffic control unit for Marine Corps
planes. When the US government discovered this after the investigation of JFK&#39;s murder, they did hold up a smokescreen over the &#39;true facts&#39; (little investigation was done according to Pacepa.) The knowledge was deliberately kept from the public, the reason being: Had the US government told the public that their beloved president was killed by Soviet hands, this would have surely shifted public opinion into an anti-Soviet sentiment. Remember, the Cold war was at its height at those days.. Such a shift in public opinion could have seriously threatened the human race as a whole..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reply. But in my opinion, the deep state would&#39;ve loved blaming the Soviet Union and hold them responsible. Declassified CIA documents noted that the USSR was of the opinion that there was a plot orchestrated by what people call nowadays the deep state to kill JFK. I am too lazy to find them, but I am sure a quick search will deliver those documents. Also, it&#39;s true that Oswald lived in the USSR. We have been told he defected but surprisingly he carried a standard issued camera by the CIA. He made notes about Russian facilities, made notes about micro-dots and the list goes on. I think Oswald was a double agent because he was very proficient in Russian. </p>

<p>Also, after reading the Devil&#39;s Chessboard and watching and reading tons of documents,documentaries and interviews with witnesses, I think that any believer of the Oswald being the shooter is misinformed. </p>

<p>If you are interested in JFK and the role Oswald played, I would recommend watching this item made by James Corbett. <a href="https://youtu.be/IWsAoWqc52w">https://youtu.be/IWsAoWqc52w</a></p>

<p>Sorry for my not well sourced argument but I am on my phone. We can continue talking about the subject though! </p>
