<p>A random Kanye tweet, or a new picture from the Royal Wedding gets more coverage and interest than a dismembered child corpse found in the wilderness in an area with a camp being called a &quot;homeless camp&quot; oh and that innocent homeless camp was bulldozed over shortly after police arrived too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m not, yes it may well be a trafficking camp but without verifiable proof it&#39;s a conspiracy and will be used against any evidence found. And it detracts from the FACTS of arrests at Disney of paedophiles and 160 kids saved at North Fulton - so how is that wrong - you want facts or maybe patriot</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you basically saying that “ there’s nothing to see here” just because this whole discovery is not yet over? It’s a work in progress and nothing has been definitively declared or decided yet. Don’t you think it’s a little premature to be definitively saying that there’s nothing of note going on? Why try and steer people away? What’s the harm in people being interested in a situation that is possibly really fucking creepy? There’s no reason for you to come in here and try to shut down ideas and questions when the investigation is no where near over. And why would one pedo bust be more relevant/worthy of attention than another? That’s insane. All things pedophile are worthy of concerned citizens paying attention to and thinking critically about. Anything to dissuade that is disgusting and deplorable. People have the right and duty to pay attention to what is going on AND to ask questions. Lots of them. </p>

<p>You need to understand, VOP is just providing the videos, the evidence, etc. They&#39;re the volunteer guys, not being paid a cent, not even taking money donations, out there in 100+ degree Arizona heat, on their own time, to do this.  </p>

<p>Why are they doing it? Because nobody else is. Because the authorities do not seem interested. Because it&#39;s cartel land and who knows who is involved or paid off.  </p>

<p>VOP isn&#39;t getting into any of the theories being talked about and researched on 8chan or whatever.  </p>

<p>It IS a child or small adult remains found. Some bones were sawn apart by power tools. There were numerous bones found, possibly from multiple victims, but they won&#39;t even say that definitely. And they said that the area stunk of decay still, to the point where he refused to go view the skull, or even go back to that area, again after he had been to it two times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, they went through the first site. There was no obvious sign of a dead human body.  After waiting days and days for LE to do ANYTHING, they started looking for what they could find. 
No one was taking them seriously or listening to them.   </p>

<p>The second site, as soon as they realized it was human bones, they stopped &amp; didn&#39;t touch anything.   (As far as I understand). Waited HOURS for LE to respond to a dead BODY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think about the incredible irony of it all... 700 billion to the DOD every year to maintain the largest and most sophisticated military on the entire planet and at least another 100 billion on the most militarized and heavily equipped law enforcement agencies and services as well, and they can&#39;t even defend the country&#39;s southernmost border against Mexico&#39;s poorest and most disadvantaged civilians from simply pouring into the country in their thousands each and every year. </p>

<p>And if they can get in that easily and manage to stay and live in the US for years on end without ever being caught or deported, so can virtually anyone else, including any individuals looking to even-up the score by killing some ordinary American civilians in retribution for some of the ordinary ones that US forces have killed in the Middle-East or elsewhere, or all kinds of more mundane criminals on the run from authorities in other parts of the world looking for a fresh start to ply their trade in the great land of opportunity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously a skull is something for the police to look at, and is of more interest than previous discoveries (even if it&#39;s at a different site). </p>

<p>But honestly the first set of discoveries was pitched at such a hysterical level, with people drawing unjustified conclusions, it&#39;s hard for me to take any of this seriously. </p>

<p>People seem to be so anxious to find a &quot;child trafficking site&quot; and warp everything through that lens. Children&#39;s toys in the woods? Child trafficking! Piece of fabric nailed to tree? Those are restraints for child sex rituals! It&#39;s insane. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt their sincerity (hell, most of the videos these people are so wound up they&#39;re screaming and in tears). But I seriously doubt their conclusions. </p>

<p>If you go looking you&#39;re going to find a lot of skulls in that desert. They come from immigrants, who also deserve your sympathy, whose stories also deserve to be heard, even if it isn&#39;t as titillating as the fantasy of little white children stolen in the night by illuminati for satanic ritual, which seems to be driving these efforts. </p>
