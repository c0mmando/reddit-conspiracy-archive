       I am not leaving Reddit but I will not host as much "content" on here as I used to. AKA I will be linking to more off site platforms to share ideas/concepts and save text/comments for crucial context and awareness. Be careful what you post onto Reddit from here on out....

       It's gotten too big and popular! I've been on reddit for 7 yrs back when it was all   narwhal bacons at midnight and r/spacedicks posts. I'm gonna stick around and see where she goes but I'm looking for the next frontier. Idk when it changed but I guess with facebook on its way out folks gotta get their fix somewhere.

       I'm going down with this ship if need be but theres no way im moving to twitter or face book.
      </p>

       This ship will explode eventually but we might as well ride it until she drops all the way in. I won't post as many personal research discoveries from now on without linking to it hosted off platform. even then its like whats the next step for these greedy fucks. Dominoes are falling and this is the popcorn stage anyway so we might as well enjoy ourselves now

       Well this account is only 5yrs old but i been around for longer than that. It was different back then, idk how to explain it. More rage comics and memes back in them days, it was more fun. Now it's all politics, trolls and comment sections full of people fighting over opinions.

       I'm with you there. I still visit and my favourite subs and now going the same way as all the main ones did. pics, news, funny etc etc.... very little conversation, and slowly less and less information and interesting content. Everything feels very manipulated and just a mess.

       Slowly weening myself off it.

       Everything changed when pizzagate broke. Everything. This place used to be a sanctuary for free thought. Now it’s Facebook 2.0, and even more popular than Facebook itself
      </p>
      <p>
       The only place I know of is voat, and that’s nothing compared to even the early stages of reddit. This place used to be the shit. It’s so watered down now. Everything is so basic

       I'm starting to look for the next platform, this place holds a special place in my heart but it rarely satisfies my desires for intelligent discord anymore. I've changed and searched for subs but I'm not finding it anymore. It's just like I woke up one day and reddit had changed, kind of like looking at a partner and realizing you don't love them anymore lol.

       In my opinion Healthy discourse is rare on Reddit since the 2016 election. Users now subscribe to echo chamber subreddits then slowly lose (or fail to develop) the ability to agree to disagree and have rational fact based discussions without hostility. I think a lot of people including myself are more reluctant to comment these days in fear of backlash even if what their saying isnt controversial.

       It was fun when Antifa swarmed the sub.

      <p>
       Disliking tyranny was "hateful" and this sub was Nazi central,  according to them. It was weeks of craziness until the entire group suddenly pulled out and quit throwing idiocy everywhere.

       It's already being mass populated with shills, AI, bots, marketing manipulators and host of frauds, and this will only get worse in future, to the point where it will be rendered useless, it's getting close, but it might take a couple years for most people people to wake up and smell the bullshit. Reddit is a piece of shit sinking ship.

       this is spooky, thanks for posting
      </p>
      <p>
       i already have suspected that things like this are in place, it is especially valuable for them to get the information of people who think they are legally protected and or unwatched.
      </p>
      <p>
       that they are saying it is legal for them to impersonate you is like saying, 'if you get really popular on here, we may just steal your account so we can commodify your work'
      </p>
      <p>
       and this is inherent breach of trust, the worst of the internet, beyond the pale.
      </p>
      <p>
       the direction things should be going is for more verification of users who want to establish themselves as writers, more ways for individuals to earn credibility and even currency for what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this stuff is headed backwards towards some real nazi-sounding sheisty shit, though control, infinite manipulation, destruction of fact and essentially the end of the individual on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       you are either connected to an institution that provides you a digital platform, or you are a minnow swimming in the mouth of a shark, who will be eaten as soon as it(read: you, me, us) reach a certain size.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yes, reddit is lost and has been.  peter sunde says the entire internet is lost, that it's' already become a monster and i find it difficult to agree with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       we are facing the death of individual liberty and speech in our lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       more and more i think people like Tim Russert and Michael Hastings and Paul Wellstone and Aaron Schwartz died because they reached this size and disappeared down the belly.
      </p>
      <p>
       saidit, voat, steemit, all look just as comprimsed to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       and this is why, i believe, elon musk is talking about a whole new sort of platform for journalism and debate.  it is also why i saw all of this in 2002 and wrote a book i couldn't get anybody to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       so my old account
       <a href="/u/mindhawk">
        /u/mindhawk
       </a>
       is locked, you can compare this at snoopsnoo to see the writing of that account and this is the same wordcloud.  and i know the comments over there very well, that's my canary in the coal mind, mindhawk's(my) original reddit account is supposed to be locked forever and im testing to see how long it stays up and if it ever changes, so far so good.
      </p>
      <p>
       this time around with this account, despite my apparent love of the word 'people' i meet very few other accts who are prepared to actually have an exchange of thought rather than shove the thread in one direction briefly, usually a shitty direction, before bailing forever on the topic.

       How do you think that the company you work for is liable for actions on reddit?

       This sounds like complete BS, what law would that be? Secondly it would anyway totally depend where you are from, Reddit users are from all over the globe.

       I did it on old accounts just so nothing could be harvested or "usable"

       im leaving this account alone but if you feel like deleting comments I would. Also adds safety for yourself, it's good to delete every so often, we sometimes share more than we mean to and it can make it easier to doxx us

       Can you not scare people. Maybe you should clarify with reddit admin to make sure. Because I don't know you can lose your job for posting on reddit. Especially if you don't put your personal info.

       I mean technically you can lose your job over a number of things but if you read the TOS it says all of this.

       In all honesty I am sure a lot of this was already happening this is just them legally covering themselves

       I'm starting to look for the next platform, this place holds a special place in my heart but it rarely satisfies my desires for intelligent discord anymore. I've changed and searched for subs but I'm not finding it anymore. It's just like I woke up one day and reddit had changed, kind of like looking at a partner and realizing you don't love them anymore lol.
