       The bentham paper does not show 'weapons grade thermite' at wtc, It purports to show active thermitic material found in 3 dust samples the authors claim was taken from ground zero.  It is a quantum leap of faith to escalate the findings of the paper to the conclusion weapons grade thermite was found.

       But, coupled with all of the other crap, such as two planes knocking down three buildings--the third one falling from the bottom despite the bottom not being on fire--and Cheney suspending NORAD and all that other stuff, you know the lease of the WTC changing hands 2 weeks before the attacks to a private billionaire--well, it makes it all the more compelling.

       The main problem with 9/11 debunkers is that they don't seem to understand that there is a very good reason to be suspicious of the anglo-american establishment and their intelligence agencies when it comes to war-enabling events such as 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a long and documented history of false flag and black operations being used to initiate wars of conquest. Debunkers seem unwilling to even acknowledge this fact. I guess it just doesn't fit into their
       <strong>
        AMERICA - FUCK YEAH!
       </strong>
       worldview.

       No.  I am all for being suspicious of the government/establishment pretty much everything.  I have a degree in History, and have been reading about conspiracy theories for 10 plus years (believing them for many), so I have at least a basic understanding of history and the events you speak of, and I assure you I am not of the America, Fuck Yhea mindset.  I do not think the government is inherently good or working in society's best interests.  I am anti war, anti torture, and I probably share a similar world view with many here.  As a debunker I am not unique, painting with such a broad brush is a mistake.  How do you feel when the ad hom "truthers living in their mothers basement, or pot smoking truther is used?"   Basing your view of an opposing  ideology or group on stereotypes is a quick way to stifle intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue with 9/11 debunkers isn't one of people not understanding or accepting the motives you speak of, or even an opposing political/world view its that the majority of truther arguments simply do not stand under scrutiny.  Take this thread, the topic was thermite; truthers have misrepresented what the paper actually said, to the point people now assert that thermite was definitively found at GZ.  You, as a truther, should find the fact that this misinformation is being added to the truther lexicon in spite of it being false troubling.  Many debunkers (and truthes) are highly skeptical of Jones' findings, so when people parrot them off a gospel they may be dismissed in many circles, and it has nothing to do with someones view of history.  I think people who claim to be skeptical should exercise the same level of skepticism they do on Conspiracy evidence, that they do on offical versions, and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does operation northwoods or the gulf of tonkin add to the discussion on thermite? (not referring to your post)  Nothing yet bringing them up is supposed to somehow add to the veracity of a science paper.  Discussions are often littered with these red herrings, and serve to distract from what the topic at hand is, namely the Bentham article.

       I do. If you look through my comment history you'll see that I have never asserted that the WTC buildings were imploded. I keep a somewhat open mind on the subject but I've yet to see any compelling evidence. I'm more interested in the ties between the mujihadeen, ISI, CIA, Mossad and other secret societies and their hidden influence in historic and unfolding events. I'm a LIHOP truther, not a space-lasers truther.

      <p>
       The only reason I chime in on such threads is to troll the more aggressive "debunkers" like Jerkimer.

       Yes, a lot of powdered rust and aluminum should raise some eyebrows.  Even if these elements were present in the WTC I don't see any reason why they would be in powder form and mixed together.

       Just keep in mind that the paper wasn't properly peer reviewed.  It seems the authors were able to choose their own reviewers.  This isn't how peer reviews are supposed to work.  The editor of the journal quit after she learned the paper had been included.  She didn't even know what was being published in the journal she was supposed to be an editor of.

       Cam wants us to think that out of all these several hundred papers that have been published that some how THIS ONE (Jones&amp;Co's Paper) was able to by pass all of the editors and was published under their noses.

       Except unlike many of the successful open journals that benthlam publishes that have active editors that are able to put their names on the line for the journal they represent, this journal had only been around for 2 issues and obviously did not have active editors willing to put their name on the line.  That's why older journals are more respected than younger ones.  They've had time to ensure quality control.

       You ask for proof, I provide it.  You do nothing to refute my points other than saying bantham does have good journals, which I agree.  With nothing left you criticize me for not being able to be critical when confronted with facts.  Nice.  If all your going to do is resort to attacking me personally then please, stop debating with me.

       Comment karma is inversely proportional to intelligence. At this level I am light years ahead of you, xeno. It's not even a fair comparison. Ie.-- I'm Einstein and you're a retarded snail.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think my comment karma also might have something to do with the Bury Brigade infesting Reddit, and their festering, slobbering hate for the truth. But honestly I don't give a fuck about them. The truth will get out regardless.

       No.  I am all for being suspicious of the government/establishment pretty much everything.  I have a degree in History, and have been reading about conspiracy theories for 10 plus years (believing them for many), so I have at least a basic understanding of history and the events you speak of, and I assure you I am not of the America, Fuck Yhea mindset.  I do not think the government is inherently good or working in society's best interests.  I am anti war, anti torture, and I probably share a similar world view with many here.  As a debunker I am not unique, painting with such a broad brush is a mistake.  How do you feel when the ad hom "truthers living in their mothers basement, or pot smoking truther is used?"   Basing your view of an opposing  ideology or group on stereotypes is a quick way to stifle intellect.

       The issue with 9/11 debunkers isn't one of people not understanding or accepting the motives you speak of, or even an opposing political/world view its that the majority of truther arguments simply do not stand under scrutiny.  Take this thread, the topic was thermite; truthers have misrepresented what the paper actually said, to the point people now assert that thermite was definitively found at GZ.  You, as a truther, should find the fact that this misinformation is being added to the truther lexicon in spite of it being false troubling.  Many debunkers (and truthes) are highly skeptical of Jones' findings, so when people parrot them off a gospel they may be dismissed in many circles, and it has nothing to do with someones view of history.  I think people who claim to be skeptical should exercise the same level of skepticism they do on Conspiracy evidence, that they do on offical versions, and vice versa.

       What does operation northwoods or the gulf of tonkin add to the discussion on thermite? (not referring to your post)  Nothing yet bringing them up is supposed to somehow add to the veracity of a science paper.  Discussions are often littered with these red herrings, and serve to distract from what the topic at hand is, namely the Bentham article.
