<p>For example the Mayor of Tucson has the last Name &quot;Rothschild&quot;</p>

<p>I pointed this out and got dog piled by people calling this assertion silly and ridiculous because I dont have proof he is connected to the blood line.</p>

<p>Is it just me or isnt it not that much of a stretch to be suspicious of the mayor in a town   currently in a human trafficking scandal to be &quot;COINCIDENTALLY&quot; named Rothschild, a town where a group of Veterans (who the army of Top Minds have taken to calling &quot;crazy loons&quot;) claims the police did not respond immediately and when they did the investigation was improper and then the site was immediately bulldozed.</p>

<p>I know it isnt  Courtroom level evidence but to me it is more than enough to engage a discussion on the topic.</p>

<p>Point being the comment section of the linked post is a warzone and clearly draws the line between people that enjoy discussing and looking into suspicious circumstances and people that should probably subscribe to Top Minds (if they dont already)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In not sure what you guys are taking about be demanding evidence is never a tactic to derail an investigation. Demanding evidence is a tactic to derail bullshit and con men. Circumstantial evidence needs to be connected and needs to be corroborated by more than just itself otherwise it can create wild fantasies that can lead to incorrect judgments. It&#39;s like if you see someone go into a bank and then the bank alarm goes off then you see him run out you assume he robbed the bank. That evidence is circumstantial and unless it&#39;s backed up could lead to incorrect conclusions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the Thread is so cluttered with bullshit, and the tactic of these people is basically to present difficult arguments which require a good amount of thought and a paragraph of writing to successfully defeat.</p>

<p>And then they ignore everything you say and present another argument which again despite being incorrect at its core takes a good amount of effort to defeat.</p>

<p>With the overall goal of depleting mental energy which could be directed at more productive routes of discussion and investigation then endlessly arguing with fucking trolls and/or shills</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really like this analogy. I mean I understand what he is getting at but not all conspiracies are connected and tiered like a staircase. And how he has God and flat earth theory at the very top is pretty funny. He makes a lot of false assertions too. Like how if you take one step than you must walk all the way up. If you decide to investigate a certain conspiracy for any reason, possibly even personal,  doesn&#39;t mean you must investigate ALL conspiracies eventually. It sounds like he is just trying to sound profound. He says a lot of good things though too like about evidence and investigating instead of believing everything you&#39;re told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mayor Jonathan Rothschild is the son of prominent Tucson bankruptcy attorney Lowell Rothschild.
<a href="http://tucson.com/news/local/tucson-s-lowell-rothschild-reflects-on-legal-career-that-spans/article_e5646100-fe00-5c32-8b4e-cc75ccf8e5a7.html">http://tucson.com/news/local/tucson-s-lowell-rothschild-reflects-on-legal-career-that-spans/article_e5646100-fe00-5c32-8b4e-cc75ccf8e5a7.html</a></p>

<p>Lowell was born to Chicago to Albert Rothschild and Sydel Bernstein.  Lowell moved away from his father at 15 and he and his mother went to Tucson.  Sydel then opened a used furniture store in Tucson.
<a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tucson/obituary.aspx?n=lowell-rothschild&amp;amp;pid=187711841">http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tucson/obituary.aspx?n=lowell-rothschild&amp;amp;pid=187711841</a></p>

<p>If Albert had anything to do with the famous family, it sounds like Lowell and his mother were estranged from them when they moved in the 40s.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just a name?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all your title included a fallacy. You assume that people who demand evidence also see what police say as absolute truth. Apparently this is about another thread that I didn&#39;t read so you can take my answer as it is without knowledge of whatever it is that you&#39;re actually talking about in that thread. Conspiracies do require evidence. You can&#39;t just pick a topic at random and make a claim without evidence. Conspiracies are built from hidden evidence and/or evidence being covered up, lied about, or misleading into a deceptive abyss. Maybe you don&#39;t understand the concept of conspiracy and think that it&#39;s to believe everything you hear if it sounds edgy enough and pay no attention to the lack of evidence because it&#39;s only a conspiracy right? If it lacks evidence.. find the evidence or dig deeper otherwise it has no credibility. Don&#39;t say that it&#39;s not needed because it&#39;s just a conspiracy. This post is insulting to anyone who actually does any investigating themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP is wondering why he&#39;s getting shit for posting in a conspiracy sub. It&#39;s not world news. This sub can be full of reptilian conspiracies but it too much to talk about human trafficking? <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/ciadrugsabusemurder.shtml">The Finders</a> happened, it&#39;s definitely worth discussing when someone claims to have found a camp. Just discussing it seems to be frowned upon here. It&#39;s not much of a conspiracy sub when the comments are just regurgitated MSM talking points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Careful; if people online keep pushing for awareness of the possible human trafficking crime scene found in Tucson,  some brainwashed  MK Ultra victim will magically appear when the security cameras are turned and bring a weapon into the goddamned Cemex plant during the first-ever and hastily scheduled Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll deliver several over-scripted lines which will be latched onto by the media and used to demonize truthseekers with preconceived and incorrect associations. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be absolutely incredible if the only shots fired from that hypothetical lunatic&#39;s weapon managed to avoid all people and land safely in the computer hard drive of Cemex&#39;s CEO?</p>

<p>That would be crazy!</p>

<p>TL; DR</p>

<p>People who ask questions are crazy. Don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate witch hunts.  And in the last couple of years the conspiracy community, as well as the Reddit community, have felt it entirely acceptable to accuse people of horrific things with zero evidence so that all the nutjobs can come out and threaten their lives and liberty.</p>

<p>Call me crazy, but I keep thinking &quot;This would totally suck if it happened to me.&quot;  One day I&#39;m bopping right along in my boring life, next thing I know some conspiracy nut (and I say that as a conspiracy theorist myself) creates a blog/YouTube video accusing me of raping children and sacrificing them to satan - has ZERO evidence - but suddenly my boring life has turned into a life dodging death threats and fielding hate mail.</p>

<p>Evidence is simply <strong>NOT</strong> too much to ask when making serious accusations such as pedophilia, rape and murder.</p>

<p>You make a really great point.  But I&#39;ve learned hypocrisy can run strong in this community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Almost none of what VOP/patriot groups/QAnon are claiming is evidence is actually evidence. Some of it is just random stuff left behind by unknown people, that these groups have assumed is linked to trafficking because they want it to be.</p>

<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. A massive sex trafficking camp fueled by Soros/Clinton money is an extraordinary claim.</p>

<p>The evidence for this claim is thin, at best. At worst, it&#39;s entirely made up.</p>
