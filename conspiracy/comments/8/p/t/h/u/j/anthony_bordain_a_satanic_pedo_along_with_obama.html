       Remember when WikiLeaks released an email claiming that Obama spent $65,000 on pizza and hotdogs?  Conspiracy theorists went wild, claiming that pizza and hotdogs is actually code for underage girls (pizza) and hotdogs were code for underage boys.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/crZKCx11VKI?t=3m10s">
        https://youtu.be/crZKCx11VKI?t=3m10s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the link to the email where you can see for yourself.  If you notice the email response below it, they're clearly talking about hotdogs as people!  "To celebrate all you hotdogs out there".

      </p>
      <p>
       Now watch this video.  Anthony Bordain is asking Obama if ketchup is ever acceptable on hotdogs.  Of course the "code" to us conspiracy theorists is that ketchup is blood!  So when Obama responds that ketchup isn't acceptable after age 8, he seems to be saying that they stop bleeding after age 8!  That or they require the blood of children under age 8 for some satanic reason!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the skeptic will claim that he just thinks kids use ketchup on hotdogs, but that's silly!  Plenty of adults love ketchup on hotdogs!
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy grows with responses like this!  Check out how awkward Anthony's respond is, as he's trying to cover up the hidden meaning.

       The age of 8 is a particular number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mormons baptize at age 8 because they believe it's at that age where they lose their innocence, and can now be judged for sins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Catholics allow children their first communion at age 8 too, I'm guessing for the same reason.

       It’s getting downvotes because he was a chef talking about a food item, a food item well connected with the city of Chicago, and the Chicago dog never has catchup on it. While yes, the emails about spending a boatload of money on flying in hotdogs from Chicago is very suspect and likely to be code, that does not mean that every time anyone talking about hotdogs, they are talking about prostitution or whatever the code might be about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anthony Bourdain was known for standing up against sex abuse in the film industry. He is also a chef and this discussion was on a food show. It’s not likely it meant anything more than just a scripted conversation about food on a food show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he was beloved and you probably are getting a lot of downvotes because of that as well. Truth is, your theory is quite a stretch.

       That's true, from an outsider perspective it does seem crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, check out his girlfriend's Instagram and you'll find tons of satanic pedo imagery.  Even many of Anthony's images are dark.  Seems to be they are much more connected than just some people trying to expose sex trafficking.  They seem immersed in it themselves.

       He was dating Asia Argento. She was not friends with Weinstein. She was raped by Weinstein and came out very publicly on stage about it recently at the film festival in Cannes. Anthony Bourdain was very supportive of women coming forward about Weinstein, and tried to raise awareness of the sexual abuse issues in the film industry.

       That's true, but he's also connected to Illuminati and Satanism, as a simple look through his and Asia's Instagram will easily prove.
      </p>
      <p>
       So was he killed for going against Weinstein?  Possibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       However his girlfriend looks completely nuts (you should see the pics she posts).  Maybe she sacrificed him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, they got indicted on charges and he took his own life rather than face punishment.

       It depends on the level of information you're exposed to.  If you know about elite child trafficking then it's easy to see that they're having a little joke about "hotdogs" that the public won't understand.  The awkward way Bourdain responds to try and play it off makes it obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course clueless people will think he just means Chicago hotdogs, and won't get the significance of why he mentioned a specific age at which the "ketchup" is no longer good.

       I’m well aware of child sex trafficking...it has nothing to do with how much information you’re exposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You already have your mind made up, which makes you intellectually vulnerable. You already assume Obama is a satanic child sex sacrificer, so when he talks about fucking KETCHUP on HOTDOGS (how fucking mundane) you automatically jump to him using code words. It really only detracts from the credibility of any discussion on child sex trafficking because it’s so damn ignorant and trigger-happy

       Maybe Obama did have a $65,000 hot dog party, but this tweet isn't anything.  The person replying to you here has pretty much explained it in full.  There's more to dig out there.  8 year olds, or children in general are known to not have a sophisticated taste in food.  So saying that putting ketchup on a hot dog gives you the taste of an 8 year old.  Which would be a slight jab at him since he's a chef and known for having good taste in food.  And Chicago doesn't like ketchup on their hot dogs.  Pretty simple.

       This morning when my Dad mentioned he committed suicide I had a fleeting thought which was: What kind of disgusting shit did he do and what is he escaping from by killing himself?

       He was always very vocal about his past struggles with depression, mental illness and substance abuse. People take their lives all the time and it almost always has nothing to do with them doing anything awful to others. It’s hard to imagine someone with such a nice life killing themselves, but in reality, depression robs you of everything nice so the seemingly nice lifestyle means nothing to you.

       There's no reason for Obama to mention an age when discussing ketchup on hotdogs.  If it's unacceptable, it's unacceptable at any age.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 8 is an interesting number also.  Mormons baptize at age 8.  Catholics give their first communion at age 8.  Apparently many religions believe a child loses their innocence status at age 8.

      <p>
       Also, to add, about your number 8. You say in more than a few religions, it is the age that the child loses their innocence. Well then that really doesnt make sense because these people get their power from the kidnapping, raping, killing, blood drinking of INNOCENCE.

       There’s obviously something strange about Bourdain’s death and everyone knows this.   There’s a lot of people pretending to be super fans of his saying he was depressed.  I just don’t think it adds up and something is going on.  So that means the usual shill tactics off people.   $65000 worth of hot dogs is just....bizarre, and the way Obama and him speak about hot dogs seems weird as well.   It’s like a little wink and nod to each other I assume

       That's true, from an outsider perspective it does seem crazy.

       However, check out his girlfriend's Instagram and you'll find tons of satanic pedo imagery.  Even many of Anthony's images are dark.  Seems to be they are much more connected than just some people trying to expose sex trafficking.  They seem immersed in it themselves.
