        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Codex Gigas, have you heard of it?   </p>

<p>A manuscript like no other, and otherwise known as the Devils Bible because it contains a large and incredibly bizarre illustration of the fallen angel Satan.   </p>

<p>It is the largest medieval manuscript still in existence, made from over 160 animal skins and at almost a meter long, it takes two people just to lift it.   </p>

<p>Written in Latin around 1210 AD, the Codex Gigas has brought disaster and pain to all who have possessed it and many others around them, including plague, mental illness, fire and destruction, the story of it&#39;s life is filled with mystery and evil.   </p>

<p>The manuscript originally had 320 pages, of which, 7 pages have since been removed with no trace, supposedly highly secretive or possibly and more obviously because they contain the monastic rules of the Benedictine monks.   </p>

<p>Legend has it; that it was completed in just one single night, by an individual monk, condemned to inclusion (to be bricked up alive) for his sins, and aided by selling his soul to the Devil; to help guide his hand and perform this impossible task, he bargained the manuscript against his punishment.   </p>

<p>Experts have determined that at a writing speed of 20 seconds per line, and many hours of illustration it would have taken close to 30 years to have created the text with a single scribe.   </p>

<p>Researchers have apparently confirmed that the manuscript WAS penned by a single scribe, possibly a monk by the name of Herman the recluse, and that it was created over a much longer period than the legend describes, yet still can not explain how the exstensive 12 point calligraphy shows such uniformity and absolutely no signs of tiredness, illness or aging as would be inevitable from its creator.   </p>

<p>The researchers believe that the word used for the monks punishment &#39;inclusion&#39; has been misinterpreted, and actually; that the correct translation is the word &#39;recluse&#39;, which is where they believe they have found the scribes name.   </p>

<p>It seems a little strange to me that from the time the scripture was written and followed, in a time where Latin was dominantly used, it would have been incorrectly read, and only now, almost 800 years later someone believes they can read it correctly.   </p>

<p>The Codex Gigas holds the entire Vulgate version of the bible along with Isidore of seville&#39;s encyclopedia Etymologiae, Josephus&#39; Antiquities of the Jews, Cosmas of Prague&#39;s Chronicle of Bohemia, chapters of history, etymology and physiology, a calendar with necrologium, a list of brothers from the Podla≈æice monastery and details of magic formulae, spells, medicine and other local records.   </p>

<p>Apparently, apart from that one single word &#39;inclusion&#39; the entire text is completely perfect and error free.   </p>

<p>And depending on which word you choose to use, the entire text of 320 pages has a thoroughly different meaning.   </p>

<p>Is this a conspiracy to dumb down, separate and segregate religious belief from reality by modern religion?, maybe just simply a blind, closed minded approach to the translation of the text?, or is it realy the incorrect understanding of the original scribes meaning.   </p>

<p>Pick a word, choose for yourself!   </p>

<p>I love the thought of a universal scripture, held within the bindings of a single book approaching the subjects of historic fact, magic and religion all together, and all in line.   </p>

<p>And to actually see this aged historic record (although just from Hi-Res photographs) and contemplate its meaning and the secrets and stories it tells, sends a chill down my spine.   </p>

<p>Make&#39;s me want to believe the legend!   </p>

<p>I wonder what intrigue the missing pages hold?   </p>

<p>I hope you take a little time to look at the links I have posted, even just to look at the pictures, It is a truly wondrous book and an extremely mysterious story, and it has attracted many thousands of people to witness it.   </p>

<p>I am not religious in any sense of the word, but this book, I presume, holds a degree of that knowledge which is no longer readily available to those who do not search for it, and it would be interesting to scan through a translation, if anyone can find one?  </p>

<p>Uhm im no expert but knowing a bit of caligraphy and engraving (working with a substance that cant be fixed) Nobody, no matter how skilled would breeze through a line with just 20 seconds. Its more like 10 minutes per Line on something like this. Anyway amazing piece of work, didnt know about it before. Cool legend aswell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I‚Äôm currently reading a book called ‚Äúthe origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind‚Äù which has an interesting take on the rise of demonic imagery within churches. It posits that in the absence of the ‚Äúgods‚Äù that humanity (at least from their written and oral accounts) could see and hear, illnesses and weather anomalies began being attributed to demons. Since demons weren‚Äôt as powerful as gods, they couldn‚Äôt really be responsible for as many things and this is why you see so many sub classes of demons for different illnesses, weather patterns, mental states, etc. it‚Äôs a proto-‚Äúscientific‚Äù classification and naming system.
Also, this isn‚Äôt just a European trend. </p>
