    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, a bit of conflation, The FBI paragraph is right above the paragraph below (links to Washington Post article)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-still-has-no-clue-about-mystery-illness-striking-us-diplomats-after-inquiry/2018/06/07/a328837a-6a2d-11e8-bbc5-dc9f3634fa0a_story.html?utm_term=.a4b118bfa7c9">Separately, a group of researchers at the University of Michigan suggested that a poorly engineered ultrasonic transmitter, designed to eavesdrop on conversations, could have caused the injuries in Cuba. They said their experiments managed to replicate the metallic chirping sounds that U.S. diplomats heard in conjunction with the attacks in Cuba, raising the likelihood that the injuries were the result of ultrasonic signals.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the theories I&#39;ve heard so far make a whole lot of sense. Who stands to gain by using a weapon like this against American diplomats? Attacking diplomats is a huge risk with very little actual reward. China and Cuba aren&#39;t really in a better position after these attacks. Someone else suggested that it might be an outside group responsible for the attacks and they might be trying to increase tensions between the US and these other countries, but that doesn&#39;t really seem to be happening either. </p>

<p>The only theory I&#39;ve read that I really like so far is that these illnesses are actually the side effect of a listening device or something else and not the actual intended effects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah because I can’t make sense of it, I’m imagining: </p>

<p>What if there is a global conspiracy to attack off shore US resources (or anyones for that matter) and these devices are going to be tested in various environments prior to all being used simultaneously in a coordinated attack? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would think they&#39;d test it on something less obvious than embassy personnel though. Fucking around with diplomats is a big deal. Or at least it would be normally. It&#39;s surprising just how little attention this story is actually getting. As someone else in another thread speculated, it either means our government knows exactly what is going on and they don&#39;t want to reveal it yet, or they have absolutely no clue and don&#39;t want people to realize that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking testing it on Americans may have something to do with our biology or some other physical trait </p>

<p>It may sound nuts, but if there were a weapon that could only effect Americans somehow, well that would be a very desirable weapon indeed to many foreign adversaries</p>

<p>So maybe that’s why the diplomats are being used for testers? </p>
