       Potentially. It's also possible that it's the same country's listening devices just going haywire.

       Canadian diplomats were "sickened"or"injured" or "attacked" in their homes in Cuba as well.

        Separately, a group of researchers at the University of Michigan suggested that a poorly engineered ultrasonic transmitter, designed to eavesdrop on conversations, could have caused the injuries in Cuba. They said their experiments managed to replicate the metallic chirping sounds that U.S. diplomats heard in conjunction with the attacks in Cuba, raising the likelihood that the injuries were the result of ultrasonic signals.

       None of the theories I've heard so far make a whole lot of sense. Who stands to gain by using a weapon like this against American diplomats? Attacking diplomats is a huge risk with very little actual reward. China and Cuba aren't really in a better position after these attacks. Someone else suggested that it might be an outside group responsible for the attacks and they might be trying to increase tensions between the US and these other countries, but that doesn't really seem to be happening either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only theory I've read that I really like so far is that these illnesses are actually the side effect of a listening device or something else and not the actual intended effects.

       Yeah because I can’t make sense of it, I’m imagining:

      <p>
       What if there is a global conspiracy to attack off shore US resources (or anyones for that matter) and these devices are going to be tested in various environments prior to all being used simultaneously in a coordinated attack?

       You would think they'd test it on something less obvious than embassy personnel though. Fucking around with diplomats is a big deal. Or at least it would be normally. It's surprising just how little attention this story is actually getting. As someone else in another thread speculated, it either means our government knows exactly what is going on and they don't want to reveal it yet, or they have absolutely no clue and don't want people to realize that.

       I was thinking testing it on Americans may have something to do with our biology or some other physical trait
      </p>
      <p>
       It may sound nuts, but if there were a weapon that could only effect Americans somehow, well that would be a very desirable weapon indeed to many foreign adversaries
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe that’s why the diplomats are being used for testers?

       There are plenty of Americans that aren't protected by international law that would make way better targets for testing. Attacking embassy personnel just seems like the easiest way bring the full attention of the American government down on you.

       I don't see this as too alternative, I checked out some coverage of this and knowing that these weapons exist, this seems to be exactly what's going on.

       I listen to news from my home country to avoid the bias of American/Western media conglomerates.

       They were talking about this on a radio program and how US diplomats in China are now getting sick and they said this is clearly not an isolated event and it might be something the US diplomats are carrying with them/on them. Basically, the problem isn't everyone else... It's something wrong with
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       . Who knows what it could be though

       The Cubans are not attacking U.S. "diplomats" (or even CIA criminals working under "diplomatic" cover) with sub-sonic weapons.  Lol.  There's another explanation.  And if anything, it's the other way around.  I recall reading somewhere years ago that the U.S. has attacked Cuban society with biological weapons and lots of other kinds of weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cubans want normalized relations with us, as does every other innocent nation we've been attacking since the 1950s.

       I think the embassys have been using some kind of defense against espionage that makes everything vibrate, so it can't be read by lasers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The health probelms are an unintended conseqence, but they discovered it too late and the emabassy personel are paying the price for that.

       back during the GWB days, it was the MO to demob National Guard units fro overseas tours a month before their benefits kicked in, saved the US govt big bucks.

       I suspect this is a similar thing, make em ill then replace them with Trump conformists.

       methinks the current regime does not trust the leftover Obama appointees that are working in various embassys and posts, this is a way to get rid of them.

       This is a theory I enjoy entertaining. So someone high up in research and development for some kind of technology company, not necessarily weapons but maybe, either discovered a method or intentionally developed one. And now it’s being used for practice or are the diplomats the target?
