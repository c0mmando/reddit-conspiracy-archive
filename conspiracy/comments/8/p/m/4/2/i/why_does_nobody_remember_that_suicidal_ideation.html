        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the recent very sad news of the passing of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain, among countless others, depression and the topic of treatment inevitably arises. What never gets mentioned though, is that <em>the very treatment used to combat depression (often, the category of SSRI&#39;s) can exacerbate thoughts of suicide, self harm, and harm to others.</em> This is never mentioned and never gets discussed when in actuality the medications could be the cause of the suicide itself. I think we need to bring more awareness and attention to this very real problem. There are also countless alternative treatment methods for depression, including lifestyle changes, nutritional applications, holistic therapy, exercise, counselling, orthomolecular applications, etc. without resorting to prescription chemicals, but those never get mentioned, or at least, not nearly as often as the first line of treatment. So, what do you think? Is the media willfully ignoring the impact of these drugs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What, and pass up another chance to blame the Podestas/Soros/Clintons/Rothschilds for doing something bad again?</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I think mental health is an issue rarely talked about and rarely understood and one that is a serious problem in the United States. I think antidepressants help a lot, but overall like you said there are so many other natural options available. Overall, this is a problem that has to be tackled on an individual level. Everyone has a different brain chemistry and they should consult with their doctors and plan out the best possible solution. I tend to believe that antidepressants plus a lifestyle change can go a long way in fighting depression. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ADs do not help a lot, depression doesn&#39;t need pills it needs understanding. If one of the biggest pharmaceutical firms discovered a non invasive cure for cancer would they release it? No as they will make more money while people die. Which is why they will throw pills at everything, they care about profit not people. Depression is a social disease, you are not happy in yourself but you don&#39;t know why? You have something lacking, pills may help but don&#39;t cure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree. I struggle with depression, and take ADs. They have helped me a tremendous amount, but it most certainly not a fix-it pill. Therapy and getting out of my comfort zone has been the deciding facotr in how I manage my depression. Oftentimes people just want a pill to fix things for them, without realizing that ADs do&#39;nt work that way. They continue with the same mindset, outlook, habits, etc. and nothing truly changes for them. <strong>(opinion incoming, take with a grain of salt, please. I am no expert in anything)</strong> I dare say that many people who commit atrocities, such as a school shooter, or some of the people who commit suicide while on these presciptions do not change any habits, perhaps because they think ADs will fix them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a true statement at all. Every damn time an antidepressant commercial comes on, anywhere, they paper it with &quot;side effects may include depression and thoughts of suicide&quot;.  </p>

<p>Claiming that is never talked about just isn&#39;t, IMO, true at all. Overmedication, lack of empathy in the United States in general, or the world in general, lack of education in GENERAL--all seem more likely to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about after the fact, after a suicide has taken place? Obviously hard to truly investigate the exact cause, but again, the medications never get mentioned afterwards, when there is clear warning beforehand. The other reasons you mentioned are all a part of it too. But taking something with measurable effects on one&#39;s brain chemistry seems like a huge risk factor to me, especially if one is predisposed to those thoughts as a baseline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhh you’re wrong again, especially in the case of mental health hospitals and Homes they always blame suicides on misdiagnoses and people getting the wrong meds, and ill side effects of the medicines they were prescribed.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah no one&#39;s disputing that you are counselled on the side effects before you begin a regimen. Ha I worked in pharmacy for 10 years, I&#39;m fully aware of the process. You seem to be missing my point though.  </p>

<p>In my title question I asked why does nobody <em>remember</em>. As in, <em>after the fact</em>. And to be fair, I&#39;m not talking about mental health hospitals and homes. I&#39;m talking about high profile celebrity suicides. Where everything else gets discussed except for the prescription drugs they were taking. </p>

<p>Imagine you&#39;re depressed and can&#39;t even get yourself out of bed. Suicide would require effort, but you have no motivation to do anything. You start taking the meds, you&#39;re starting to have more energy and be yourself again, but they haven&#39;t fully kicked in and your suicidal thoughts haven&#39;t gone away.

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t true. They increase suicidal ideation. So more people report thinking about suicide, not more people committing suicide. Some people have depression but have never even considered suicide, then start thinking about it as a side effect of taking the drugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the media is either ignorant or definitely overlooking the impact of these rugs.  I also think the same when it comes to the high-school shooters.  Virtually every last one of them has had a history of antidepressant/psychotropic drug use.  I am so glad to see you posting about this.  It is my firm belief that Psychiatry and Big Pharma have a lot of blood on their hands as a result of their pushing these pills at people, and I don&#39;t think it will ever be publicly acknowledged because they are making them a fortune and the last thing they would want is to see these drugs taken off the market - who cares how many people might still be alive otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You gotta understand that, as crooked as big pharma can be or seem to be, they got rules to follow - rules that prevent lawsuits.</p>

<p>These rules include citing every single thing the guinea pigs experienced during trials. A guy, out of 4000, suddenly died with no logical explanation during a trial phase? There goes your sudden death side effect.</p>

<p>The same applies to depression and suicidal thoughts; if someone is depressed and wants to try an experimental treatment, and reports feeling depressed during the trial, there goes your side effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have some amateur insight into this. Brain chemistry varies from person to person. A medication that works really well for someone can have terrible side effects for someone else. I’ve been struggling with depression for years and have tried many different antidepressants. Finally, I decided to take a gene swap test. They basically study your DNA and use that to determine what medication will work well for you.  Only a few medications worked well with my brain chemistry, while a majority did not. So yes, they can make it worse if it’s not the right one for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did your DNA test results help you find a medication that helped your particular flavor of depression? I imagine having that data would be useful to weed out certain groups of meds, but then I think it would still be a lot of trial and error. And it&#39;s the trial and error that drives a lot of already sad people to new levels of despair, feeling like the situation is hopeless because they aren&#39;t responding well to x, y, z meds, while also dealing with the intense (often nightmarish) side effects. Tapering on and off antidepressants a couple times would make any sane person feel fucking crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the test seemed to be really reliable. All of the medications I had tried in the past were in the red zone, meaning they were all horribly incompatible. There were to in the green zone and I tried one of them, and it worked much better then any I had tried previously. I tell whoever I can about it, as it saves a lot of trial and error and is well worth it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never know what to really think about this because it seemed like they helped me when I was dangerously depressed, but soon after that it felt like I was feeling better but actually started to SH. I was very numb and I think that is a factor of it, also some people who start ADs will get more motivation to go about with their suicide plans because some medications can make people manic or just have more energy than when they’re depressed and can’t get out of bed. It’s scary how there’s so many yet they keep saying you just have to find the right one, well shit how many years of trial and error can one take if it’s making their symptoms worse? Is it even worth experimenting when it’s a hit or miss, especially considering the black box warnings on them?? There are SO MANY they could throw at you to try. I’m nervous to go back on any partly because of this reason, I feel like I’ll be better off just staying away from them period despite everyone saying I’d benefit from them. At least I have kratom which I believe is way safer than even Tylenol, let alone antidepressants. </p>

<p>Yes, ADs did get me out of a bad episode, but I started to self harm a few months after them. The numbness can be so fucking dangerous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>why is a suicide agenda pushed so thoroughly in the media. so it&#39;s seen as a normal thing and you don&#39;t question otherwise. suicide isn&#39;t normal and it&#39;s not normal for people to be depressed. but I guess it&#39;s easier to take a pill rather than fix your diet and lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about after the fact, after a suicide has taken place? Obviously hard to truly investigate the exact cause, but again, the medications never get mentioned afterwards, when there is clear warning beforehand. The other reasons you mentioned are all a part of it too. But taking something with measurable effects on one&#39;s brain chemistry seems like a huge risk factor to me, especially if one is predisposed to those thoughts as a baseline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did your DNA test results help you find a medication that helped your particular flavor of depression? I imagine having that data would be useful to weed out certain groups of meds, but then I think it would still be a lot of trial and error. And it&#39;s the trial and error that drives a lot of already sad people to new levels of despair, feeling like the situation is hopeless because they aren&#39;t responding well to x, y, z meds, while also dealing with the intense (often nightmarish) side effects. Tapering on and off antidepressants a couple times would make any sane person feel fucking crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yet, that doesn&#39;t sound like clinical depression as it is defined by some sort of reductive matter of brain chemistry.</p>

<p>Actually, sounds more like circumstantial misery. Change the circumstance, remove the misery.</p>

<p>It is so infuriating how the same mentalities pushing meds would have had no problem subduing a Nazi-dominated Jewish ghetto in Poland with this &quot;My my-look at all the rampant depression circulating around here. Tsk.&quot;</p>
