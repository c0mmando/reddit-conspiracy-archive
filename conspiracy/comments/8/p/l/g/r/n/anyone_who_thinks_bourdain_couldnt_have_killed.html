       Depression is a vicious monster, and people keep it shoved down as far as they can for as long as they can. At least American men do. People kill themselves out of nowhere for no apparent reason all the time - and more are doing it now than ever.

       It's not a conspiracy. It's a disease. And rather than worry about the "deep state" "suiciding" everyone who "knows too much," worry about your friend who seems off, or your loved one who is starting to withdraw from life.

       They might be telling you...screaming at you...that something is wrong. And you're too busy chasing shadows and cabals to see it.

       Is it being reported that he hung himself? I haven't heard, but I haven't been hitting news sites much today. I'm not sure I'd call it "odd" in regards to suicide. People hang themselves. Second most used method, 25% of suicides from what I just googled. So really it's far from odd.

       It's not rare overall, but for a rich person who could kill themselves any way they want, as well as having expressed a desire to choose ODing by heroin as a suicide choice, it does seem odd.

       Can you just go out on the street and score junk? Maybe he could, maybe he couldn't. As an ex junkie, I'm pretty sure he knew an OD isn't the quick quiet way out that it is in movies. Again, people hang themselves. Rich or poor has nothing to do with it. If it's the most available method, it's the method you use. If you don't, you might lose your resolve. Maybe if he scored, he might have just chipped and fallen back into that world instead of ending it. I'm sure he had scored and gone that way people would be saying why didn't he hang himself. Can't please everyone.

       If someone found me hanging from a doorknob, I hope people would be skeptical. It's not disrespectful to want to know what happened, if anything it's quite the opposite.

       Staging a murder as a suicide is a common practice and don't forget you're on a conspiracy forum. If you don't like people questioning things like this then you're in the wrong place.

        I think tuscon is a psyop. Like comet. I think comet did do a shit ton of child trafficking but damage control took care of everything.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Tl;dr tuscan and ping pong are being used to say child raping is fake news, it dosent happen. Look at the crazies who think its real. See we investigated and we say its fake. Remeber theres no such thinh as the ruling class fucking your kids because its fake news and isnt real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intro:
      </p>
      <p>
       Real child rapist and traffickers operate in broad daylight. People like Jerry Sandusky (football coach child rapist and provider of children), Jeffery Epstine (child rapist, child provider, and owner and operator of the lolita express), and Jimmy Savile (child rapist, child provider, and known killer of children) ALL operate in broad day light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people knew that they raped and provided children. And many people helped them cover their tracks. Jimmy Savill was never outed till after his death. Sandusky was outed but his operation was not. Jeffery Epstine is convicted and let go. Each of these people have really interesting stories if you ask people on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       On to what you asked:
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet ping pong is a pizzaria owned by james alafantes, a suspected rothschild. The pizzaria is operated in a known CIA town. Basically everyone and their neighbor works for a clandescent alphabet agency. We allready know clandescent agencies work with children as a currency. It is a main modus operandi, see cynthia mckenny and dyncorp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet ping pong was suspected of being a front for child trafficking.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/cg5rhg3lqjs">
        Here is a girl screaming for help in comet
       </a>
       . I cant find it, but there is a video of the neighbor who regularly complains he hears screaming in comet. And he allegedly has called the police several times about the screaming. The neighbor is adament that children are being raped in comet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet has wall art that is pornographic in nature. It is advertized as a family friendly pizzeria. "Bring your kids and lets play ping pong." And they also forget to mention look at pornographic pictures on our walls. That have since taken it down. But there are pictures online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet has lots of fucked up after parties. They are invite only parties with extremly fucked up themes.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/vlhBn_zSIro">
        Here is a band that playes there
       </a>
       . Now dont get me wrong, im all for sexual deviance and wierd shit. But i draw the line at fucking kids. Its because i feel children should be allowed to grow up with out being the subject of an adults sexual objectification. The lead singer of the band is outspoken on his stance for kiddy fucking. This guy is for it. You can look that stuff up, im sorry but im a lazy internet warrior lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest things for me was comet ping pong posting a picture of
       <a href="http://elitepedos.com/2017/01/14/researcher-finds-kill-room-and-receives-death-threats-from-james-alefantis/">
        their basement kill room.
       </a>
       You can CLEARLY see jimmy comet posted this. That is james alafantes. He posted the picture, says it looks fun, and then says hastage murder. He then says he dosent have a basement. He vehemently denies a basement. But in an article printed in like 2006 he brags about his homemade sauce and how he makes the sauce in the basement.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also was caught fucking a teenage boy. He was in a mentor role relationship and definatly took advantage of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then finally, ping pong had a server in the resturant. When all this came out black hats discovered it and noticed it had insane amounts of storage for a single page website. Like a web site would want to be small so it can operate fast. Maybe a single gb tops. Instead this server had backend access to several terabytes of data. It also had a username log on and password for people to remotly access this large data holding system.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as this became known, the black hat community began working to gain access to the data. About two days later, a person with ties to alafantes and the entertainment industry through work and family came into comet "ranting and raving" with a gun and shot a single shot in the building. He shot the server straight through its heart. Destroying ALL data stored and ability to recover what was on the server.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then ping pong was blasted all over the news. The word fake news was made up. And comet ping pong was used to prove conspiracy theory people are nuts, and theres no such thing as rich people fucking your kids. But we know that is a lie because of saville, epstine, and sandusky.

       No, Bourdain had a history of depression and drug abuse.  Doesn't surprise me at all that he did it. And if he didn't I'm not hearing anything more compelling than his history pointing toward suicide.

       Or maybe its just people are tired of wild accusations and want an iota of evidence before believing something. Granted I'm not big on people telling others not to talk about something. Talk all you want. Just dont expect people that use critical thinking to jump on your bandwagon until you have some proof of any type.

       Ad hominem? You should probably look that up before you start throwing it around in public (and I’m not jut talking about your spelling). My point, clearly lost on you, was that your requirements are your own and certainly not ones to be imposed in a place literally named “conspiracy”.

       A hypothesis is an educated guess. Its not random statements to push a narrative one way or the other.

      <p>
       Simply saying oh it wasnt suicide it was murder isnt a hypothesis. Its an uneducated guess.

       youre right. those showing signs - generally dont want to kill themselves - they just want to get help.   those that finish the deed, wont let you know b/c then they cant get to their goal.  My husband killed himself 10 yrs ago. He went to work, said  "I love you , see you when I get home."  It was weeks before we found him hanging from a bridge at a disused park. Some people wont understand unless they live it. Im sorry you felt so hopeless. As a fellow human, Im grateful you didnt do it.  We only get this one time to be ourselves. Its worth it to stick it out.

       I'm truly sorry for your lost. That being said, be careful with the kind of info you are spreading around. When u say this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "youre right. those showing signs - generally dont want to kill themselves - they just want to get help. those that finish the deed, wont let you know b/c then they cant get to their goal."
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't help but think u r a little off there. Maybe this is how it was for your own personal experience, but that's not how it is for everybody. Everybody's circumstance is different. To think that those showing signs don't really want to kill themselves and that only people who aren't showing signs are the real serious ones sounds like a dangerous precedent to set and a slippery slope.

       thats why I used the term "generally".  I have a degree in grief counselling &amp; bereavement. Ive been involved with group therapy for teen girls with abuse &amp; self harm issues for decades. Slippery slope.? Life is a slippery slope.

       Bourdain was a man who openly struggled with addiction and mental health issues. The only reason people are trying to “shut down” dialogue about it is because people are being wildly disrespectful to him and his legacy by insinuating that he was part of something more sinister. Not everything has to be a conspiracy, this was just a good dude who took his life.

       Its sad that with these kind of things people would rather go through so many loops by making it a conspiracy rather than recognizing mental illness exists and it can effect anyone. Same thing with school shootings, people want it all to be some convoluted setup with crisis actors and fake blood, refusing to acknowledge the possibility that one kid with a severe mental illness decided to acquire a firearm and go on a shooting spree. The U.S has a mental health epidemic, and things are only going to get worse until we drop the silly conspiracies and get to the truth of the matter.

       Yeah, I've been getting downvoted a lot lately for going against the grain. Funny how these people will claim to be the ones persecuted but they usually always have a platform for this nonsense while those skeptical are downvoted into oblivion. I agree with you entirely though, these people put on such a show but they are ultimately ineffective and can't do anything outside of their circlejerks.

       Literally never said I thought he relapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m saying, maybe the reason he hung himself, rather than OD, is because he didn’t want his family and loved ones thinking he had relapsed. Maybe being sober was important to him, thus no pills as well.

       That's not what the person you're replying to said, but, honestly - is that (or some variation) so hard to believe? I have no idea if he relapsed and don't personally think he did, but if it comes out that that's what happened, I would think that makes sense. Why is it so crazy to you?

       Not everyone is the bogeyman. Let me explain my thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I come to this sub because I enjoy reading about conspiracy theories, and believe in a few, but not all. I'm not going to take everything at face value and just accept it because I'm on a conspiracy sub. There is nothing wrong with being skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a person with depression and anxiety. It is almost always present, rarely apparent from the outside, and never rational. I don't know when the next time I'll think about killing myself will be. Hopefully not for a long time, but I am sure it will happen again. That's just the nature of depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression and suicide are not rational, which our brains don't like. We look for connections. So I understand why any suicide will breed conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem with this, however, is that suicide is a huge problem, and sweeping it under the rug is not helpful. We need to address it. We need to talk about it. We need to understand it. We need to properly fund mental health services.
      </p>
      <p>
       So hopefully you see where I and others are coming from. Or you can keep believing we are secret agents here to compromise a fucking meaningless internet forum, as if TPTB will be taken down by a gif of old buildings or whatever else is on the front page currently.

       So he's rational enough to make a TV show, have a daughter, and do all this other stuff, but then you think in a moment of weakness he chose one of the more painful and slow methods of killing himself? It's possible but I'm just not buying it. You're not the only one who knows the nature of depression.

       But he's dealt with this issues for literally decades. And his mom and himself said he's feeling better this year than he has in a while, in recent interviews. He had plans for how to kill himself, if he were to do so, that he had publicly stated.

       I think the quote from him was that he was 'relatively happy', which is hard to judge. Sorry if I'm wrong.

       Do you have a source on him having plans on how he would do it? I've tried googling for it but can't find it. Also, if someone killed him and faked a suicide, and he has published plans for how he would do it, wouldn't they follow those plans?

       Yes, which is exactly what makes the hanging so suspicious.

      <p>
       I tried to find a source on him wanting to OD on heroin as a preferred method of suicide, but it's very difficult to find now because it keeps pulling up stories of his actual suicide. I definitely read it a few days ago though. If I find it I'll let you know.

       I'll never understand why people have such a problem with others discussing potential conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think there is just a problem of communication and understanding. When someone says "Bordain couldn't have killed himself because he said he wanted to stick around of his daughter's sake," that doesn't mean the person necessarily thinks its impossible that he didn't do it. The person could just be expressing his or her strong opinion that it seems suspicious.

       So let's change the definition of exposing from "reveal the true, objectionable nature of (someone or something)." to "repeat well-known information for millionth time." Because yeah, then you are totally right. He was an exposer just like the million other celebrities condemning the rapist. I mean, niggas gonna get their hands full murdering everyone.

       There are gonna be people who flock to the idea of posting some theory every time a celebrity dies. Every single time. I think people need to realize that they are just people at the end of the day.

       Bro, this sub has ALWAYS BEEN skewed towards paranoid delusions. How long have you been here? Know what I do when I see what I think are paranoid delusions? I downvote and move on. Why come to meeting of people that enjoy a particular hobby and tell people their hobby is dumb?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's no secret this sub is full of shills that are actively trying to discredit everyone. Anytime someone commits suicide, you can basically assume there will be people here claiming everything under the sun about said suicide. So why bother trying to discredit? We already have a dedicated group of people that will try to do that anyway. If you think it's stupid, just downvote and make a post about something you think is valid.

       So the fact that some of these deaths look and seem suspect makes them paranoid delusions? I really don't care that much about this tbh i used to but it's just like weird to see  theories and theorists being talked about the same way the mainstream media does it in the conspiracy sub reddit of all places.

       I like how its the calm guy saying 'I dont believe this' yet the conspiracy reaction is the irrational one when any organic honest user would know 99% of the time its the other way around. People with minds open to more possibilities than the average person dont usually flock to little corners so they can await for their beloved skeptics to arrive so they can berate them. Now the other way around?

       This is something I like to bring up when  the topic of why someone would commit suicide is being discussed. Life can be absolutely torturous in the heads of some. How can some people call those who do take their lives, pussies and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This specifically reminds me of my oldest friend. He even posted this to his Facebook like 6 years ago. He has changed alot since the 2016 elections and all that and this shit storm. I wonder if he still feels the same way? Or has changed that opinion since he leans so heavily on the side that discourages that kind of degrading of people and accepting of mental illnesses.

       Man, if you think suicide is never a logical conclusion, that it is committed only by the mentally unwell, you simply have no idea what you are talking about. People take for granted without any examination that life should be lived in its entirety. Depression isn't simply illogical, either.

       I was addicted to heroin for many years and got clean about 15 years ago.  Every single day after has been a struggle.  It is something you don't forget and you long for daily.  You feel like your life isn't complete without it.  Any tragedy you experience after getting off it makes you want to run towards it again.  I feel for him and hope he has finally found peace.

       My cousin hung himself a month ago. He got absolutely blackout hammered to do it, they found an empty HANDLE of vodka. Drank the whole thing and hung himself. People do hang themselves. I don't know why, it isn't what I would do if I were going to do it, but people do it.

       Lost an older friend of mine years ago who hung himself. Used a loop of wire with a slip-knot tied to his basement ceiling. Simply leaned back enough into it to cut off the blood supply and black-out, letting his unconscious body weight finish the job of cutting off his air after he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, it's not difficult, painful, or necessary to struggle with being strangled in the process as anyone might suppose. I never actually knew that, either, before that happened.

       Thank you for relating to me. Oddly enough it helps even on the internet in a grievous time. My cousin did it with his own climbing gear, he loved climbing. Idk if that was supposed to be a metaphor or what but it's darkly poetic to me.

       It's one of the less painful and more effective ways to go and requires little planning or resources. Moreso cutting off the blood supply to the brain than traditional hanging by asphyxiation.

       But you'd think if someone went to the trouble to kill him, staging it to make it look like suicide by hanging, they'd just have injected him with a "Hot Shot" of heroin.  Easier and less suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it odd too though, simply because he was so tall.  But in looking at the type of room he probably stayed in at Le Chambard, it would've been possible.

       I mean it may still come out that he OD'd and it was autoerotic asphyxiation or something. If they're smart they'll have covered their tracks in this way.

       In the end, we'll probably never know for sure. All I know is there are enough coincidences to warrant a real investigation.

       It's strange that there has been no real investigation. Often they will say 'X has died' and further details can come later. This was deemed a suicide straight away, all over the MSM from day 1.

       Maybe. Maybe they do not want a high profile murder on their hands. Or as is the case with corruption from within, maybe those investigating were "hand-picked" and told what to find and what to ignore. Very quick forensic and crime scene analysis too.

       Its also so hard to stay clean from it do to the amount of dopamine which is flooded into your brain. Opiates flood the brain by 10x the amount it would naturally so after long term use the pleasure sensor takes that much more to produce the feeling of happiness or euphoria. I know how you feel because i also am a recovering addict. I don't have to explain the deep depression you fall into as an addict at times and I mean it when I say I am genuinely happy for you. The road to recovery is long and its a lifetime battle. I'm not trying to turn this into a recovery post but the point I'm trying to make is no one has the slightest clue what someone is feeling and people who are hurting the most are the people who seem to hide it the best.
If you have a friend or loved one who is struggling with depression/ mental illness...reach out to them and let them know how much you love them sometimes all it takes is for someone telling someone suffering that you're there for them because shit like this makes you feel like you're on a row boat in the ocean without oars.
      </p>
      <p>
       I commend you on your sobriety...stay strong friend.

       In my area of expertise they were just inventing shit to do with no grounding in value or economics. I spent 40&amp;#37; of my time just doing box checking bullshit that a person with no High School education could do!

       I don't mean this as any disrespect to you and wish you continued strength and success in your sobriety, but I've started to entertain the idea that opiod addiction is a essentially a terminal illness.  It seems to be pretty true that once a person becomes addicted to opiods , the chances of that being what ultimately leads to their death becomes an almost foregone conclusion.  And even if you are recovering (or to share some terminology, in remission) , it hangs above you like a sword of Damacles, always threatening to wrestle control of your life away from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sincerely hope you continue to have the will and energy to fight and win against it.

       Why would he hang himself though instead of OD on heroin like he had said he would do if he were to kill himself? Where did he get the rope, did he go to a hardware store in paris and buy rope?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very possible he didn't kill himself. If you're not even open to the
       <em>
        possibility
       </em>
       then you're just pushing an agenda.

       This is a different conversation than that. I'm all for having that discussion too because mental health is very important. However I don't see that as a justification to shut down alternative conversations.

       It is actually extremely difficult for people who are depressed to find a path to a better existence and even harder for friends and family to recognize the signs someone needs help and the proper way to extend that helping hand. Mental illness is as diverse as the people that makes up our society even within all of the sub categories. Mental illness is a custom trait that is expressed or not expressed differently in every person.

       I want to give you an upvote just because this sub is hilarious and prone to implosion.  i think you make a very good point and I believe 100&amp;#37; that Bordain was a troubled person who could have killed himself.  I find it hilarious that even suggesting there is no conspiracy automatically puts you in the shill camp.  Keep drinking that Fool-Aid, shill!

       in come the damage control huh? The narrative is changing and people are becoming wise to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people have been dying by hanging. Remember that pharma couple that died by hanging and that was declared a homicide? Yet when others die of hanging it's a suicide?
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually the pharma couple was first ruled a suicide but then a homicide.
      </p>

       <p>
        Canadian homicide detectives on Sunday took the lead in investigating the mysterious deaths of pharmaceuticals billionaire Barry Sherman and his wife, Honey, a day after relatives complained about the handling of the case.

       Just odd that these suicides often end in hanging.

       Seems it would be very easy to strangle someone and then put a rope around their neck... that retcon ‘suicide’ would be much easier to stage than gunshots and poison,
      </p>
      <p>
       But if all of these recent celebrity suicides are legit, why is it hanging? Are these people into autoerotic fixation or whatever its called when you choke yourself and rub your bits? I mean, statistically, it seems off.
No celebrities are jumping from rooftops and I only know of that one B-list comedian recently that shot himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Death by Hanging seems to be pretty vogue right now, whether it’s a ‘conspiracy’ or not.

       This is ridiculous , the whole point of this page is to question everything. Posts like this are the reason I believe in shills and the deep state. This is a place where skepticism should be rewarded not shit on. Take your propaganda elsewhere shill.

       Everyone on and on about this being a conspiracy.

      <p>
       Someone says, skeptically, that it could be just a suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is angry for him being a skeptic and demands that he should be

       Thanks, this nicely summed up what was wrong with the reaction on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem lately is that any naysayers to these conspiracies seem to fuel the fire, they are called shills and people are saying "we must be on to something."
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe someone could tell me, what would happen in a conspiracy post if there wasn't one, single person that disagreed?  What is the special outcome there that is so sought after, would it really make a difference in the end?

       Mate this is hilarious, one second your being condescending and shutting down the discussion, the next you're preaching like you have the answers. You mocked me for suggesting that Bourdain's efforts to expose Weinstein could have put a target on his back. Instead of thinking about it at all or trying to engage you instead use sarcasm and say "hur dur everyone and their mother was calling for weinsteins head".
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Bourdain exceptional to that at all? Any other factors that bring him closer personally to the situation? YES. He's dating a victim who is best friends with the main accuser. This is as close to the eye of that storm as you can get. Maybe it doesn't stop at Weinstein maybe he's the scape goat and it goes higher than he. Maybe Anthony was trying to convince people that they can go further with this and bring the whole thing down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of engaging in any sort of discussion you were rude and tried to put me down. Don't come in here playing your trumpet like a golden boy here to guide the masses when you're just playing the same stupid games as everyone else. Christ

       I'm sorry you took it that way.  The immediate suspicion of every suicide gets on my nerves because I had one happen very close to me.  I still don't get why people can't just defend their beliefs or ignore the people that disagree, but I'll leave that discussion for another time.

       I'm sorry to hear that, so have I, so have most people. Suicide is unfortunately becoming common place.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that any effort to stifle conversation isn't helping anyone. I get that this place can be frustrating (I've watched it implode over the passed 2 years to the point where I no longer post besides the odd comment) but you perfectly embodied the problem with discussion, you saw the way the thread was going and you had to jump in with a snarky comment that had no bearing when you actually thought about it for 2 seconds.

       I agree. I was suicidal 3 times in my life, all for very stupid reasons, well stupid to me now. In all those cases, something woke me out of it. A friend, the love of my life (without knowing it) and family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I literally had a long deep conversation about this with my wife on Wednesday. I let her know I had once been like this. Almost 20 years together, and she never knew. I feel so much better now than I ever have.

       Maybe he couldn't stop it. Maybe his shows, etc were getting to be too much. Who knows, but to say it was a conspiracy out and out is ridiculous. Without knowing his actual state of mind, and what was going on around him, you can't make that call.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read another post about being with his best friend in Paris, blah blah blah, he would never do it there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he felt it was the only place to do it... It was home to him.

       Nah, that's not what this forum is for. Suicide prevention and education are for other forums. People to get  "suicided" and so we owe anyone who has apparently committed suicide the benefit  of an investigation, the benefit of  the doubt that they would give up on live and abandoned their loved ones. I'm fine with considering other alternatives, because Bourdain won't be able to ever tell us what happened.

       My brother was my best friend. We told each other everything. Except he never mentioned to me that he was feeling depressed and that his life was weighing him down. He was so bubbly and happy and optimistic about everything. And then one day he wasn’t. And that’s the day he ended it. I will always regret not asking him more. We shared everything but he didn’t share this with me. He didn’t tell me or even allude to it. Life was good. But then it wasn’t. It’s been six years and it still hurts.

       Lots of people judge you really harshly just for being depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told some friends when I was depressed years ago and they basically cut me out which only exacerbated my depression. I had ONE friend who would do what he could to get me out of the house and try to have some fun, or just hang out and talk about whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either they just can’t handle it or they think it means you’re crazy. I don’t understand that mindset, I’d be there for a friend if I knew they felt so bad they wanted to die. I’d be there for someone even if they weren’t my friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s definitely a lot of people like my friend out there, but there’s even more who just don’t understand or maybe flat out don’t empathize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m so sorry for your loss and sorry your brother didn’t reach out. Keep him in your heart, that love lives on.

       And sometimes there's a positive change in their apparent emotions.

       Some get happy and more upbeat once they have decided when to end their life, they give gifts and seem calm and collected.

       Everyone please stop discussing this topic immediately. Depression is totally normal and there are no warning signs, we wouldn't understand anyway as OP has stated. Everything revolving his death is simply a coincidence. We apparently don't "know a damn thing a suicide" after all.

       I lost an old friend to depression-induced suicide in 2009, someone who had been suffering from various mental health woes for the previous nearly
       <strong>
        ten years
       </strong>
       .  I hadn't seen him in a while, but attended his funeral, where very tactful use of words revealed a tragic truth: he had got infinitely worse just before the end, worse in  way that had never been seen in him before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression is pure evil and utterly horrifying.  A non-physical illness which forces many sufferers to
       <em>
        end their own lives to escape it
       </em>
       . Just let that sink in for a moment.

       The worst part is that there's this stigma around therapy that there shouldn't be. You don't just tough it out when you have cancer, you see a doctor, and depression is a disease of the mind.

       I assume it might be an accidental overdose on an elicit substance. I heard him on a podcast recently and he seemed extatic about life, he was in the middle of filming an episode. He had a young daughter with who he had a good relationship with. I think they just don't want people to know he used.

       Because energy could be spent researching much more likely conspiracies or components of big conspiracies(ie MIC, PIC, etc). Also thinking every celeb death is a conspiracy is a pretty low standard-very low-hanging fruit, so to speak. Also, turning every celeb suicide into something more shows how much this sub really does care about celebrity culture. And so on. People here complain about the masses laughing at conspiracy theorists but continue entertaining eye roll-inducing theories like this.

       You realize... if there hadn't been several deaths with the same M.O
       <em>
        this week
       </em>
       which also was labeled by Q as "suicide week", along with several deaths last year with yet again the same M.O*, on top of the fact that they almost all had potential ties to all this sex trafficking/child abuse/#MeToo/Weinstein  stuff and ...that no one here would care?  Like if Kim Kardashian killed herself none of us would give a shit.

       Last time I checked, American depression is the same as depressions elsewhere on the world. Why do you think this is significant to say?

       It's more an illness by definition. Also why is it wrong to think it's a conspiracy on a conspiracy subreddit?

       Be right back, grabbing some tissues. I'm tearing up by this emotional comment.

       Look, Depression is a vitamin deficiency. Look into this, and if people you see are depressed, have them go on the Element Iodine, then look into Niacin and Vitamin C. These people are just not getting the nutrients, make sure they take some enzymes to be able to absorb them. People need to start taking care of themselves first before any conspiracy, you can't make a person feel better if they are missing an essential nutrient that is making them feel so crappy, they want to die due to the pain that missing nutrient is creating. I am so SICK of doctors, therapists NOT GETTING IT!
