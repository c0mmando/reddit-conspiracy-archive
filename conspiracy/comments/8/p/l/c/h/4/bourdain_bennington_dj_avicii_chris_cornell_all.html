       Yes but these people came out to discuss it. Not just to say it's wrong but to claim knowledge of it and to rail against it. Avicii for example was said to have direct knowledge of it happening and was working on exposing it.

       I could see suicide ranking fairly highly on a list of causes of death for human trafficking supporters. A period of clarity where they stop and look at what they have done, followed by their attempt to make amends for what they have done.

       I think that's fair. The thing that gets me is they all hung themselves. I don't know about you but if I'm killing myself I'd probably choose different than you. It's all coincidence but it's odd that they all killed themself similarly and in a way I'd find more unique than a firearm or pills.

       Agreed, that’s kinda odd. But to be honest the internet has ruined me to the point that I’ll believe that they might have been doing some auto-erotic asphyxiation type move.

       Cornell had CHRONIC depression, some bouts leading to him being on "suicide watch" for WEEKS at a time. (the "average" is apparently 3 days, and no I dont know how they got that figure either????)
Chester Bennington also suffered from depression and was DEEPLY affected by Cornells death, ending his own life on Chris' birthdate

        Not sure you're correct there
       </a>
       They are all US citizens so I used that as the method.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you about Bennington/Cornell being related. It's likely nothing, but Bourdain? Avicii? Spade? Just really odd so many and all similar.

       To be honest, I guess if I was thinking suicide, I'd want to go a method that was both effective and painless. Like too many pills or in a car with the exhaust piped in. I just can't see someone wanting to hang themselves as a means to an end.

       Aaaah, gotcha. I just looked world wide. 
And to be honest, I never even thought of pills/ overdose as a method, It's reaaly quite difficult here in the u.k. to buy any amount of painkillers etc.
 That might be seen as "troubling" ... a 12 pack of Anadin is about the largest you can get in one go?

       Hanging is a very prevalent form of suicide it tends to be a very dramatic way to go out..... I would be more interested in the prescription medications that they where taken then their moral stance against human trafficking..... I am a firefighter and have run multiple calls for suicide gunshots hanging ODs but the one major thing most of these people had in common was they where battling depression and being treated with antidepressants and other various forms of SSRIs....the real conspiracy is the lies being told to the patients being prescribed these medications.... I would suggest anyone to do some research on it these drugs are terrible.... I am sure they have helped some so I don’t want to totally bash them but the truth is we are all being force fed a bunch of pills from any doctor we go see.....

       I did not realize it was this prevalent. I guess I just figured people would want something less painful. It shocks me to realize how many people choose this way instead of falling asleep.

       People die. It happens. I don't think this sub deals with death that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of you need to go outside and experience more life. I'm not even 30 but I've dealt with enough death to ask why? Was it something more? It's always personal. Why did they hang why OD? I never got to know and nobody ever gets full details because it was personal.
      </p>
      <p>
       People get sad and think it's the only way to deal. Not every death is a conspiracy. Do you not think of your death? It's a constant thought in the humans brain.

       Bourdain wasn't an opponent of the sex-trafficking industry; he was a client. Check out his connection to the NXIVM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bourdain was a hedonist, and an elitist. If you thought, he ate exotic and disgusting things, imagine the "meals" he consumed with Marina Abramovich ad crew.
      </p>
      <p>
       4Chan is already linking to stories about how Bordain ordered girls: ages 6 - 9.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitch probably had kuru from human flesh he was eating "as a delicacy for the elite".

       You know: Because he wasn't constrained by morality like us peasants.

       (And, yes, he was murdered by the very people he hung around with. Good riddance.)

       Can anyone send links of Chris Cornell or Chester Bennington vocally announcing their protesting of sex trafficking? I hear everyone share this theory but never actually see anything said by those two about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's a conspiracy thread, but is it really so hard to think that sad people kill themselves sometimes, especially after their close friend recently does the same (in Chester's regard)?
