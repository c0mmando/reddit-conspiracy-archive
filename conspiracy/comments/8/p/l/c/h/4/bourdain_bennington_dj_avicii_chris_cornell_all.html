    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s fair. The thing that gets me is they all hung themselves.

Cornell had CHRONIC depression, some bouts leading to him being on &quot;suicide watch&quot; for WEEKS at a time. (the &quot;average&quot; is apparently 3 days, and no I dont know how they got that figure either????)
Chester Bennington also suffered from depression and was DEEPLY affected by Cornells death, ending his own life on Chris&#39; birthdate

<p>I agree with you about Bennington/Cornell being related. It&#39;s likely nothing, but Bourdain? Avicii? Spade? Just really odd so many and all similar.</p>

<hr/>

<p>To be honest, I guess if I was thinking suicide, I&#39;d want to go a method that was both effective and painless. Like too many pills or in a car with the exhaust piped in. I just can&#39;t see someone wanting to hang themselves as a means to an end.</p>

And to be honest, I never even thought of pills/ overdose as a method, It&#39;s reaaly quite difficult here in the u.k. to buy any amount of painkillers etc.

    <div class="md"><p>Hanging is a very prevalent form of suicide it tends to be a very dramatic way to go out..... I would be more interested in the prescription medications that they where taken then their moral stance against human trafficking..... I am a firefighter and have run multiple calls for suicide gunshots hanging ODs but the one major thing most of these people had in common was they where battling depression and being treated with antidepressants and other various forms of SSRIs....the real conspiracy is the lies being told to the patients being prescribed these medications.... I would suggest anyone to do some research on it these drugs are terrible.... I am sure they have helped some so I don’t want to totally bash them but the truth is we are all being force fed a bunch of pills from any doctor we go see..... </p>
