They can turn invisible to the human eye, and they can go completely undetected by even our most advanced RADAR capabilities (our RADAR technology is incredibly advanced, truly brilliant stuff). They can basically fly as fast as a bullet. That&#39;s the stuff they show off over our own carriers, so imagine the stuff they don&#39;t want anyone to see. But again, that&#39;s assuming the AAVs (Anomalous Aerial Vehicles) are our own. If they&#39;re not our own, then I do not have a proper answer to your question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The military is on par with what the public has knowledge of. U.S. military is not actively using any technology that is more advanced than what any other country is capable of copying and matching. If any advanced technology is in production or research/development, that&#39;s not going to be available for the military to use. </p>

<p>However, I do wonder about the possibility of highly advanced or &quot;Alien&quot; technology existing. If you ascribe to the possibility of Aliens having contact with humans and giving them access to their technology, then we could think of some very &quot;far out&quot; answers to the question of &quot;what is the most advanced technology in possession of humanity?&quot; We could not possibly know about it unless we are meant to know about it, so that question goes unanswered. </p>

<p>I like to think about the possible activities being hidden from the public&#39;s knowledge. How do they hide their activities? Why? Who are &quot;they?&quot; Considering all of those clearance levels above what the President has, what could people with those clearance levels know? Is it all military operations? Homeland security intelligence? What would be dangerous for the President to know about? The President knowing all of that information would be dangerous, especially if the President was captured or compromised in some other way. Keep the intelligence dispersed so no one person has all of the answers, but don&#39;t leave only one person responsible for a piece of information or else it could get lost. It is all very intriguing, but I guess that&#39;s why people write Spy novels and historical fiction. </p>

<p>Could there be a group of people who run things behind the scenes, above the President and all other elected officials? If this group of people had access to alien technology, do they have plans to disclose information about their contact with E.T.&#39;s? If the public had this information right now, it would cause major disruption to everyday life. </p>

<p>If not advanced/Alien weapon/flight technology, then what about advancements in medicine and energy? Are there any medical advancements that have been hidden from the general public? Think of all of those scientists working on cures for cancers and other devastating diseases. What would happen to them if they suddenly became useless? How would they deal with knowing their entire careers were spent working on developing something that already existed? How would that impact bio-tech and pharmacological companies? People would be without jobs. Same goes for energy innovations and scientists working on those. Major innovation would disrupt the system in place currently, which would be bad news for both the rich and the working class. What if society is unable to keep pace with technological advancement?</p>

<p>Just because society might not be able to keep up with (even more) rapid innovation in technology  doesn&#39;t mean anything is going on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to keep the pace of innovation down or to destroy/hide technology that we may not be ready for. &quot;The powers that be&quot; may be hiding things from the public, but we don&#39;t know what those things could be, so we make guesses. It&#39;s not outrageous to make those guesses or think that way, though some ideas seem too crazy to pay any attention to. </p>

<p>I also think about how &quot;hidden&quot; technology could be kept hidden. Is it right under our noses? Do we have valid evidence of advanced technology existing, yet that so-called evidence is discredited by media/politicians/influential experts? Or are those discrediting the evidence correct? How close are we getting to an uncovering of this &quot;hidden&quot; technology? How is society&#39;s progress being calculated? Are we being prepared for disclosure? Or are we being conditioned for ignorance? Who are the top-most major players in influencing public opinion and what are their main goals? </p>

<p>Maybe life on Earth is just as random and boring as we are lead to believe. Maybe we are just an almost impossible manifestation of intelligence in the Universe on a big rock flying through space that just so happens to be in the most perfect position for our existence and survival. All these seemingly impossible coincidences, it almost looks manufactured. &quot;Occam&#39;s Razor&quot; suggests the more assumptions one has to make, the more unlikely their explanation is correct. I don&#39;t know about you, but I have to take a lot of assumptions as fact to arrive at the conclusion that human existence on Earth is a random occurrence. More assumptions have to be made to reconcile the belief that intelligent life only exists here on Earth, or at least that humans are the most intelligent life currently existing in an area that is too far for any other intelligent beings to travel to or know about the existence of. </p>

<p>I can believe that the public is knowledgeable of the most advanced technology available in the world if I assume that the government has nothing to hide and no reason to hide it. The same amount of assumptions have to be made to come to the conclusion that there are technologies hidden from the public and that the government is hiding things and reasons to hide them. So, for now, I remain open to the idea that advanced technologies do exist, but I cannot say that I believe advanced technologies exist that are being hidden from the public. I mean advanced technologies that would disrupt society, anyway. I&#39;m not talking about technology currently in development/research/production that is a seemingly natural progression from what technologies the public are aware of existing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where you talked about clearance levels, what the president might know and what would happen if he was captured, you weren&#39;t taking &quot;need to know&quot;; the president has the highest clearance, all clearance levels are ultimately given by the office of the president, he can classify or declassify anything. But they aren&#39;t going to tell him about things he doesn&#39;t need to know without him asking first, and unless you&#39;re taking shots in the dark you generally need to know about something to ask about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I guess what I meant by &quot;above the president&quot; as far as clearance levels go is a clearance for information the President is barred from knowing about (or I guess things he doesn&#39;t know to ask questions about). I think the term is &quot;compartmentalized information&quot;  or &quot;special access.&quot; Those are probably two different things. I&#39;m a layman. I am guessing there&#39;s information the President is barred from having access to because I have heard about clearance numbers for subcategories of &quot;Top Secret&quot; that are higher than the clearance number/subcategory the President falls into. Just because I read about it on the internet doesn&#39;t mean any of it&#39;s true or it is completely true, but I didn&#39;t acknowledge that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy was accused of &quot;causing $800,000 worth or damage to computer systems&quot;</p>

<p>His crime? Accessing a computer network that didn&#39;t even have password protection. What he uncovered is substantial,  and the legal response they attempted to level at him for what amounts to the military&#39;s irresponsibility is very telling. Obviously,  he didn&#39;t damage computers just by accessing the network. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When he hacked into Johnson’s systems, he found a high definition picture of a large cigar-shaped object hovering over the northern hemisphere. When he hacked into the systems of US Space Command, he found a log that listed non-terrestrial officers… which he believed was evidence that the US military has a secret battalion in space. Some of these logs were ship-to-ship transfers; the USSS LeMay and the USSS Hillenkoetter were the names he saw on the transfer logs – USSS stands for United States Space Ship.</p>

<p>He said, “I found a list of officers’ names … under the heading ‘Non-Terrestrial Officers’. It doesn’t mean little green men. What I think it means is not Earth-based. I found a list of ‘fleet-to-fleet transfers’, and a list of ship names. I looked them up. They weren’t US Navy ships. What I saw made me believe they have some kind of spaceship, off-planet”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously with the DoD&#39;s budget they can afford to pour money into tech that isn&#39;t provides marginal benefit far outside of its cost.  So there&#39;s that.  In terms of <em>revolutionary</em> tech, they&#39;re not far ahead because that stuff usually needs a knowledge and industrial infrastructure that would be hard to keep under wraps. </p>

<p>How effective is what they have really anyway?  The problem with &quot;advanced&quot; tech put deployed very rarely is that it hasn&#39;t seen the breadth of use to work out the unforseen kinks, and will be prone to failure.</p>

<p>And lastly we must remember the point of the MIC is to syphon money out of the goverment to private industry and, unless the product in question is meant for wide-scale deployment, its quality isn&#39;t really a concern to the kleptocrat generals.  So who knows how much of this advanced tech that doesn&#39;t even theoretically work are in government warehouses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very difficult question to answer, since we don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know, and the Deep State sure as shit ain&#39;t gone tell us.</p>

<p>But here is one good yardstick to measure how secretly advanced the Pentagon&#39;s toy tech really is.</p>

<p>From the Snowden leaks, this is one of the top 10 most interesting documents--it&#39;s a &quot;fact sheet&quot; format of talking points showing what NSA can and can&#39;t speak about in public and what level of top secret classification specific things that NSA knows or does not know.</p>

<p>Regarding Quantum Computers. </p>

<p><a href="https://edwardsnowden.com/docs/doc/quantum-computing-21sep11-redacted.pdf">https://edwardsnowden.com/docs/doc/quantum-computing-21sep11-redacted.pdf</a></p>

<p>Since Quantum Computers are one of the most heavily hyped new-new-technologies, which is always &quot;just another 10 years away from you being able to buy one in a Best Buy, and since the introduction of practical QCs on the mass-market really will be an event bigger than the Manhattan Project, we can use this document to gauge how far does NSA go into denials and secrecy when they have an Earth-shattering secret break-thru tech.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good starting point:</p>

<p>&quot;The fact that NSA has determined that a specific classical public-key cryptography design is or is not secure against QC attack for algorithms for which the security or non-security is not widely known and publicly available&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;SECRET at a minimum&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously, NSA is talking about attacking the RSA cipher using their QC. Every e-commerce purchase you make on Amazon, every Like you give to FaceZerg, every dick pic you sext through iMessage--all of it relies on RSA encryption. So what NSA is saying, &quot;if&quot; (HAH!) they invented some QC attack that decrypted RSA, they would not tell *YOU* the stupid Voting Sheeple so that you could secure yourself. No, NSA would hoard that esoteric knowledge among themselves alone, for their own nefarious use alone. NSA probably wouldn&#39;t even tell the President nor anybody outside of NSA.</p>

<p>Think I&#39;m exaggerating how big the NSA&#39;s ego is?</p>

<p>A few pages down, NSA even admits to it!</p>

<p>&quot;The fact of a vulnerability of a specific U.S. Government cryptosystem to QC attack.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Top Secret at a minimum&quot;</p>

<p>NSA&#39;s Information Assurance dept is legally responsible for ensuring the cryptographic security of the *ENTIRE* FedGov, yet here is NSA saying &quot;nuh-uh, we ain&#39;t got to tell you FedGov worker bees that all your bits are plain text against our QC.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;definitions&quot; section at the end of that document is amazing. </p>

<p>We learn that NSA&#39;s QC has 21 qubits of &quot;operational&quot; processing power.</p>

<p>At least, it did in 2011 when that document was dated.</p>

<p>NSA&#39;s QC has 51 qubits of &quot;theoretical&quot; qubits.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t worry about NSA&#39;s QC. 21 qubits is light years away from Pong. I have read math research papers that showed you would need *hundreds of thousands of qubits* to even think about maybe attacking something like SHA-256. So the Ft Meade dweebs will still be pulling their billion dollar research grant puds a hundred years from now and still saying &quot;we&#39;ve almost got it this time, QC is around the corner.&quot;</p>

<p>(By the way, I don&#39;t believe in QC, because the underlying physics is Not Even Wrong, so I never worry about NSA&#39;s QC budget busting boondoggles. What I do believe is that P=NP and therefore any QC, which is functioning almost like a time-traveller by pre-computing all possible paths at the same time, as opposed to a classical computer which can only compute sequentially one-by-one--any QC can therefore be simulated by the same classical algorithm that reduces to P=NP. So no sci-fi magic necessary, just smarter math that will seem so obvious in hindsight that all the brainiacs will feel stupid for not noticing it before.</p>

<p>And by smarter math, I mean FACTOR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As stated, we don’t know what we don’t know. My hypothesis is that the unlimited black budget afforded to our shadow government has led to unimaginable advances... Some from our own ingenuity, some reversed engineered from downed alien crafts &amp; other (human) nations, and some from current alien assistance. I’ve seen interviews of high ranking military officials that have admitted (on condition of anonymity) that whatever one can imagine, is already possible including interstellar travel, time travel, transporters, FTL/warp starships, phasers, shields, wormholes, off-world military bases, and so forth. It’s widely accepted that our current public/commercial technology is superseded by at least 20 to 30 years in the (known) military. They keep it under wraps to keep enemies guessing. This same official said try more like 80 to 100+ years more advanced as in 22nd century technology and beyond. To allow the general public to know our true technological state would require a lot of admissions/confessions they’re not ready to make... such as how long that level of technology has been available, where it came from, the existence of alien life, and so forth. Further, how do you think people would react if they found out cures for diseases, zero-point clean energy exists (enough to power the entire human civilization for thousands of years), replication tech providing food &amp; clothes, etc. has been available but withheld for decades...??! It would also destroy overnight the stranglehold and control religion has on people, Capitalism would be irrelevant, economies &amp; stock markets would crash, police and traditional military would be irrelevant. Knowing they had the tech/ability to easily eradicate terrorism, but did not... all to protect their secrets and advancements. Suddenly introducing super-advanced tech to a society not ready for it can quickly become a catalyst for utter destruction and extinction. It can also be the turning point (the Singularity) that propels a society into their rightful future. All depends how it’s done and the ultimate agenda behind it.</p>
