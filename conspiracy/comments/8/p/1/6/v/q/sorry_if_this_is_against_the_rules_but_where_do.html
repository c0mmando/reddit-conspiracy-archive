       I'm mainly interested in aliens, but anything is appreciated. Any documents, sites, theories, PDFs etc I should read? I read this sub and others, plus listen to podcasts, but I'd like to do my own research and was just wondering if there's any good forums or sites or any of the aforementioned things.

       Oh there is pedophilia and homosexuality referenced. In no way is it advocating for them, if you read the book or listen to the Mystery Babylon radio broadcasts you'll find it's quite the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not surprised such a review is the first thing you see googling though, Bill Cooper was a legendary whistleblower and one of the first to thoroughly explain the mystery schools and their effect on the world to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedo and homo is in the book to the extent of "In X times, secret society Y thought Z so they engaged in pedophilia throughout the course of ABC" etc.

       From when I bought it. It was one of the books that got flagged by the FBI. Like the anarchist cookbook and hitlers. Not sure if thatâ€™s the case till this day but Iâ€™m paranoid so I wouldnâ€™t but thatâ€™s just me.

       Ive felt the same way. I keep noticing posts about YouTube videos or documentaries. While im glad it might just be newbies looking for a jumpstart to their research, not going to pretend like it doesn't bring up a reddish flag. Especially with all the censorship of conspiracy videos on YouTube and the like lately, part of me feels like posts like you mentioned are just more of a survey of "What's out there, what have we not gotten to yet? etc"

       Yeah, it's absolutely some dipshits (OP excluded of course) working for something like SLPC, on behalf of the DNC, to censor the Internet, in an incredibly lame and not well considered, attempt to subvert the will of the American people by swaying an election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say it could be even less well organized, if it didn't start over a year ago.  The less well organized attempt would just be flagging videos that get posted here.

       Whenever possible I try to go to the original source - or as close to the original as possible.  Obviously, looking at ancient texts I need to rely on translations and  photos.  I don't have access to the actual tablets, nor do I read hieroglyphs or cuneiform.  So, I have to rely on the experts.   I might also check multiple translations to see if they are similar and accurate.  Like Joe the Ancient Alien Theorist's translation of this tablet may not concur with the translation published by Bob the Archaeologist and Sue the Expert in Ancient Languages at the British Museum.  My advice is to check multiple sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I'm looking at videos, I always try to find the original or first publication of the video. So many videos have been edited and marked up with bullshit, it's hard to know what you're even looking at.  So when I'm looking at them, I go to the "as it happened" or unedited footage.
      </p>

       There's a lot of information available directly from the National Archives on
       <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/military/air-force/ufos.html">
        Project Blue Book
       </a>
       .  If you're doing UFO research, it's a must read.

       As Maxwyfe said... get as close to original sources as you can - otherwise you are relying on someones interpretation, which comes laden with their biases etc, which you can then internalize rather than forming your own measured opinion.

       There still are used book stores. Goldmine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look in the
       <em>
        children's section
       </em>
       . Propaganda narrowed-down to its most-essential elements, or at least they are quick-reads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things I found in children's books (not judging any of these, they were just snippets which got me thinking):
      </p>
      <p>
       *Prehistoric book suggesting the Glaciers were formed when the Arctic warmed and more precipitation became airborne.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Book on 'Energy' had a picture of proposed oil-tanker submarines to ship oil under ice sheets.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Old book promising nuclear-powered trucks, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       *One-of the most detailed maps of Antarctica is in an old book from 1960 (Golden Treasury of Knowledge).
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The 'Prehistoric Man' stuff still lines-up the human-ancestry as one branch where modern cladograms suggest Afarensis, Boisei, etc are each their own "crown" (Tattersal and Swartz)...
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Oh, my god I am getting so excited just thinking about it!! If you want to know what the World is
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to be like, read the preachy, let-me-tell-you-what books full-of-promises that are offered to children!

       First: I never search info trough mainstream sources. They are only reliable to understand what they want you to not look. So, the more one view is pushed in the mainstream, more the opposite spectrum of it is true and
Second: multiples sources from alternatives points of view, and not from coorporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       So mainly, is where to not look more them where to look. If there is no money behind one opinion, it tends to be based on a person true convictions. Them you must use your owm discernment to get somewhere. Also the more open and more you know of your own lack of knowledge, more deep you can go and learn.

       Some may be psyops ... Never said they werent. BUT some of the individuals employed as remote viewers etc.. Went on to do the same stuff after they went back to civilian life. Many did things for many police departments etc.. With great success and accuracy and have proven themselves a hundred times over finding missing persons etc.. Sure some shit is psyops etc.. But not all. Many governments dedicate millions of dollars to the study or remote viewing etc.. With consistent success. Private organizations as well. Still a worth while rabbit hole none the less. Even if you dont believe any of it... You still have to ask yourself... Why the lies and disinfo ...In either case everything we have been rold or thought we know about reality and the world around us is a lie and their is an organized effort at rhe highest levels world wide to ensure it continues. In turn making a whole other rabbit hole worth jumping into. Fascinating in either case.

       I am probably in the top 1&amp;#37; of "extreme" conspiracy theorists as I can say it is my obsession and #1 hobby in terms of hours spent since the 90's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I regret nothing by the way. It was absolutely worth it to end up like this meme about the "Black Pill":

       First, anything read on forums like here doesn't even rank in the top 5 of being the most important source for True Knowledge. Online forums have long ago been so clogged up with drooling Normies and JTRIG and JIDF sock puppet brigades, that you'll spend more of your time spinning in the hamster wheel of pointless debates about bullshit that doesn't even matter and that can't even be resolved and that gets you no closer to Enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You absolutely have to do your own research. If that sounds daunting, or if you have any doubts about your own ability to comprehend disconnected events into a "Grand Meta-Narrative", just remember--*ALL THE FUCKING EXPERTS ARE MORONS*.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at how wrong the Spooks are about everything, all of the WonkTank "fellows", all of the career Lifer Pentagon Brass, all of the super dooper elite Special Forces, all of Academia, all of the Media--the dumb shit those
      </p>
      <p>
       lunatics believe and they puffed up egos they hold about themselves is just pure comedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, the teeming masses of amateur rando Anons on the Internet who are just fucking around for fun by deep diving into the Hot Sheets to satiate your fundamental human instinct for curiosity about the bullshit world out there--the odds of you discovering something "big" that shoves Sisyphus' boulder one more inch towards progress for the rest of us is a MILLION times greater than all of those useless eater "Experts."
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why i shout from the Crow's Nest of the Pirate Ship calling on everyone to "GET IN HERE", if something in

       the official narrative seems fishy to you, go chase that butterfly, because you will come up empty 99&amp;#37; of the time, but in that 1&amp;#37; you won't, and what you may find could light the world on fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or at least get some Shapeshifting Reptillians fired from their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my workflow of research tips that I have honed for over 20 years and which you probably haven't seen anywhere else.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Always look for Original Sources first. Don't wait for Alex Jones to butcher the facts and dumb shit down for the  Conspiratainment demographic. Because you'll miss out on 99&amp;#37; of what's really going on if Alex Jones is your primary source for Ground Truth. Read as many Government documents as possible. Read the most boring dox you can find down to accounting records and budgets. Always read the footnotes--they love hiding bombshells in there. FedGov publishes so many millions of documents each year, even the one guy who has the most Top Secret Clearances into everything doeen't know a fraction of what the Deep State is doing in aggregate.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Where can you find FedGov dox?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my #1 Google search has probably gotten me put on several Govt watchlists:
      </p>
      <p>
       "site:.mil filetype:pdf"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it. Search all military domain names for documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just add some key words for topics you're interested in and start reading randomly chosen dox.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Biological Warfare"
      </p>
      <p>
       "ISR Sensor"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Synthetic Aperture Radar"
      </p>
      <p>
       Every year the Pentagon must submit its budgets to Congress. Those budgets are then published as pdfs on
       <br/>
       <a href="https://senate.gov">
        senate.gov
       </a>
       . They can often be over 1,000 pages long and full of nothing but numbers, but you can often find
      </p>
      <p>
       obscure programs or new weapons platforms, or the location where they are, which you can then search for
      </p>
      <p>
       by looking up the military bases where those locations are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my #2 Google search:
      </p>
      <p>
       "site:dtic.mil filetype:pdf"
      </p>
      <p>
       DTIC is an amazing resource. You can find academic publications and studies about nearly any topic related to
       <br/>
       Warfare, from history to cutting edge research and development.
      </p>
      <p>
       DTIC is where I first found a few papers about the Pentagon's "GORGONSTARE" program.
      </p>
      <p>
       Way back in 2011. Google only returned around 6-10 documents naming it, so I knew it was something important because they were trying to hide it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I especially knew I had found something juciy when searching for those same documents months or a few years later and they had been *REMOVED* from Google's index.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's the coverup that looks really bad here--not the deed."
      </p>
      <p>
       --Richard Nixon
      </p>
      <p>
       What is GORGONSTARE?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the Pentagon's secret program to link together video feeds from dozens of drones and jets into a composite panorama which "watches" entire cities simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like some far-out sci-fi futuristic shit amirite?
      </p>
      <p>
       GORGONSTARE was *operational* at least by 2009. And it was the replacement for an even earlier program doing the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing about GORGONSTARE years ahead of the Snowden leaks made me not at surprised about how far the NSA was going to spy on everything down to the molecules.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how I also found a USAF document describing how one Drone pilot operate multiple drones at the same time. Way back in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's just two examples for where randomly browsing around .mil pdfs really can pay off big time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are my #3 Google searches:
      </p>
      <p>
       "site:
       <a href="http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov">
        www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov
       </a>
       filetype:pdf"
      </p>
      <p>
       "site:nixonlibrary.gov filetype:pdf"
      </p>
      <p>
       "site:

       Basically all of the ex-President's library websites are troves of old and forgotten documents, many of which
      </p>
      <p>
       used to be classified, but which have been half-assed declassified. The black sharpie officers who choose what to redact often fuck up and leave new clues to old mysteries laying in plain sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       That glimpse into my workflow should be enough to get you started.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go and do likewise Gentlemen.

      <p>
       And what would other military domains be? "nav", "air"? or something else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if these are dumb I'm just curious and want to be doing this correctly. Thank you once again, an answer like this is exactly what I was looking for.

       putting "site:.mil" in your Google search will narrow your search to only include all domains ending in ".mil"
Which includes all of them--usaf.mil army.mil navy.mil etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also search for "site:.gov" which will search all govt sites, like nsa.gov and cia.gov.
      </p>
      <p>
       add the words you are searching for to the end. For some reason it is extremely rare for any military docs to use the word "drone"--they always call it "UAV"
      </p>
      <p>
       so your Google search example would be:
site:.mil filetype:pdf uav

       This is what is known as x-ray searches. You can Google that for more syntax and how to use it.

       You probably already know this but using exclusions can really ramp up x-ray searching effectiveness. These searches can be fickle at times. Try excluding a term that in the context of your other keywords would most certainly be included.

       Hard to give an example but something like "tropical fruit" OR pineapple OR mango -kiwi. Kiwi is a tropical fruit, but if someone wanted to hide information about a kiwi they sometimes don't remove all the context.

       Enjoy man. Itâ€™s a pretty cool starting point. After reading that you can use his references and do your own research. Get ready for months of going down a rabbit hole.
