    <div class="md"><p>You just made me remember this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now our knowledge is partial and incomplete, and even the gift of prophecy reveals only part of the whole picture! But when the time of perfection comes, these partial things will become useless.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things. Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely.</p>

<p>Three things will last forever—faith, hope, and love—and the greatest of these is love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s other, similar references in the same book.  I&#39;m paraphrasing off memory here, but there&#39;s another one, like &quot;two lie down, one wakes up&quot;.  Later, I here&#39;s also a passage where Peter is saying that Mary can&#39;t do something because she&#39;s female, so Jesus sidesteps it by saying he&#39;ll make her male.  </p>

<p>The book is intentionally cryptic, obviously, so it&#39;s my interpretation (bas d on this book and others in the Nag Hammadi library) that it&#39;s referring to psychic and physical joining/cooperation, but there&#39;s always room for more opinions :). </p>

Most religions pit one against the other, i.e. &quot;thou shalt not...&quot;, humans having &quot;original sin&quot;, and &quot;chop of your weiner parts because god says so&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds very Buddhist. It&#39;s why the theory of Christ traveling and learning Buddhism during the years he&#39;s MIA from the Bible made sense to me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about eliminating duality and seeing all as  one. You cannot have hot without cold, up without down, etc.  If they are completely codependent and need each other to exist then they are actually the same thing.</p>

<p>If all is one then there is no separation from each other or from anything else in the universe. It&#39;s simply an illusion that there&#39;s separation. If you can &quot;see&quot; this way you are whole and never need anything. You are in &quot;heaven.&quot; You&#39;ve entered the kingdom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alot of the religons overlap. I personally believe that Christ&#39;s death and resurrection could be a metaphor for the &quot;Ego death&quot; experience from Buddhism. Once you&#39;ve experience that without drugs but through meditiation you cant look at the world the same way. Then look at society and how it&#39;s all set up to feed the Ego and distract from the work. Thats where the &quot;Game&quot; really begins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its that way of seeing the world in my opinion. Non-duality. Hindu and buddhism philosophy talk more about it but so does theosophy. I think more along the lines of everything is &quot;God&quot;/Brahman in the act, pretending that its not. Hindu philosophy looks at life as a dramatic play with &quot;God&quot;/ Brahman/the Supreme self playing all the roles (plants, rocks, animals people, etc), just because it likes to. Its an interesting idea to kick around in the ol&#39; noggin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They say this world is a world of &quot;Maya&quot; or illusion, another good one to look up up. Thats seems more and more obvious as we wake up and realize that money isnt real, nothing here is solid its all atoms that are bouncing around, truth can&#39;t be pinned down (2 sides to every story). Even looking on here on this site you can see that people argue both sides of everything. What is &quot;truth&quot;? It seems to be subjective. &quot;Truth should be the same when its looked at from every angle. What can you do that with?</p>
