        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You&#39;ve heard it all before:</p>

<p>&#39;We&#39; went to the moon.</p>

<p>&#39;We&#39; can use carbon dating to determine how old stuff is.</p>

<p>&#39;We&#39; launched an unjust war against Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>And so on and so forth.</p>

<p>The question is: <strong>why do regular people identify as being part of the group who do/did these things?</strong></p>

<p>I am going to suggest to you that there is a reason why the average person does this.</p>

<p>Little do they know, they are still operating with the <strong>collective conditioning</strong> which school and mass media exist to impose.</p>

<p>And here is why it is so important:</p>

<p>A person who believes that they are part of the &#39;we&#39;, and &#39;we&#39; went to the moon, will** take it personally**, they will get offended, when it is suggested that the moon landings never happened, because in their mind (consciously or subconsciously), it is their achievement.</p>

<p>A little bit like living vicariously through others, those who identify as part of the &#39;we&#39; feel a sense of achievement for what &#39;we&#39; supposedly did/do.</p>

<p>Until somebody breaks free from their collective conditioning, they will NEVER -- not in a million years -- be able to <em>reconsider</em> their preconceived notions objectively and logically.</p>

<p>If somebody cannot reconsider their preconceived notions, then they will spend the rest of their lives operating on the absurd beliefs given to them by school and mass media.</p>

<p>Some of you who read this post will understand the significance of what is being addressed. Many will not. My interest is in the former group, not the latter. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post! Made me think of this quote by C.G. jung. </p>

<p>Insofar as society is itself composed of de-individualized human beings, it is completely at the mercy of ruthless individualists. Let it band together into groups and organizations as much as it likes – it is just this banding together and the resultant extinction of the individual personality that makes it succumb so readily to a dictator. A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one.</p>

<p>Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally shortsighted age things only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well disciplined mob can do in the hands of a single madman… People go on blithely organizing and believing in the sovereign remedy of mass action, without the least consciousness of the fact that the most powerful organizations in the world can be maintained only by the greatest ruthlessness of their leaders and the cheapest of slogans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a long, long story. Just like for most people here, my journey from lemming to critical thinker has involved many twists, turns, and rabbit holes.</p>

<p>Even though I am sick of Flat Earth (a meme which should have died in 2015), I remember that when I took the time to debunk it for myself (mission accomplished), I was staggered by just how little I knew about the <em>official</em> cosmology.</p>

<p>For my whole life, I had just been taking things on faith, and sneering at others who did not. Today, after lots of research and thinking and challenging assumptions, I can tell you why I believe the best model for earth is spherical, <em>without</em> having to make appeals to authority or appeals to consensus. It is amazing how few people can do that.</p>

<p>The whole process taught me a great deal about <strong>humility</strong>. I learned to go back to the <strong>primary sources</strong> and think about things for myself.</p>

<p>The best example is <a href="http://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">the Cavendish experiment</a>. To this day, it cracks me up that &#39;intelligent&#39; people try to defend it. It is a joke, and the joke is on anybody who cannot (or will not) see that.</p>

<p>So I guess, to cut a long story short, what changed was that I accepted my own ability to be fooled by the authorities, and so instead of reinforcing my preconceived notions, I got into the habit of checking my own premises, looking for primary sources, and so on.</p>

<p>It isn;t an overnight thing. School and TV teach us horrible habits, such as appeal to authority and appeal to consensus. It can take a while to break free from this lemming mindset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This immediately makes me think of the kinds of TV commercials you see aired during sports games. Seems like half or more of them all follow a common theme of creating a &quot;sports fan&quot; identity group. &quot;It&#39;s a sports-fan thing, outsiders wouldn&#39;t understand&quot; or some variant of it is the tagline in most of them.

<p>Excellent point. Those commercials appeal to the same desire for commonality, the same innate desperation to feel part of a tribe, as what the &#39;moon landings&#39; seem to offer a certain type of person.</p>

<p>In fact, much of what passes for &#39;science&#39; these days is exactly that: a post-religion collectivism which allows its devotees and adherents to feel special, to take credit for what their clergy have &#39;done for us&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seems to be a decent amount of circumstantial evidence that when forming our modern historical narrative people places and empires and events were duplicated and maybe even triplicated to expand history back far in time . That&#39;s probably a good place to start piecing together the truth. It seems the mechanism that allowed for this complete historical take over was some kind of global catastrophe in the 19th century. I would say that our modern evolutionary history is just as flawed as our chronology. There is an obsession from the experts in creating huge swaths of time that we simply do not have evidence for. Its hard to understand how mammoths could have all died 4,500 years ago yet we find perfectly preserved specimens in the ice and the meat is even fed to dogs. Maybe the megafauna was actually done in by the catastrophic event I mentioned earlier and not the absurd tale of over hunting that they try to spin. Lots to look into and that&#39;s why I created r/culturallayer to look at all the anomalies together. </p>

He was on Joe Rogan&#39;s podcast a couple times and he has done a lot of research on cataclysms, their effect on human civilization, and their effect on human psychology as a whole. He thinks the end of the Ice Age was marked by a meteor impact that would explain the loss of any previous history and the extinction of the North American megafauna. As far as dating goes, what are your thoughts on tree ring studies and ice core samples? Modern scientists claim these methods are reliable enough to figure out the climate of the Earth thousands of years ago, as well as other environmental factors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I first got into conspiracies joe had already done a few podcasts with Randall and graham and I was a big fan for a while until I started studying history for myself. They are smart men but they ignore to much to be entirely trustworthy. If you take Randall&#39;s research and observations and pair it with the observations of Michael Steinbocher who says the cataclysm was of a an electric plasma nature. And then look at the evidence for a recent cataclysm, then maybe we have a good picture,  but Randall and graham alone are useless and might even be limited hangout/red herrings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think there is a coordinated effort to distort the average persons understanding of history. They aren&#39;t all powerful or anything and it&#39;s not hard to see the manipulation once you know what do look for but the average person is easy to fool. Mark twain has a great quote about how it&#39;s easy to make someone believe a lie and how hard it is to undo that lie. So long as the majority believes the official version no alternative version will ever get a word in. </p>

<p>My favorite way to research is to read Wikipedia articles while holding these alternative explanations in my head. You start to notice the weasel words and the assumptions that then indicate something needs to be looked into further </p>

<p>It&#39;s also good to hear what straight up academics are saying , it&#39;s only by understanding the official version that we can start to understand what is wrong with it so I look for free lecture sites </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;taking it personally&quot; thing is a good point. And I too dislike when some people say &quot;WE did X, we went to the Y&quot; because it sounds stupid. However there are instances when we/us is useful like
encouraging a team work mentality in getting the truth out there. E.g. &quot;We need to spread awareness of the evils of money in politics leading to cronyism, extremism and corruption&quot;. </p>

<p>Although one counter argument could be made....does the we/us thing make people complacent? &quot;Oh that guy said &#39;we&#39;, others will take care of it, BRB watching netflix&quot;. Perhaps a balance is wise. &quot;We need to X, I encourage YOU to do Y&quot;. Not a big deal but this subtle change could eventually have a snowball effect.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the history thing (my unreliable gut feeling tells me human history is longer than we&#39;re told but still fabrications or shuffling/mixing/repetitions of events may still have occurred as the victor rewrites history or some overlords may want to hide eras of technological advancement and less oppression).</p>

<p>But remember my friend, this is reddit which is heavily compromised compared to a few years ago. It&#39;s sometimes difficult to tell who is a shill as it only takes a half truth to muddy the waters. As for the 9/11 footage of the tower-plane impact, I could buy that. There was a frame or so missing which leads me to believe flawed (live?) composites were used or they&#39;re simply hiding a frame that reveals something inconvenient. </p>

<p>Does this confirm &quot;no plane&quot; hypothesis? I&#39;m not sure, but I think some might be scared of repeating this in fear of spreading misinformation if it turns out to be false....or scare normies away when more obvious evidence is available (for 9/11 being a false flag, inside job and likely outside job too) -- i.e. building 7 controlled demolition. </p>

<p>Try not to judge what people think based on reddit. However I admit (due to lying corporate media and cultural engineering) some normies are almost as bad as the manipulated reddit community (whether it&#39;s reddit wide or just r/conspiracy). Some people are sedated or scared to question their worldview. Perhaps because they feel threatened in feeling helpless. </p>

<p>But people tend to be more enthusiastic during elections (although voter turn out is still too low and primaries partially rigged) so there is some hope. In elections, people seem to get angry or passionate about freeing themselves from their slave chains. </p>

<p>This may be due to having the opportunity to do something about their oppression as opposed to non-election times where they have to slave away at their work, pay the bills, help the kids or feel the force of depression, without being offered a democratic say. The anti-establishment movements need to be constant efforts. We must help the normies and ourselves, we&#39;re mostly all in the same boat and can&#39;t do that much individually but combined efforts can do great things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its could possibly be  from the World War 2 era , that famous slogan “We can do it !” With that lady flexing her muscle , resonated with American culture , makes people feel like they are part of something  , sometimes people feel like they are part of nothing in their ordinary everyday lives and want to be part of the big picture , as far as sports go and the whole fans perspective as being the part of the team is almost a tradition at this point , you represent your city and cheer for the home team , seems like a tribal type of thing , fanatics dress up get excited , drink beer in front of the modern day equivalent of a fire , fathers bond with their sons / kids. Sports are traditions for many Americans.  Religion pretty much the same thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Words are obviously powerful; they form the foundation of our thinking. It&#39;s a great point that people have a tendency to want to be on teams and to have the hive mind mentality. This is why I&#39;ve always felt the most successful tactic of the social engineers is fostering binary thinking. It&#39;s rampant everywhere we go, and prevalent on this sub as well. So many things become an us vs them, or an I vs them. </p>

<p>But the same thing happens with the use of terminology like &quot;normies&quot;, &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, etc. Humans are inherently limited in their expressions to the language they use. That&#39;s why intention and accuracy in usage is fundamentally important. And why I personally can&#39;t stand it when people rampantly misuse rhetoric and language to ultimately make claims that effectively reflects this &quot;team&quot; mindset. </p>

<p>The thing is it&#39;s not just the collective pronouns. In my opinion using I and taking it personally is the same thing. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s a team of one now. Let&#39;s face it, what has your (and I mean this in a general sense, every individual) &quot;individual&quot; team done? Have <em>you</em> gone to the moon? Have <em>you</em> actually proved or disproved any conspiracy? Have <em>you</em> actually done anything meaningful? What original idea or skill or craft have <em>you</em> actually come up with? The human condition is a collective. You wouldn&#39;t have the internet and device you&#39;re using right now without this &quot;team&quot;. You wouldn&#39;t have the very language you&#39;re using to think with without this &quot;team&quot;. Breaking free from collective conditioning is good, but it&#39;s just one thing to be aware of and it&#39;s not like it will magically make you an enlightened individual. </p>

<p>So I agree, breaking the hive mentality, the team illusion, etc is important, as is the cancer of binary thinking. Just as important is to crush the fragile ego that most people have. But this should be a basic prerequisite to critical thinking. I mean psychology, linguistics, and anthropology have studied this idea for centuries - and have put forward and discussed these ideas for a long time; ironically for the OP. </p>

<p>But nonetheless an interesting topic.</p>

<p>The best part is how they condition this system (cosmoloy) into our minds.</p>

<p>Like you said, not only did <strong>we</strong> go to the Moon, we&#39;re also going to Mars. It&#39;s also <strong>us</strong> who are destroying the planet with our greed and selfishness (alhough <em>they</em> -TPTB/lucifer- created this system).</p>

<p>That&#39;s a strawman. You can&#39;t weigh the moon with two heavy metal balls in a shed. You can measure the force of gravity between them. Since you know the mass of the balls, you can figure out how much mass you need to get a gravitational field of a particular strength. From the orbit of the moon, you can figure out its gravity, and then from there calculate what its mass is.</p>

<p>How can you do this without the &#39;force of gravity&#39; of everything else around them interfering?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the history thing (my unreliable gut feeling tells me human history is longer than we&#39;re told but still fabrications or shuffling/mixing/repetitions of events may still have occurred as the victor rewrites history or some overlords may want to hide eras of technological advancement and less oppression).</p>

<p>But remember my friend, this is reddit which is heavily compromised compared to a few years ago. It&#39;s sometimes difficult to tell who is a shill as it only takes a half truth to muddy the waters. As for the 9/11 footage of the tower-plane impact, I could buy that. There was a frame or so missing which leads me to believe flawed (live?) composites were used or they&#39;re simply hiding a frame that reveals something inconvenient. </p>

<p>Does this confirm &quot;no plane&quot; hypothesis? I&#39;m not sure, but I think some might be scared of repeating this in fear of spreading misinformation if it turns out to be false....or scare normies away when more obvious evidence is available (for 9/11 being a false flag, inside job and likely outside job too) -- i.e. building 7 controlled demolition. </p>

<p>Try not to judge what people think based on reddit. However I admit (due to lying corporate media and cultural engineering) some normies are almost as bad as the manipulated reddit community (whether it&#39;s reddit wide or just r/conspiracy). Some people are sedated or scared to question their worldview. Perhaps because they feel threatened in feeling helpless. </p>

<p>But people tend to be more enthusiastic during elections (although voter turn out is still too low and primaries partially rigged) so there is some hope. In elections, people seem to get angry or passionate about freeing themselves from their slave chains. </p>

<p>This may be due to having the opportunity to do something about their oppression as opposed to non-election times where they have to slave away at their work, pay the bills, help the kids or feel the force of depression, without being offered a democratic say. The anti-establishment movements need to be constant efforts. We must help the normies and ourselves, we&#39;re mostly all in the same boat and can&#39;t do that much individually but combined efforts can do great things.</p>
