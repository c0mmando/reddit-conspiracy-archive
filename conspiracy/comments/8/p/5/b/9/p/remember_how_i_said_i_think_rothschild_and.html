<p>Here shows Bronfman and Rothschild and the belr company. I found on this website: <a href="https://phibetaiota.net/2018/06/breaking-being-censored-child-sex-trafficking-camp-in-arizona-tied-to-clintons-rothchilds/">https://phibetaiota.net/2018/06/breaking-being-censored-child-sex-trafficking-camp-in-arizona-tied-to-clintons-rothchilds/</a></p>

<p>This:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CEMEX also co-owned by Bronfman-Rothschilds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then the belr website</p>

<p>Just to make sure, how is belr connected to CEMEX. Because I want to have an iron-clad evidence-backed case that Rothschild and Bronfman have a stake in CEMEX.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still, it shows the actual tie-in. Because this company I believe was formed in 2013? It says so on the webpage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bronfman E.L. Rothschild, L.P. is a Delaware Registered Investment Adviser located in Rockville, Maryland. It was registered on Monday, May 06, 2013.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is a fairly new investment adviser, investing in an old company like CEMEX. It&#39;s very suspicious is what I&#39;m trying to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re correct in that it does show a tie. New investment advisors investing in old companies is more than frequent though. Cemex is publicly traded, so anyone can buy shares, and old companies are frequently invested in because they are generally less risky and would cater to conservative investors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found some additional evidence of Rothschild involvement in CEMEX. They supposedly own 4.160 shares through EDMOND DE ROTHSCHILD HOLDING S.A. and 9,124 shares through BRONFMAN E.L.

<p>The VOP people stated in a video (though they haven&#39;t shown it...which is annoying), that there is an underground complex that could be a sort of church? </p>

<p>Yes but pictures and video footage for example, of a tunnel and bodies dug up, these can show people that there is some truth behind these rumors. Evidence needs to be presented to wake people up. Otherwise the &#39;elites&#39; are just going to say everything said is false. And with good reason. There&#39;s nothing concrete to prove otherwise. </p>

<p>The whole fucking point of evidence is to allow people to see what&#39;s going on! it doesn&#39;t matter if YOU know. What matters is that everyone else does!</p>

<p>That&#39;s how you get people together to form change. By presenting easy to absorb, real evidence of what&#39;s going on. Rather than relying on &#39;he said, she said&#39;. Because I&#39;ve learned, that gets you no where.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that what is considered evidence is based on perception.</p>

<p>It was discovered that there was a spy embedded in the Trump campaign. Deep state calls him an informant.</p>

<p>There is a paper trail, very clear anecdotal evidence and otherwise, but the corrupt deep state changes people&#39;s perceptions so they don&#39;t see it that way.</p>

<p>A child trafficking and sexual exploitation camp is discovered on CEMEX property in Tuscon and they call it a homeless camp, then will come in and scrub the physical evidence.</p>

<p>Its best not to beat them at their own game. Thats why this war of hearts and minds is going to be won in the following way:</p>

<ul>
<li>generate enough awareness that the established narrative is wrong so that people dont trust it. This can be done by appealing to people&#39;s sense of logic, but more importantly to open the door for people to make their own intuitive assessments. </li>
</ul>

<p>Once a critical mass of people reach the point where they trust their own abilities of deduction and let their gut feeling guide them to important issues, the war is won. We win.</p>

<p>It doesnt even take the majority of the population. Studies have shown that it is somethimg as low as like 10%</p>

<p>If there is one child&#39;s dead body dug up in any location where VOP&#39;s been going, that will be evidence enough to do something.</p>

<p>I myself found verifiable links of Bronfmann Rothschild investments in CEMEX. I also posted the video of the knife VOP said he found in the dirt.</p>

<p>These are key aspects of educating people and inspiring them to research themselves.</p>

<p>There are female pedophiles. There are tapes of child molesters raping children. If those tapes are found and leaked, true change can arise.</p>

<p>If there is verifiable proof that certain people own stake in companies like CEMEX, people can then begin to deduce where the money is going, what it&#39;s being used for.</p>

<p>For example, there are many small businesses in Arizona owned and operated by two people. Where does that lead? These things can only be discovered through research and evidence!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Rothschild and Bromfan invested heavily in CEMEX....</p>

<p>It seems fishy on the surface but its nothing of substance. CEMEX is actually a very rapidly growing company that has become a global player in the cement biz within a few decades. Investors have been talking about it for years. They even teach the CEMEX in business schools.</p>

<p>There is no evidence of wrongdoing in investing in a public company.</p>

<p>I for one appreciate it and am a huge proponent of following the money, but it doesnt mean much in this case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say they invested heavily. I just said there is a financial tie to them through those investments/owned stock. I&#39;m just providing examples because without these examples, you can&#39;t really investigate further.</p>

<p>This guy for example, investigates and uses real data: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq1bvKRgwww">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq1bvKRgwww</a></p>

<p>He does a better job waking people up than anyone I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>And if someone is even close to bringing the truth, people do come and try to take their information as evidenced by this woman and her experienced break-in:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oiRis5KZWE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oiRis5KZWE</a></p>

<p>Why? Because they know information is powerful. If we got evidence of collusion, of video recordings, then who can deny anything? But if we go in blindly and just state things without proof to back it up, it makes us look like fools.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the resources to bring forth that kind of evidence. However, I hope others can. You are doing a disservice to the cause by just saying things. I get it, I did the same for a bit. But not anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im too lazy to bring forth that much evidence on a regular basis but I admire guys like Randall Carlson who have done it their whole lives. </p>

<p>I am however, pretty good at intuitively sniffing out the good stuff and connecting the dots so thats what I focus on.</p>

<p>Im more the kind of person who creates the spark that lights the blaze. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I havent looked into that too much, but my impression was that it was a Mexican or MS13 style gang killing of the forensic psychiatrist and anybody connected to what he had discovered.
The way it was done (just gun shots) seemed more like a contract hit then revenge for past convictions he had facilitated.</p>

<p>Of course the gangs run the human trafficking operations across the border into Arizona with Tucson being one of the major trafficking arteries. My guess is that the forensic psychiatrist had found bodies or tunnels related to the trafficking so they got paid to kill him as one of the services they provide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well hopefully evidence surfaces to support this. Theory is important. It&#39;s good to construct a workable theory. Just needs some evidence to support it. In time, whatever truth is out there, it will be found. More and more people are realizing they need the truth. </p>
