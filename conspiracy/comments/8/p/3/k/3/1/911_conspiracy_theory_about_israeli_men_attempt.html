       TL;DR:  9/11 Conspiracy says there were a group of men (Israeli) that had explosives from Mossad ready to blow up George Washington Bridge.  They were arrested.  I filed FOIA requests to find out what I could, and NSA wouldn't confirm or deny records existed. I tried to get their case processing notes on my request -- and they said all were TOP SECRET (supporting documents did actually exist). I tried again a few years later -- still would not confirm documents existed. I appealed and tried to get the notes again -- they covered up their first answer because I pieced together the evidence, changed the reasoning for hiding the documents, then withheld the notes yet again -- but still won't confirm documents that I requested actually exist.  Something is fishy...
      </p>
      <p>
       .........
      </p>
      <p>
       LONGER:
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok all you 9/11 conspiracy / inside job fans... this one is for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me say off the bat, I do not buy the "inside job" conspiracy theory, nor do I believe there were explosives in the building that brought down the towers, etc. Please, don't copy and paste a bunch of links to this thread, as this is not what this is about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, one angle of the conspiracy that WAS intriguing, because my research did prove that the story largely vanished, was the part entwined in this whole mess about the "5 dancing Israelis" that were connected to an arrest made on, or near, the George Washington Bridge. The idea was that these men were going to carry out an attack on the bridge, and the story even morphed in some versions that the explosives were traced back to Mossad (Israeli Intelligence).
      </p>
      <p>
       I even dug up a Dan Rather news segment regarding the incident that was broadcast on the evening of 9/11/01, so I knew at least to some extent, there was truth to the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, this goes against just about everything that we have come to learn about 9/11. So, out of sheer curiosity (and to further prove I do look into everything, despite what I believe personally), I filed FOIA requests to multiple agencies regarding the incident. The FBI and the Director of National Intelligence came back with "no records" however, the NSA gave a different response. They offered a "GLOMAR RESPONSE," meaning, they will neither confirm nor deny anything exists. Having had so much time pass after this alleged incident, and the fact that it apparently didn’t happen according to official storylines, wouldn’t they just say they had “No Records”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after receiving this response, I filed a FOIA request for all case processing notes, emails, and other documents generated during the processing of this request. The NSA has released many times in the past, these notes and messages that give an inside look at the process of filing FOIAs. It shows how the FOIA request progressed, and sometimes, offers insight to how the final decision was reached. Frequently, there are redactions, primarily due to FOIA exemption (b)(5), which deals with the “deliberative process” of how agencies work/make decisions. It is noted, that (b)(5) is the most controversial FOIA exemption, because it is widely used and overly broad.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the response came in for these notes on my FOIA request, and 100% were denied as being classified TOP SECRET. This was a VERY strange result, as I have yet to find a request for case processing notes, on a FOIA request that received a “GLOMAR” response, that were 100% considered TOP SECRET.
      </p>
      <p>
       I waited a few years, and filed again on March 30, 2018. In short, after a two year period, documents can then be requested to be reviewed again (either by a FOIA or an MDR, which is a lengthy explanation in itself). In this particular case, I filed a FOIA (and not an MDR) because the NSA would not even acknowledge documents existed, so I did not feel my MDR would have any positive results, since I couldn’t cite any documents for review. Sure enough, I received another GLOMAR response to my 2018 request, and everything could neither be confirmed nor denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appealed on May 2, 2018, and by June 1, 2018, less than a month, the NSA denied my appeal. However, the story got even more strange. They split my appeal into two parts in order to respond properly. The first, was the documents I was requesting regarding the unidentified men on the bridge. They said they supported and agreed with the GLOMAR response, and that was it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part of my request was for the FOIA Case Files / Processing Notes that I asked for that were classified TOP SECRET. They retracted the claim they were classified TOP SECRET, but then still exempted them 100% under FOIA exemptions (b)(3) and (b)(5). So, therefore, they changed the reason for their answer, but their answer was the same none-the-less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the reason they did this, was based on the root of my appeal. In my official appeal, I stated the following (in part):
      </p>
      <p>
       “Given also the fact that ‘item 1’ of my request 103943 (FOIA request for case processing notes) yielded documents that were entirely exempted under the FOIA as being TOP SECRET, this strengthens the belief that responsive documents do, in fact, exist. There would be no reason for (what I assume are case processing notes withheld) to be TOP SECRET on a topic with no responsive records.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, what I was saying, was that if they will “neither confirm nor deny” records exist, but then classify my FOIA Case Processing notes as TOP SECRET across the board, there is something there. I believe this part of my appeal may have influenced the NSA to say they were “incorrect” in that assessment, but then gave other reasons for a denial which would not allow me to draw that same conclusion. Was this truly a mistake? Or is this an attempt to cover-up the fact that I pieced together the evidence to prove documents exist in a case where they did not want to admit to that?

       I lived near the bridge during 9/11 and remember seeing "action" on the bridge (large police presence). For those that think this never occurred, here's [Dan Rather's short 9/11 report on the situation involving the truck load of explosives found on GWB](

       Too many people are suspicious of the government for them to take out too many at once unless they created an emergency scenario and took out dissidents via martial law and extrajudicial executions...

       On the other hand, when a new order arises, whether it is a negative totalitarian world government or a breakthrough of awakening and human evolution, those with advanced knowledge, insight and intuition will be very valuable as AI makes decisions on who will be given what job.

       I’m sure there are many reasons why along with disruption of the ME. Other than the main reasons of, they do what they want to get what they want. I think a lot of it had to do with what happened to the US after 9/11. We have lost all privacy and Israel has their hands on the majority of it.

       Yeah, those buildings were way past usable and needed to be gutted but was full of asbestos. It would have cost him way more to rehab then rather than pull them. Plus all the people that were told not to be there, no way it wasn’t planned from insiders.

       Well this is not true.  First, the buildings were a goldmine.  They were at almost 90% occupancy in 2001 (that’s more than 10 million square feet of office space), with thriving retail space in the lower levels, on top of the major transportation hub for Wall Street and downtown Manhattan.  In fact, there were 30 or so bidders for the property when the Port Authority decided to sell.  So not exactly a white elephant.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for asbestos abatement, there are buildings all over New York that have had to deal with it - there are going to be very few buildings in the city built prior to the 1980s that have not had some kind of asbestod issue.  Asbestos removal is a given for real estate investment, and no, nobody decides that knocking buildings over is a viable way of dealing with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if Silverstein was plannng all along to go batshit crazy and fund terrorists to destroy his buildings, don’t you think he would have nailed down the insurance end of things first?  He spent major legal fees dealing with insurance that wanted to reimburse him for one attack, while he claimed he should be compensated for two attacks.  This fight dragged on for years, so even when he won, it was a pyrrhic victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what’s your proof people were told not to be there?  I knew plenty of people who worked in the towers - nobody got that memo.  September 11th, however, was both an election day - for NYC mayor, a pretty big election in New York,  and it was also the first day of school for many students - lots of people planned to be a little late to go to their polling place, and many planned to be late to bring their kids to the first day of school.  So if there were fewer people in the buildings that morning than usual, you can thank those two events.

       On 9/11: Was the Asbestos-Laced World Trade Center “Disposable”?

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact: Thanks to Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney’s purchase of Dresser industries in 1998 Halliburton was liable for the WTC asbestos. Due to the asbestos NYC would not allow a controlled demolition of the WTC but thanks to 911 Halliburton was able to completely escape their WTC asbestos liability.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        THE WORLD TRADE CENTER: OBSOLETE AND PLAGUED WITH PROBLEMS
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Those who thought the World Trade Center comprised some of New York’s most desirable office space may have been mistaken.
      </p>
      <p>
       In “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,” author John Perkins reflects on a walk he took through lower Manhattan shortly after 9/11:
      </p>
      <p>
       “I recalled reading that the World Trade Center was a project started by David Rockefeller in 1960, and that in recent years the complex had been considered an ALBATROSS. It had the reputation of being A FINANCIAL MISFIT, unsuited to modern fiber-optic and Internet technologies, and burdened with an inefficient and costly elevator system. Those two towers once had been nicknamed David and Nelson. Now the albatross was gone.” [3] [with emphasis added]
      </p>
      <p>
       More detail comes from Rowland Morgan and Ian Henshall in their new book, “9/11 Revealed”:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The WTC began in disaster, just as it ended. A grossly misconceived Soviet-style land-development catastrophe…[it] was OBSOLETE LONG BEFORE IT WAS FINISHED. …The oversized…site destroyed swathes of human-scale streetscape…the towers…stole light from buildings all across Manhattan. Their exterior-frame structure maximized interior space while minimizing views and making office workers depressed [the windows were barely wider than the 16″-wide steel exterior columns]. Space-saving on elevators that involved two changes up and down made for lengthy journey times. …It would take a full two hours to evacuate everybody in a fire.” [4] [with emphasis added]
      </p>
      <p>
       Morgan and Henshall go on to note that BY 2001, MUCH OF THE TOWERS’ OFFICE SPACE WAS EMPTY. The towers were due for a “mid-life rehab,” but building codes would have REQUIRED REMOVAL OF THE ASBESTOS FIREPROOFING lining the towers’ ceilings and steel framework. According to Morgan and Henshall, “Such a job would have been unrealistically expensive and physically impractical, with no gain in [rental] revenues.” [5] [with emphasis added]
      </p>
      <p>
       (In spite of these problems, it’s worth remembering that given the proximity of major airports, the towers were DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND THE CRASH OF A FULLY LOADED, FUEL-FILLED BOEING 707–a large, four-engine airliner. This has been reported in numerous books and articles.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A LENGTHY, PRE-9/11 LEGAL BATTLE OVER THE WTC’S ASBESTOS PROBLEMS
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The WTC’s original owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, had been concerned about asbestos-abatement issues for many years prior to 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Karl Schwarz [6] and other writers, the Port Authority in 1991 filed suit in U.S. District Court against insurers in the hope of recovering funds to help pay for needed asbestos-abatement work at the WTC and one of the region’s airports. In the suit, “Port Authority of NY vs. Affiliated FM Insurance Co.,” the Port Authority sought between 500 million and 1 billion dollars from the insurers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that this suit was filed TWO YEARS BEFORE the first so-called “terrorist attack” on the WTC; the truck-bomb explosion in the Center’s underground parking garage in 1993.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schwarz reports that the U.S. District Court judge ruled against the Port Authority as of May 14, 2001.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less than three months later, the Port Authority transferred ownership of the WTC buildings to private investors.

        CHENEY, HALLIBURTON, THE BUSH FAMILY, AND ASBESTOS
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Dick Cheney, Halliburton, Inc., and, reportedly, the Bush family are surprisingly well acquainted with asbestos-related concerns. [7]
      </p>
      <p>
       On December 18, 2002, CBS News reported that Halliburton “has agreed to pay about $4 billion in cash and stock to settle hundreds of thousands of asbestos claims against it.” Reportedly, Halliburton inherited its asbestos liability from Harbison-Walker, a unit of Halliburton’s subsidiary Dresser Industries, and from Halliburton’s Kellog Brown &amp; Root subsidiary.
      </p>
      <p>
       On December 13, 2001, the World Socialist Web Site reported that “During the 2000 election campaign critics noted that in the last several years Cheney and Halliburton had contributed $157,500 to congressional candidates who had co-sponsored legislation to cut off victims’ rights to a fair recovery when injured or killed as a result of asbestos exposure.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And on August 11, 2002, The Olympian (from Olympia, WA), carried a Washington Post article noting that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Dresser had close ties to a family Cheney knew well: the Bushes. Cheney’s boss while he served as Secretary of Defense, President George H.W. Bush, was once being groomed to run Dresser, a company that Bush’s father and grandfather had reshaped decades earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Dresser went public in the 1920s, it turned to W.A. Harriman &amp; Co., whose president was George Herbert Walker, grandfather and namesake to former president Bush. Prescott Bush, the former president’s father, helped organize Dresser and select its new president, H. Neil Mallon. Prescott Bush eventually sat on the board and by 1941, still held 1,900 shares of Dresser stock. Mallon was so close to former president Bush that he described him in his autobiography as “surrogate uncle and father-confessor.” One of his sons, Neil Mallon Bush, is named after him. After World War II, Mallon employed George H.W. Bush and Dresser executives expected him to take over the company, according to journalist Darwin Payne, who wrote a history of Dresser. Instead, the former president left to prospect for oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Cheney saw sound business reasons for acquiring Dresser, there was a problem in its past — the use of asbestos in Harbison-Walker division products.”

        THE WTC’S CHANGE TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP–JUST WEEKS BEFORE 9/11
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       On July 24, 2001, private investors (Silverstein Properties, with minority partner Westfield America, Inc.) took control of the WTC under a 99-year lease.
      </p>
      <p>
       In “Waking Up From Our Nightmare,” Paul and Hoffman note that the WTC’s estimated value at the time was 8 billion dollars. [8]
      </p>
      <p>
       According to professor of economics Michel Chossudovsky, the lease called for payments to the Port Authority “amounting to 3.2 billion dollars in installments” payable over 99 years. With several hundred million dollars being provided by mortgage holders, Mr. Silverstein put just 14 million dollars of his own money into the deal. [9]
      </p>
      <p>
       Quoting from a May 20, 2002 article in The New Yorker, Chossudovsky notes that “Explicity included in the [lease] agreement was that Silverstein and Westfield ‘WERE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO REBUILD THE STRUCTURES IF THEY WERE DESTROYED.’ ” [9] [with emphasis added]
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul and Hoffman add that “Quoting the British Financial Times of September 14, 2001, the American Reporter wrote that ‘THE LEASE HAS AN ALL-IMPORTANT ESCAPE CLAUSE: IF THE BUILDINGS ARE STRUCK BY “AN ACT OF TERRORISM,” THE NEW OWNERS’ OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LEASE ARE VOID. As a result, the new owners are not required to make any payments under their lease, but they will be able to collect on the loss of the buildings…destroyed and damaged in the attacks.’ ” (The American Reporter’s article was titled “No Fraud, but Huge Profits Seen in World Trade Center Attacks.”) [8] [with emphasis added]
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also reported that Mr. Silverstein is “a large contributor to Democrat and Republican office-holders.” [8]

       Oh what a bunch of crap references and ridiculous inferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even going to bother to go to the trouble of responding to most of the conspiracy laced bullshit you have spewed here.  Neither you, nor the source you quote have any idea what you are talking about and so have decided fantasy is a fine substitute for knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just off the top of my head:  Explicity included in the [lease] agreement was that Silverstein and Westfield ‘WERE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO REBUILD THE STRUCTURES IF THEY WERE DESTROYED.’ ” [9] [with emphasis added].
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard the phrase "force majeure"?  It's  a french phrase describing "unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract."  If you look at fine print on all sorts of thing from airline tickets to passes to sporting events to commercial you'll see force majeure boilerplate language about acts of god and acts of terrorism, etc.  voiding obligations.  This is not new language, nor was it invented for Larry Silverstein's lease.  There was, and is, a similar or identical phrase in every commercial lease in New York City at least, and possibly everyplace known to man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another ridiculous misunderstanding of the world and everything in it that leaped out at me:  "the Port Authority in 1991 filed suit in U.S. District Court against insurers in the hope of recovering funds to help pay for needed asbestos-abatement work at the WTC and one of the region’s airports. In the suit, “Port Authority of NY vs. Affiliated FM Insurance Co.,” the Port Authority sought between 500 million and 1 billion dollars from the insurers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that this suit was filed TWO YEARS BEFORE the first so-called “terrorist attack” on the WTC; the truck-bomb explosion in the Center’s underground parking garage in 1993.
      </p>
      <p>
       No shit, Sherlock!  New York City had enacted legislation, with the EPA's help, mandating asbestos inspections for all buildings in the city, staggering the dates over a nine year period.  For ''tall'' office buildings (eight or more stories), as well as hospitals, hotels, elevator apartment houses and schools, implementation would start in 1990; for ''short'' office buildings (under eight stories), theaters, factories and lofts it would start in 1993; for walk-up apartments, stores, religious institutions and garages and gas stations it would start in 1996. Inspections would occur every three years, and buildings obliged to adopt remediation plans would be given specific time periods to complete them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, no shit the Port Authority wanted their insurer to play claims for remediation in 1991, as soon as they had the plans in pace after the mandated inspection of 1990!  And they weren't the only ones.  Millions of tons of asbestos pipe insulation, fireproofing, floor and ceiling tiles, and acoustical plaster was (and partly still  is) embedded in one-fifth, of America's public and commercial buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       And who the hell are these Morgan and Henshall goons.  Have they ever been outside their mancaves in the basement, never mind actually in New York City.  It is easy to find a list of tenants and office space that was occupied on 9/11.  I worked for one of the larger tenants myself (though I was not there the actual day).  The spaces were by no means empty; in fact from the basement retail mall (the third most profitable in the country, despite being, by far one of the smallest), to the tippy top of Windows on the World and the broadcast antennae used by all major TV and radio stations, many of whom had major office space in the building below, the towers were packed.  Some of the major tenants, just of the two towers that day:  Bank of American: 132,588 square feet, Empire Health:  461,000 square feet; Lehman Brothers:  45,000 square feet, Marsh USA:  361,000, Verizon:  155,490, Morgan Stanley:  840,000, Fuji Bank:  182,956, Fiduciary Trust:  245,156, AON Corp:  219,136.  And there were more than 170 other tenants in the two towers and the WTC complex, filling up the 10 million square feet in the towers, and the 34 million square feet of office space overall in the complex.  And yes, people had love/hate feelings for the buildings.  They were an icon, known the world over; the chamfered corners reflected blazing sunsets; they were a major point of location for every New Yorker - if you left an unfamiliar subway station and weren't sure which was was north, south, east, or west - you could almost always find the Towers and orient yourself.  And as for those tiny windows?  They were narrow, but they were floor to ceiling and wrapped around the entire building - when you stood in an office, you were above the helicopters below, above the clouds, you were suspended in air - the furthest thing from claustrophobic you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would't normally care about conspiracy stuff - it can be interesting to think about and fun to discuss.  But thousands of people died (and are still dying.  I lost my best friend, a photographer for one of the New York City papers, who was on site the day of 9/11 and many days after, as well as living in Tribeca, in the actual shadow of the towers, to lung cancer caused by exposure to toxic dust on and after 9/11.  A couple of years ago, I lost another good friend to the same cancer.  He had been in Building 7 and had just exited when the first tower fell, engulfing him in debris so thick he was sure he would not survive the next few minutes.)  This bullshit you peddle, for your own amusement, is not amusing to anyone who has had to live with the consequence of the attacks.  You are not uncovering anything, if the sources you list here are any indication.  These people you quote are nothing but ghouls, making a living off the pain and loss people suffered that day, and they should be ashamed of themselves.

       Many floors in the two 110-floor buildings were not occupied. Twelve floors in each tower were dedicated to mechanical equipment and a giant lobby.

      <p>
       In addition, dozens of Asian investment firms in the World Trade Center had closed their offices or cut employment sharply because of the recession in Asia. Other offices were leased but empty or under renovation. The Atlantic Bank of New York had moved out of the 106th floor of the south tower in July but was still paying rent.

       Right? And our agencies didn’t see any of this prior to 9/11/2001? I mean, come on! The FBI, CIA, etc......this is their main job. They knew what was going on, if not planned it themselves. They had access to all the damn buildings! Was the CIA not stationed in WTC building 7? And don’t even get me started on building 7, or the man who survived the “bombs” in bldg 7, told his story publically about hearing bombs going off BEFORE the towers fell, and then he mysteriously dies a few years later? No obituary, no cause of deAth, no death certificate, nothing. I cannot recall his name, but their is a site dedicated to his “death”. There was more strange things that happened in reguards to this man, those were the few I could think of off the top of my head. Very recently learned about this man myself.

       Just my two cents - you're also touching on the part of this that I do believe is also part of the cover-up, and that is the massive intelligence failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is one document that I believe really shows that lack of follow up:
       <a href="http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/terrorism/m29fbimemo.pdf">
        http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/terrorism/m29fbimemo.pdf

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence failure is something I believe strongly happened, and is largely covered up on how much they failed.  I know that isn't as fun as they let it all happen, or planned it themselves, but alas, that's what the evidence shows.

       Actually, it does matter. But I never jump out of my seat when someone leads off with, "... It was without a single shred of doubt an 'inside job'" -- sorry -- there just isn't the evidence to support that strong of a statement.  Should I date ask and open this can of dusty, rotting, worms what your evidence is that made you come to this conclusion?

       If you don't believe it was an inside job, how do you explain the NORAD training excercise that placed simulated hijackings all over the country that crippled the response to the real hijackings? Operators at NORAD couldn't differentiate the simulated hijackings from the real 9/11 hijackers on their computers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This to me is evidence that there was some degree of inside collusion. Some deep state group, perhaps some members of project for a new American century, colluded with Israel and Saudi Arabia to spark the American war machine into perpetual war. PNAC openly stated that the USA needed a catalyzing event, like a new Pearl harbor. Then a bunch of them get come into office after a disputed election, one year and 9 months later we have a "new Pearl harbor".

       There has been a navy surveillance ship parked downriver of the GWB since the terror attacks, so I’m pretty sure something serious was at least threatened and is an ongoing concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also remember bomb squad activity being reported on the bridge, but I’m pretty sure that wasn’t till a few days - maybe even a couple of weeks - after the 9/11 attacks.  I could be wrong about the timing though as those were crazy days.  My husband wanted to drive out of the city that day, just after the attacks, and our route out is always over the GWB though, so I would probably have been very keyed in to any reports of bomb squad activity there on the actual date, particularly as I didn’t want to leave.  It would have been a point for staying put.  We didn’t leave in any event because it was not clear if people were going to be let into the city or not for a while after the attacks.

       We know for a scientific fact WTC 7 was a controlled demolition and I will explain to you why.
      </p>
      <p>
       The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TLdR
       </strong>
       - The fact that WTC 7 underwent free-fall means that none of the building’s potential energy was used to crush the structure below it. All of its potential energy was converted directly into energy of motion (kinetic energy), leaving no energy to do anything else.

       Every time I even mention 9/11 on posts either here or primarily Facebook, it spirals into these large cut and paste wars between truthers trying to prove to me that they know more than everyone else, and anyone who doesn't believe George W. Bush pushed the button himself to detonate the buildings is an idiot. That's why I asked not to spiral the thread into that age old debate.

       I'm amazed you wouldn't be educated about the potential role israel played in the events of 9/11, especially since your name suggests you run the website blackvault, and seem keen on fact based evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       zim shipping company, a partly israeli owned container shipping company, abruptly terminated their lease and forfeited their security deposit, either weeks or 1-2 months before 9/11 happened (don't remember off the top of my head).
      </p>
      <p>
       dominik suter, owner of urban moving systems, fled with his family back to israel on I believe September 14th.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dancing israelis should be seen in the bigger context, view carl camerons fox news report about the largest spy ring ever busted in the usa - i believe hundreds of israelis were arrested before and after 9/11 for espionage.
      </p>
      <p>
       the foia documents are available for the dancing israeli's, they are very entertaining and mind bending to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       more interesting information that doesn't get mentioned, that supports the idea of having inside help:
      </p>
      <p>
       there is the case in memphis, tn, where a man arrested for ID fraud was found with a pass to do work on the sprinkler system in the days before 9/11. there was a group of people arrested, only 1 of them had the pass. the man was egyptian, living in the us illegally.
      </p>
      <p>
       this case is a can of worms, and one can spend hours researching information related to it, as well as the dancing israelis.

       in my opinion, which ultimately doesn't mean much, is that the biggest red flag is the fact that the dancing israelis were deported back to israel after 70 some days, even though there was more than enough information that they were fully aware 9/11 was going to happen (witnesses place them on the roof at 8am) and they all gave very conflicting reports if you read the foia documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       taking the above in context with the largest ever espionage ring to be busted in the usa, should be cause for alarm

       I'm not sure who did the FOIA, or what process they took for the fbi to declassify them, but they are out there, thousands of pages to read. Very interesting

       Hey there, and yes, that is what I believe.  I spent years researching it -- and have amassed THOUSANDS of pages of documents, and I compiled a FREE and very large research center all on 9/11 here, if you're interested:
       <a href="http://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/tag/911/">
        http://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/tag/911/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       (That lists pages of actual archives with multiple documents in each archive.)  It was this research that drove me to MY conclusion -- but I welcome all others to look at the evidence themselves... that's why I put it online and don't editorialize it on the archive -- it's up to you to decide.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, I do believe there is a cover-up / conspiracy related to 9/11, I just don't think it's the "inside job" thing everyone talks about.  In my personal opinion, the cover up is that we shot down United 93. That is not based on a smoking gun -- but rather, pieces of evidence here and there, including the fact that President George W. Bush wrote in his book he gave the order.   I have posted this theory well before he wrote that, and to me personally, that solidified it in the sense that it makes sense.  Did it happen? I really don't know -- but I do believe deep down, that's the coverup.

       what about the stand down order by Cheney tho? and the obviously contrived break down of the US air defense on the day of 9/11? i'd say it was a foreign op ultimately too, but without assistance from the inside it would've been totally impossible.

       Two purposes I can think of the bridge demolition:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         It would have severed the fiber optic data links to Wall St and crashed the stock market -- like.. total crash. No more stock market until it's repair.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It would have stranded everybody on Manhattan Island breathing radioactive asbestos dust for
         <em>
          days
         </em>
         . There's another post recently enumerating the thousands of cancer cases from 9/11, but the number would have been much higher had the bridges been destroyed.

       The Israeli van attempting to blow up the bridge is just a component of what was going on. You also had the 'The 5 Dancing Israelis' taking video of an event they knew was going to take place. You also had the Israeli art students who were in the towers for months before 9/11...if you can take a comparison of just these two photos...

       I don’t remember this happening, but what I do remember from that day is a tv news anchor saying the State Department was under attack or had been bombed. I lived in Foggy Bottom at the time just a few blocks away. If I remember the sequence of events properly, we (I think I was with a friend or two at the time) saw the planes hit the towers on tv and then the report about the Pentagon. We went up to the roof of my building and saw the smoke from across the river. We came back down and I want to say Brian Williams or Tom Brokaw from NBC reported the State Department was under attack. That prompted us and a lot of other people to leave our buildings and basically evacuate. There were streams of people leaving the neighborhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this isn’t related but I was curious if anyone heard about this supposed attack? It scared the hell out of us and always struck me as so completely irresponsible to report without some amount of confirmation...
