        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fact: Both local police and ICE have said there&#39;s no evidence that the site found by Veterans on Patrol was used for trafficking</p>

<p>Fact: VOP did not call the police when they found the camp, but called another veteran&#39;s group making a documentary about child trafficking</p>

<p>Fact: The head of VOP is not a veteran, has a history of using his group for publicity stunts, and was thrown out of both Bundy Ranch and Malheur Refuge</p>

<p>Fact: The debris was picked through by VOP, who claim to be storing much of it without showing it to police</p>

<p>Fact: The debris found at the site is entirely consistent with the detritus found at any homeless camp or squatter enclave</p>

<p>Fact: Police came through with a cadaver dog and found nothing</p>

<p>Fact: Much of the &quot;evidence&quot; used to &quot;prove&quot; that large numbers of children were moved through the camp hasn&#39;t been proven to exist</p>

<p>Fact: Most of the videos being made by the people picking through the camp show not evidence, but people talking to the camera recounting things they claim to have seen, but don&#39;t show</p>

<p>Fact: The connections between site owner Cemex and either George Soros, the Clinton Foundation, or the Rothschild family are incredibly tenuous, and are the same connections that almost every major company has with major investors or philanthropic orgs</p>

<p>Fact: No evidence has been found of tunnels, nor of bodies, nor of mass graves</p>

<p>Fact: Not one person has claimed to have actually been trafficked through the camp, nor to know anyone who has been trafficked through the camp</p>

<p>Fact: There is no credible connection between the &quot;camp&quot; in Tucson and either the murder spree in Scottsdale or the suicide of Kate Spade.</p>

<p>Am I missing anything? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL.  So because they <em>claim</em> to have found a knife with blood on it, I&#39;m supposed to believe this was a &#39;CHILD RAPE UNDERGROUND CAMP&#39;.  Perhaps that&#39;s enough for you.</p>

<p>But as someone who has camped, I can think of at least a dozen rational explanations for finding a knife with blood on it at a camp.  Granted, many of those reasons are nefarious - but nothing that screams (which is what is happening here) &quot;CHILD RAPE UNDERGROUND CAMP&quot;.  </p>

<p>At the very least these guys are being sensationalists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the evidence is up to interpretation,  and the majority gets the win.  bullshit arguement if you ask me.. utility is at stake, sex without consent is wrong no matter the scenario.</p>

<p>you have two different groups reviewing the same evidence coming to two different conclusions.</p>

<p>now, I fail to see the difference between a sex trafficking spot and a &#39;coyotes den&#39; that happened to rape people.</p>

<p>if sex is occurring without the person&#39;s consent.  that is rape by definition, and should not be tolerated.</p>

<p>What does it matter in the end, if the result is the same?  This is a spot where clearly nefarious activites occur.</p>

<p>get off this board you fuckin shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the same thing, but then I found out the dude in all the videos is this guy:</p>

<p>Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer</p>

<p>He went to Bundy ranch during that stand-off. Bundy ranch was undercover LEO central...the reason no one got persecuted in that case is because it turned out a huge amount of &#39;patriots&#39; that were in the cabin were actually undercover LEO for various agencies. Entrapment. They had to throw that shit out.</p>

<p>Dude is a felon, has a fat rap sheet, apparently isn&#39;t even a veteran (which, if he&#39;s not, and he&#39;s talking with all that &#39;bravo&#39; camp &#39;alpha&#39; camp shit....very suss), and has been accused of being an FBI informant.</p>

<p>I 100&amp;#37; believe cartels traffic drugs/humans through boarder states. In fact, it&#39;s a fact. But, I dunno...this Michael Lewis Arthur Meyer character does seem fairly fugazi to me. Gotta look at the messenger as well as the message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As of now, I&#39;m filing this one away as &#39;keep an eye on developments&#39;.</p>

<p>Being balls deep in all this human trafficking/pedo shit, I have come to the conclusion that no one is going to do anything about it. So I love the idea of citizens getting fed up and doing something about it themselves; but I also understand anything in this arena is going to be chalk-full of disinformation and spooks and psyops. This seemed so clear-cut to me when it first came out. Now I&#39;m not so sure, but I&#39;m not one of these dumbasses that thinks I know everything and can ascertain whats real and whats not at a simple glance.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll see how this unfolds. If I was in AZ, I&#39;d probably go check it out myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>at 1:50 of this video Addie Rivera of the group Veterns on Patrol states the policehave not gathered any evidence, since she and her friends have gathered the evidence and then refuses to let the reporter see the evidence.</p>

<p>I find it a bit weird the group who found this site are refusing to share that evidence with the public and police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The police actually have some evidence including the bloody knife and it is still an open case with Tucson PD, but they didn&#39;t secure the site physically and allowed the site to be bulldozed. Since when do police allow a site to be tampered with when they are still analyzing evidence and case is still open? Maybe I wouldn&#39;t trust police with all the evidence if they don&#39;t even do their jobs. A report was made to police and they sauntered down there 5 days later to do basically nothing and now of course if there&#39;s further evidence its been destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are talking about child trafficking run by the elites so they can eat their adrenal glands or whatever, yes, I think that is fake. As a person who was abused by a sick fucking pedo as a kid, they are fucking everywhere. And this whole PG, Tuscon shit drives me crazy.  I have 2 issues with this stuff. 1. I just find it so convenient that when all of this partisan extremism started with this election, this type thing really blows up. I see it as a ploy to make Democrats, or their supporters, look worse than they already are. Or at least muddy them up enough to make people doubt them in that election, which is exactly what happened. The 2nd is that people aren&#39;t really trying to end this stuff, they are trying to prove some sort of conspiracy and it pisses me off.  Why not spend the time they do, combing through dumbass emails, working to shed light on pedos running around the internet or right in their own town? It is so easy to catch these fucks. People running around in the desert saying &quot;this is a child trafficking shelter&quot;, without any fucking proof at all, does absolutely nothing. There are sick fucks that 100% traffic children, there are sick fucks that are extremely wealthy, who molest and rape kids, there are powerful people that do it, there are homeless people that do it, there is one in every walk of life. If this was truly some sort of honorable thing they are doing to expose pedo&#39;s, they could 100% expose them. There are quite a few groups that already do and it leads to actual fucking arrests. Instead, they would rather take some idiots emails where he talks about food and say, there it is! He is a pedo, he&#39;s connected to HRC, he&#39;s wealthy and a big time Democrat so they must all be pedo&#39;s. </p>

All four and military veterans, they wouldn’t forsake their morals to hide something as horrible as child trafficking.

<p>Thats fine by me man, I can totally understand that stance.  I&#39;m not trying to say anyone is wrong for choosing to side that way</p>

<p>And it’s not the media saying nothing there. It’s the local police saying nothing is there, the media is merely reporting what the police say.</p>

<p>Did the police actually come out with an official statement or was it local news sharing what so and so said about it?  Even if the PD did come out with an official statement it would not surprise me if they were lying.  Police lie all the time in official statements</p>

<p>This is why I dont trust what the police are saying about this.  No indication the camp is being used for any type of criminal activity?  So, I guess its legal to build your own underground bunker that close to the border?  Disregard the sex trafficking part, but this place absolutely looks like a spot for illegal immigrants to stay/hide while coming into the states.  Especially since its so close to the natives that refuse to have a border wall on their land</p>

If they are indeed trafficking pedos, I think they’d be smart enough to keep evidence to a minimum, and for sure not in the open where a bunch of cosplaying rednecks would find it. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see a well sourced post detailing all the circumstantial evidence available with photographs / documents</p>

<p>There is not enough information to really decide one way or the other as of right now. I am suspicious of hardcore &quot;skeptics&quot; who throw any notion out of the window just as much as the hardcore believers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. It&#39;s fine that some people are not convinced that this is a child sex trafficking camp. But this is an area known for cartel and border-crossing activity, and there is a quite a bit of circumstantial evidence that would be consistent with human trafficking. The fact is we just don&#39;t know, and anyone saying it&#39;s definitively <em>not</em> a child trafficking camp is wrong and/or has an agenda. </p>

<p>It is correct, I literally just looked.  You can as well.  Get on desktop, click &quot;Top&quot; and sort from this past month.  There are 4 topics in the top 50 that are about pedos....That&#39;s one per week AKA 1 every 7-10 days.</p>

<p>If you want to count every single topic about it then I can just as easily claim there is as much (or more) topics about jews here or 9/11.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t normally upvote anything, so if they&#39;re at the top its not because of me, but I don&#39;t see anything wrong with bringing attention to a serious problem.  How come you do?  </p>

<p>Not a thing.   It appears you are shifting into some sort of damage control mode though.  Not sure what that is about, but its weird that you&#39;re getting so nervous about this topic</p>

<p>The fact is that you can easily scroll past whatever you don&#39;t like. If you&#39;re too sensitive to even see such topics on the main page, then maybe you shouldn&#39;t be here. There are a lot of ugly conspiracy theories out there and none of them are for the faint-hearted. I understand that it&#39;s morbid stuff and sometimes we all need to step back and take a break from it, but I don&#39;t understand what the flying fuck you mean by &quot;innocent users.&quot; People are not &quot;innocent&quot; just because they prefer not to read subreddit topics about child abuse. You know who <em>is</em> innocent? The abused children. Maybe not in this case, as nothing has been proven to even be going on, but surely in the hundreds, thousands of other actual confirmed child abuse cases. Don&#39;t paint people on this sub as &quot;innocent users.&quot; Perhaps &quot;uninterested&quot; or &quot;disgusted,&quot; but not innocent. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s break this down into a proper sentence: do you believe that the police and those in authority aren&#39;t corrupt?</p>

<p>The simple answer is: some are, but the majority aren&#39;t.</p>

Obviously you&#39;re insulted or just upset or something if you feel the need to insult my sentence structure as your last resort lol, but thanks for actually _finally_ answering the question without being (that much) of a pretentious cunt!</p>

<p>And actually if you&#39;re reeeallly going to go there, your changed question does not have the same implication as mine therefore it&#39;s not simplified or corrected at all really, just changed. The way I worded my question was in a way to specifically imply that some but not all positions of authority are corrupt. Your changed sentence implies that _all_ police and people in authority are corrupt, which is obviously not fucking true and not at all what I&#39;ve been arguing or saying this whole time. But like I said if you really need to simplify things for yourself to understand!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah obviously. Look up just about any conspiracy on google and the very first results you&#39;ll get are articles trying to debunk them. Google&#39;s search results are obviously controlled just like any flow of information to the public. It&#39;s not difficult or that far fetched. </p>

<p>Also I looked into the snopes article you mentioned. All the points debunking it are just reports from police and other authorities. Of course they&#39;re going to lie about this stuff. The authorities always lie about this stuff and avoid it all in the first place to the best of their ability. When the site in Tucson was first discovered, it was immediately reported to police and authorities who refuse to go anywhere near it, and of course when they finally do, they deny literally every claim made about the site. </p>

<p>Why would some random group of guys be lying about a human trafficking site? What&#39;s the point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s more about the fact that, in the absence of any other evidence, this just adds one more thing to the unlikelihood of the claims about it being a <em>definite</em> trafficker hideout. Now, if some of the claims had more substantial evidence — which could include someone coming forward, but isn&#39;t a necessity, and could just as easily be something like evidence of bodily harm (like blood) — then that would already be more than what has currently been shown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, this just looked like a Coyote rest area. I am sure if that is what it is, then children have been there, but that does not indicate a child sex abuse ring. Also, homeless people are weird as fuck and most have mental illness, so don&#39;t expect a simple explanation with some of the shit found there. </p>

<p>It very well could be some type of child sex abuse camp, but to me, a homeless person fort or a coyote rest stop seemed more plausible. If it is a coyote rest point, then yes they are trafficking humans, but I don&#39;t think that automatically means they are torturing and murdering their cargo. Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they said they found children&#39;s shoes and clothing. this is the main reason they deduced it was a sex trafficking ring. i lived in tucson for 17 years and they found dugouts way more sophisticated than the one in his vids. they are primarily drug traffickers pit stops. often times women and children being smuggled across the borders are put in the holes  by the south of the border operatives to wait for the us connect. the kids are given us clothing so they dont stand out. and the women if they cant pay are used as mules to deliver cocaine and heroin to the us connections who get them where they want to go. it was almost a weekly occurrence to read in the news of more of these bunkers.  there is an incredibly complex system of these running from calif. to tx. most of these desert locations are so remote it is sheer luck to find them.  they can with a team of men dig one out in a single evening.</p>

<p>Lol what? Are you saying every buisness has ties to the Clinton foundation and George Soros?</p>

<p>Like, Laura Silby has the same connections to the Clinton foundation as any child trafficker would. </p>

<p>Where are you going with that fact? </p>

<p>Just having any ties to the clinton foundation would be indictive of illegal activity. Im not stary eyed like everyone else. It is a foundation whos sole purpose is to fund corruption. Its the ONLY purpose the foundation has. It is why the foundation was set up. It is way it still exists today. It is Bill and Hillarys and Chelsys tool to fund all the illegal shit they do.</p>
