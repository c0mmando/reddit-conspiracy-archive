        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yes this is a new account.  I&#39;m mostly a lurker here, but because of the public nature of my reddit profile and my life, I needed to make a new account to post on Conspiracies. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve followed craig sawyer for a little over a year now (once again, on a dummy account) and still do.  I&#39;m very familiar with his work.  That&#39;s why this all strikes me as wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen all the pictures and videos on Facebook, here and other places.  When this first broke here on reddit, people were saying they found bodies and teeth and things,  but that turned out to be hearsay.  What they DID find was still disturbing.  One of the most talked about items was the straps on s tree.  What people are calling the &quot;rape tree&quot;.  This is over the top ridiculous.  Here is why:</p>

<p>1) they are saying those are straps used to bind children to a tree so they can be held, raped or whatever.  There is no way that&#39;s what those are used for.  But, any child will easily slip out of those because they are non adjustable.   Children&#39;s arms and legs are too small.  </p>

<p>2)  if this were truly child trafficking, why in the fuck are they binding them to trees to rape them?  Out in the open air?  Where people can see or hear them?  Why rape and beat or bruise the product before they get to the end user?  Nobody wants to sleep with a busted ass looking hooker.  Same would go for child trafficking.  If what you all seem to think is true, the person doing the buying would want to do the beating.  Right?  Isn&#39;t that supposed to be how it works?  </p>

<p>3) I am 95% positive those are the kinds of straps I&#39;ve used before in camping when I&#39;ve set up a hammock.  You wrap them around the tree and they&#39;re very tough and stable.  But they come on different sizes,  but none of them could hold a child.  They&#39;re all too big.  However, of that&#39;s what type of straps they are, it would give further evidence as to this being some kind of homeless camp.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also reading a lot of comment about how they found various articles that seemingly didn&#39;t belong there such as kids toys. Honestly, I&#39;m not surprised at all.  The &quot;camps&quot; as I&#39;ll call it, is very close to the border.  I think it&#39;s possible that coyotes used this area as a post border stop.  They use places like to to stop and rest after crossing the border.  It&#39;s not uncommon for them to also place food, water, clothes,  and objects to keep kids busy/quiet.  That would mean that this IS a site of human trafficking,  just not the kind they think it was.  The freedom kind.  Not the rape kind. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also seeing a lot if comments about the septic tank or whatever the hell it is under all the debris with a very small opening.   People are saying it&#39;s a cell for kids.  There is no way that&#39;s what that is.  First of all, it&#39;s outside.  Why in the hell would you keep people outside where people may hear them if they scream??  I also keep seeing people say that the opening is so small that only a kid could fit In.  That may be true, we don&#39;t know.  But we also didn&#39;t get to see enough of it.  For all we know there may be a hidden or rear exit.  You may even be able to enter it thru the top.  In any event, there is DEFINITELY another way in other than the one that was shown because there was a big teachers desk type piece of furniture inside of it.  There is no way that big ass desk was squeezed thru an opening that only a child could fit thru.  It just isn&#39;t possible.  Forget it.  We&#39;re not being told everything. And it&#39;s very possible they are using camera tricks to make it seem worse than it actually is.</p>

<p>And that brings me to my final point.  Craig sawyer is many things.  One of these things is an actor.  It says so right on his profile.  In addition to that, he pimps has line of tactical gear almost constantly.   I don&#39;t know if it was his intention going into this to get publicity or donations or if that is a side effect.  But I do know he legit works with veterans to do some good things.  So I don&#39;t know.  But what I do know is that what he found was NOT a child trafficking camp.  At least not in the way he&#39;s making it out to be.  It&#39;s almost certainly a combination of homeless camp/coyote hole.  There is no doubt about it.  Not unless VOP shows us some evidence they haven&#39;t released yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like a illegal alien camp to me. We have them all over the place here in rural Texas, back in pastures, in draws, wooded areas, etc. The county sheriff broke one up on a friends back forty about a mile from my place just last year. I could probably find 5 of them within a 5 mile radius of where I live right now. It could be something more sinister, but that&#39;s what it looks like to me. One thing these vets should watch for is the illegals or coyotes or whoever the hell they are often booby trap them when they go out to work or do whatever it is they do. They&#39;re probably aware of that though, as its common knowledge anywhere you find these camps,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deductive reasoning and critical thinking right here, good post.  I agree with most of what you said, and i think part of the biggest problem here is that people tend to try and find something so hard that they&#39;ll find it in anything.</p>

<p>The &#39;camp&#39; certainly is creepy, and i wouldn&#39;t be interested in spending any time there, but it just doesn&#39;t make sense as to what people are calling it.  If people are involved in something so illegal and extreme as human trafficking, they have to do it properly and extremely well, otherwise it will fail.  It&#39;s terrible, but it&#39;s like any other business and has to be run the right way to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because showing up at a hotel with a gang of kids where there could possibly be HD cameras everywhere isnt a good idea.

    <div class="md"><p>Not saying that I believe it is a trafficking camp...but I would be willing to believe that whoever handles the children are not the ones with all the money...they hare most likely Mexicans that know how to live out there and then get paid a small amount when they deliver the product.
Its a lot like any other dirty/illegal business...they can&#39;t just take a bunch of kids around in the open...especially if they are being looked for...you have to keep it on the down low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure that if this is a child trafficking site, which IS a possibility. My bet is that drugs were used on the kids. I mean come on that&#39;s the first thing I thought of, because you&#39;re right kids would scream. BUT then again, it&#39;s almost 100&amp;#37; certain that children traffickers use drugs to keep them docile...  </p>

<p>You also can&#39;t say that you DO KNOW that&#39;s it isn&#39;t a child trafficking camp, why because you have no evidence, and what I have seen leans more towards children trafficking than a homeless camp.   </p>

<p>I have had MANY hammocks for camping and never have I seen straps like this...why because they usually don&#39;t come with them...or not much at all...  </p>

<p>If it was a children sex trafficking site, why would they rape them? I think that&#39;s the dumbest statement I&#39;ve heard. Also isn&#39;t the case that with drug dealers they usually &quot;test&quot; the product...same thing applies.  </p>

<p>In the end, if this isn&#39;t one, it doesn&#39;t mean that the elite are using adult and children sex trafficking to fund there agenda and control world events. How do you think they keep politicians, celebrities, and the sort in check? Fucking blackmail!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the skull, and the bulldozing. You know police donâ€™t move that fast. Are you a conspiracy theorist? Do you even care about child trafficking? Do you have a soul?!? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus dude!!  Just because I still think it was a homeless camp doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have a soul or care about trafficking.  </p>

<p>Look, VOP doesn&#39;t exactly have a ton of credibility.   They lied and said there were kids there to get sawyer to come around to gain credibility.   They keep saying they have all this evidence, but nobody has seen any of it.  The blueprints,  the bloody knife,  all the kids shoes.  Where is it?  Where is any of it.  And even if they did find a bloody knife, how do they know it&#39;s blood?  They don&#39;t have the means to know that for sure.  Not to mention the skull they found was 30 miles away from the homeless camp.  </p>

<p>Trafficking exists in many forms.  But not all of that is sex trafficking.  Sometimes it&#39;s people looking for for a better life by crossing the border.  And this hollywood type view people have of sex trafficking doesn&#39;t help.  What nobody seems to know or remember is that most victims of trafficking are willing, at least at first.  And sex trafficking of small children does happen, but it&#39;s mostly done by their shitty parents.  Not like in Hollywood where a kid is snatched off the street and put into a van never to be seen again. (Although that does and has happened too, it&#39;s not typical).  </p>

<p>Anyway, my point is the idea that it was some kind of trafficking stop or camp is ridiculous.  It doesn&#39;t work that way.  That&#39;s fake ass hollywood shit.  And if it were, it&#39;s probably a corridor used by coyotes to get people across the border, NOT A RAPE CAMP WITH A &quot;RAPETREE&quot;.  which isn&#39;t a real thing.  That&#39;s fake news and speculative bullshit.  </p>

<p>Think about it.  You some sexual deviant who pays thousands or maybe millions of dollars to force yourself on a child.  If you paid all that money would you want to do it at a dirty ass open air camp surrounded by garbage?!?  Of you ran a trafficking ring and made all this money, would you put your operation out in the open?! Even if it is miles away from a city, that camp was right by the highway!!  You got all this money, why take the risk?!?!  At least use a storage shed or something!  For fucks sake, think about it!!  What you see in the movies and on tv isn&#39;t real!!  These operations are sophisticated.   They put a lot of thought into this to avoid capture.  How stupid would you have to be to sell underage tail next to an interstate?!?!  One person drives by and hears a scream or breaks down on the highway in the middle of the night and the jig is up!!  IT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE!!</p>

<p>and the vop guy is a real human dumpster fire.  Using child trafficking and fake accusations of child trafficking to make a name for himself.  Yeah he found a skull that I thought was obviously adult, but he stated over and over that it was a child&#39;s just to draw attention to himself.  On top of that, that piece if shit exploits people&#39;s (people like you) ignorance of how human trafficking works.  He plays these ridiculous ideas in people&#39;s minds such as &quot;this is a rape tree&quot; and &quot;this camp is where they rape people&quot; and he does all this shit for his personal glory.  And people eat it up because, yeah, it takes a monster to sell humans of any age, much less children, into sex slavery.  It&#39;s terrible, and people want to know about terrible shit.  But everyone takes his word for it because he presents himself as an expert, and he has not the first clue what the fuck he&#39;s talking about or how sex trafficking works.  Or at least of he does, he Intentionally misleads people.  And people, again, like you, eat it the fuck up without question.  And they rage and try to take a stand.  Not knowing that their cause is rooted In complete and utter bullshit.  They&#39;ve been lied to.  But it&#39;s such a good cause that anyone who questions it is suddenly made to look like a terrible person, JUST LIKE YOU JUST TRIED TO DO TO ME.  You went from nothing to telling me I don&#39;t have a soul because I don&#39;t care about trafficking.  All because I dared to think critically.   </p>

<p>In summation, your anger over this, while understandabe, is misdirected.  You&#39;ve been lied to and tricked and your ego won&#39;t allow you to realize it.  As mark twain (I believe) said : &quot;its easier to trick a man than it is to convince him he has been tricked.&quot;  And you sir or madam, have been 100% tricked.  I just hope you&#39;re able to realize it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless about what this camp is or is not. You seem to not understand that sex trafficking is one of the largest problems in the world. Fuck, it is the largest, the UN is even involved.  Almost all countries are. </p>

<p>The people that actually run the world, use it as a means to make their money to control world events and blackmail to get what they want. </p>

<p>Too many large profile pedophiles donâ€™t even get time!! For say raping a 5 year old! Itâ€™s disgusting. The underbelly of this world is disgusting!! Our compliance is disgusting! </p>

<p>Yes! Kids ARE snatched off the streets. Yes Hollywood uses their fiction to show you what actually does happen...art imitates life. They put real shit in front of you and call it fake so youâ€™ll never truly believe it. It also helps with predictive programming. </p>

<p>Everything is connected. Youâ€™re right I was blinded because I wanted something big exposed. My ego however, isnâ€™t really in question because not only am I a proud conspiracy theorist I also study the spiritual arts and mediate. My ego is under control. </p>

<p>My theories are based on all accounts of what is happening in life. The world is a stage! Weâ€™re all being played! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trafficking goes both ways on the border, though, yes, heading south is less common than north. In 2009 a Tohono tribal elder testified that recent kidnapping victims in Phoenix most likely were snuggled into Mexico through his reservation.
