        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello friends! I’ve been working on researching and writing about cabal child trafficking for over 5 years now, it’s taken me a week I guess to get caught up on this Tucson situation, and for this thread I am interested in laying out my thoughts on the situation, examining the validity of evidence, and exploring the cabal links, as well as prompting a discussion and asking for criticism so we can collectively come to the best possible understanding.</p>

<p>First off, two things stuck out to me immediately. One was how poorly the situation has been handled by Veterans on Patrol, who have been exposed in multiple lies such as a lack of police response (9 police reports have been filed) and using an initial claim that children were present at the camp (there weren’t) in order to garner interest. Not since the massive McMartin Preschool child rape scandal have I seen such misinformation and misdirection, making it exceptionally difficult to know exactly whats going on.</p>

<p>For those out of the loop on that reference, McMartin Preschool was the site of a massive child abuse ring (and subsequent coverup) in the 1980s. Even though over 400 kids testified about being sexually abused, most of them showing physical evidence, and many of them confirming their story again as adults, the cabal was able to sweep the whole incident under the rug by blaming the whole incident on over-zealous therapists, but not after a few suspicious murders. The testimonies of kids were attributed to false memories, and a “False Memory Syndrome Foundation” was set up, staffed almost entirely by former members of the military-intelligence complex.</p>

<p>Before continuing, if anyone is unfamiliar with McMartin and the many other documented cases of organized child abuse in the US covered up by Gov agencies, please read the following investigations, which are crucial in developing the proper context to understand modern events:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil">www.wanttoknow.info/mk/liftingtheveil</a></p>

<p>Ok, back to Tucson, the second thing that stuck out to me immediately was how many cabal actors were linked to the site! The land the site is on belongs to Cemex, in which George Soros and the Bronfmans have significant ownership stakes, and which has donated to and partnered with the Clinton Foundation, and exists in the jurisdiction of Jonathon Rothschild, Tucson mayor, for starters.</p>

<p>So despite VoP and their leader making a pretty big mess of the publicity and making a few false claims, the various links to cabal actors made me think that there is definitely a lot here worth investigating.</p>

<p><strong>EXAMINING THE EVIDENCE</strong></p>

<p>First, I looked to Craig “Sawman” Sawyer, a former Team 6 Navy Seal and founder of Veterans 4 Child Rescue, a respectable organization with success in busting pedos and saving kids. Craig Sawyer is NOT involved with VoP, which seems to be (mis)handling the investigation, and in fact, it was the false claim of finding two children by VoP that made Sawyer bust his ass to get out to the camp in the first place.</p>

<p>Sawyer arrived at the site and immediately decided that there were some very suspicious things going on. While recording a video, he documented the existence of a very strange dug out cavern with a septic tank inside that seems to be used as a holding cell for small children.</p>

<p>This secret underground bunker was quite big, fitting six people sitting at one point, and it was dug out manually, which must have taken a lot of effort. The top was concealed by piled logs and sticks, and surrounded by trees. Inside this underground room was a buried septic tank, angled with its base downwards and opening upwards. The opening is to small for an adult to fit more than their head but it would be a fine size for kids. There were drawers, children&#39;s clothing, fruit loops and a few other items that indicated kids stayed in there for some periods.</p>

<p>At one point in his video, Craig Sawyer stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“None of us who stuck our heads in that container could imagine putting our kids in there willingly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is because there was a serious lack of ventilation and the uncomfortable angles of the floor at the bottom of the tank. He also noted that it would be impossible for a small child to overcome the incline and climb out of the hole.</p>

<p>What other evidence did Craig Sawyer show on video?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are peculiar straps tied or nailed to at least 6 different trees made out of various materials, all seem to be tied low, between the waist  and chest of an average adult male. (One or two were shown in the video, the rest have been documented in photos.)  </p></li>
<li><p>Barbie Dolls  </p></li>
<li><p>Cribs  </p></li>
<li><p>Brunette Hair     Dye  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>What evidence did Craig Sawyer claim to see but did NOT document on video?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Strollers  </p></li>
<li><p>Childrens shoes of various sizes  </p></li>
<li><p>A rubber pulley-type system that connected from near the main path to the grove where the straps are located.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>A quick digression: When determining the validity of evidence, I usually divide pieces into 4 categories: Direct, circumstantial, weak and useless. And from there, the source has to be examined, primary document vs. eyewitness vs. secondary source etc. in order to determine validity.  </p>

<p>The first list can be filed under a direct source because it is verifiable on video, the second list has to be considered eyewitness source. Based on my research on their backgrounds, I consider Craig Sawyer to be reliable eyewitness testimony and will take into consideration his oral account, and I do NOT consider VoP to be reliable eyewitness testimony, and will not consider any of their claims that do not have video or photo evidence backing it up.</p>

<p>So, I file the dug out underground septic tank holding cell as DIRECT evidence because there is no rational explanation for its existence other than for holding and hiding children. If you disagree with that statement, please try to examine and understand your biases and do research on the vastness of child trafficking to avoid any mental gymnastics.</p>

<p>The cribs and barbie dolls could be labeled weak consequential evidence because they could conceivably exist at any homeless camp with a family, yet they still corroborate the idea that children were a large focus at this site.</p>

<p>However, the crib, strollers, and shoes of various sizes TOGETHER indicate that there must have been many different kids of all ages brought through the site, MANY more child related products than a single homeless family could use.</p>

<p>The hair dye indicates that there is an attempt to conceal identity. Some skeptics have pointed out that if they are smuggling kids into the US, the kids probably will already have dark hair. To that, I respond that the trafficking highway goes both ways, and a blonde American kid smuggled out to some international high roller is probably the biggest single “product” these sick fucks can move (Well, second biggest, only to kids with rare genetic pupil disorders like Maddy McCann)</p>

<p>The straps tied/nailed to trees are very suspicious. The oft-repeated explanation that they were used to support a hammock or to hang food doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Photos show that distances between the straps are inconsistent to the idea that they would support something between them. And as an Eagle scout, I know first hand that you NEVER hang food close to the ground touching the tree.</p>

<p>Adding in the rubber pull system, it seems to be a logical extrapolation that these straps would be used to restrain kids for abuse/rape, and a lookout would man the rubber pull system as a way of alerting the rapists if anyone was spotted nearby.</p>

<p>OK, so just from Craig Sawyer initial testimony it seems obvious to me that the site was used for child trafficking. All of the above is relevant circumstantial or direct evidence that child trafficking is taking place. Now, as of yesterday Sawyer announced he and his org were moving on from Tucson. However, this was not based in a doubt of any of the above evidence, but instead based in a complete annoyance with VoP and his trust in the Tucson Police Department to come to a rational conclusion. (Later, we will see why the TPD is not to be trusted). So to me this doesn’t invalidate any of the analysis of the above, rather it just indicates that we won’t be learning any more from V4CR.</p>

<p>So, now lets move on to Vets on Patrol and see what evidence they have presented. My main initial criticism of VoP is that they make tons of claims but do not provide visual evidence to back them up!  </p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: I have not watched every VoP video so if I am missing some evidence, either oral or recorded, please say so in the comments!</p>

<p>So what evidence does VoP claim to have?</p>

<p>First, they claimed to have made a major breakthrough with finding a childs skull. Here is one of the pictures they shared:   </p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/6hfz9rvk9z211.jpg">https://i.redd.it/6hfz9rvk9z211.jpg</a></p>

<p>Now, it definitely looks like a small skull to me! But I admit I am not an expert. The TPD took the skull to forensic analysis who determined it was an adults skull. Furthermore, the skull was moved from its original position and was found 20 miles from the original location, in another suspected camp. So, even though this find is intriguing to me, it has to be classified as useless when arguing with skeptics because multiple leaps have to be taken to directly connect it, and the official story that its an adult skull probably from an immigrant seems simpler, even if it doesn’t resonate.</p>

<p>They arrived at the above location due to allegedly finding blueprints for the layouts of other camps in the area, but I do not think they have produced this evidence, so again we have to qualify it as useless.  </p>

<p>They claim that bulldozers came and cleared a suspected site. They shared this photo to corroborate:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redditmedia.com/ET02IQu4-H4ItChMWvEA-xzwmRK1M89iALMISDSr8uU.png?s=c7230d29827fc2ccf29fb1deee5f1a9e">https://i.redditmedia.com/ET02IQu4-H4ItChMWvEA-xzwmRK1M89iALMISDSr8uU.png?s=c7230d29827fc2ccf29fb1deee5f1a9e</a></p>

<p>Indeed an area has been cleared but I haven’t able to find out if the actual area is larger than the one in the photo, or where exactly it took place. It is definitely suspicious that it would be cleared so quickly but this could rationally be explained as company policy to prevent a scandal. So I think this evidence is relevant but weak.</p>

<p>They claim to have found a bloody knife , pornographic material and condoms, but haven’t provided visual evidence, so this has to be filed as useless. This would be HUGE evidence if they produced visual verification, but as far as I know they haven’t so these statements are useless.</p>

<p>They claim that the police have not investigated, but there are lots of local news reports on the police investigating and 9 police reports have been filed, so this serves to detract from their cause.</p>

<p>(Source for 9 police reports is Craig Sawyer in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAVuAvkE6bM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAVuAvkE6bM</a>)</p>

<p>There is a picture of a strap with alleged oxidized blood circulating, which was actually found by someone on 4chan who has earned the nickname GoatAnon by posting pictures of a fire on a suspected site with his goats in the foreground. I am currently unsure if he has submitted the strap to forensics, he is not involved with VoP so maybe he will act more rationally. Evidence type: status pending.</p>

<p>VoP allege they found another Coyote (trafficker) camp some miles away with lots of backpacks and childrens shoes. Has anyone seen this on video? If yes, then this supports the understanding that this general area is a corridor for human trafficking. </p>

<p>So unfortunately, VoP has in my opinion served to detract from the legitimacy of the Tucson investigation and are invigorating skeptics through their livestream rants, mishandling and exaggeration of evidence, and simply through the very fact that the founder of Veterans on Patrol isn’t a veteran. If anyone disagrees with this assessment or has knowledge that VoP has been a helpful organization please let me know and I will take the input into account.</p>

<p>Despite the actions of VoP, I come to the conclusion based on the available evidence we are indeed looking at a camp used for child trafficking, likely one hub in a corridor of many. However, there is an unfortunate lack of “smoking gun” evidence for mainstream onlookers who, out of ignorance, are skeptical of the possibility.</p>

<p>But so far we have only looked at half the story, lets go a little deeper into the rabbit hole. Always fun to do that!</p>

<p><strong>SUSPICIOUS ACTORS, EVENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS CONNECTED TO THE CAMP</strong></p>

<p>Alright, now we are going to examine some “deeper cuts” into the <em>circumstanc</em>es surrounding the camp, which are naturally <em>circumstanc</em>ial but in this particular case coalesce into a mind-blowing picture of cabal involvement.</p>

<p>The first thing to mention is that a child trafficking scandal has been predicted THREE TIMES in the last few years. An anon on 4chan wrote in March 2017:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The biggest happening will be #Tucsongate when J rothschild/ Tucson mayor is outed for trafficking kids through Casa de los Ninos with the help of the Clinton foundation.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone on Voat highlighted Tucson as a place of interest for further research over a year ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1672098">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1672098</a></p>

<p>And lastly, Tucson trafficking has been a topic on Crazy Days and Nights, a “dark secrets revealed” gossip site focused on Hollywood.</p>

<p>So at the least, the above indicates that child trafficking in Tucson has been suspected for some time, and maybe even indicates a higher level of awareness on the level of Tucson trafficking being an “open secret”.  </p>

<p>Moving on, one of the first revelations to come from the investigation is that the land the camp is on is owned by CEMEX, a very large cement company based in Mexico. And wow, does Cemex have connections to actors previously suspected of being involved in child trafficking!  </p>

<p>Soros Fund Management LLC has a $43 million ownership stake in Cemex, and Bronfman E.L. Rothschild LP also have an ownership stake.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.holdingschannel.com/13f/soros-fund-management-llc-top-holdings/">https://www.holdingschannel.com/13f/soros-fund-management-llc-top-holdings/</a></p>

<p>Cemex has donated to and officially partnered with the Clinton Foundation, including winning a $7 million bid to work with the foundation in Haiti after the devastating earthquake (a verified child abduction location).  </p>

<p>The CEO of Bronfman E.L. Rothschild LP is Lynn Forester de Rothschild, a member of the Council of Foreign Relations and a friend of Hillary Clinton  </p>

<p>Evidence of comfy Rothschild/Clinton relationship:</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/1570">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/1570</a></p>

<p>The chairman of the board of Bronfman E.L. Rothschild LP is Matthew Bronfman, who has two sisters, one a major funder of trafficking cult NXIVM, and another who is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.</p>

<p>Three possibly relevant notes regarding Cemex: They hold a patent for blood mixed in concrete, they provided the concrete for the Florida bridge that collapsed recently, and last month they released a policy statement on human trafficking.</p>

<p>Before discussing the implications of this web of corrupt actors, lets look at the rest of the suspicious circumstances we can find.</p>

<p>First, is the Tucson Police Department itself. The current police chief oversaw the rape of a trafficked minor by over 30 of his officers while located in Richmond, California, and is currently directly named in a lawsuit regarding the case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Richmond-cops.pdf">https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Richmond-cops.pdf</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.redditmedia.com/K6s9LrOm-ILi_SoAWCxZmgjdwjTPFzLcITGBKnr8WWg.jpg?s=4c99d19ceb63216698e98ed1bf591669">https://i.redditmedia.com/K6s9LrOm-ILi_SoAWCxZmgjdwjTPFzLcITGBKnr8WWg.jpg?s=4c99d19ceb63216698e98ed1bf591669</a></p>

<p>Further, there is a detective from the TPD who is being accused of “serious investigative misconduct” by failing to investigate 36 child sexual abuse cases.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1528436974731.jpg">http://i.4cdn.org/pol/1528436974731.jpg</a></p>

<p>At what point does it become clear that there is an institutionalized policy of covering up abuse in the department?</p>

<p>Next, the anon who predicted #tucsongate was right that the mayor of Tucson is Jonathon Rothschild, who was also the board chairman of Casa de los Ninos at one point if not currently. Its not intellectually honest to presume that Rothschild = Cabal but it is definitely a connection to add to the map.</p>

<p>This can’t be a coincidence: The local child trafficking task force is called SAATURN, Southern Arizona Anti-Trafficking Unified Response Team, very likely a controlled opposition org and  hints at the occult nature of child trafficking networks.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/sb573i7fpo211.png">https://i.redd.it/sb573i7fpo211.png</a></p>

<p>A couple days ago, a fire broke out on Cemex property that was suspected to be a trafficking site, military helicopters were above the scene. Definitely suspicious. I haven’t heard updates on this story recently.</p>

<p>One VERY suspicious actor right now is the leadership of the Tohono O’odham Nation, which sits on the border of Mexico and is suspected of harboring the entrance and exit of traffickers through their land. The Nation has refused to allow authorities on their land in the past to inspect ports of entry and has also been accused by the president of the local border control union as being “… responsible for close to 50&amp;#37; of all drug seizures in the entire country.”</p>

<p>Now, I doubt a union leader would be able to know that for a fact, but it reinforces the legitimacy of suspicion towards the Nation.</p>

<p>Did I miss anything?</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>Piecing the puzzle together reveals a cohesive picture of how the cabal operates their child trafficking rings.  </p>

<p>A cement company under the cabal’s control provides locations for trafficking hubs, and uses their resources to fill in and clean sites after use. A blind spot along the border is used to smuggle kids in and out, and presumably low level gangs (MS-13 is a known cabal employee) physically transport them from hub to hub, until they are transferred to higher ups in Tucson. The operation is being funded by massively wealthy cabal members who have a history of suspicious connections and scandals, and also have membership in organizations that work to shape public opinion and policy. The cabal has control of the network from top to bottom, from working with local gangs, to owning the property of the hubs through a corrupt company, to corrupting a police department, using charities to cover up sinister operations, “controlled opposition” by running the Southern Arizona anti child trafficking taskforce, and having a corrupted mayor and senator to help occult the operation.</p>

<p>The obvious child trafficking bunker that has been uncovered should be a catalyst for massive investigations, but local authorities can’t be trusted. There is not yet a smoking gun that would generate international attention but surely there is one out there. There is a lot of misinformation being thrown around and we should all strive our best to push this story using rational arguments in order to not turn away people who could be potentially woken. I am praying that this story doesn’t die down and get swept under the rug like all those major child abuse scandals in the `80s and `90s that the mainstream now collectively misremembers as a “satanic panic”.</p>

<p>This post isn’t meant to be definitive in any way, its the first time I’ve organized all my thoughts on the matter, so please give me feedback and criticism and together we can find the best way to move forward with trying to expose the cabals trafficking network.  </p>

<p>I have faith that with continued attention, research and discussion, a breakthrough can be made.</p>

<p>Love vibes to all, thanks for reading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think the most glaring aspect of the argument It&#39;s just a homeless camp is the septic tank.  They aren&#39;t exactly cheap nor easy to move and the one used was obviously new.  That&#39;s not to say a homeless person didn&#39;t put it there, but it would have taken a grip of cash, a truck, and a lot of work to install.... All for a spot that didn&#39;t look like a grownup would live in.  But who knows, It&#39;s definitely a weird situtaion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your post. It looks like to me this was indeed a site for some sick shit. But you tube video people fucked up and chance of doing anythinf about it. </p>

<p>As sick as it sounds, they would have been much better off to dress in torn down clothes and pretend to be a drifter looking for a meal. Catch them in the act. Maybe try to save the child there on the scene, but even penetrating the orginization would have served a higher cause.</p>

<p>Instead they ran in banging pots and pans. Making sure everyone knew their presence and intent. Allowing police intervention and cover up.</p>

<p>I wonder if this is a controled release. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good write up. I read somewhere that there was a desk inside the dig out place. if this is true, would there not have to be a second entrance/exit big enough for adults? if that’s the case, could the hole be used solely for ventilation, detracting from the claim that it is kid sized?  sawyer said the conditions there would have been very harsh, but considering no one was there, wouldn’t the more likely conclusion have been that it’s a coyote camp for illegal immigrants that doesn’t get used during the summer months?</p>

<p>Craig Sawyer showed the size of the opening in his video, but he has taken them down. I&#39;ll try to find another source.</p>

<p>I think that conclusion is a rational one but I disagree it is the more likely one. The underground bunker was already quite big to give shelter to people without having to add in the tank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chapter IV of the <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/pedophocracy.html">Pedophocracy</a> link OP shared really opened my eyes! I didn&#39;t realize over 400 individuals, both children and past California residents as old as 20, reported similar things happening at these three Manhattan Beach schools! Crazy how the initial accuser, AND the private investigator hired by the parents, were among those to die under mysterious circumstances before testifying. It is easy to hear the allegations of tunnels and secret sites and immediately discredit the entire thing, but it&#39;s amazing that so many of the 400 alleged victims had genital and anal scarring. There just seem to be a few pieces that raise valid concerns, that have not yet been fully and completely debunked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually don&#39;t bring up McMartin as a shining case study exactly because of all the sabotage and misinfo surrounding it. But it was apt here because Tucson is experiencing a similar problem. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, doctors testified that ALL children who made it to trial showed medical signs of abuse.</p>

<p>Most expensive criminal trial in us history, lasting years, getting covered from day one, and thats swept under the rug? This is the original pgate, amigo, complete with made up satanic rituals and tunnels that dont exist. The case fell apart because it became clear that the initial accounts from the children were coerced and entirely made up by the interviewers.  Meaning innocent people had their lives destroyed because everybody believed the ravings of a delusional schizophrenic-the original accuser. I encourage people to read the link you posted, and any other coverage from real news sources about that trial.   30 years later and people are still looking for the door to the basement in buildings with no basement. </p>

I showed several links of videos where he showed a camp, a coyote spot, and a knife/underwear.</p>

<p>ttps://<a href="http://www.bitchute.com/video/k8IgGjwGMd3I/">www.bitchute.com/video/k8IgGjwGMd3I/</a></p>

<p>This shows another spot they found that looks to be a homeless camp? A bunch of stuff there. Look at the difference from the alleged sex camp:

    <div class="md"><p>I also think the spiral symbol is important. It&#39;s been in several areas. It&#39;s not a pedo symbol. But it is a symbol see in Arizona. I also showed some information on the supposed director of Casa de los ninos, and a potential side company with a trademark spiral design.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll paste my three older comments:
Look at this symbol in the casino instagram page: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BH8UkL9BoDK/?taken-by=diamondcasinos">https://www.instagram.com/p/BH8UkL9BoDK/?taken-by=diamondcasinos</a></p>

<p>This thread talks about it:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/8oe5vc/there_is_major_down_voting_on_any_post_or_comment/">https://np.reddit.com/r/greatawakening/comments/8oe5vc/there_is_major_down_voting_on_any_post_or_comment/</a></p>

<p>I found this radio frequency site with diamond and cemex listed: <a href="https://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?tab=reports&amp;amp;mid=68&amp;amp;rpt=1&amp;amp;os=200&amp;amp;s=freq">https://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?tab=reports&amp;amp;mid=68&amp;amp;rpt=1&amp;amp;os=200&amp;amp;s=freq</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how valid this information is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it looks like anon discovered that the drainage tunnels that end near where that camp was found lead back to the Desert Diamond Hotel and Casino in Tucson. This location has refused National Guard on their land, opposed the border wall, and 50% of all drug seizures in the NATION take place on their land.</p>

<p>towards the middle is where it is.</p>

<p>This is the best i can do for now. </p>

<p>and </p>

<p>So follow the women I think. </p>

<p>The director of Casa de los Ninos is Arianna Sholes-Douglas at least that&#39;s what I see here:
<a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/az/casa-de-los-ninos.html">https://www.bizapedia.com/az/casa-de-los-ninos.html</a></p>

<p>There is a Jewels for the Journey LLC here, run by a Arianna Douglas. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same person.
<a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/az/jewels-for-the-journey-llc.html">https://www.bizapedia.com/az/jewels-for-the-journey-llc.html</a></p>

<p>And then I found in the anon thread, mention of a spike in sex trafficking during a gem show?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Gem Show is just beginning, but with the thousands of people coming into town to see the exhibits, also comes a spike in sex trafficking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>NOT STATING ANYTHING. NOT LINKING ANYTHING. JUST PRESENTING INFORMATION.</p>

<p>Edit: here is a trademark the jewels for journey applied for. It&#39;s apparently for beauty/hygiene/wellness? Not really sure:
<a href="https://www.trademarkia.com/logo-85447152.html">https://www.trademarkia.com/logo-85447152.html</a></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>I found this symbol on this instagram page: The lodge Ventana. Now not saying this is specifically a pedophile symbol. Just showing a compilation of symbols that have the spiral. please do not harass these businesses:

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that the camp in question does look different from usual homeless camps. That’s what seemed off to me. Homeless camps that have constructed a sturdy structure usually have clothes, food trash/wrappings and water bottles on site because they are lived at. And the camp in question did not appear to have those things lying about. It just does not look like a location that people reside at. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read a New Yorket article about how the drug and slave trafficking cartels dig plenty of tunnels around the border. With the right kind of rock it&#39;s relatively easy. Other areas are too sandy or the rock is too hard or won&#39;t stay up.</p>

<p>All cities have tunnels. Major cities with a history of smuggling often have lengthy tunnel networks and hidden entrances.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not about to head into cartel territory with a shovel and a camera. Or do searches and research for you on a specific tunnel. You can see the camp videos if you want to see the partly undetground parts. Tunnels near borders should not be a controversial idea, especially for that region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m preparing a longer post about this on monday but basically, the cabal is a network of psychopaths. Over the years they have saturated global institutions of power and, in the same manner that you and I naturally exclude deviants from our social groups, these psychopaths weed out neurotypical people. They recognize each other and many are members of a black magic occult groups that ritually abuse and murder kids they procure from the same type of trafficking networks this post talks about. </p>

<ol>
<li>Can you please show proof Bronfman are major share holders in Cemtex like implied? You show Soros but not Bronfman. Why?</li>
<li>Why has this investigation focused solely on CF and Soros and not on any of the 100s of other politicians who have taken money from Cemtex?</li>
<li>Do you personally believe this internet investigation is suffering from extreme conformation and political bias?</li>
<li>Do you personally believe the chans would be interested in this story at all without the Soros CF connection.</li>
<li>Is it possible the Soros CF connection is made because it is a sure fire way to get people riled up in order to do further digging?</li>

<li><p>The Clinton Foundation is suspected to be a giant criminal slushfund and pay-to-play operation, so its important to highlight their links to possible crimes whenever possible. The other politicians who took money from cemex should be scrutinized as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I would say significant political bias and moderate confirmation bias.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the investigation would be less active, yes. But a lot of the right are hyped up on child trafficking thanks to QAnon so I think it would still be big on the chans.</p></li>
<li><p>The possibility that this is a psyop or controlled disclosure has crossed my mind. The Soros Clinton connection serves to both ignite one group and distance another. There is an ongoing effort to divide the country and this could be a part of it.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have personally been researching casa de Los Ninos since the anon post started to circulate. I have not seen Rothchilds name attached to it. I have been very suspect of these people and looking into the board of directors. I have only went as far back as 2010 and I can say for sure he hasn&#39;t been since then. This is a very large charity bringing in millions of dollars every year and does have some high level wealthy names attached to it. </p>

<p>My first thought was to follow the money but noticed quickly on archive that they had changed their logo from the suspect pedo symbolism back in 2014. What is odd to me though this that the old symbol has been scrubbed from their old website data. It is literally the only thing missing from past years. You can find it through image search on other websites and events but not their own. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the laws surrounding non profits suck and they are not required to report who is making donations. They do however have to report where the money is going and have to publicly make that available. So I have learned how to and been investigating all of their tax reports from the last few years. I am actually still going through all of it and it is very tedious. I can say at this point some things look very fishy to me. So let me try and break down what I have found so far. </p>

<p>In 2016 they paid $318,000 to pay their board of directors. Those who make over $100,000 have to report their earnings. Which is odd in itself as it seems that non profits are perfect for laundering money. Most of the higher ups report making $0 for the year and only 1/4 reported making money. Ok so not a lot of money to pay staff. Now this is where it gets strange to me. They report $11 million in (other salaries).  Ok wow that is a lot more than they are paying their own staff. Now if they pay someone over $100,000 that has to be reported and they only list 2 people. One is to Medicare trans for $460,000 and the other a Dr Damien Parkinson for $126,000. So what is weird to me is that $10 million of that (other salaries) has gone unreported meaning they supposedly made less than $100,000. That is 10X the amount than has been reported. I am not an expert and I don&#39;t know how things are run there but to me it stinks.  I think at the very least moment money is being laundered out of there. I purposely left off names so not to call anyone out on Reddit. Once I uncover some more I will be making a post if I can come up with anything more substantial because as it stands now it is all circumstancial. </p>

<p>Regarding Rothschild on the board, this is where I got my info</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=275738">https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=275738</a></p>

<p>&quot;He has served in various capacities, including Board President of Casa de los Ninos, Handmaker Jewish Services for the Aging, and Temple Emanu-El.&quot;</p>

<p>Not sure how reliable this site is though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw from archived data that he started as treasurer and moved to president where he remained for the majority of the time. The current president has numerous businesses registered all of which you can find no info online about which makes me think shell companies. One is called xerxes corp which struck me as an interesting name. So I researched xerxes. Very quickly I came across this info:   </p>

<p>In Histories, Herodotus relates that at the Strymon river, the Magi sought good omens by sacrificing white horses. And after using these enchantments and many others besides the river, the armies of Xerxes crossed its bridges at the Nine Ways in Edonian country. When they learned that Nine Ways was the name of the place, they buried alive nine boys and nine girls who were children of the local people. Herodotus further relates that burying people alive is a Persian custom and he adds that Xerxes&#39; wife Amestris buried, twice, seven sons of notable Persians as an offering on her own behalf to the fabled god beneath the earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been a pretty active skeptic during this whole thing, but am opening up to this narrative being a possibility. My current question, and please throw out ANY idea for an answer for a better conclusion, is this:</p>

<p>How did the dresser get in there, and its purpose?</p>

<p>It quite obviously cannot fit through that small hole. And the kids didn&#39;t build it. So, is that tank missing the front wall, and the dirt+hole built after putting the dresser in? And why give kids a homey feel to store their shit in, if its a temporary stop during travel? Any story with trucks, shipping containers, etc of kid smugglers has JUST the kids. Traffickers dgaf about em, there were never any honey buns and babydolls recovered in any of those other stories.</p>

<p>This is starting to vibe out to a serial rapist scenario. Check me,
1. Fairly remote location, yet accessible</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Home environment with hints of a slave/kidnapped victim.</p></li>
<li><p>The hair dye would indicate change of identity to move victim(s) out of state/town. There was NO INTENT of return. Its why there hasn&#39;t been, and also why the stick to climb out of the tank was INSIDE. If the purpose was to trap, keeping it in the tank offered an opportunity to escape. Plus, ONE box of hair dye is supposed to move a whole camp of kids? It even looks like some got wasted on the dolls hair.</p></li>
<li><p>Trafficking scenarios will almost always have designated shit/piss areas. That tank was tidy enough where there was no shit on the floor. And the traffickers wouldnt care to clean it up, considering they wont be able to get in anyway.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This has Stockholm written all over it. And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a few bad cops were involved</p>

<p>The drawers look quite small though, bag of chips for scale. The plastic crates inside are probably the biggest thing that could fit through the hole.</p>

<p>So you are saying instead of an organized trafficking ring it might be a few bad actors killing the kids themselves? It is plausible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to believe, but I can&#39;t so far. Things that nag at me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Skull was found offsite, I don&#39;t understand a direct link between the 2 sites. If it&#39;s a suspected trafficking route, might it be used by others and not exclusively suspected sex camp?</li>
<li>It appears out in the open granted camo&#39;d and close to general population. If the cement company is involved along with their associates, I think it would be a bit more sophisticated being in a major city. </li>
<li>Voices can carry, if they sexually abused children right off a freeway frontage road on a &quot;sex tree&quot; was there any evidence of drugging or gagging them? </li>
<li> Please internet search sex tree, it&#39;s a bit different in most trafficking cases. </li>
<li>Are the goats still around? As a kid it wasn&#39;t unusual to see a goat hanging by it&#39;s hind legs being bled prior to butchering. As a adult a guy that used to live nextdoor used his kid&#39;s swing set to hoist them up to bleed out. You&#39;d want to bleed them into a bucket with a tarp covering the ground because the smell could bring scavengers, birds, big cats, dogs, coyotes, ect. The animal can be field dressed right there after being bled which usually takes a larger sharp knive to do it.</li>
<li>Have they shown the pix of the numerous pairs of shoes? I&#39;d like to see them. </li>
<li>Homeless can be notorious hoarders, but some around here, Los Angeles, have been known to have a sidewalk sale with stuff they gather. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>You should also investigate and write about Lewis Arthur leader of Veterans on Patrol who found the site. I believed him at first and yes there was enough suspicious stuff to warrant an investigation of the site, but on researching Lewis&#39;s background realized all may not be as seems. He was at the Bundy Ranch standoff in 2014, in 2016 he was at the Oregon militia standoff at the Wildlife Refuge where he and his friends caused a fight. He has been accused of being a provacateur, a federal informant or federal agent/Cointel Pro. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL-IhGW39EU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Operation Backyard Brawl Unravels</a> I&#39;m not sure what his angle is, but he does have a suspicious past. Will he be used to discredit pizzagate researchers and those who legitimately want to stop child trafficking? Why was he at 2 standoffs involving the federal government? The Oathbreakers (a militia) have said they are coming to Tucson to help. Is this a honeypot to lure patriots, militia in and discredit them in some way? I really don&#39;t trust him.</p>

<p>Two things you missed. A bizarre transgender person posted a video to YouTube. Denies capturing children then claims responsibility for building the Tucson camp septic shelter. Video is deleted, someone saved a screencap.</p>

<p>Then there is Midnight Productions, and a character or person called Lisa Bigblock. Snuff films probably.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m preparing a longer post about this on monday but basically, the cabal is a network of psychopaths. Over the years they have saturated global institutions of power and, in the same manner that you and I naturally exclude deviants from our social groups, these psychopaths weed out neurotypical people. They recognize each other and many are members of a black magic occult groups that ritually abuse and murder kids they procure from the same type of trafficking networks this post talks about. </p>
