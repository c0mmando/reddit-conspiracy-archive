        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many dietetic associations around the world now claim that a plant based diet is one of the most healthy and nutritious diets for humans.</p>

<p><strong>American Dietetic Association</strong>: “It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.” (Source: &quot;American Dietetic Association, 2009, Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets&quot;)</p>

<p><strong>British Dietitians Association</strong>: “Well planned vegetarian [and strict-vegetarian] diets can be nutritious and healthy. They are associated with lower risks of heart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers and lower cholesterol levels. This could be because such diets are lower in saturated fat, contain fewer calories and more fibre and phytonutrients/phytochemicals (these can have protective properties) than non-vegetarian diets.” </p>

<p><strong>Dietitians of Canada</strong>: “A healthy vegan diet has many health benefits including lower rates of obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.” and “A healthy vegan diet can meet all your nutrient needs at any stage of life including when you are pregnant, breastfeeding or for older adults.</p>

<p><strong>John Hopkins School of Public Health</strong>: “A strong body of scientific evidence links excess meat consumption, particularly of red and processed meat, with heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, and earlier death. Diets high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans can help prevent these diseases and promote health in a variety of ways. […] The majority of the protein foods consumed in the U.S. are meat and animal products, which are often high in saturated fat and cholesterol, as opposed to the more nutrient-dense and health-promoting plant-based options (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, soy products, nuts and seeds).”</p>

<p><strong>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</strong>: “a very low meat intake was associated with a significant decrease in risk of death in 4 [of 6] studies,” and “Current prospective cohort data from adults in North America and Europe raise the possibility that a lifestyle pattern that includes a very low meat intake is associated with greater longevity.”</p>

<p><strong>Harvard Health Publications</strong>: “A meta-analysis of 29 studies of meat consumption and colon cancer concluded that a high consumption of red meat increases risk by 28&amp;#37;, and a high consumption of processed meat increases risk by 20&amp;#37;.” and “It appears ‘healthy meat consumption’ has become an oxymoron […] People in the study who ate the most red meat tended to die younger, and to die more often from cardiovascular disease and cancer. […] even when the researchers compensated for the effects of unhealthy lifestyle, mortality and meat remained associated.”</p>

<p><strong>Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine</strong>: “Two themes consistently emerge from studies of cancer from many sites: vegetables and fruits help to reduce risk, while meat, animal products, and other fatty foods are frequently found to increase risk. […] Not surprisingly, vegetarians are at the lowest risk for cancer and have a significantly reduced risk compared to meat-eaters.”</p>

<p>I personally believe them and have transitioned to a plant based diet in the last year. I also believe that there is the potential for a lot of money to be lost by the &#39;meat industry&#39; and they are aggressively pushing an anti plant based, or anti vegan, message in response to the threat that a widely adopted plant based diet would pose to their bottom line. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear what people in this subreddit think about plant based diets/veganism and even potential collusion between the animal agriculture industry, health industry and western governments to suppress information about the food we eat and keep us consuming unhealthy products. </p>

<p>In a new paper in The Quarterly Review of Biology, Thomas and colleagues argue that the brain suddenly began evolving faster because our ancestors discovered an even better brain food. &quot;At that point, we develop the use of fire and start consuming more carbohydrate-rich foods,&quot; Thomas says. &quot;[That] was critical to the expansion of the brain.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its a weak correlation at best. That reference article states this itself, by the end.  If not for meat, there would be no fire to cook those starches. Meat was consumed as raw tartare for nearly a million years before fire. And by the time we began cooking, the cranial design we enjoy today was set in stone. give credit where credit’s due. You’re able to ruminate and “articulate” your arguments for a very simple reason: your ancestors ate a ton of fresh, bloody meat and animal fat. Just be glad they didn’t share those plant-centric dietary theories, or else you’d be ruminating on actual grass, twigs, and sticks instead of enjoying culture, language, music, and the other accomplishments of mankind’s big ass brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DI THE EXACT OPPOSITE DIET THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND MAIN STREAM MEDIA TELL YOU TO FOLLOW. Remember government and big business base every decision made on money and power and not health. Ever!!!! If they tell you to use corn oil and high fructose corn syrup you can be assured that came from payoffs from the lobbyists for the corn industry. Stay away from coconut oil and sugar they tell you, hmmm why? Maybe because we don’t grow coconuts here. Don’t eat a lot of meat for sure but if you do eat meat for vitamin B12 then eat grass grazing chemical free no hormone or antibiotic free meat. Buy from a local butcher or farmer. They tell you it’s too expensive, well the number one reason for bankruptcy in the USA is health cost so you can pay a bit now or a hell of a lot later. 
Also we have been on a margarine vegetable oil  based diet for over 50 years and heart attack and stroke rates never declined and keep rising. Maybe butter wasn’t the problem. Who has the better lobbyists?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been on a plant based diet for almost 10 years, it is one of the best choices I have ever made. Meat is unhealthy, in every metric of biological evolution you are an herbivore and should treat your body as such. If humans evolved to be carnivorous then I would advocate that, but we are closer to herbivores or lacto-ovo vegetarians so adjust accordingly and your body and health will thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, definitely yes. </p>

<p>Have been vegan for 2 years + now and I love it. </p>

<p>However one should always listen to their body and make the transition and any diet changes based on what the their body and intuition combined tell them. Sometimes one may need to transition through a vegetarian diet for a while, then move on to veganism when ready. For some, an immediate jump to totally plant based is fine as well. Just listen to your body and intuition. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eating plants is murder too. They may even be more conscious then us. Also I love vegans that drive cars because you literally kill thousands of insects on a regular drive. Not to mention the animals and bugs that are killed harvesting vegetables. Life eats life. There is noway around it and when you realize it is wll just the same energy in diffetent forms it becomes much simpler to eat life to survive.</p>
