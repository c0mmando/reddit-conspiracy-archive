      <p>
       First off... I don't care what side of the aisle you identify with; red, blue, purple, rainbow...whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all, at the end of the day, one human species. A core feature of our humanity is our offspring and, as human beings, we should all labor to protect the weakest among us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the recent report of immigrant children being separated from parents, I have really started to become suspicious (moreso than before). Whereas this practice is not new*, it should be EXTREMELY alarming to consider the implications of what exactly is occuring.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not solely immigrant children that are going missing...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am exhausted, mentally and physically, due to nearly 8 hours of constant research so I cannot compile a complete list of all the things I've read, plus my computer and phone both seem to keep freezing up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       DynCorp a la Cerberus Capital, the PMSC of choice for this administration (Feinberg appointment as head of Intelligence Advisory) is and HAS BEEN the corporation hired to manage Child Protective Services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let this sink in...
      </p>
      <p>
       The private mercenary group who was caught in Bosnia prostituing children, the PMSC that brought you underage boys to dance for DynCorp employees, the people who were caught killing civilians un-impeded in Iraq... The organization who used labor slaves from war-ravaged areas is now the agency tasked with keeping track of thousands of undocumented children...
      </p>
      <p>
       They are awarded contracts in all branches of the military as well as the Dept of Health &amp; hospitals and the SSA...**
      </p>
      <p>
       What better way to make sure the populace at large is kept blinded of the fact that these children, as well as many other thousands in the CPS system, than to have unstoppaple access to all databases that could potentially track them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm aware that, following Bosnia, new ownership was found; however, this does not mean that those practices were condemned or even punished...at all. And they apparently still seem to have an issue with high-level execs continuing to perpetuate pedophilia...
      </p>
      <p>
       "No DynCorp employee has ever been criminally prosecuted for any of these crimes.Â While most recently in April of 2017 the Vice President of Business Development for DynCorp, James Grazioplene, was arrested for molesting children in the 1980s, this was during his term as an officer in the United States Army."***
      </p>
      <p>
       Now... Let's add to this fact that Trump had to choose between DeVos' brother,  Eric Prince (Blackwater/Academi/the list goes on...) And Feinberg (Cerberus Capital/DynCorp/Computer Sciences Corporation)... He chose the guy with a company that is well-versed in human trafficking instead of Blackwater, who just harvested organs and made millions off of Afghani heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my point is... We have hundreds of thousands of immigrant kids, separated from their families, by an agency that had NO OBLIGATION to tell family members where they are, run by an organization of mercenaries that specialize in child rape, under a president who so publicly decried child sex trafficking that he hired the leader of a well-known, corrupt contractor and signed an executive order that has NO SPECIFIC POLICY on trafficking via PMSC's....
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that's not enough to satiate your need for proof.... Trafficking has increased under this administration.  ****
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;dr - The elites of America are literally kidnapping children and are most probably selling them into sex slavery.

       I am a mother and have been a mother to all kids since i was young &amp; I've always felt the need to stand up for children so this issue is hitting home for me. My heart aches and I'm just aghast at the things that I'm putting together...
      </p>

       The worst part is that this info is all available to anyone with access to the internet....and yet no one has the brains, balls, or chesticles to ask "why"...

      <p>
       I'm not going to stop till I have done everything that i can to make public the fact that PMSC's are literally being used to supply slaves globally...

       I have been following the UN/Child Rape in Africa and Haiti. I find it so interesting that the formula is so predictable:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Peacekeepers" get busted raping kids and then DynCorp gets hired... the same day... And then suddenly no one is talking about it; no stats or follow-ups on these poor kids...just...gone. 
Then another, equally blatant PMSC with the blatant organ harvesting in Haiti, TOO?...

       In my research (exhausting and depressing lengthy research that is) I pretty much figured out that the number that kids are being used by traffickers and the trickling down of their clients were literally LIKE SOMEONE USING CIGARETTES. No seriously...they use them as disposable as smoking too because they know the worst case scenario end game is organ harvesting so why not abuse them for their own deviant sexual needs and occult ceremonies before they are killed. It will leave one gobsmacked if they have a heart.

       Look into Laura Silsby and the sex trafficking of children in Haiti. Backed by Hillary Clinton. There is a HUGE investigation into child sex trafficking shaping up right now. It's global. Huma Abedin and John Podesta have both been under sealed indictments since November 2017. Unfortunately, before the massive number of culprits involved can be tried, the judiciary has to be cleared of judges they own. In the meantime, Trump has made child sex trafficking a national security issue. Those involved WILL be going through military tribunals and on to Gitmo.

       This stuff has been going on for quite a while but nowhere in Trump's legislation does he state any restrictions for private military corporations as they relate to trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for everyone involved getting locked into a dark cell forever, but as Trump raged so hard against HRC and the DynCorp thing was indeed nefarious, I just want to see him address this issue head on.

       The stage is being set. They've been working on this nonstop - preparing. How do you remove 90% of the politicians, both parties? How do you remove the elite? The corrupt judges? The corrupt criminal CEOs of major corporations? People who actually own judges and routinely use hitmen? How do you do this without shaking society to the ground? Very carefully.

       Personally, I always get suspicious when anyone goes out of their way to declaim another (opponent/spouse/family member). I get especially curious when they start to repeat it...like almost in a verbal programming pattern.

      <p>
       The pattern with Hillary was definitely deflection, IMHO. That is not to say I believe she is innocent. 
The fact is that these mercenary groups and alphabet agencies very often force children into sex with powerful global politicians leaders. They record it and then use the footage as blackmail...

      <p>
       So maybe she did, maybe she didn't. I still haven't tried to go into that direction yet...

       Regardless... We all need to realize that this game has been staged directly beneath us for years.

       Ever hear of REX84?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Rex 84, short forÂ Readiness Exercise 1984, was aÂ classifiedÂ scenario and drill developed by theÂ United StatesÂ federal government to detain large numbers of United States citizens deemed to be "national securityÂ threats", in the event that the President declared a "State of National Emergency". The plan was first revealed in detail in a major daily newspaper by reporter Alfonso Chardy in the July 5, 1987 edition of theÂ Miami Herald. Possible reasons for such a roundup were reported to be widespread opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad, such as if the United States were to directly invadeÂ Central America.[1][2][3]To combat what the government perceived as "subversive activities", the plan also authorized the military to direct ordered movements of civilian populations at state and regional levels, according to Professor Diana Reynolds.

       It is true:the obama administration did it, bush did it. It's all literally to justify the war's we've been in. But I feel like it's not necessarily the president-could be, tho. Then again, in the event of a State of National Emergency everything's pushed over to FEMA..which is...suprise again, run by contractors almost exclusively.

       bill cooper and others suggest that through myriad executive orders and complex legislation spread out over 30 years, since 1980 basically, the military and wealthy have just decided that our constitution and civilian government is tooooo annoying and as such can't be counted on to function in the event of a real emergency or fake emergency.

       Links to Q - these posts began last year.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/nKH_hEiuw10">
        Here's a couple of videos to sum this up.

       These were done by a guy nicknamed the Praying Medic. They're good videos. Very concise. Here's his

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbFkAZBtQzA">
        this one
       </a>
       contains a bit of a summary of all KINDS of things revealed by Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q is sometimes signed as a group, sometimes as one person, on rare occasions as POTUS. People following Q pretty much know what's going on behind the scenes as well as what is going to happen next. Nothing on the news is true, and propaganda has now covered to Internet. Reddit has become a complete trashcan of misinformation with very few exceptions. r/greatawakening has a Q collection.
      </p>
      <p>
       The raw data is on 8chan in 3 different places. Here's
       <a href="https://qanon.pub/">
        just the Q posts
       </a>
       with no analysis by the "anons".
      </p>
      <p>
       And here is Q on 8chan with the anons digging through it all.

       Oh, DynCorp, that's right, rings a fucking bell. Yea, CPS is feared where I live, and for good reasons. They're the societal equivalent of the state coming to take your kids away and if you don't do what they say they'll just override your authority in a corrupt court system. that was what was behind my mom's entire complex that put me on (forced)medication therapies at a pre-teen age;Because they told her that if she didn't they would take me away. And they probably would have.

       You don't have any real rights under CPS accusation.  Children need to  be protected from abuse, but having the state jump in to overrule parents whenever it wants is not healthy. No accountability.

       About 13 years ago Dyncorp split into two divisions. Federal contracts and overseas support. I was working for Dyncorp at the time and CSC bought out the federal supports contract. Thankfully all the awful crap happened in the DynCorp overseas stuff, not local.

       Oh, DynCorp did end up going back to domestic federal support later to compete in the same space.  Interestingly, CSC federal support division got bought out by PAE about 8 years ago.

       I did not now that dyncorp was the one handling the 1500 missing kids, that's troubling

       don't forget the columbia scandal, they had underage girls there too.

       Yeah... He's just as guilty as the rest. 
I firmly believe that the reason he's so keen on Russia is because there's a video out there of him doing something heinous with an underage victim.

       Look into what Mueller has. Think Cohen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anthony Weiner's "insurance laptop", which had backup files of Hillary and Huma and other even more damning material connected to pedophilia - was deliberately left in Cohen's office prior to the raid so that everything on it would become admitted evidence. Things are happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two NYPD detectives saw what was on that laptop and were later both shot dead. The Obama DOJ threatened and pressurized the NYPD to not go after Hillary and Huma, and one of their judges sealed the laptop so no one could see it though the NYPD still had possession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump just UNSEALED it. Justice is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the detectives was named Familia. Trump made a large point of promising her family justice. After all these decades of Satanists in high places getting away with murder, we are finally going to see it stopped. This child sex trafficking and the Satanic ritual abuse of children these evil people have been involved in is coming to an end.

       You're gonna need to dig into Q. There is SO MUCH going on right now, and at the heart of everything Trump and the generals are doing is the WORLDWIDE takedown of child sex traffickers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing you see on the news is true anymore. The same folks that are doing the trafficking OWN the networks. Literally. That's why they are bashing so hard on Trump. He is hitting them in the worst place he can - the abuse and murder of children they buy and sell.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the upper echelons they are ALL Satanists, and the things they do to kids can't even be talked about without trauma.
