      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Whist for men firearms are by far the most popular, followed by suffocation/hanging and poisoning, women have poisoning as their most popular method, followed by firearms then suffocation/hanging. Given firearms are the most reliable method, and drug poisoning one of the least successful, that may account for some of the difference in actual suicide rates between the sexes.

       Someone making a note of a person that looked like he hung himself, but then examination shows it was murder.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My preliminary observations indicated that the “Suicide” was actually a homicide and that someone had effectively staged the scene to make it appear to be a suicide.  I saw a piece of vegetation caught in the man’s hair that did not come from the location.  I also noticed dirt on his pants, which later analysis revealed that it did not come from the area.  The man had been strangled to death at another outdoor location and then transported to the construction site where he was “strung-up” with the electrical cord to make it appear to be a suicide.  The initial responding officers as well as the ambulance crew at the scene were ready to declare the death a suicide and were preparing to transport the body to the morgue.

       it seems like hanging is the easiest to fake.  maybe they knock them out with something first, then set them up in the sling.

       Simple choke-hold will do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone combat trained can do that. Amateurs obviously they'll leave more evidence of struggle.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Distinction between murder and suicide may be impossible by an examination of the body alone. Detailed investigation of the scene, reconstruction of the position of the suspended body, examination of the rope, the knots, the direction of the fibres on the rope may serve to discover homicidal hanging. - Compared to suicidal hanging homicide has a frequency of about 1% in our autopsy material. However, we cannot estimate the number of obscure cases.

       Yeah, it will but if they fight back they could find DNA evidence underneath fingernails, they could maybe fuck something up enough to cause signs of a struggle, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just kind of playing devil's advocate because it's not fool proof. You can look at Kurt Cousin's death and see how easy it is to fuck up a gunshot staged as a suicide.

       Do they run toxicology reports on apparent suicides? Is there a chance they're sedating them beforehand?

       A big man who is trained to kill in this manner would leave absolutely no trace of his work.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fast and savage choke hold from behind from a man with arms like iron wearing a padded non abrasive sleeve would easily render someone unconscious in a matter of a few seconds.  When a trained killer goes up against a person who is not the fight is over before it begins, its not like a movie with trashing and crashing through walls.

       If you watch Clooney's "Michael Collins" you can see something similar: stun gun and then an injection in the foot of heart stopping meds. Also "Snatch"- stun gun then a plastic bag on the head, followed by feeding the victim to the pigs.
      </p>
      <p>
       With hanging it's 10 secs till you're unconscious and then 40 secs till your brain stops working (blood choke). Bourdain would know this from BJJ. Doesn't mean it wasn't a set-up, tho.

       Actually if I were murdered and it was made to look like a suicide, I would want someone to investigate. That pharma couple's family did and they were able to get some justice with the case being turned into a double homicide.

       My sister worked for a place that provides rehab and housing for people with traumatic brain injuries.  She said the two groups that really stood out were ex-bikers who crashed with helmet and failed gunshot suicides that wound up as partial lobotomies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would suck to hate life so much you tried to kill yourself, but ended up trapped in a worse life, permanently handicapped by your suicide attempt.  I'd guess you'd "hope" the brain damage would be significant enough that you wouldn't have awareness.

       It's totally not hard to see how gun suicides go wrong.  Put the gun to your temple, jerk the trigger, inadvertently move the barrel to the frontal bone or temporal line and if you're using a low-powered cartridge you wind up with just brain damage, not death.  You've just tried to shoot through a very dense segment of skull at the worst possible geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have little understanding of firearm exterior ballistics, how to shoot a gun, etc, so they will just believe the TV version, any gun, shot at any part of the head, is instant death.  Doesn't matter if its grandpa's .22 short revolver that can't kill a squirrel at 15 yards.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they had any knowledge, they would
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       stick it in their mouth at an upward angle and shred their brain and/or knock out the hypothalamus, as well as using a gun with real power, like a shotgun or large-caliber pistol.

       I get most downvotes in two subs,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       and my local city sub.  I get the latter, I like to argue with the hard-core leftists who want abundant, low-cost apartments in high demand neighborhoods.  Here, I don't get it -- I think this sub attracts a lot of angry people who like to downvote anything that doesn't brigade their agenda, but I keep coming back for the small bright spots.

       honestly hanging is a horrible way to go, and with the drugs these people have access to it would be much simpler for them to just take a couple pills or go out on a wicked heroin spike. just seems like a weird way for them to chose to off themselves honestly.

       Maybe a combo platter?  10 mg of Xanax or Ativan, 10 mg of oxy, stand on something with your "rope" around your neck.  When you pass out due to the drugs, you wind up hanging yourself and too knocked out due to the drugs to react to it.

       While you can die from opiate overdoses, it's often not pretty on the way there for people who aren't already addicted high doses and basically surfing the threshold of overdose.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, I was just thinking of ways to achieve substantial sedation.   Inspired by the therapy my mom was on when she was stage 5 with metastasized breast cancer -- a combination of ativan and opioids.  I know it left her nearly catatonic.
