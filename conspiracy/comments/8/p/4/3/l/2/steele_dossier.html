    <div class="md"><p>Yes it was a huge Conspiracy by the Clinton campaign and Obama administration to use state assets and even foreign intelligence alliances to attempt to guide the public&#39;s hand in electing Hillary because &quot;it was her turn&quot;.</p>

<p>Thank fucking god Hillary had too many skeletons in her closet to succeed.  It&#39;s pretty glaring when you have all the unelected, unaccountable assets of the 5 eyes alliance (7th floor) group working to subvert the most powerful democracy in the world and you fall flat on your face, get chucked into a van like a side of meat and then go on a world tour explaining how you lost because of your data team, racism, sexism, Russians, Israelis, Pakistanis, David Duke, Winton Churchill and bad advice from the ghost of Elenore Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Also, just saying, the Dossier leaked <em>post</em> election (2018, not 2017), so I have no idea where you think it&#39;d influence the elections.</p>

<p>Sounds like PizzaGate / Russia conspiracy projection. Around that time, that whole conspiracy seems to have came to light.</p>

<p>That fact he existed is undemocratic and a sane population would be demanding the complete dissolution of the agencies involved and a total restructuring of our rogue intelligence agencies.

    <div class="md"><p>Just the opposite for me. At first I was skeptical and thought that it might be legit, but with time and as things have played out, I have become more and more sure that it was manufactured. There might be some already known info in there to give it the appearance of legitimacy, but that is about it from my perspective.</p>

<p>Also, I think if one thing in there is bullshit it sort of poisons the legitimacy of the whole document for me, and makes it way less likely to be genuine. And the pissing on the bed thing seems like bad fan fiction and I think something more would have come out had that been real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh no offense to you, just my take is that it was manufactured. You pay an ex-MI6 guy to get some &quot;dirt&quot; on someone you are running against and then you can spy on them to get compromising information. Sure, the &quot;dirt&quot; is going to look juicy, but in the end it will just be bullshit.

<p>But how do you explain the actual connections? Is it just a bunch of #fakenews? I mean, it&#39;s reputable sites publishing this information. It&#39;s backed up back actual record. Like this isn&#39;t some deep hidden thing that the government&#39;s trying to suppress, <em>except it seems like they are for some reason</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.</p>

<p>The Steel Dossier was probably written sometime in mid-2015 (I&#39;m guessing, maybe sooner). <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight/how-russia-sold-its-oil-jewel-without-saying-who-bought-it-idUSKBN1582OH">The Rosenloft deal was announced mid-2016.</a>.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/michael-cohen-qatar-trump-administration-access-1-million-2018-5">Cohen</a>plays in; as he middle-mans the deal between the broker and Qatar. Now all that the broker has to do is middle-man a trade between nations. GlenCore fell away as a <em>private</em> investor and  China stepped up the plate (which was probably the plan all along). Interestingly enough, the deal fell through on the Chinese, due to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2018/05/07/six-months-after-privatization-sale-russias-rosneft-loses-two-big-buyers/#47bfe5ff64b7">the private company&#39;s management team is being investigated for white collar crimes</a>.</p>

<p>Now Qatar&#39;s stuck with the bill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just the list. But if you want to read the actual Steele Dossier, go for it. It should be <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>But who trusts random words written on paper as &quot;truth&quot;. That&#39;d be silly if there wasn&#39;t additional evidence. It&#39;s actually pretty fun to follow a few of the strings they put there.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching this since before the Rosenloft deal was announced. I was entirely skeptcical it was going to happen (as I Google&#39;d around). When I later read the news of the oil deal (which wasn&#39;t even in the front page of reddit), I was entirely shocked. It&#39;s actually fun keeping tabs on it. There&#39;s so many obvious links, I feel as though it&#39;s crazy for not more people to be watching it.</p>
