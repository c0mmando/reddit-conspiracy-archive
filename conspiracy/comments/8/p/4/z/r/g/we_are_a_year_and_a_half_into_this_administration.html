<p>We aren&#39;t talking about illegal wars, Google AI helping the pentagon develop death robots, intelligence apparatus out of control, government trafficking narcotics, illegal surveillance, torture... the list of things to discuss is endless and literally Trump&#39;s opponents have lost all focus and instead of talking about issues, they are doing exactly what people always criticize - discussing the person, the man, the transient component in this system. The component that in 4-8 years won&#39;t be there anymore, but all the shit he engaged in will be left behind, sticking around while the new guy adds to the list. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah but its important because&quot; fuck off. Just fuck off. This country is so far beyond anything resembling what its sold as and while you are neck deep in the asshole of distractions they&#39;ve given you... the SAME. OLD. SHIT. CONTINUES.</p>

<p>Stop acting like Trump is something new. He isn&#39;t. There are plenty more vacuous, empty shells ready to step up and fill that position. A position that consists of someone willing to do what they are told, pass unpopular policy, take the blame and move on in 4-8 years.</p>

<p>Start talking about the fucking issues. WE TORTURE PEOPLE AND ASSASSINATE PEOPLE WITH FUCKING ROBOTS IN THE SKY USING PHONE RECORDS FOR TARGET ACQUISITION. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a difference between asking you to backup your claims/facts with rationale and asking for your opinion.</p>

<p>You note vague claims that have been derived from clickbait headines and soundbites tbh. Just from your first item alone show your lack of information: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Him cutting regulations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which regulations, specifically and why are they bad? Did you not even research about how he has allowed terminal patients to try the most modern/experimental medicine? <em>Right to Try</em> is revolutionary and cuts regulation of accessing medicine previously held captive by bureaucracy. That&#39;s an example of cutting regulations that is good.</p>

<p>For shits and giggles, and educational/awareness for the passive reader I&#39;ll challenge each point:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>cutting spending for mental health care</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He literally hasn&#39;t done this. What you are reading is speculation on proposed budgets, but it relates to healthcare in general. He been one of the few to address mental illness as a main factor in the gun shootings, rather than the need for gun control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>trying to repeal Obama care and not replace it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obamacare is a mess at the core. It is strategic for Trump to let it die rather than take it on. If he revamps it, people will riot about &quot;Trumpcare&quot; not working, when it is a problem inherited from Obama. Moreover, there have been proposed solutions already for healthcare reform.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>trying to ban Transgender people from the military</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am mixed on this. From a financial perspective, it makes sense that the government SHOULD NOT subsidize hormone therapy, vaginaplasties, boob jobs etc for soldiers (otherwise you&#39;ll have &quot;normal&quot; folks wanting cosmetic benefits too!). From a citizen&#39;s perspective, I see the need for the army to treat everyone equally in terms of allowing to participate in the army.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>getting rid of protections for those that are LGBT</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL blatantly false. Trump is from New York and has stated that he doesnt care about gays (or race) for that matter. What LGBT protections has he rolled back, specifically?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>saying that he prefers soldiers &quot;that don&#39;t get caught&quot; when referring to McCain</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see why anyone supports McCain lol Trump saying that to McCain is fair game-- if you remember McCain was against Trump during the primaries and general. If McCain cant catch the shade, then he shouldnt be throwing it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>increased military spending when it&#39;s already the biggest in the world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you even read where the military spend was going? (on paper anyway---looking at you shadow projects)
Part of the increase in budget was for better wages (GOOD!).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>suggesting unconstitutional acts like throwing flag burners in jail for a year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh so <em>now</em> the constitutional rights apply? But let me guess, if a private business does not want to bake a cake for gays on religious freedom then they don&#39;t have a right to exercise their rights?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the wall, etc, etc</p>

<p>The wall will be yuuge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I used &quot;yuuge&quot; as a litmus test/trigger for Trump Derangement Syndrome, and you are positive. Moreover, it&#39;s hilarious how you want to focus on my two statements yet <em>still</em> present <strong>no facts</strong> against me. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s break down my previous statements into one you can understand: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>suggesting unconstitutional acts like throwing flag burners in jail for a year</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You still didn&#39;t answer my question, rather attacked my question: Oh so now the constitutional rights apply? But let me guess, if a private business does not want to bake a cake for gays on religious freedom then they don&#39;t have a right to exercise their rights? ---why dont you answer the question? BEcause you dont want to seem hypocriticial? 
Trump is entitled to his opinion, too. Any consequences he suggests would not mean he is going to influence new legislation. Anyone with basic understanding of laws knows that Trump isnt an emperor and the due process would quickly shoot down any unconstitutional bills. You can disagree with Trump on some views, just like I&#39;m sure your mom doesnt share the same exact views as you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the wall, etc, etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The wall is a HUGE deal, really. As historical as the North Korea/South Korea summit! What people dont understand is that it is NOT sustainable to have immigrants come over! I dont see why you WANT open borders! Think about MS13, the cartels, human trafficking, etc. With the good comes the bad. 
The wall will serve to to SLOW DOWN immigration and other traffic. Is it the perfect solution? NO. Immigration/illegal crossing is a tough problem to solve. </p>

<p>Some things to note: 
- Immigrants are the shadow labor that fuels the American labor and capitalism. They get shit pay, no real benefits, and no long-term security, in exchange for corporations hitting huge profits. It&#39;s a shame that you support the abuse of immigrants to continue. </p>

<ul>
<li>The money is so good that Europe wants a piece too! With declining birthrates, they need the refugees to come and work shit jobs and get abused. (Though it is worse since you have Muslims wanting Sharia law) </li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Last response because you&#39;re still not getting the point, and I understand you really wanna seem right here but it&#39;s not <em>relevant</em> </p>

<p>I gave  reasons why people dislike Trump that weren&#39;t due to his pussy tape scandal. You&#39;re defending those reasons based on your political views. Oh well we need the wall it&#39;s the only solution, oh he banned transgender people from the military for financial reasons, oh but baking cakes!!! Again, that doesn&#39;t matter, people disagree with Trump on these issues. They have values and their own stances, like for example protecting the rights of sexual minorities like the LGBT community, so when they see actions taken by Trump that are against those values, then they will of course dislike the man</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same thing with Christian evangelicals disliking any liberal political for their stances on abortion. I&#39;m not gonna make a rant how their hatred isn&#39;t justified because abortion is actually moral and we should give women the choice because you know what! They&#39;re still going to dislike them! Because they go against their core beliefs! I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s hard to understand!</p>

<p>And keep trying to ping another user, that&#39;s totally normal and not odd behavior </p>

<p>People hate Trump for (a) things that don&#39;t matter and (b) things that aren&#39;t true.  Also that he&#39;s a womanizer and plays fast and loose with money, but frankly if you didn&#39;t hate Donald Trump in 2014 you have no business casting shade on him now </p>

<p>I like that he doesn&#39;t focus on climate change. As of late, it&#39;s become more of a political bargaining chip rather than REAL issue. China is the biggest offender and they arent going to stop supplying cheap shit and fucking up the environment anytime soon. No matter what the US does or the individuals in America do, the net effect is the same. Moreover, if the world is heading down naturally, then there isnt ANYTHING we can do, so why bother putting focus on it? the only solution would be to populate Mars---let&#39;s focus our energy there (no pun intended). </p>

<p>Ok no one is claiming that he didnt?Go reread my post. The decision is not because he personally hates Trans people, its about financials. PERIOD.</p>

<p>And what solution do you have? Keeping the borders open will cost us MORE money! Not just welfare, but think about the investment in surveillance, criminal investigations, ICE raids, etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, lets suppose you understand the difference of identity politics and greater world order vision. Trump represent and idea. His campaign promises represnt an ideal. </p>

<p>When ussr collapsed russia closed itself off from the world and rebuilt itself. Now it is ready to open itself up, and it has, olympics, f1 races, football world cup, tourism, international news and politics as well as opena pposition to US. </p>

<p>Now, US is the one with the problems, but luckily world order learnt from the ussr ussues what it means for a world superpower to try and compete with another at the cost of the people. US is a big boy, complex boy. Letting the population suffer through inequality and other problems in order to justify competing with another power, in case other powers is bad. It could lead to collapse of social cohesieveness leading to civil war. US has guns so the civil war would be pretty fucking bad. </p>

<p>So trumps promises on racism and wall building and brinign jobs back home. Are actual promises his preidency is bringing to US. Through racism and wall building US is setting itself up to close itself to the world, to stop immigration as it has enough population. Through trade wars and tarrifs promote internal growth of induatries, production and learn to live sustainable at the expence of its own internal supply(like russia has done since ussr collapse. People like to make fun for russian gdp, etc but its internal economic market has developed enough to sustain its country, be it smaller and is giving rising living conditions to its people with huge promises to end poverty, as its already halved it, like china in very short time) usa on the hand is seeing reverse trend jn rising inequality. </p>

<p>Furthermore Trumps very being a president is creating exposure in money in politics corruption, although its externalising the probelm by blaming russia at least the population is waking up to real internal problems. </p>

<p>So in reality, everything is as it is according to plan. Its just imagine if the people were outright told US is closing its borders to reimagine capitalism and free market ideals, away from shifting world order of UN and WTO etc as eurasia is all interlinking and through China creating a unified trade route across entire continent?  How do you think they would react being told they arent the idea the wolrd is looking to promote any longer? Yeah, exactly, it would be bad. So i think US will close itself off like russia did, (well as much as it can in the current state of globalised world). Go from the front of the usa 1st, to 2nd tier nation as world focuses on eurasia as new ideal. Rebuild its democracy, rebuild its population and work force for the world of tomorow with automation and socialist ideals that work well with their capitalistic free market ideals or shifting ideals idk yet. And when the world has transitioned into the future with automation and new world order, US will once again open itself up, snowing the world how its way is better than EU, or russian or chineese way(becuase their way is more gov in marketplace vs US marketplace without a gov).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia undermined our election to try and get Trump elected, that&#39;s a huge deal, and something that has to be stopped next time we have an election. What we dont know for sure is if the Trump campaign knew about it and colluded with them. It looks less and less likely every day, but it&#39;s possible that he had nothing to do with them influencing election, that they did it their own just because they wanted him president. </p>

<p>The Mueller investigation is really only about looking into Russia&#39;s interference. Any normal president would support that investigation. The biggest red flag is how much open resistance Trump and the GOP are giving the investigation. If they were innocent, or if Russia was trying to help the democrats, don&#39;t you think they would want it looked into?</p>

<p>Politically all Trump had to do was ignore the investigation. The story would have died down if Trump wouldn&#39;t have fired Comey and bitched about it being a witch hunt for the last 2 years. </p>

<p>Hell if it wasn&#39;t for the daily scandals surrounding the president he&#39;d probably be doing fine in the polls right now. The negative ramifications of his asinine trade war, spiking oil prices after ending the Iran deal, and tax cuts aren&#39;t going to damage us for while.  </p>

<p>His only hope for reelection is thst the Mueller investigation doesn&#39;t find a smoking gun trying him to Russia undermining the election forcing the congress to impeach him, or that the democrats put up another horribly unlikable canidate like Hillary again. That or the Russians interfere again and change the results to an insurmountable level.</p>

<p>The second is for Cohen, the special Master as gone through everything seized from the office apartment and safety deposit box.  Cohen&#39;s lawyers have to turn over anything they aren&#39;t going to challenge is private or personal.  Stormys lawyer we&#39;ll be there a believe to say Cohen was working with stormies old lawyer Keith Davidson.</p>

<p>Turns out Davidson is connected to several of the more famous sex tape extortions of our time.  Hilton, tequila, Hogan. Possibly the Kayne.  He also was the lawyer for 2 other women one a playmate that have NDAs with Trump.  So I big Hollywood sex the scandal should eat up a lot of the news media.</p>

<p>The iag report is due on Hillary&#39;s email investigation.  Senators bill and Warner are having a meeting to get a special intelligence briefing very soon that could be related to that.  Last time something like this happened was when the Mueller investigation got started so we could have more Hillary email. Or a new investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man thats a trip considering that Bilderberger Peter Thiel funded the lawsuit against gawker for the Hogan sex tape.  Obviously these guys were getting a bit too juicy with the sex stuff and needed to be taken out.</p>

<p>Personally I just stay right the hell out of provocative organizations and sex as I have enough of that going on with my self-generated ideas alone for all of that mess.  I&#39;m pretty much a nobody but I was living in L&#39;viv, Ukraine 1-3 years before the war and during the war.  Looking back shit was spooky as hell and I dodged out of meeting described ultra important people because it seemed odd and clumsy like I was being baited for something.  I said to myself that my life is pretty good and these people won&#39;t help me and I don&#39;t need any of their nonsense and if they really are big scary people then they are in the business of exploiting others and if they are nobodies then I don&#39;t need the jive talk.  Well a woman I knew well enough told me that after I introduced her to this guy who was trying to get me to meet people that she lost track of several days and essentially woke up in a convent sort of place with a really weird head.  I&#39;m thinking some kind of scopolamine-like substance.  Additionally, two guys in L&#39;viv were adamantly telling me two years before the war that there was going to be a war.  I laughed them off and they repeatedly insisted and we continued to drink.</p>

<p>Looking back, well sure.  That is just my experience being in an environment where things were going on intellectually far beyond what I could perceive but I managed to slip through it unharmed because I avoided some situations that gave me very bad feelings.  For myself I know for a fact that there are scenes that are just utterly saturated with state, mafia and spooky next-level Khazarian level mafia and they aren&#39;t just going to come out and tell you as such.  I fell right in the middle of that just by chance because that is where the cheap drinks and pretty women were.  Its really pretty insane compared to the sterility of the suburb.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin mentions off hand that he keep regular contact with trump, in regards to foreign relations. (As you would assume seeing as two countries are in sanctions war, syrian and iranian and NK conflict) but the news on reddit and in general are blowing up how thats proof trump is russian puppet. </p>

<p>Personally I think trump is an image of everything that is wrong with american politics, and its at the very minimum has ushered in for the people to start participating in democracy and politics. But the negative is that the whole is fueled by hate of last century relating to a communist red scare, and is purpetuated like so. Because admitting there is something very wrong internally would be admitting how corporate and the rich class have influence over the whole system, and that kind of leveraged power on democracy cant be taken away from them, they will fight for it. Remember the 1% movement? How it started so strong, and then on a whimper replaced with tons of class deviding social issues in order to distract the population. Atheism, lgbq, black lives matter, womens rights, lists go on i am sure. But basically the core sociatal democratic issues are not those, its how the corporate elite through monwy in politics influence the system. </p>

<p>So this power has to remain at all costs as US is a corporocracy, but clearly lack of people, wage earner, the 99% representation in the system has created massive problems. They are doing the whole democratic overhaul of the system backwards. Because at the top level the money polics will remain, the 1% will fight for it to the death. But at the local level induviduals are running for local gov etc sure. But that isnt going to change jack shit on the federal level. Core of the problem is still there, and the whole russia russia russia issue is being used to confuse and direct attention away from true internal discussion, by externalising the threat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it&#39;s not.  There&#39;s a whole laundry list of things that cast doubt on it&#39;s legitimacy.  Many things point to it being a partisan attack...</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there&#39;s actual documented cases of Israel interfering in our policies, and asserting it&#39;s influence through guys like Kushner.  They just moved the embassy in israel and recognized a previously shared area as Israels... that&#39;s kind of a big deal don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly something people should be talking about if they actually see &#39;collusion&#39; as an issue.  Or is it only bad if it&#39;s russia?  </p>

<p>Sure. And that&#39;s why it has been a huge topic in the media. </p>

<p>Ask the AG or the president. They are the ones appointing special prosecutors. </p>

<p>Did you even know that it was Rosenstein who appointed Mueller? </p>

<p>Who did <em>you</em> think kicked off the whole Russia investigation? Hillary?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure the embassy move has been in the media.  Because it&#39;s a very contreversial move.  They&#39;re not covering the israel collusion angle though are they? </p>

<p>Are any msm outlets talking about how kusher, a personal friend to netanyahu got Flynn to talk to russians to vote for israel? </p>

<p>They covered it.  But they covered it as &quot;flynn talks to russian&quot;  the important part is &quot;flynn talks to russians on orders from Kushner to aid israel, a foreign government Kushner holds loyalty to.&quot;</p>

<p>It really is one of the bigger russiagate fails.  If you don&#39;t cover it in the proper context, then obviously people like me will point out how ironic it is that there&#39;s actually &quot;collusion&quot; happening and it&#39;s not getting coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that a segway into suggesting a party line implies that it&#39;s not simply a democrat wet dream?</p>

<p>Once you have the known liar james clapper read off a fancily typed report on live tv and say things like &quot;with a certain degree of confidence, we believe russia did x,y, and z...&quot;  Most people either sign on or risk being categorized as a loon.  Because... that&#39;s what they do.</p>

<p>Once you start saying wait a minute, these people didnt&#39; even prove anything.  They  just say &quot; we think &quot; and have a record of lying.. you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist.  It&#39;s really weird.</p>

<p>I feel like they really flipped the script the last couple of years and now if you don&#39;t buy into a conspiracy theory you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist.</p>
