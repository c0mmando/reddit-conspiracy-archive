       We see a lot of conspiracies, news, issues, etc being pointed out, but we don't really see solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think are some solutions and changes that you think will help move us forward in a positive manner?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll start.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Home Schooling, VR Schools, YouTube/Online Courses, and Alternative Schooling that includes Critical Thinking courses will help change and help awaken the Global Population a Lot faster
      </p>
      <p>
       Meditation Courses in Schools and in Prisons which studies show crate many Improvements;

       I think balancing out the Population in some manner would be helpful. For example if you are broke, can't afford it, live in 3rd world country, etc, then you should be limited to the amount of Children you can have.

       I don't think so. For example, the more we go into Solar, Batery Tech, Electric vehicles, the closer we get to getting off the TIT of big Oil and the House of Saud. That's just one example.

       Crypto Currencies scare the banks, that's another example

       Crypto is way too volatile, as seen with Bitcoin -- and that's beside the point that all crypto is based on real world currencies. If markets crash, crypto isn't isolated from that.

       I wish I was a shill at this point man, but you gotta face the reality. You can make things better for yourself, but try to realise that in this day and age, there’s no way to get out of this system.

       How can you know that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can picture two (among many other) possibilities: 1) that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are powerful enough to prevent any emergence from the system, or 2) they are only powerful enough to make the majority believe they have the power to do 1).
      </p>
      <p>
       If something along the lines of 2) is the case, it would look very much like 1), and
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       would certainly want us to believe that 1) were the case.

       I'd say yes and no. The control grid is very real. If you (as a commoner) don't pay your tributes to the state, men with guns will take you to jail, or kill you if you resist. That is in no way a mirage.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a mirage is that such a state requires the very people it subjects to perpetuate it. The police officers and prison guards and low- and mid-level bureaucrats are, for the most part, subjugated by the very system they make possible. Those who profit most materially from our systems could not run it by themselves; they must persuade us, the people, to run it for them.

       I mean, I hate jumping on the defeatist train, but look around. People are largely stupid, and easy to control and manipulate. We still have millions who identify as republican or democrat, thinking that either party actually gives a shit about them. Most people are enslaved to the banks as soon as they turn 18, college, car, house, and many who can't afford a house are stuck working to pay rent on stagnant wages. We all know that only a revolution can set things back on track for a while, but is it even worth it? If so many people can be subjugated without a fight, are they worth trying to save? Maybe TPTB are the smart ones, controlling the masses for their own benefit. If you throw your morals out the window, they may appear to be the superior people.

       That’s exactly what I mean. Those who are unhappy with the system we live in should be aware enough that nothing we do can stop this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way would be to restart as a civilisation but that just won’t happen in our lifetimes. And those who think that things can change for the better are either delusional or in denial. Yeah, go ahead and eat dirt and use solar power and don’t vaccinate or whatever you do, but guess what? Majority don’t have the capacity to think outside of this system and are happy to be a cog. So go ahead, and try make your own life better; but don’t pretend there is a way out of it for all of us. And you know what? Not all of us will want a way out.

       Yeah, I'm with you there. I find it depressing, because I feel that humans have so much potential that gets squandered away for trivial reasons, but what can you do? Suicide or continue the game, maybe I've always chosen the wrong option.

       Require all public officials to wear live webcams 24/7 so their bosses, the public, can see who they go to lunch with, what they discuss with people on the golf course, what is discussed with thier rich benefactors at parties, etc. Those who tend to turn off the cameras often will lose public trust and will tend to not be reelected.

       How? This isn't as much a solution as it is a description solved system. Disregarding whether it's practical or would work, it means nothing if it can't be implemented. The only way to

       Most conspiracies are enacted by those in power in order to help remain in power.  Often they will resort to violence to maintain that power, but prefer to utilize the law and the weakness of human emotions (and ignorance) to trick people into validating their rights to those positions of power.  Deep are the games they play as they have done so for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, there is a straight forward game plan that the concerned human can employ:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Self education.  Learn history and law and some psychology and don't be one of the ignorant masses
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be active and participate in all forms of your government that actually enable the principles of democracy.  Don't let others vote away your rights and liberty
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be not quiet or nor easily silenced.  Learn to speak eloquently and present quality arguments that are based on logic and historical record, and not emotion and personal or cultural appeals.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be long of memory.  Do not forget those who transgressed against the common good and do not let them think they are forgiven.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Be independent and do not fall for basic tribalism and group think.  We have the capability or truly being an enlightened species but it is easy to fall in the comfortable pattern of picking a side and staying with it.  This is a key tactic of those in power that is being used to great effect in society today.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Also do not forget the most basic of all human patterns: the rule of might.  The people in power have not forgotten the basic powers of intimidation and violence, and often easily fall to those extremes.  This is why the common person must be enabled to defend themselves.

       And this is exactly why this account's comments are occasionally interesting, when it's a regurgitation of ideas that he accosts as his own, but once he actually types his own feelings and opinions (and I stress opinions because he has no actual evidence for his claims), his hypocrisy and intellectual dishonesty creeps in.

       This here is an exact example of the collective conditioning that he berates in a post he made earlier. It's like clockwork...he exhibits the exact behaviour that he criticizes and accuses others of.

       By no means do I have any feelings of vindictiveness or hatred towards you. In fact it's obvious we have some overlapping interests hence I see your comments. I'm just pointing out these inconsistencies and disingenuousness because you always ask people to be honest with themselves.

       Like I said, we actually happen to be interested in similar topics; you're certainly not worth stalking. And honestly it's nothing personal, it's a habit of mine to call out hypocrisy and illogical stuff, especially when I see it so repeatedly and consistently. Like you said, I'm attacking the message, which in this case comes from a specific messenger.

       I got into a welding Union when I was 19 and was already woke, but a bit too excited about sharing/dropping gems and the normie meat heads at work looked at me like I was fucking alien.

      <p>
       So then I started talking about sports, grilling, recipes, motorcycles, and hot actresses and literally everyone loved me after that I got promotions and became everyone's boss in my department within a year.

       I disagree completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the difference between a "normie" and a "woke" person?
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person is "woke" when they see a truth which had previously been hidden or suppressed by them, and they act on that truth. Even the normiest of the normies do this, only see different truths than you. A normie's just a seeker who hasn't been smacked with a hard enough truth yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't this true of you? Weren't you a normie once, naive and willfully ignorant to the truths of this world? Is there not a past you whom current you would want to smack for a way they were asleep?
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between a normie and a seeker is not a matter of intelligence. There are highly intelligent normies and, in terms of IQ, lower intelligence seekers. The difference is not a matter of age: there are normies and seekers of all ages. It's not a matter of race or gender or nationality or any other feature like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no feature that determines the difference because it is not binary; it is a spectrum. We all exist on a spectrum of what truths we're willing to question and which truths we're willing to dedicate ourselves towards. If you're honest with yourself, there are truth's you neither acknowledge nor act upon, even though you know you should.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normies aren't easy to manipulate;
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       are easy to manipulate. We're naturally drawn towards truths which make us feel better, and reject truths that make us feel worse. What makes a person "woke" is the degree to which they consciously strive to find and act upon those truths which are true, rather than those which merely please our emotions.

       "Normie" is relative. We can also go into "Zombie" which I liken to the people entirely identified with their own ego who are not self conscious and have not realized that they are consciousness. Someone like this hardly has any free will at all and is just basically a slave to the subconscious/unconscious programming that operates in their ego based on western society and bodily programming

       Sure of course that's true to a point. I dont have kids so I have no idea about the truths that have to do with having a kid, raising one, instilling good, raising right, etc. While I do want one one day, I think universally or even objectively, figuring out spiritual enlightenment is a higher and better journey for a seeker than having a kid and living "that" life.

       I'd argue normies are 10 times easier to manipulate. If I put you next to an average random joe, 9 times out of 10 you well question and critically think everything I tell you or try to convince you into, whereas the normie won't more time than he would. I've actually done examples of these kinds of exercises with my buddies and my coworkers at work, at the bars after work, etc. We make bets, trick others, play pranks, plant lies/gossip, and manipulate people and situations in various ways and we watch it take effect and work 9 times out of 10.

      <p>
       I think that's mostly what I'm trying to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever heard of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime">
        E-Prime
       </a>
       ? It's a form of English which doesn't use any form of the verb
       <em>
        to be
       </em>
       . So you can't say "Bob is a normie," you'd have to phrase it "Bob is acting like a normie now," or "Bob often deals with new information like a normie."
      </p>
      <p>
       While acting like a normie might be part of Bob's
       <em>
        behavior
       </em>
       , it's not a part of his
       <em>
        identity
       </em>
       , as saying he
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a normie would imply. If Bob stops acting like a normie today and starts acting like a seeker, then his behavior would change and my description of his behavior would change. But Bob is still Bob; his identity did not change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this is an important distinction because the language we use to describe our reality affect the way we perceive and act in the world. When we say Bob
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       a normie, we've already set up a situation in which we feel our identity, our ego, is superior to Bob's identity, and that will color the interaction. Yet if we only focus on Bob's behavior, how he's "acting like a normie" in this specific interaction, we can see Bob as a person worthy of dignity who happens (by our estimation) to be behaving like a manner
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's much easier to talk to people about behaviors than identities and egos. When a person feels their ego is under attack, they are naturally defensive. If instead, we focus on a specific behavior, particularly one which is not tied to the ego, most people are more amenable to exploring other possibilities.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I don't doubt that some people are gullible and easy to manipulate, and that these people likely tend to exhibit normie behavior more frequently, but I truly believe that everyone can become more introspective and honest with themselves. A normie is one who has tall walls built around their ego; a seeker is one who strives to remove those walls and see the truth more clearly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's what separates a normie from a seeker: what they do
       <em>
        in that moment
       </em>
       . The normie's behavior is to ignore it or rationalize it away; the seeker's behavior is to choose to confront that truth. We each come across that choice many time every day, and how we responds determines our commitment and dedication to living out our truths. We don't get to discover one truth and call ourselves "woke" (and nor should we believe others' truths just to appear "woke"). We must approach these truths with honesty and bravery in each and every moment if we want to continue waking up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find "woke" to be a less desirable term than "normie" in that someone who claims to be woke thinks they're done waking up. As a term of self-identification, it lacks the humility to be open to yet-undiscovered truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not woke; I am waking myself up.

       that's why the only option is to eliminate authority altogether.. or at least do it gradually.. every empire that forgot the virtue of limited government has fallen.. it's only natural to extend that virtue to no government.. we are obligated to at least try to make that possible!

       Unfortunately even someone working a minimum wage job without government aid could reproduce and create tons of stupid people. The hierarchy of our society has little to do with reinforcing natural selection. Successful people don't necessarily reproduce more. Maybe high violent crime rates could select for desirable traits, but I don't think so. Genetic modification is our best bet.

       It is the sad fact that it is easier to appeal to the masses with emotion as the easiest way to get people to listen is to tell them what they want to hear.  But we're talking about surviving and being more than one of the 'profane' because in large they do not change things or resist things.  My key point here is to deliver your message with the best and most unassailable points so that they are the most easily defended, because if you are speaking against others beliefs or the status quo in general you will be attacked.  It will also help to garner support from those that do not just take the popular or government supplied opinion on things.

        Also do not forget the most basic of all human patterns: the rule of might. The people in power have not forgotten the basic powers of intimidation and violence
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the only one I question. I think it is erroneous to assume that people with power are all Machiavellian tyrants that employ violence and intimidation wantonly. The rule of might, as you put it, is not the rule of thumb. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolute, sure. That doesn't mean that there are no powerful people in the world trying to make a positive difference. As you said before:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Be independent and do not fall for basic tribalism and group think.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Lobbying "the elite" together into a group and demonizing them is just as tribalistic. The rich versus the poor, and the weak versus the strong, is a very dangerous binary way of thinking that doesn't help our cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Define better that which we are fighting against. Evil. Corruption. Cheating. Rigging of systems in favor of particular people/groups/established power structures etc. Know thy enemy. You have to clearly define who it is we are fighting against. We are not fighting against "the elite" or "the rich". We are fighting against the corrupt. This is a battle between good and evil, no doubt, but that battle rages within each and every human on the planet, between different societies, between the people and elements of their governments, and factions within the "elite" class of global civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to fight this battle, the first step is to better oneself, to fight whole heartedly 100%, in every direction, to create the most good. Sacrifice for the next generation and raise good children. Sacrifice for the weak and speak truth to power. Sacrifice for the followers and be a good leader. Do everything you can, absolutely everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second step is to define your enemy. Don't try to solve all the world's problems at once-you can't. The world didn't get as fucked up as it is now in a single generation. Lasting change is accomplished slowly, and if you aren't working towards a goal that will outlive you, you aren't focused enough to actually change anything. This fight against evil, in identifying evil, in spreading awareness of evil, in targeting evil, and in defeating evil, begins with the individual development of self and articulation of that which is evil within oneself and outside of oneself. This is no easy task, but it is absolutely imperative and it requires extreme devotion to the cause. The Corbett Report, Those Conspiracy Guys, etc. they are helping. Of course they don't get everything right, nor do they provide complete narratives-you have to think for yourself, but at least these people work fulltime at this so you don't have to, so you can focus on refining your awareness of the enemy.

         Well yes, that's why i mentioned earlier that they prefer non violent mechanisms, something that history has taught the value of.    Violence should always be the last resort, or reserved for specific instances when precision can be used and the responsible parties obfuscated.

         Yes, you are right.  I treat them in this post as a single thing and they are not.  They are an amorphous bunch with competing ideologies and methods, but are all united in the need to remain powerful and pass that power down to only those that share their beliefs and motivations.  I can go on about defining what evil is and lay out a battle plan, so to say, but this post was more about an inward look at oneself, which is the first step in any meaningful progression.

       To simplify your post, the key takeaway is: Education and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way in which the education system is designed to shape people as workers and subservients to the dominant system it inhabits.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, from 1776 through much of the 19th century, American education was decentralized, entrepreneurial, and driven by the demands of individual parents and local communities, not school districts or states.
      </p>
      <p>
       This began to change in the mid-19th century when American academics became enamored with Prussian schools. Prussia, a modern day Sparta organized for constant warfare, purposefully designed its school system to create obedient soldiers, workers, and civil servants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meet Ellwood P. Cubberley, (1868–1941), dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Education and a key player in the field of educational administration during the first half of the 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1934 Cubberly bragged in Public Education in the United States that compulsory schooling is designed to extend childhood by two to six years. Indeed, Cubberley viewed school as a giant social engineering project; he wrote, “Our schools are…factories in which the raw products (children) are to be shaped and fashioned.”
      </p>
      <p>
       A close personal contact of Cubberly’s was a Harvard professor named Dr. Alexander Inglis. Inglis wrote a famous book in 1918 called Principles of Secondary Education. In this book, he outlines the true goals of public school. They include:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The adjustive or adaptive function - teaching kids to accept and respect authority.
       </li>
       <li>
        The integrating function - making every one alike.
       </li>
       <li>
        The diagnostic and directive function - determining each student’s social role/class.
       </li>
       <li>
        The selective function - helping along the evolutionary process by using grades, demerits, peer pressure, etc. to mark and ostracize those deemed ‘unfit’ or unwilling to conform
       </li>
       <li>
        The propaedeutic function - identifying the next generation of elites and teaching them how the system really works
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Our economy is based on work and consumption, both of which need to be taught. Human beings are not naturally inclined to spend 40+ hours a week sitting in 8x8 boxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Catering education to the needs of the individual would be a great detriment to the strength and unity behind the Empire, especially when you consider the geopolitical context at the turn of the 20th century.
      </p>
      <p>
       “No one asks how to motivate a baby. A baby naturally explores everything it can get at, unless restraining forces have already been at work. And this tendency doesn't die out, it's wiped out.” ― B.F. Skinner, Walden Two

       boom, kill shit. You're choosing subjective feelings over objective science. I bet if we did blood tests, I would have longer telomeres because of my supplementation, and would be more mindful/aware because of my meditations and awakenings/OBE/NDE's

       Ok, so I am on your side, but flu is a virus and antibiotics would not have helped. Actually, given the duration of illness you probably had a virus and the antibotics did not help but you got better anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you may have gotten oseltamivir which is an antiviral, but how well it works is disputed although it claims to shorten symptoms although there was some sketchy behavior by pharma when it was getting approved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, for the hepatitis case, that is a true marvel of modern medicine. He likely had hepatitis C, a virus. Not only do we have hep c treatment now, but it is shorter and more tolerable and we can target it based on the genetics of the particular strain. Its pretty amazing.

       A solution would the introduction of a

      </p>
      <p>
       Having one only costs $450 billion but brings our current payload lift of $2000/kg using Rockets all the way down to $10/kg. With it we can cheaply deploy profitable Solar Panels into Orbit that generates an upward of $18 trillion +in revenue per year upon completion. In other words, you can:

      <ul>
       <li>
        pay off the national debt

       <li>

       <li>
        maintain all government spending without any further taxation

        start cutting a check to every American every year for $50,000
       </li>

       One: We own the airwaves. Open up 5 channels and possibly a similar number of radio stations. Ban immediately campaign contributions, all campaign promises will be made on these channels. Absolutely secure web servers will be reserved for same. Shut down NGO's, eliminate tax deductions for every institution that does not demonstrably directly benefit those in need. Now, ban lobbyists. Arrest those who attempt to influence representatives through back channels. Shut down the revolving door between private and public employment. Limit all elected officials to one term. Stop their self appointed right to use insider information for investments. Reverse Citizens United. In short, get money out of politics. Sheep fence the representatives and make laws that punish relentlessly those trying to use the governance for their own benefit. Enforce a code of ethics against career bureaucrats with simple criterion to fire them.

       This. Our first obstacle is money in politics. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree, regardless of their perceived political leanings. No one likes cronyism and 'legal' corruption. There should be internet campaigns for it, in a similar spirit to the net neutrality stuff. If we can emulate that sort of viral effect, waking the people up won't be too difficult.

       I use to think that spreading awareness about the unseen evils in this world would help people snap out of their conditioning and allow us to move forward and create a better world. I was dead wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more we focus on the problem; the bigger it gets. I dove head first down some deep dark rabbit holes. The deeper I got; the darker my life became. I was angry and fearful of this evil that was tormenting my body, mind and soul. I was convinced it was all real. That demons were after my soul and chem trailing drones were following me and blasting me with DEW that damaged my body and manipulated my mind. It was a all time low and I cried out to the Almighty for wisdom.

       In ways that I can’t even describe; the Almighty showed me the folly of my plight. I thought I was going crazy, but really I was just manifesting the reality that I firmly believed in.  All my energy went into learning about the darkness and my life became dark. What is within you comes out as reality. We are truly in charge of our reality and now I seek the knowledge of the Almighty which is centered in love.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we focus on growing our love our reality will reflect that love. Love is the only solution. Love you guys!!!

       Was nodding my head and agreeing til you got to that 'almighty' stuff. I used to think the world could be made a better place, just "wake up", let's all get on the same page and work together. Needless to say I woke up from that delusion. I'm walking away from this shit. This was a rigged trap from day one. I will never again waste the energy on the shit going on inside this world when I think the real battle takes place at death.
      </p>
      <p>
       And love isn't the solution. I love the ones I feel are worth loving and trusting. Overall I don't like or trust people anymore. They're not getting a thing from me again. My past is what showed me that I was doing wrong. Somebody treating you like shit doesn't deserve your respect, kindness, love, whatever you want to call it. What needed to be done was standing up for yourself and letting the assholes know that you're not a welcome mat to be stepped all over.

       This. I’ve been meaning to ask this question for a long time, and have taken some time to dwell on it. Knowledge is power. In the face of seemingly unchangeable circumstances, sometimes the best thing we can do is inform others, who are caring and open-minded. Change permeates from the individual to a society. I’ve done my best to inform close friends and relatives about issues I care abut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, around the world children are being used for unspeakable evils. It bothers me to the core and physically sickens me. Through the help of some friends I’ve informed, we’ve been able to feed, clothe, and send a few homeless kids from my home country to school. It doesn’t do much, I know it’s something. If everyone were to help in some way, about an issue they cared about. I feel like the world would be a lot kinder place. Although I do see my self as an idealist - probably to help cope with how shitty the world is...

       Personally i think the worst problems come from the fact that many believe "Greed is Good". Those things usually drive the real conspiracies that are going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If greed and Corruption is to be stopped, we must shun corrupt individuals. China does it right, you are a High level Official, and you take money on the side? ---&gt; Firing Squad. Problem solved. NEXT?

       THANKS FOR POSTING THIS, OP! WE NEED TO MAKE THE STATUS QUO OBSOLETE
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a vision to help make many of our socio-economic challenges obsolete. Such challenges are both quantitative and qualitative in their conditions, and as such need solutions which address both the issues of meeting physical needs, and mentoring individuals in ways that uplift them psychologically and spiritually.
      </p>
      <p>
       In brief, I'm interested in using "Proof-Of-Value"  ( ala backfeed.cc) or "Proof-Of-Cooperation" (ala FairCoin) Cryptocurrencies  to encourage the digital and physical collaboration of participants in the creation of high-tech civilization-building CO-OPs which utilize the research and development capabilities of online, open-source collaborative communities and the mentorship of Co-op members, the physical benefits that the localized participation of interested members gain when participating with a coop.
      </p>
      <p>
       A project example could be that a CIV BLDR CO-OP could implement vertical , aquaponic growing systems to help us all grow food year round, tiny home construction or perhaps even develop liquid flourode thorium reactors for advanced alt-nuclear energy production-- the possibilities are only limited to the collaborative power of the open-source internet. How about a solar collector on nano carbon tower? We can design it and crowd fund it with crypto ourselves!
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of Value or Cooperation Cryptocurrencies would essentially allow members to verify the value that others provide, which creates the currency based on the incremental value added to these socially uplifting projects. Members receive the increased value of their invested currency as more coop participants volunteer time to meet specified goals in collaborative projects. This model could completely change the way we view welfare, basic need sustinance, and collaboration online. We need to bring about Society 2.0. We need to make the status quo obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just getting started on this journey, and I desperately want to collaborate with people who have the technical knowledge to collaborate with me to implement a civilization building Co-op... I'm desperate. Please help me I don't know where else to go. I would be so happy speak with any of you increadible people serious about such a venture.

       I think for a lot of this stuff you have to bounce things off of tech people, professors, community leaders, etc.

       Also Sesame Credit in China kind of goes into some of this stuff, but it ends up being Dytsopian Black Mirror style B.S.

       How? This isn't as much a solution as it is a description solved system. Disregarding whether it's practical or would work, it means nothing if it can't be implemented. The only way to
       <em>
        require
       </em>
       officials to do so would be to use the coercive power of the state, which means the officials would have to vote for it.
