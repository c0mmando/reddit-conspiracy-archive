       This whole thing in Tucson is very interesting but I can already see how it's going to be used to divide members of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know child trafficking is a Huge problem and I wouldn't be suprised if it is a child trafficking camp but most the videos are of the one dude saying THE KIDS ARE GETTING RAPED
      </p>
      <p>
       We all need to see physical evidence and decide for ourselves. Here is what I've found so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       This pictures the "rape trees" and parts of the camp.

       This clip actually pictures the inside of the bunker they keep talking about

       Finally found a child seat they keep taking about

       I don't have FB so .maybe I'm missing out on some of the evidence, but where are the 60+ pairs of shoes? Where are the blueprints for sex dungeons?? That's what I want to see.

       Going to need more than that to please the hardcore skeptics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see a well sourced post detailing all the circumstantial evidence available with photographs / documents, including contributions from those digging for more information and following the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       A more thorough compilation is needed, with greater collaboration and minds at work. I like your idea of a dump thread, but the way Reddit works, you will see posts such as these instantly criticized (rightly or wrongly) for lack of information and in general talking about the lack of detailed information and laughing at the "nonsense circumstanial evidence", rather than aiding in the research and compiling of the information out there.

       I'm not looking to disprove, but there are a TON of homeless camps in my area and this looks like all the rest to me.  So in order to push "CHILD RAPE CAMP" you're going to need to cough up
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       that points in that direction.

       I think these guys need to start their own investigation and should begin by interviewing local homeless (not just homeless veterans, by the way, but them included). You never know what information might turn up. Next I think they should consider interviewing local prostitutes - as messed up as that may sound. Some of them may have narrowly escaped trafficking situations, you don't know. Granted some of them won't say anything and some just won't know anything but again, it's a place to start, and the word of these people is often taken for granted, but they could have valuable information about trafficking rings or some shady people which could lead to another piece of info. Hell, even if it doesn't tie to Cemex, maybe it will lead to some other trafficking thing.

       This is one of about a dozen videos on the subject put out by them or with them in it. I'm just filling you in on the fact that no homeless were involved in the discovery of or promotion of the camp. There's two different entities involved. One is VOP, Veterans on Patrol, who found the camp when out looking for homeless vets to assist, which is a normal thing for them. They then contacted Craig Sawyer, who is a legitimate child trafficking expert, who came and saw it and agrees that it looks suspicious. People are questioning the VOP figurehead when you see all of the talk going around about being a felon, his involvement in the Bundy incident, etc... Craig Sawyer is on the up and up as far as anyone can tell.

       I am not one to side with the crazy transsexual but I believe her over that SEAL dude. 
He reminds me too much of Dan Bilzerian to take seriously.
       <br/>
       She is more than likely the denizen of said camp or this is all an elaborate troll. If so, well done.

       He might vaguely resemble Dan Bilzerian but their character could not be further apart. I have been loosely familiar with Sawyer for a while. It makes sense that he would be someone called to offer his expertise, being he runs Vets 4 Child Rescue, and that's pretty much the extent of his involvement. He's been pretty much the exact opposite of the VOP crew throughout this. He's been professional, not seeking attention, and level headed.

       For real man it seems like there has to be one person who could report back here!  All the videos I've seen posted here are just that dudes ugly mug claiming child rape.  I want to see pictures of the fucking underground railroad blueprints and all the other shite they keep saying over and over again.

       Now that you mention it, that's part of what is bothering me.  I don't trust people who enjoy being in front of the camera *that* much.  YOU ARE POINTING YOUR CAMERA IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, DUDE.  I want to see evidence, nothing else.

       I live in AZ. I’ve been debating going down there for a few days, and due to all the confusion, I think that’s what I’m going to do this week. I just don’t know what I’ll do once I arrive. Find the dude holed up in a tower who says he can’t trust anyone and demand pictures of his evidence? I need a game plan of what to do when I get there, and I’ll promptly travel there once I formulate such a plan.

       Just charge your phone and press record on video preferably in the day time and be like ok here i am. Like u dont even got to get out just be like ok jere it is bc i honestly dont know if this place really exists like this could just be some elaborate hoax to distract from something else. Im not saying it is but some proof not from a media outlet or youtube or somebody just tryin to get views would be legit.

       What do I record tho? Just a spot in the desert? And I thought I heard the place got bulldozed, does anyone know if that’s factual?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have the time and resources to take the short drive there, but I need a checklist of things to do. I’m taking suggestions!! Anything anybody wants to see (that’s feasible) go ahead and let me know.

       I'm not looking to disprove, but there are a TON of homeless camps in my area and this looks like all the rest to me.  So in order to push "CHILD RAPE CAMP" you're going to need to cough up
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       that points in that direction.
