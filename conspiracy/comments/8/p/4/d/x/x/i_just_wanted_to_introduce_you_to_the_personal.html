<p>Flyboard Air is a type of jetpack/hoverboard powered by proprietary turbojets. It was invented by a French man called Franky Zapata.</p>

<p>It achieved a Guinness World Record for farthest flight by hoverboard in April 2016 of 2,252.4 m.[1] Zapata Racing claims that it allows flight up to an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,000 m) and has a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph). It also has 10 minutes autonomy.</p>

<p>Seriously cool, eh?  This is the kind of stuff we used to dream about when we were kids.  Zapata,  however,  ran into opposition from officials in France almost immediately after unveiling his creation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The man who invented the Flyboard Air has been barred from flying his jet-powered hoverboard in France, sparking a debate over the country’s policies on innovation. In a Facebook post on March 10th, Franky Zapata, founder of the company that bears his name, said there is a “strong probability that the Flyboard Air will never fly again in France,” after officials from the French air gendarmerie told him he would be placed under criminal investigation if he continued to pilot the craft. Zapata added that he will now be “obliged to leave France” in order to continue his work. </p>

<p>Not to worry,  though!  He left France and came to the US in order to continue his dream of revolutionizing personal transportation. Now,  everyone will benefit from his amazing ingenuity! </p>

<p>Oh crap...  I forgot about the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951.</p>

<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2018/03/28/five-thousand-inventions-in-limbo-and-under-secrecy-orders-at-the-us-patent-office/">https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2018/03/28/five-thousand-inventions-in-limbo-and-under-secrecy-orders-at-the-us-patent-office/</a></p>

<p>Oh well....  We should have seen where this was going. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Zapata Industries, the company behind the jet-powered hoverboard known as the Flyboard Air, is <strong>about to be purchased by a defense tech company called Implant Sciences</strong>. </p>

<p>Liscouski [Implant Sciences’ president] declined to elaborate on potential uses, and instead focused more on how <strong>Implant Sciences will use its established defense industry relationships</strong> to figure out what the technology could be used for. &quot;You need people who are going to be able to figure out if they can actually use this stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;<strong>Quite candidly, the military is the first in line because they look for ways to get what would be equivalent to a competitive advantage [in the field]</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We’re looking at ways that we can facilitate and enable Franky to get into the marketplace where he doesn’t have access and where we think we can really enable that, <strong>such as the DOD</strong> and the security space here on the US side.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to come to conclusion that this is nefarious in nature . However context is everything. What was happening in 1951? The Korean War was waging, a war that is poorly understood and essentially not taught at all by our Marxist school system.  This war along with the indo china war and Vietnam war were not wars against poor Asian countries these were intact wars against the full might of the ussr. Can you imagine the world today if the Soviets had managed to secure more advanced technology then the United States? This act ensured that no more tech would fall into the hands of the energy. A peace agreement was never signed between America and North Korea or more appropriately the ussr. So this act remains only because we are still function as if it is war time. </p>

This can only start to happen because the enemy has been steadily losing ground for a while now.

<p>It <strong>is</strong> pedantic, but not only that, it&#39;s also pseudoscientific to represent abiotic oil hypotheses as fact when this is a poorly documented phenomena still being researched and weighed by the scientific community for its merits, and so far it is the opinion of those scientists whom directly work with the study of the origin of petroleum, that it is possible that small amounts of petroleum may form abiotically, but that no significant quantities of petroleum form this way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then you better hope the Korean conflict comes to an end soon.</p>

<p>The Korean war is not a rational justification for decades of corrupted application of a law designed to give America an advantage during the cold war. Geopolitically, yes, there is an ongoing struggle between the nations which underwent communist revolutions and participated in opposition to the U.S. during the cold war, but the cold war is over. You want to talk about the issues of hegemonic governments and dangerous tyrannical ideologies, look, the Chinese government taxes 6% less of its economy than the American government. In fact, the west makes up the most highly taxed nations in the world, and taxation is essentially theft by the state, and in the case of the U.S. government, incredibly ineffective use of stolen funds and for all we know, embezzlement of trillions of taxpayer dollars, about enough money to wipe out all of our debt, completely unaccounted for. There are many different kinds of tyrannies. America has lost sight of what it is fighting for, and has become the monster it once sought to destroy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A flying platform this size, with those particular engines, is not a practical form of transportation at all, even for the military. It is a toy. Do you know why? It&#39;s because microturbines that size have a TBO - that is, time between overhaul - measured in the tens of hours. Imagine having to rip out and rebuild the engine in your car after every 25 hours of driving time.</p>

<p>When Franky Zapata flew the Flyboard Air in the US, a bunch of busybodies even complained that he was breaking the law because the thing exceeds the performance specs of an Ultralight, and therefore needs to be FAA-registered.</p>

<p>If this thing hadn&#39;t been bought out by the military-industrial complex, it would&#39;ve faded into obscurity. Even after it&#39;s been bought by the military-industrial complex, it&#39;s probably going to fade into obscurity. It has very few practical applications, other than, of course, putting on a cool show.</p>

<p>I had a concept for a VTOL jet-bike that uses a pair of Tomahawk engines with vectored thrust nozzles and features a carbon-fiber fuselage and whole-aircraft recovery system in case of engine failure. You sit on top of the thing, like a motorcycle, wearing a special suit with snap-hooks attached to nylon bands woven around the back like a fall protection harness to keep you from falling off. Way more practical; the TBO on a Williams F107 is much longer than any R/C aircraft microturbine. It&#39;d guzzle fuel like nobody&#39;s business, and it&#39;d probably cost over a million dollars, but it&#39;d be pretty damn nifty.</p>

<p>Probably the most practical VTOLs these days are those backyard multi-rotors you see people building. Very cheap and easy to construct from COTS components with a budget under $30,000. As the power-to-weight ratio of electric propulsion improves due to advances in battery tech, you&#39;re going to see a lot more of those.</p>

<p>This has to be true, I think even hardcore skeptics would struggle to argue this point given the evidence provided in this single case. But, to what extent is this true? Maybe we already have the capability to cure many diseases. Maybe this kind of technology is childs play compared to some of the hidden technologies that have already been invented. I think there are many things that already exist that are too mind blowing to be public knowledge.</p>
