       When Trump was given props for arranging the SK and NK talks, I barely saw anything regarding it on MSM and it did NOT make front page on Reddit. In fact...had to watch it on a 3rd party website b/c our media didn't cover it. Hmmmm....? Speaks for itself. Media is shit. They have an AGENDA!

       Reddit was actually always equal parts Ron Paul libertarian and Bernie Sanders type lefties. Check out r/politics from early 2016 and you'll see a completely different place
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit was never anything like it is today. It's now basically party line establishment Democrats and neoliberals. Reddit is even pro John Mccain now.

       People will try simple statements like the one way above to kinda generalize Reddit as liberal, but I've been here for 5 years and this place was a Libertarian dream. People debating fairly civilly, information being shared openly, game info, politics still was kinda iffy, but there was a freeing feeling this site had.

       Now it's a ideological nuclear battleground and I don't see the path back.

       when did he pretend to have a learning disability exactly and how is that bigotry?  and wow, he said something millions of other men say and joke about, as do women.  what a monster to say something that there is zero evidence actually happened!

       seriously, ive said far worse things than that that i have not done and would never do. and ive heard far, far worse from women talking about men.
      </p>
      <p>
       and how about this. from a mainstream magazine. posting an article about mens dicks.  men who train for their whole life to compete in the olympics and cosmo writes an article about oogling their dicks.  where was the outcry?  but trump makes a stupid comment about grabbing chicks by the crotch (which again, no proof ever actually even happened) and all the sudden he is the worst person ever?  come on.

       lol I’ve had women come up and actually grab me by the dick. Many times. I used to run concerts and it’s how they’d try to get backstage.

       i spent a good chunk of my teen years on a competitive dance team that was like 5 of us guys and 200 girls.  they are just as filthy minded as guys, often worse, and you know what, who cares?  a group of friends sitting around saying awful stuff that never happens is not that big of an issue.   and thats what the grab the puss thing was.  it was 2 guys who thought they were having a private conversation talking about dumb shit that damn near every guy talks about at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       or are you going to tell me youve never been with friends and said something along the lines of "oh, id fuck her so hard her mom will feel it!".  or him or whatever youre into.  because how is that any more appropriate?  its just as rapey is it not?
      </p>
      <p>
       so how about we just stop with this self righteous indignation bullshit and focus the hate on people like bill cosby who was actually out drugging and raping women?  or all the scumbags in hollywood taking advantage of everybody.  crazy idea i know, but maybe instead of getting all up in arms about something that has zero evidence of actually happening and was just a stupid supposed to be private conversation between 2 people go.  because who fucking cares what 2 dudes said to each other on a bus 10 years ago or whatever. it has zero impact on fucking anything.  everybody has made some stupid remark that could be taken badly by somebody.  but most people dont have to worry about cameras and mics being everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       at least im not too big of a hypocritical asshat to admit ive said dumb and awful shit before.  because apparently nobody else has.  they are all living comfy lives in their glass homes with no rocks to throw. not a single one.  all a bunch of ned flanders or some shit.

       Dude I understand people are filthy creatures. I'm one of them. It was still a pretty bad tape for someone running for president. I cant imagine how many heads would explode if Obama was on tape saying some shit like that. I dont think most guys or girls really talk like that. Ik a total degenerate but I dont think you should just be grabbing people when you're famous and can get away with it.

       again, who did he grab?  where is the evidence he was going around doing that?  i dont recall all of that evidence that he actually did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       thats a pretty big part of it, no?  of course nobody should be going around just grabbing people.  but is simply talking about it really that big of a deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       or are we going to pretend he is the first person to become president to have said or done something like that? cough cough bill clinton.... he was caught with his cigar in an intern.  presidents are people too, for better or worse.  i dont think being so outraged over somebody just saying something stupid with no evidence of it happening is worth the time.

       i care because clinton did it literally in the oval office.  there is a difference between a private life incident and what you do at work, especially when your work involves representing the most powerful &amp; greatest nation on earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       just like i dont care what bill is doing now i dont care what trump did before, that is between him and his wife. bill is free to have freakin orgies at his house if he wants.  film it. sell it. i dont care, what he does in his private life is his business and banging interns is not in itself illegal. but when you move that orgy to the white house, when youre in office, we have a problem now. thats not just his personal life.

       Why are you implying a handicapped guy, Kovaleski, has a learning disability?

       That's fucking bigoted as hell man.  Not everyone who has a condition that effects their motor skills and causes them to hold their hands in an atypical posture is learning disabled or mentally handicapped.

       I'll be honest I didn't actually look up who he was mocking, so that one's on me. But on the other point, I have no problem with the women involved in the situation. I have a problem with someone in charge of a country talking like he can just do whatever he wants to women with or without their consent. In any case, Americans can enjoy their president, I have enough on my plate with the asshole we have here.

       The difference between Trump's bullshit is that he just blurts it out instead of insinuating things with political rhetoric. Doesn't make it better, but nor does it make it worse. The fact is he is no worse than any slimebag US politician, and may, in fact, be better if only because he defies expectation. The jury is still out for me on Trump, but he's hardly my focus when so much other shit is hitting the fan that was flung way before he showed up.

       Case in point, the media can spin anything they want any way they want it.  The truth about the handicapped guy getting mocked is as follows.  They notice that Trump makes this gesture (the retarded hands thing) whenever he is mocking his critics or people who say dumb things so the find a person with said condition to criticize him publicly and they sit back and wait for Trump to bite.

       All I had to do was summon fake outrage about women's choice and you're back on your heels signaling how virtuous you are.  This is called identity politics and gives no consideration to the individuals (good diggers, groupies, alimony chasers) who make a choice to do exactly what Trump described.  Everyone knows they exist, and they exist on all levels.  The only thing wrong that Trump did was get caught on tape talking shit to other guys who were goading him on about it.  We've all bragged about stupid shit and sometimes it's about loose women or sexual conquests.  Sex is absolutely not a taboo topic, shouldn't be and it's ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alot of the people complaining about Trump grabbing the pussy of girls who literally want him to do it are the same people who can't see a problem with a transexual person keep their status a secret and "conquering" heterosexual partners.
      </p>
      <p>
       The layers upon layers of hypocritical outrage on everything Trump related is getting old as fuck.  It's obviously being force fed into the narrative.

        Yes, this.

       This is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the kind of bullshit that made me wake up and see how problematic feminism is (not trying to derail topic, so people, please do not reply to me regarding feminism - I'm sticking to Trump discussion; however I would love someone to do a post on 3rd wave feminism as psy-ops). When I was involved in that cult-like mentality, it was so easy for me to believe politicians who pander to "women's rights", and it was so cheering to me to think there were politicians out there who really did GAF about women (I am a woman, btw); as a result, I didn't bother looking into the hypocrisy of all the candidates and only focused on how "terrible" Trump was for his language use. It wasn't until after the election that I had a miraculous epiphany that Trump is no worse than anybody else in office proclaiming a "virtuous" ideology. (Again, not yet sure where I stand on him now. I don't hate him, and I disagree with a lot of his policies primarily related to wildlife, but I do agree with other policies, and I refuse to hate him more than any other politician when they have pretty much all been nothing but greasy liars.)

       I love how I get downvoted just because I admit to being neutral about Trump. Liberals claim to be the "open-minded" group but they are so self-righteous that they willfully disregard their own hypocrisy. I know this because I
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       one - I was the flag-waving feminist voting blue no matter who. It took the election of 2016 to make me see that people were disproportionately hating the man. Yes, he is obnoxious and vulgar and "not presidential," but I have yet to encounter
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       who either can or is willing to articulate to me exactly why Trump deserves more vitriol than any other person in significant power. I don't care that they hate him, but I care that it's not equal hatred of politicians all-around. I
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       get the same "Well so-and-so is the lesser of two evils" (ie Hillary's campaign) - but are they
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       ??? If you want to hate Trump, that's your business, but at least be honest enough to admit that the reasons you're hating him are paltry compared to the wide array of reasons available to hate other people in power, including the people you stoop to vote in because you're too lazy to do the research on the candidates beyond checking compromised and extremely biased "news" sources like NYTimes or the like.

       You're either intentionally misinterpreting everything I say to push some false narrative on me about who I am (none of which you've gotten correct, by the way), as I have explicitly made clear that I am neutral (as regards Trump), maybe you're just delusional enough to believe in your own self-righteousness. Either way, you're just projecting. You couldn't even own up to being called out when I corrected you about accusing me of lying. Balls up, grow up, and come back when you're ready to be an adult about politics instead of a hypocrite who is accusing me of clinging to extreme beliefs when clearly you're the one clutching your pearls.

       "So liberals who are willing to protest at Antifa events are communists?" isn't a truth unless he's asserting it, and it's not a particularly relevant truth unless it somehow refutes the alt-right argument. As is, to any downvoters it probably looks like a lame gotcha question trying to discourage the alt-right bit rather than make any serious point about anti-fascists.

       That seems like an easy life hack for anyone to suppress free speech, just send in some racists or "ANTIFA" thugs and the whole thing gets shut down.  You're basically begging to take power away from the people's right to protest.

       You might be right on Antifa. The counter protest was not organized by them and the counter protest permit was assigned not affiliated witn antifa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the Unite the Right permit and organization was handled by white supremists.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I agree in this case since Antifa wasn't the originating point of the counter protest the others were not joining Antifa's protest since they didn't own it.

       There were all kinds of groups who "rallied" to save the statue because of activists on the left who made it an issue by trying to get the statue removed.  Just because one racist group joined in the protest doesn't mean everyone who organized the protest was a racist.

       They didn't join the protest. The Unite the Right protest permit and organization was all done by white supremists, advertized on white supremist websites like the daily stormer, and was a coalition of white supremists. Let's not be naive in thinking the non white supremists joining them did not know what the protest was now.

       Unite the right certainly sounds like a regular political event so it's pretty likely that a lot of people didn't know it had racist organization.

       Do you really think someone goong there isn't going to look up basic information? The organizer Nathan Damigo said it was intended to unify the white nationalist movement in America. The members wore Swastikas, had anti muslim and antisemitic banners. A simple search online would have told anyone it's purpose is for white supremists to unite. A simple look around would show you who you are protesting with.

       The statue was a confederate statue. A representation of the Confederacy and what they stood for. For instance, The Articles of Secesson, which had 8 points. 7 about slavery, and 1 indirectly about slavery. The people were defending a historic statue that is a representation of slavery to black people. So yes, they were sympathetic to white supremists, but I don't go that far and label them white supremists.

       one side was not all wearing swastikas, but nice try.  actually, no, it wasnt a nice try, it was as pathetic the millionth time as the first time.  please dont try again.  its just sad at this point.

       at least pick one of his ridiculous twitter rants to harp on him.  he has done plenty of things worth criticizing but you still want to pick bullshit?  those rallies were not some robe wearing klan meeting where they were stringing up black people.  there was in fact people from all sorts of walks of life, and there for different reasons.  i dont have jack shit to do with the alt right or the klan or any other group really, but i think removing statues is stupid and solves nothing.  trying to erase history does what exactly?  guess im a nazi now, huh?  oh well.

      <p>
       isis, isil, taliban, etc.  they do a whole lot of removing statues that they dont like the message of.  like, a whole lot of that.  with bombs usually.

       so if your viewpoints are shared by literal terrorist, maybe its time you reevaluate your values.  just ask

       no, i would not.  but would also not be so quick to judge people who may have showed up simply to protest the removal of a statue and ended up next to people with extreme views who also decided to show up.
      </p>
      <p>
       or is the left now going to apply that logic of lumping everybody into the same group and admit that all muslims must be terrorist because some terrorist stand next to other muslims?  and all blm supporters are cop killers because cop killers showed up to their marches.
      </p>
      <p>
       so which is it, do we lump everybody into one group or do we not?  you cant just pick and choose on a whim. that would be awfully hypocritical, wouldnt it?  or did you go to those marches and chat up every single person there to see what they were there for?  im sure you did that, you seem like you have some solid logic here.  though since im a nazi why listen to me?

       if you just read only the post you made describing this event, without mentioning the race of the individuals involved, does that sound like a "bigoted" act? i don't want to put words in your mouth, but are you trying to insinuate that the people involved simply being black somehow turns this into a "bigoted" act?

       like how can you possibly say "he wouldnt have written it had they been white" and feel like that is some sort of actual answer to a question?  wtf is wrong with you if you think that is how reality works?  there is no proof for that statement, and how could there be unless the exact same thing happened with white people and his opinions were different.

       This all happened back when I was a teenager, but Trump was pretty well known for being a racist.  This Central Park Five thing came several years after Trump was sued for not letting black people rent his properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, after those guys were proven not guilty by DNA evidence, Trump still (even as recently as 2016) claims that they are guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either Trump is too stupid to understand what DNA is, he's unwilling to ever admit he's been wrong, or he's a racist.  Or possibly some combination of those three.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the guy's got a pretty established pattern of talking shit about minorities.  He rareley does this stuff with white people. 
 Although I do remember he dated a pretty hot black chick for a while.

      <p>
       please show me in that article where he said they were guilty because of their skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
       he said they were guilty because: "They admitted they were guilty" and "The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty. The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous".  maybe im the idiot here, but which of those statements involves race in any way at all?  ill be waiting on the edge of my seat for your answer on that one for sure.  because you dipshits always have an answer to why YOU think something is racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       so if he did speak to the case in regards to race you sure picked the absolute fucking worst article to prove your "point".  at least find something remotely relevant to your argument if you are going to try and tell me why i am so wrong.

       These are all great things!  And I agree they should be talked about, but keep in mind that only one of those things is actually tangible and passed. The others also happened in a week where some major foreign policy talk is going down. I think a looming trade war is going to overshadow him saying he would "probably" support something.

       Not a coincidence. There has been a concerted effort to ensure left leaning posts make it to the front page. I really hate to get too political here, but I honestly think the "bad" democrats have teamed up with Chinese communists to ensure certain ideologies are heavily promoted on this website. Forget the name of the known Chinese group that is paid to post pro Chinese commentary online.

       The narrarive is that trump is the worst thing in the universe. His presidency is suppose to teach america and its people to participate in democracy and not assume someone else will do it. Cant trust media or politicians as corruption runs wild. To solve this, real change is wanted and needed, but if a considerable population size still wants to revolt. A 50/50 split on shithole choices last round brought to you by elextoral college, means there is considerable discourse in the public. Everyone wants change, but promises are never met for the people, corporate donos sure. Everyone erged people to come out and vote, like that matters. The lesson was not only to vote, but participate in politics, actively participate. Not just consume lying media and swallow it up as truth. Lessons are being taught the hard way, through self education. If the public cannot overcome the programming they will continue to be punished(its simple law of the reality)

       If i had to estimate I would say reddit is 60% anti trump 20% pro trump and 20% neutral which is probably why that happens. I suspect if you had polled Clinton supports and Trump supporters on using reddit it would be 3:1 atleast.

       ShareBlue does do a pretty good job of painting that illusion, I I'll admit. But I think most of us would be shocked at the amount of anti-Trump astroturfing. I'm not saying it doesn't come from all directions, but I suspect ShareBlue is winning the volume game by massive margins.

       You think the MSM is not covering the meeting between Trump and Kim Jun Un? It’s more likely that the NK meeting was purposely scheduled to conflict with the G7 meeting in Canada (which Trump will be leaving early in order to “prepare” for his meeting in Singapore with NK). If anything, Trump “smartly” is trying to take negative press away from the G7 meeting and pushing the coverage over to his NK summit (where all he needs to do in order to get good press is agree to more meetings and a “commitment” to end the war in Korea).
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM has absolutely been covering the NK summit. You could argue that the MSM is poisoning the well, by focusing on Rudi Giuliani’s insane comments in Israel. But you can’t say that the MSM is hiding or minimizing the meeting.

       We do, but when the entire world is sponsoring the hate and it's spawned nearly 20 different subs dedicated for conservative bashing, some of us users are going to take a step back and ask "What are they selling now" and "How did they manage to create a movement that you cannot disagree with without being the enemy?"

       You come to a conspiracy forum to complain that the President of the United Ststes is getting bad press. Give me a break. Maybe if he wasn't such an appalling human being, and thought through any of his statements, more people would tolerate him. I have no sympathy for such a cruel and callous parody of a leader.

       I'll never vote for DJT and have some serious policy disagreements with where he's leading us.  However, just out of a basic sense of fairness, I find myself defending the guy.  The 24/7 anti-Trump hysteria has made alot of people on the left just flat-out stupid about the bigger picture.

       Environmentalists, or anyone on the left, really, complaining about tariffs on Chinese solar panels is a good example.  The reason those panels were cheap to begin with is China's craptacular wage, safety &amp; enviro regs along with not accounting for the true cost of hydrocarbons in shipping.  The demand for solar panels isn't going away, but now there's some space for US companies to get in.  Anyone who is pro-union should realize these tariffs are flocking up NAFTA and 20+ years of
       <strong>
        <em>
         multi-national/corporate/state
        </em>
       </strong>
       trade practices that haven't done blue collar manufacturing workers any favors.  Much of the regs for TPP are already on the books thru separate trade agreements.  DJT is flocking all that up.  Kicking the TPP sandcastle over isn't something anyone on the
       <strong>
        ACTUAL
       </strong>
       left should be complaining about.  All those protesters who trashed downtown Seattle b/c WTO should be giving DJT a thumb's up on at least one aspect of trade policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't to say tariffs are good things, but the MSM isn't remotely giving balanced reporting on the pro's and cons.

       Trump has done very little that could be considered positive.. He's not a negotiator, he doesn't make comprises, he's a loose cannon and is stirring up a lot of hate within America. You should wonder why the kkk and neo nazis like him and feel enabled by him
