       Ryan had been trying to score an interview with James (Comet Ping Pong owner) for a few weeks prior to the threatening phone call. Shortly after Ryan posted his Pegasus findings on Voat, James reached out to him and demanded a phone call. Some very strange stuff in the video below.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Pegasus Museum video
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT9QzmMAe4">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT9QzmMAe4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       During the call, according to Ryan, James had threatened to kill his wife, his family, and to put Ryan in prison. Ryan filed a police report following the incident, and posted a video detailing the experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBn7ja_oegM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBn7ja_oegM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The paid infiltrators and shills that are deployed to protect James and the other people implicated, usually accuse Ryan of being a profiteer who fabricated the story to sell shirts, ignoring the police report he filed against James and his conversations with the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan actually has an account on here, and will usually chime in in posts that mention the incident. In the most recent Pizzagate round table discussion, he replied with his account,
       <a href="/u/GuyAlefantisThretnd">
        /u/GuyAlefantisThretnd
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Hey... it’s me Ryan. Nothing was fabricated. Yes i sold shirts. I also refunded everybody who bought a shirt when the shills shit their pants over it. Focus of shirts was spreading awareness. 100\% of the marketing of pizzagate was controlled by MSM. I wanted to change that. Even if my motivation was to make money... it still happened. Pegasus is real. The threats are real. The info in the video is real. His reaction was real. The police report is real. The special agent i dealt with was real."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there was something happening at Pegasus. Why else would this "innocent pizza parlor owner" be forced to threaten the life of somebody who brought attention to it? This piece of evidence can't be forgotten.

       He examined some images of the front of the property, If you check out the video there is a spot on the concrete that says "kids" with an arrow pointing down. That's where a lot of the IG photos were taken.

       Yes. On the outside...so you can lock the gate when you walk out of your house. I’m not arguing anything here so I’m not sure why I’m being downvoted. I grew up in DC...I know what our windows and doors look like.

       Seems like we could have used a sales pitch. End result is alefantis and podesta and the rest faded away in place of metoo and monthly hot discoveries (Tucson) that fade just as fast until the next big thing. We are easily distracted.

       Not all of the people skeptical of Ryan were shills. While I understand the awareness angle, and the perk of making money from/for a good cause, I feel like it's still a questionable action to sell "gear". His original goal was a billboard campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a topic that was mostly truly focused on by a skeptical subculture, it should be expected to be questioned when money is involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I don't doubt his sincerity in spreading awareness, profit off of tragedy calls credibility into question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weird situation though. If someone were so passionate about a cause to make a big enough deal about it, it's possible they'd be threatened. But it can also be a noisy wheel getting grease situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the bold claims in the Tucson matter, which were so immediately debunked, we might have gotten more real evidence. Now we'll never know. I understand the need for sensationalism to drive a cause, but it can be abused and cause things to fall apart as quickly as it builds them up.

       Maybe if we’d bought the shirts more people would know what’s going on... seems like an overall fail for the redpilling movement. Shills won.

       Or, you know, this stuff costs money to investigate. Like plane tickets and other transportation, equipment, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Money and time is the reason most people couldn't investigate something like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking for money when supplying a great deal of your time and effort for a cause is not any reason I would be skeptical. Was he supposed to be doing this all for free out of his own pocket?

       I was around and very active throughout the investigation and i was 50/50 on this being authentic. I study grammatical forensics and Ryan had a very specific way of texting and typing and i found many of those same linuistic patterns in the James texts leading me to believe there was a good chance both sides of the conversation were the same person.

       If this was fabricated, how was he able to file a police report against James for a "terroristic threat", a report that James acknowledges?

       James could have sued him if he faked this conversation. He didn't.

       I've never seen any acknowledgement by alefantis. I'd like to though. That'd have eased my skepticism at the time.

       Also, do you remember that other guy who was constantly trolling voat and uploaded creepy stalker videos and ate nothing but pizza and had shitloads of infowars stickers everywhere?

       No obviously dont take my word. Im just trying to add my opinion about what I thought back when it actually happened. I can go through some of the specific patterns i found if you are interested in another post. It becomes pretty clear they forgot to change their style of typing. Everybody types differently online or in texts. Some people use different forms of correct and incorrect grammar, shortcuts, vocabular, punctuation abbreviations and it literally creates a written fingerprint.

       You can confirm it by looking at the videos that were removed. YouTube says they were removed because of a copyright infringement from alefantis himself. How did alefantis know to remove my video PERSONALLY if he wasn’t focused on it at the time

       The videos of your texts or of Pegasus? He was pretty actively following pg threads at the time. I recall some of his comments making his identity fairly clear, so I could see him complaining about what he found.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean I never saw any police reports and I never saw alefantis confirm said reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I recall correctly, he was going on a tear getting videos removed left and right. I followed all of this closely as it was unfolding, and at the time, i never saw proof beyond a reasonable doubt regarding your claims.

       At any rate, hopefully things are going well for you sir!

       The one part of this that makes me believe is fake is that both him and his friend were present during one of the phone calls and both of them didn't think to record any of it? It would have cleared any doubt about any of this.
