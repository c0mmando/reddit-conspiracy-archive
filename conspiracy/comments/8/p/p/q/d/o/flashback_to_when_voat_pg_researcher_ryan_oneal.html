        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/GreenIDLady.html">GreenIDLady</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ryan had been trying to score an interview with James (Comet Ping Pong owner) for a few weeks prior to the threatening phone call. Shortly after Ryan posted his Pegasus findings on Voat, James reached out to him and demanded a phone call. Some very strange stuff in the video below. </p>

<p><strong>Pegasus Museum video</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT9QzmMAe4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnT9QzmMAe4</a></p>

<p>During the call, according to Ryan, James had threatened to kill his wife, his family, and to put Ryan in prison. Ryan filed a police report following the incident, and posted a video detailing the experience. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBn7ja_oegM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBn7ja_oegM</a></p>

<p>The paid infiltrators and shills that are deployed to protect James and the other people implicated, usually accuse Ryan of being a profiteer who fabricated the story to sell shirts, ignoring the police report he filed against James and his conversations with the FBI.</p>

<p>Ryan actually has an account on here, and will usually chime in in posts that mention the incident. In the most recent Pizzagate round table discussion, he replied with his account, <a href="/u/GuyAlefantisThretnd">/u/GuyAlefantisThretnd</a> .</p>

<p><em>&quot;Hey... it’s me Ryan. Nothing was fabricated. Yes i sold shirts. I also refunded everybody who bought a shirt when the shills shit their pants over it. Focus of shirts was spreading awareness. 100\% of the marketing of pizzagate was controlled by MSM. I wanted to change that. Even if my motivation was to make money... it still happened. Pegasus is real. The threats are real. The info in the video is real. His reaction was real. The police report is real. The special agent i dealt with was real.&quot;</em></p>

<p>I believe there was something happening at Pegasus. Why else would this &quot;innocent pizza parlor owner&quot; be forced to threaten the life of somebody who brought attention to it? This piece of evidence can&#39;t be forgotten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all of the people skeptical of Ryan were shills. While I understand the awareness angle, and the perk of making money from/for a good cause, I feel like it&#39;s still a questionable action to sell &quot;gear&quot;. His original goal was a billboard campaign. </p>

<p>For a topic that was mostly truly focused on by a skeptical subculture, it should be expected to be questioned when money is involved. </p>

<p>Though I don&#39;t doubt his sincerity in spreading awareness, profit off of tragedy calls credibility into question. </p>

<p>Weird situation though. If someone were so passionate about a cause to make a big enough deal about it, it&#39;s possible they&#39;d be threatened. But it can also be a noisy wheel getting grease situation. </p>

<p>Without the bold claims in the Tucson matter, which were so immediately debunked, we might have gotten more real evidence. Now we&#39;ll never know. I understand the need for sensationalism to drive a cause, but it can be abused and cause things to fall apart as quickly as it builds them up. </p>

I can go through some of the specific patterns i found if you are interested in another post. It becomes pretty clear they forgot to change their style of typing. Everybody types differently online or in texts. Some people use different forms of correct and incorrect grammar, shortcuts, vocabular, punctuation abbreviations and it literally creates a written fingerprint.</p>

<p>I mean I never saw any police reports and I never saw alefantis confirm said reports. </p>

<p>If I recall correctly, he was going on a tear getting videos removed left and right. I followed all of this closely as it was unfolding, and at the time, i never saw proof beyond a reasonable doubt regarding your claims. </p>
