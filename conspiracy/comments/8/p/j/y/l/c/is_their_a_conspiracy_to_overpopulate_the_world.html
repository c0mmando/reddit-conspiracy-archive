<p>I notice Billionaire Bill Gates is attempting to cure the things that kill the majority of children in under developed countries and specifically Africa.</p>

<p>This is a good move, but these countries also have huge problems regarding birth control and contraception being underused and families having 4 or more children out of an expectation of some of their kids dying.</p>

<p>Africa is already expected to grow from 1 Billion to 4 Billion people.</p>

<p>The growth will occur faster and go farther once the diseases that have killed off Africans for centuries become permanently cured within the next decade</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/africas-population-explosion-will-change-humanity-2015-8">http://www.businessinsider.com/africas-population-explosion-will-change-humanity-2015-8</a></p>

<p>For reference the current world population is 7.6 Billion</p>

<p>For further reference the average IQ of Africa is somewhere between 60 and 80</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289609001275">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289609001275</a></p>

<p>The criteria for Mental retardation is below 70 IQ</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/ustat/ustat0301-01.htm">https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/ustat/ustat0301-01.htm</a></p>

<p>Im sure  I will be called racist for this.</p>

<p>But is it not a major issue that a continent that hovers around the retardation criteria will make up nearly half the world population within our lifetime?</p>

<p>Would this not be beneficial to a ruling class?</p>

<p>Maybe education could solve this issue but I am skeptical.</p>

<p>Please give me some facts to offset these fears such as IQ growth stats or something.</p>

<p>What do you propose as a solution.  HEre is one little fact for you. </p>

<p>Each time since the 60s when there is a Democratic President/U.S. government, that government makes available to developing nations all manner of birth control support.  </p>

<p>Each time there is a Republican administration those funds are cut. 
And the explanation is that those liberals want to eliminate the poor via birth control. </p>

<p>Why are you making this a partisan, anti conservative issue?</p>

<p>My &quot;evidence&quot; is all official</p>

<p>barring major changes</p>

<p>Africa WILL reach 4 Billion people (x4 growth)</p>

<p>Every other population WILL remain about the same</p>

<p>Africas Avg IQ IS 80</p>

<p>Bill Gates IS trying to cure the main diseases ravaging Africa</p>

<p>I just take all that and ask if it is just &quot;natural&quot; for the 1st world to be VASTLY outbred by the 3rd World, to a degree with low intelligence migrants will have to flood into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Africa is already exporting migrants and that WILL rapidly increase if they follow UN projected population growth stats.</p>

<p>TL;DR because an IQ test is skill based you can get better at them, meaning someone that starts at an IQ of 90 can test better than 125 given practice.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly said I am assuming IQ is based on external factors.</p>

<p>My question is if Africa is currently at a state where the external factors are keeping IQs at a level nearing the western equivalent of retardation.
(not my opinion, the official stats)</p>

<p>How will they be able to change those factors when faced with a quickly rising population while already receiving foreign aid?</p>

<p>The 1st world simply does not have the capabilities to educate that many people, there are already education crisis in some western countries just with their natives.</p>

<p>I am not saying they are legally mentally handicapped.</p>

<p>I am saying their average IQ, is extremely close to the western criteria for retardation in terms of IQ excluding other factors.</p>

<p>Do you not get what I am saying?</p>

<p>I am NOT saying they are permanently mentally disabled.</p>

<p>I AM saying their environment has led to an entire continent having an average IQ of 80</p>

<p>I AM saying that the western criteria for retardation level IQ is 70 - 75</p>

<p>Do you get that those 2 points are facts?</p>

<p>Yeah Africans can probably jump their individual IQs to 100 given proper education and other things such as food water and shelter</p>

<p>My POINT is, if they are incapable of doing those things NOW with a population of 1 Billion.</p>

<p>How Exactly will they suddenly be able to with a population of 4 Billion.</p>

<p>The 1st world countries are INCAPABLE of fixing this problem for them, even now we funnel billions into Africa and it may save some lives or help individual Africans but it is doing close to nothing in terms of fixing the average IQ problem.</p>

<p>And to simple maintain this &quot;doing close to nothing&quot; status we will have to increase funding x4.</p>

<p>So while you sit here arguing semantics</p>

<p>Nearly half the worlds population will be unable to pass 3rd grade math yet will be allowed to vote and form political movements.</p>

<p>And you are clearly more concerned with policing peoples speech so they dont describe this segment of No-intelligence no-education people in a way you find &#39;&quot;offensive&quot; </p>

<p>Instead of being concerned that 4 billion out of an expected 10 billion humans will be mind numbingly stupid and uneducated</p>

<p>It explains how iq is mainly based on upbringing, citing a study where identical twins seperated at birth, one going to a richer family and the other going to a poorer one having a 20 point iq difference</p>

If they are unintelligent because of only their upbringing and for example food they eat, then there is no problem.

    <div class="md"><p>The world could MAYBE handle 1/4 of Africas projected population which would be 1 billion.</p>

<p>For reference all of the US is about 300 million total if we accepted 100 million  migrants that would be 1/40th  of their population and they would no make up 1/4 of our country .</p>

<p>And then every country would have to face a crisis of attempting to integrate migrants who would be bringing their toxic culture with them and make room for them in their schools and spend countless dollars setting up special education programs.</p>

<p>This would drain a large amount of money from every country that accepted them and every country would also see a rise in crime as we are already seeing in many european countries accepting refugees.</p>

<p>And besides that huge burden Africa would still have 2 billion more people than it does currently and require much more financial aid from countries who are already spending a ton of money attempting to integrate its migrants just to maintain current levels of aid which are minimal.</p>

<p>And we just have to hope these migrants dont coalesce into communities in the countries they migrate to and perpetuate a toxic culture from their home country for multiple generations</p>

<p>Again I see your point, and you may be correct, but it will never go well for you to argue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Africans are intellectually inferior based on their genetics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if it is 100% proven as fact, it will not be accepted.</p>

<p>and by saying it you will make yourself a target for extremists.</p>

<p>It is much better to go through a purely logical argument route assuming intelligence is 100% upbringing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not what I am debating.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly said I am assuming IQ is based on external factors.</p>

<p>My question is if Africa is currently at a state where the external factors are keeping IQs at a level nearing the western equivalent of retardation.
(not my opinion, the official stats)</p>

<p>How will they be able to change those factors when faced with a quickly rising population while already receiving foreign aid?</p>

<p>The 1st world simply does not have the capabilities to educate that many people, there are already education crisis in some western countries just with their natives.</p>
