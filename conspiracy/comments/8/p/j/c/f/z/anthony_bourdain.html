<p>Not saying this is not the case, but I just had a very good friend&#39;s father commit suicide.  He lived a lavish lifestyle, traveled all the time, and even has a helicopter pad at his beach house. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting at,  is just because money doesn&#39;t make everyone whole, sometimes there are other issues, in my friend&#39;s case, i was severe depression.  Those who knew him well understood the issues he had,  those on the outside looking in just saw a very wealthy attorney with a helicopter. </p>

<p>Perhaps he was severely depressed and killed himself. The number 10 cause of death in the US is suicide. Depression has many masks, the most common one being a fake happy smile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. I&#39;m a type 2 so I should know what I&#39;m talking about because of ya know, 19 years of experience. All I said was that he said he suffered from manic depression. MAJORITY of bi polar people in a cycle of depression have suicidal thoughts. It is possible to hit a low without feeling suicidal. I&#39;m not arguing with you there. Him being manic depressive could explain why he felt low enough to end his own life. Fucking relax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again. You are saying he was manic like that means he was suicidal. As the two are not entangled or exclusive.</p>

<p>You are not the only person who suffers from bi polar disorder. You are the only person in the conversation suggesting you have some kind of special knowledge because of it. </p>

<p>You go ahead and preted you have some kind of higher knowledge. Maybe you should catch up on your meds. </p>

<p>And finally, being manic does not mean you suffer from suicidal thoughts or tendancies. That is seperate, although you are correct, a large number of people with bi polar disorder do suffer from suicidal thoughts and tendancies. But then again, there is a insanly huge number of people who do not, at all, in any way siffer from suicidal tendancies and have bi polar. Enough people to be in the hundreds of thousands. </p>

<p>So just sitting around with your dick in your hands suggesting all bi polar people are suicidal is wrong. And i wish you would shut your fucking mouth. Being bi polar does not inherently make you suicidal. So stop fucking saying it. </p>

<p>Do not say, well he was bi polar. Loke whelp, that explains it. Because NOT ALL BIPOLAR PEOPLE ARE SUICIDAL. </p>

<p>Its like saying you got something stolen and saying whelp he was black. Sure, lots of black people steal, but not all black people are theives. </p>

<p>So dont fucking say it. Take the nasty words out of your fucking mouth and put them somewhere else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Punched in the gut with this news. Loved his work. In terms of travel shows, he was the best. Bourdain was a former heroin addict among other drugs. Even though people can kick it, the tendency remains. Not saying he got hooked again, but it&#39;s possible he had an injury in his martial arts and the doctors got him hooked again on opioids. For a former addict, or even an alcoholic, the descent is swift when picking up again. Depression comes quickly. Not saying that&#39;s what happened, but it&#39;s possible. We never know the private persona of public people, or even people in our lives. I&#39;m grateful for the man&#39;s existence and for the body of work he gave us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in a hospital where people who have fallen off the sobriety wagon pass through all the time. Sometimes they&#39;ve been sober for decades, but people are funny and like you said addiction is a lifelong battle. If one becomes depressed enough they are capable of making all sorts of bad decisions. It&#39;s just a little surprising to me that so many seem to believe Anthony Bourdain would somehow be immune to relapse, even if it were a momentary one. I mean if he was in the state of mind to <em>kill himself</em>, why is it so impossible to consider that he wouldn&#39;t have cashed in his chip as well?</p>

<p>As someone pointed out on this vein, he loved France, may have been his choice of places to go out with dignity and not let some son-a-bitch cancer get the best of him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is in line with my first thoughts. I didn&#39;t think about a diagnosis, but more of him choosing his own time. He loved France maybe he just felt like it was better to go out now than when he couldn&#39;t do what he loved anymore.</p>

<p>A potential diagnosis would fit right in with this. I know if I am diagnosed with terminal cancer I&#39;d end it on my own terms. Makes sense.</p>

<p>The thing is that many people who are manic depressive have suicidal thoughts, but a lot of the time they aren&#39;t suicidal, just ready to die. Which doesn&#39;t sound like much of a difference, but it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there&#39;s really not always some big thing that happened - that&#39;s the point, people commit suicide even when their life looks perfect to others (even when people dig into it). Maybe there&#39;s something obvious that people will point to as a reason for what Bourdain did, but maybe there won&#39;t be. </p>

<p>He&#39;s openly dealt with depression and addiction - what beyond that do you need to explain suicide?</p>
