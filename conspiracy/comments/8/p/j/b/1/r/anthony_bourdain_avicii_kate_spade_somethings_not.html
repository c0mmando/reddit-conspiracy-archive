       Somethings not right. Anthony Bourdain was someone who was so full of life. He literally was in the middle of shooting an episode in France which anyone who reads his book would know he loved. He wouldn’t commit suicide there when he was also with his best friend Eric Ripert. Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but he recently clashed with Weinstein.... this is too coincidental. Devastating but something is incredibly odd

       Dude was very supportive of his partner Asia Argento. She recently came out about Weinstein, at Cannes, to an audience that did not expect that.

       Tony knew too much, for sure. He's hobnobbed with very, very important people.

       How so because we don’t even know the cause of his death yet, only that he was found unresponsive which would suggest drugs. He has a history of drug use although he had stopped taking drugs a long time ago. Also it could be accidental overdose.
Avicii also had a history or drug and alcohol abuse, something that seems to go hand and hand with his industry.
As for Kate Spade I know very little about her but her husband did say she has always been fighting her demons although her suicide was a complete shock.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality is there every anything right about suicide?
      </p>
      <p>
       Harvey Weinstein is a bit of a stretch as many, many, many people have spoken out against him from A listers to small fries.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could simply be lifestyle choices per individual.

       Someone just wrote a commented that they deleted/was deleted but Anthony bourdains girlfriend is Asia Argento. She was a main accuser/charger against wein. These people were openly accused of rape, harassment, wire tapping, threats for coming out with this info.

       And one of her bffs is Rose McGowan, who is (was) openly friends with Bourdain. They both were stalked and intimidated by Weinstein goons and were extremely outspoken about it all. Bourdain was a huge pillar of support to these ladies and others against Weinstein. This doesn’t sit right at all.

       There have been a few celebrities that have decided to hang themselves instead of any other method of death, which is interesting. Chris Cornell recently and before that David Carradine. I’m probably missing a few. But when I heard the news, I wondered what episode Anthony was working on.

       strangulation while supposedly engaged in a sexual act while alone. I was ruled an accident, if i remember correctly.  But his nephew,  actor Robert Carradine, believes otherwise:

       Bourdain hated Trump.  Bourdain was outspoken about it.  See?  Anyone can do it to fit their agenda.  NATO used snipers in Maidan to frame Putin.  Why wouldn't they use "suicides" to get rid of Trump's enemies and frame Weinstein or Clinton or Soros?

       Because no one suspects Trump of having a good enough reason to want to kill Bourdain. Also it seems unlikely that Trump could have coaxed all those celebrities into testifying that Weinstein was a menacing rapist.

       I’m thinking this too. Kate Spade got me. She hanged herself by the doorknob, which seems so difficult and so specific but Robin Williams did the same exact thing? Doesn’t seem right to me. Then this, another hanging. I understand that the suicide rate has gone up and that obviously it would account for some celeb deaths but this is just weird to say the least. I’m not one for conspiracy but this doesn’t sit well with me.

       I feel like very rich people dont need to resort to doing their Erotic asphyxiation in such a dangerous way. IMO, they could either pay someone to help them out with their proclivities, or they could purchase some sort of contraption that still provides Erotic asphyxiation, just under a much safer condition.
In my mind, I cant rule it completely out however just because the rich tend to be thrill seekers who take massive action on the things they like to get where they are now, so if they were into the danger associated with preforming Erotic asphyxiation in such a blatently dangerous way, I could see them doing it for the thrill. The thrill of being on the nedge of losing a wonderful life (from outside perspectives)

       If those photos are real...there should be NO BLOOD when hanged, and your hands would need to be free for masterbation, AND he had a noticeable (recent-looking) scar all the way down from his neck to his groin (doesn't look like an autopsy "V" dissection). WTF?

       I'm not saying that any particular case mentioned here is a result of auto erotic asphyxiation, AEA deathed are a lot more common than most people realize. When I was an EMT 20 years ago we were often asked by family members of the deceased to collude with LEOs on reporting accidental AEA deaths as suicides. It was less embarrassing for the family during an already traumatic time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time the family member who found the victim had already taken pains to clean up any porn, lube and tissue, toys bodily fluids, etc, but it was pretty obvious. Sometimes we'd get there and the victim still had their dick in their hand. Either way, we'd pow-wow with the deputy to make sure our reports were straight. Honestly, it wasn't professional or rely ethical, but this is a small community and tried to protect reputations.

       True. I saw it on a video that is now non existent, and I recall him saying that billionaires are ruining all of our lives, the 1% doesn't give a shit, etc etc. It could be easily explained as a suicidal rant, but why is the video gone? I searched high and low.

       Depending on his tolerance. What you would need to function or not be able to function would be relative to what you've built your tolerance up to. Unless it was enough benzodiazines to kill an elephant I wouldnt think much of it. I'd imagine whatever was in his system was something he had a high tolerance to

       He was in a custody battle with Paula Yates and her husband, Bob Geldof.  It was a very unpleasant situation.  But I wouldn't put it past Geldof to have him killed, or to simply push his buttons knowing he'd been depressed since an earlier head injury that destroyed his olfactory senses.  Hutchence had said that after he lost his sense of smell, he couldn't experience anything he cared about.  He couldn't smell food, he couldn't smell women.  He became depressed after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's far more evidence though that he took his own life than him being murdered.

       Yet I don't have a hard time believing their suicides.  Robin Williams had lifelong depression struggles then was diagnosed with Parkinson's.  Chris and Chester struggled always with depression and drugs.  Not too much of a stretch to believe Carradine was into kink, but I don't know what else he might have been involved with.

       Anthony has brought a LOT of attention to how US policies have had devastating effects on other countries.  He worked to help people.  People listened to him.  To me, this made him a target.  If he stepped too boldly on the wrong toes, a hit could have been taken out on him.

       The Rescuers is a 1977 American animated adventure comedy-drama produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. The 23rd Disney animated feature film, the film is about the Rescue Aid Society, an international mouse organization headquartered in New York City and shadowing the United Nations, dedicated to helping abduction victims around the world at large. Two of these mice, jittery janitor Bernard (Bob Newhart) and his co-agent, the elegant Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor), set out to rescue Penny (Michelle Stacy), an orphan girl being held prisoner in the Devil's Bayou by treasure huntress Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page). The film is based on a series of books by Margery Sharp, most notably The Rescuers) and Miss Bianca.

       I’ve seeen a couple videos of guys hanging them selves from door knobs on watchpeopledie. One of them was even an accident, it’s probably a lot easier than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one that was an accident evens seems like he can easily put his feet on the ground, but once he’s too far into it his arms and legs sort of contort and looks like he loses all control of his body.

       What would be the M.O. behind murdering random celebs and making it look like suicide though? Maybe to glamourize it as a means of population control? At the same time they romanticize it in the media ie that netflix series.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be that the govt realized overpopulation is coming due to all the advances in technology and medicine, so they want to nudge undesirables into offing themselves.. "see, even successful people with great lives do it, so why not you?"

       Its about money and merchandise. Remove the artist and you can take their share too. Most of them are married into the machine as well. Their wives are Mason (no free) stalkers basically. They listen to the Devil and get rewarded for it. The kids too. Anyone seen see the vid of Cornell's Hollywood funeral? Hisnwife is in the front row joking and laughing. They basically become cryptos once they marry in and have kids.

       They would have curbed population growth decades ago if that was their goal. Order in chaos..the more slaves they have the more power they get. They have ways to get rid of mass amounts of people (food and water additives, cancer-causing tech, war, organized crime etc), but if they wanted a certain number of earth residents they would have made the calculations and adjustments ages ago.

       dude look
      </p>
      <p>
       when you get involved with this occult shit, which both of these people were, they all have the one eye stuff, numerous signs of it, they sell their souls to someone/something.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is what it looks like when those people come for your soul at the time of their choosing
      </p>
      <p>
       do you see?
      </p>
      <p>
       you should be scared, they have this much power
      </p>
      <p>
       we are civilians, they are assassins, and it's very difficult to defend yourself against an assassin as a civilian.
      </p>
      <p>
       i suspect but cannot prove that at some point one of a few things happen in these cases, 1. you know too much and are getting mouthy, but really you can probably also just know too much 2. you have something of great value that they want 3. you are a pawn in some other war
      </p>
      <p>
       These are people that potentially made the occult fashions for the secret parties, and to get where they were they had to make certain obligations that made their lives a. secondary to some other organization and b. forfeit under certain conditions
      </p>
      <p>
       i hope this helps

       I think it has to do with the knot. Some knots, if well done, will not be easy to get out of if you tight them enough.

       In some ways yes, maybe you wouldn't want people of unsound mind seeing those instructions. On the other hand, it's arguable that it's a human right to have the knowledge of how to end your own life with a small amount of dignity if that's what someone really wants.

       Why is it disgusting? If someone is going to do it, they’re going to do it; isn’t it best to provide them with knowledge so they don’t fuck it up? I clicked on the link, and it doesn’t look like they’re encouraging suicide at all. In fact, I saw in multiple places suggesting pretty much every assistance method possible and encouraging people to use those first.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are going to do what they want. I think researching the methods is probably the most responsible (if you can consider studying suicide methods “responsible”) way to go about it.

       Yeah this is one I don't understand. Just, how? And even Chris Cornell...he apparently hanged himself on like a towel hook on the bathroom door....like that could hold 130+lbs? And Anthony Bourdain hanged himself in a hotel room...just, how? Hanged from what? What would be strong enough to hang himself by? Maybe a balcony railing, but they haven't disclosed that info.

       You could kill yourself with a rubber band around your neck. A shoe lace tied around your throat. You don't need to physically hang, just put pressure on the arteries or the wind pipe.

       It's well known that people who are exceptionally skilled at making others laugh can be hiding brutal depressing of their own - like Robin Williams. Anthony was likely putting on a similar front - depression isn't like being bored or unhappy, it's a total numbness to life regardless of where you're filming or what you're doing

       I browse the watchpeopledie subreddit from time to time and there's a video of a young man who hanged himself from his doorknob and livestreamed it. It does not take a lot of pressure to cut off circulation to the brain and your torso is easily heavy enough to to the job even if your lower body is touching the floor. All it takes is determination and a couple minutes, sadly. He succeeded in taking his own life.

       Hanging yourself from the doorknob wouldn’t be difficult, just tie a rope to the back side handle and wrap it over the top. What’s the difficult part here? Not discounting this theory but I don’t know if that point supports it.

       Exactly, it's not difficult at all and it's more common than people think it appears. People perhaps query it because they're unaware that the 'suspension' method, such as using a door knob, is death by asphyxiation or via a cutting off of the blood supply to the brain as opposed to the more well known 'drop' method where death is caused via a snapping of the spinal cord.

       I think it peculiar that a woman at the top of her game with kiddos at home would kill herself. In addition, I find it to be an odd coincidence that Kate Spade worked with the Clinton Foundation in Haiti. Maybe they are connected? I could have sworn that someone who work with Hillary in Haiti and worked for Amber Alert was caught smuggling children from Haiti. Something is odd!

       Used to be the case, now depression and suicide are the way to stay out of the spotlight.

       Not true. My sister killed herself 25 years ago. I WILL NEVER ‘just accept(s) suicide.’

       Oh I know exactly what they meant. I was disagreeing with them.👌🏽 Lived through it not only with my sis - but many people over the years. I’m from Seattle and we have a high rate of suicide here. I accept they are dead.
Key word ‘explanation’. You will never truly know why the cause/motivation was. Not with any conviction. You can speculate all you like - the person that could deny or confirm that is dead.

       Watch Turner classic movies right now on optimum channel 68 it features a film that takes place where Anthony died. It’s about the assassination of someone who knew too much.
       <strong>
        The Channel is owned by an elitist billionaire. The movie is called HOTEL RESERVE (1944)

       If the billionaire being referenced is Ted Turner, he's not even part of TW anymore. Hasn't been on board in a decade. And Coleman Breland, the president of TCM, testified in Justice Department trial this spring about AT&amp;T buying TW; Breland testified as a top TW executive. TCM is definitely a property of TW in more than just name.

       Existence is meaningless. I don't blame anyone for skipping to the last page of this bullshit if they aren't enjoying it. That being said, it would be weird for someone who is knee deep in something they find meaningful to kill themselves. I do not doubt there is a very long list of 'suicided' people in the political/power worlds.

       Bourdain has been highly critical of Isreal but in a classy way,  plus growing his influence. I wouldn't be surprised is Mossad had no problem taking him down as a favor to HW.

       He was filming in Lebanon when Israel invaded in 2006. Bourdain did a decent job of using his show as a food critic to shine a light on Zionist aggression and occupation.

       I was dumbfounded hearing that he had died. Like you mentioned, he was in the middle of filming in France for Parts Unknown and he was extremely happy (from what it looked like) with Asia Argento.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, however, Argento was one of the leading causes to bring back up Weinstein’s sexual accusations, which is why he had to turn himself in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could that be correlated? I wouldn’t be fucking surprised.

       But she's not the type to get silenced by threats; she's already proved that.  If she thinks her boyfriend was murdered, that would only make her more vocal plus give her a bigger spotlight.  Or is that the plan, for Q's "glorious week" of assassinations?

       I doubt it's 75 percent at all times. It could reach that high if a post on this sub hits
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .
      </p>

       There is also a subgroup of these anti conspiracy people.
       <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-29/online-conspiracy-theorists-are-more-diverse-28and-ordinary29/9600834">
        From an analysis of this subreddit: A little under 10 percent of /r/conspiracy users are part of a "distinct subgroup who appeared to be posting primarily in order to debunk conspiracy beliefs." They call themselves "skeptics," but they are only skeptical of conspiracy theories.

       Why is no one mentioning the singer of frightened rabbit?

      <p>
       Or the hundreds of civilians (non celebrities I mean) who have committed suicide?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why focus on celebs? You're being distracted. What difference does one less celebrity make? Look after yourself and your friends and family, that's all that's important.

       It may not be rational but it's much more common when people experience major setback's in their life's trajectory. Bourdain's career was still thriving and his girlfriend just succeeded in in sending her rapist, Harvey Weinstein, into the pokey. All reasons to be happy and joyous.

Did Russian based accounts create propaganda? Absolutely.

       The examples the NYT article Inquisitr cites still seem pretty tame compared to what was going on with CTR/JIDF/Chinas 50 Cent Party (

       Lol, a couple million dollars in Facebook ads and trolls is nothing compared to the US intelligence agencies influence online, or the UKs troll armies or the JIDF. BTW, if the t_d shills were so big and powerful they wouldn't be at the bottom of every thread in almost every sub. Trump's polling at 40%, you'd expect there to be MORE  support for him online.
      </p>
      <p>
       The totally "organic and unanimous" hate for him online is way more of a red flag than his support. Imo of course. Also, before it becomes a thing, not American so not a republican (or russian for that matter).

       Keep in mind that of those 40%, a majority of them are 45 or older, while Reddit skews much younger. I wouldn’t expect him to have anywhere near 40% approval on Reddit, simply because the demographics don’t line up.  Reddit also has users from all over the world, and the majority of them don’t have a favorable view of Trump.  So, when you take that 40% approval, then you subtract the older supporters, and you add in the non-American users on the other side, it’s clear that a large majority of Reddit users aren’t going to support him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know how much US, the UK, or anyone else spends on online trolling, but I wonder why you think it’s so much more than the Russians are spending.  As for CTR, I believe they had a budget of $1m, which is much less than this one Russian troll farm.  We also have no idea how many of these Russian troll farms their are, or which other countries are employing these same tactics.  We’ve only indicted one so far, but that doesn’t mean that’s all there are.

       No, it was 10mil in 2016 and went way down after the election, with shareblue doing most of the dirty work these days. Also, I don't think that was for influencing people outside of the US.

       Well, questioning things is fine, but claiming that thing are so and so based on gut feelings and highly circumstantial evidence isn’t.

       I've seen people making huge logical leaps and I'm skeptical by default but I've definitely also seen it happen where people who are simply proposing a theory or asking questions have been pounced on by obnoxious "realists" even when the topic doesn't seem to warrant any such emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, the internet is filled with people just looking for a fight because they had a bad day/week/life but sometimes there will be long sub-threads of multiple concurring parties who are adamantly in opposition of somebody entertaining the possibility of an idea that isn't the official explanation. If it's all just  people with enough free time and alt-accounts to poke their thumb in somebody else's eye, they sure like to do it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet, if the occasional conspiracy theorist or Wikileaks fan were to promote some conspiracy theory that was at least partially truthful or info that was potentially damaging to any one of the millions of public and private organizations out there with ample resources to "look out for their own interests", it certainly would be beneficial for them to categorically discredit the bearers of such topics as lunatics with some strategic false flag trolling and sarcastic counterpoints.

       As problematic as the concept is, we need a way to hold the reputation of information sources accountable. Elon Musk has the right idea. Sure, the idea of 'grading' journalists raises more concerns and questions, as it should, but the unchecked freedom of bullshit model of information sharing isn't working either.

       It depends on what the truth is, who it involves, and how it's happening. Laws have been effectively passed to curb unethical/evil behavior. A hardened cynic might scoff at that but the system has worked in the past. If the system itself is the obstacle, there are many things that can be done ranging from raising awareness with disciplined critical thinking and communication skills and methods that pass the knee-jerk skepticism test, to concerted legal action or other circumstantially justified methods.

       I understand what you're saying and completely agree but in the sense of the bigger picture where average people have to work jobs that basically enslave them to the system that is upheld by many of these 'conspiracies' it is very difficult to do any of those things. I put conspiracies in parenthesis because much of what people consider conspiracy is just plain fact.

       Is your goal for people to find
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       truth or is it for people to be engaged in finding truths? If you can recognize that it's difficult for others to find truth because of a "muddled" environment, I think the most useful thing you can do is accept that this handicap applies to you as well and to approach any "truth" with humility.

       A good conspiracy theory can withstand questions from skeptical people.  I pride myself on trying to be skeptical in all things and to seek out more information than just whatever my echo chamber is telling me.
      </p>
      <p>
       At heart conspiracy theorists, ideally, are smart people who will ponder and test a theory.  I don't drink the MSM kool-aid but I don't dismiss it out of hand.  Same with a lot of the theories here, even the ones I want to believe.
      </p>

       But then again I'm the only liberal I know who goes to The_Donald a lot to try to see what the other side of the various Trump stories is, for example.

       It's also a literal chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters in your brain, commonly suspected as a low amount of serotonin and possibly dopamine. Are you done pretending to be a doctor?

       Are you done pretending to talk about depression when you clearly have no experience with it? It's not just the chemicals in your brain suddenly lacking. It's solely triggered by environmental factors. A lack or serotonin and dopamine is what happens when you become depressed and sad

       I don't think you're right. I'd be willing to say that there is absolutely an element of chemical imbalance in the brain. Isn't that what psychiatry is based upon? Using drugs to help correct those kinds of imbalance.

       True, i try to explain this to ppl and they dont seem to understand it. Chemical imbalance Is a smaller portion of the cases of depression then they want you to believe its mostly environmental, life style, life situation, health etc

       Just because people look happy when the cameras are rolling, doesn’t mean they aren’t deeply depressed and troubled on the inside.  Just because people are rich and famous and successful doesn’t mean they want to continue living. Sometimes people kill themselves, it’s called depression and is a sad reality of life.

       This is a great response. Depression is the silent killer and it doesn't get nearly enough attention in our society. Really mental health in general. I think a lot of things like suicides and shootings are manifestations of both depression and mental health issues. This post proves how foreign depression looks to the average person. OP can only explain it by expressing the feeling that "something is off."

       I have been treated for depression by the VA, never once did they test my neurotransmitters to see if they were low. They just give out pills without addressing th cause.

       But yet they will constantly prescribe pill to mess with levels they have never measured. Keto diet, eliminating nutritional deficiencies, anti-inflammatory supplements could have merit. It certainly changed my life more than years of Wellbutrin and clonazepam ever did.

       Sure - physical health, proper diet and exercise, can have robustly beneficial effect on mental health , but it isn't entirely fair to demean our current health system based on this particular limitation (CNS neurotransmitter levels)

       I am just expressing my personal experience. As I said, don't follow the medical advice of reddit assholes without checking with your Doctor.
This is what really made me drop them, that some of them can contribute to dementia. Dementia is on the rise so sharply some would say that is a conspiracy theory on its own. Leading cause of death in the UK now.

       I think injecting young kids with aluminum if a stupid thing to do, I won't be taking any vaccines with that shit or mercury in it. But it really doesn't matter if chemtrails are real and they really are spraying us with nano-particle aluminum. If your kids don't have autism they will have early onset Alzheimer's to look forward to.

       Clinical depression if we want to be specific. Non-clinical depression is still a mental health issue, but it's not necessarily a brain disorder. Just like it was fashionable for some time to say you were "totally OCD" because you just had to keep everything clean or because you decided that some numbers made you feel awkward.. lots of people say they are depressed when they are just sad/down. Depression is fairly permanent. It can be mitigated, but it you stop mitigation it returns.

       What options exist for people who refuse clinical treatment? They can self-medicate, but that comes with a huge expense. I think they should just legalize all drugs and let people choose whatever they like.

       Everything on TV is there to program you.  These actors are part of the programming.  They are doing what they have been ordered to do.  I think some of them get overwhelmed by the evil they are participating in and surrounded by so they take the only way out they know: suicide.

       It’s selfish to expect a person to live in absolute misery and hopelessness for the sake of others. I understand he had a child so it makes it even more complicated. Depression is an awful illness for those with it and their loved ones, but imagine how much pain a person needs to be in to choose to end their own life. It’s selfish to force him to live in constant pain just to please others (pain isn’t only physical, but can be emotional too). Have some respect. Clearly your trolling so I don’t think this comment will mean anything to you, but hopefully it gives someone another perspective.

       I appreciate the perspective.  Having lost a family member to suicide makes this a touchy subject.  Easy to get angry.

       I understand. It’s not fair, but neither is depression. Please don’t insinuate it’s always a selfish decision. Shits complicated. Life’s complicated. I’m sorry you had to go through that. You certainly deserved better, but your mom was sick. Not saying it’s ok, but it’s a fucked up illness. I hope you’re doing ok.

       How can you assume to know so much of someone you know nothing of (me) because I asked a question? Says a lot about you beloved. I bet you didn’t even think about it as a possibility. It was just a thought that crossed my mind sir. Don’t hit me.

       Wow that’s a serious generalization.  Serious question.  Do you believe EVERY celebrity, tv personality, etc is “IN” on this mass programming or that they are just compliant but guilty nonetheless?  If so, how far does it go?  Local TV?  Radio personalities? Sports figures? Genuinely interested in your opinion.

       Some people can counteract depression with behavior changes. Others have depression as a result of some other illness that requires medication. Other just need antidepressants.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's best for some isn't best for others, proper medication can be as life changing as a lifestyle change.

       You know, I have been on medication for that before (wrongly diagnosed back when they handed that shit out even more freely in the 90’s) only to years later finally talk about it with a doctor when antidepressants were mentioned as a possibility for another thing and
       <em>
        finally
       </em>
       have someone listen and realize that the side effects I had complained about with SSRI’s were a
       <em>
        contraindication
       </em>
       for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Feeling “on-edge” and jittery, racing heart, compulsive fidgeting and restless leg syndrome
       <em>
        are all symptoms of Serotonin poisoning
       </em>
       !!  As in, my serotonin levels were fine and the SSRI’s made them too high.  That is a huge problem with the method of prescription that is simply “if you exhibited x/10 of these symptoms of depression, take the pills and see if it helps.”

       Been there too. Serotonin syndrome sucks. Docs finally did a GMAP and realized that SSRIs were the last thing I should have been taking. Issue was a genetic dietary issue and a sleep thing. Docs are too quick in prescribing meds without studying the problem before hand.

       Thanks.  It is embarrassing the few times I buy gluten free bread items.  Not because I am on a diet but because that has become so associated with idiotic hipster diet fads, lol.  But the difference is marked.  Generally I try to simply avoid it entirely by eating meat and fresh greens.

       the only upside to that is the quality. I was diagnosed with celiacs at about a decade ago and the gluten free options were pretty limited. the fad diets have made that selection massive now, and the quality is so much better. specifically bread, it used to be so hard to find good gluten free bread. it was all so thick and dense and tasted horrible.

       It gets the wrap for being a fad, but intolerance is so widespread and growing. Makes one wonder if the non-celiac intolerance symptoms for many people could be originating from glyphosate in a majority of mass produced wheat (and other grains). It seems to be the source of my intolerance.

       It's not a trend. The idea that it's a trend instead of a massive global health issue to me is a conspiracy probably by groups like Monsanto.

      <p>
       It's a massive epidemic, people in the 20-30s have their digestive system completely fucked from eating poison for decades and we just take more poison in form of pills (ask celiac people) to counter the symptoms of our poisoning.

       Let me correct that to say that
       <em>
        gluten free (food item)
       </em>
       is the trend.  And just like artificial sweeteners, I am skeptical of gluten free bread being any healthier.  That is why I chose to simply cut out carbs almost entirely along with gluten (nothing to lose but favorite foods and plenty of health benefits to gain beyond mere relief of gluten symptoms).
      </p>

       I compare it to “vegetarian hot dogs”, why eat fake meat that is engineered at some processing place when you could simply eat fresh produce!?

       Oh I'm not saying gluten is bad. We used to eat that without problem but somehow now many people react to it very badly. Some studies start to point fingers at pesticides and other gut-bleaching stuff as culprit. We'll see.
      </p>

       Gluten free just means it's made with other ingredients than wheat. Seriously if you don't have the symptoms there's no reason for you to eat gluten free stuff. Gluten isn't the problem. The intolerance is a symptom of something else going fucky.

        why eat fake meat that is engineered at some processing place

       Well, assuming one likes vegetarian hot dogs, why
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       eat them? What do you have against engineering and food processing? Meatless products like the one you mentioned are made out of plants, and "processing" a plant doesn't magically transform it from good and nutritious to bad and unhealthy. Do you think chopping up broccoli makes the broccoli unhealthy? Chopping it is processing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just curious, are you also anti-GMO?

       My thought is based on many of the “vegetarians” I have known who I don’t think ever let a fresh vegetable touch their plate unless it was a condiment on a hamburger, and, oddly, most of those who ate veggie burgers/dogs took theirs with “meat” and cheese only.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the processing, given my general cynicism towards processed foods in general, I err on the side of assuming the more processing is done to the food the more unhealthy it becomes.  This obviously would not apply to making one yourself.  Any unhealthy processed food can be made healthily at home.  How much trust do you place in a food manufacturer
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to add chemicals, sugar, salt and preservatives to something just because it is vegetarian!?

       I don’t really have strong opinions about GMO’s from a
       <em>
        health
       </em>
       perspective but am very anti GMO from a
       <em>
        agricultural
       </em>
       perspective.  We have already seen that GMO’s act as invasive species (something hat Monsanto no doubt was always aware of when they decided to sue farmers whose fields their crops infested, making GMO’s the perfect weapon for pushing out any competition from smaller farmers).  We will have to find out how GMO’s do in the long run against pests, because it functions as an invasive species there is
       <em>
        a significant risk
       </em>
       of these crops becoming a monoculture which is extremely unwise (read about bananas).

       Some people think its a gluten problem but they are actually having a reaction to the glyphosate that is sprayed on the wheat(or oats, or sugar cane, etc...). I have seen some people post about how organic wheat doesn't both them. They spray glyphosate on so much shit these days its almost impossible to avoid it.

       Yup, I don’t bother with “gluten free” bread and bullshit.  Cheaper and healthier just to replace carbs with greens.  I know it isn’t (my understanding) of full keto, but I have changed my diet to primarily meat and veggies, lots of salads for fast lunches.  I feel healthier (even if partially a placebo) and don’t have that overfull, bloated feeling that bread and greasy food gives.  People who buy gluten free bread strike me as the same version of absurd as “vegetarians” who buy fake meat products rather than just enjoy the staggering variety of flavors actual vegetables provide.

       I never in several different times trying different SSRI’s had any suicidal thoughts, I don’t really think I even noticed any mental changes at all really, maybe more easily distracted or excited.  My reactions were exclusively physical.  Nervous energy, unable to sit still, restless legs, tapping fingers compulsively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did sort of feel “on edge” and i suppose that counts as mental, but it was the kind of on edge one feels when they drink way too much coffee or energy drinks and went along with that same feeling in my body, it was never a mental thing independent of physical.

       Hmm this is interesting, as I started taking Zoloft for anxiety and while it seems like it leveled me out a bit, I still definitely feel on edge, and a bounce my leg all day at work (although I think I may have done this forever).
      </p>
      <p>
       I should probably get my levels tested, as I got Zoloft after I turned down a Xanax prescription prescribed without ever talking to a psychiatrist and speaking to this doctor for 15 min.

       It is important to note that I am not saying
       <strong>
        at all
       </strong>
       that SSRI’s are bullshit every time, I know people for whom they were a revelation.  They just are overprescribed and too many doctors seem oblivious to problems from too much serotonin.  Maybe, if they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       helping you, talk to your doc about reducing the dose?

       Btw, I am only sharing my experience and things I learned from talking to my GP and researching online, I am not in any way a healthcare expert.  Don’t take my word as anything more than an anecdote with suggestions to talk to your doctor about (or to seek a second opinion if your doctor doesn’t take your concerns seriously).

       Haha no worries man, it’s just something to keep in mind cuz like you said, doctors prescribe these without really doing too much due diligence. I probably should talk to them about lowering the dose too, as i think it’s like 50mg. Not extreme but a bit high.

       Cool.  I see too many medical advice threads that may or may not have good advice, or at least advice that helped the OP, but they post them as if they are some medical authority who has all the answers and often are outright hostile toward medical professionals.  Hopefully most people take them with a grain of salt, or at least follow the advice but continue to have a medical doctor also, that could be dangerous for people who may take it as absolute fact (which is how they present it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, plenty of doctors prescribe by rote and are influenced by pharma reps, this just means a person must also learn about things and be actively involved with their doctor, if that is met with a negative reaction from the doctor, they should find a different one.  Despite the problems of overprescribing, the simple things are super important that can only be done by a medical professional such as blood tests and other lab work.  More people just need to learn how to “take control” and ask for specific ones if they have reason to believe it would shed light on health issues, and expect the doctor, if they don’t want to do a test, to explain why they don’t think it is needed or relevant.

       <em>
        none

       of these treatments are harmful and they are basically all beneficial whether they solve your issue or not.

There really wasn’t much that I couldn’t have done myself if pointed in the right direction.

        However, none of the DIY treatments like diet and yoga replace having actual blood work done to make sure the issue isn’t an actual medical issue!!

       I think that most blood panels test it.  After you get lab work done, they
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       send you a copy of the results either with the bill or on its own.  You doctor’s office can also provide you with the results if you request it.  Even if you don’t know what the results mean (my doctor’s office usually has a scale for this like good, bad, average after the result, you can also google them) the paperwork will list everything that was tested and (in the USA) you are fully entitled to a copy (I think they must provide one but it would be easy to toss out unintentionally).
      </p>
      <p>
       It should looks like:
      </p>
      <p>
       Red blood cell count xxxxxxx ng/ml
Cholesterol (several types) xxxxxxxx ng/ml
Liver enzyme xxxxxxx ng/ml
Sodium xxxxxxx ng/ml
      </p>
      <p>
       And so on, each thing tested should be listed and have the result.  And you can always ask for specific tests, be sure to explain
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       you want that test and such with your doctor and listen if they say that they dont think it is needed and consider what they say.  If you insist, especially on something simple like a blood test, generally they will order it even if they think it isn’t necessary (not particularly expensive and no risk to you by doing it).

       I hear you - I encountered years of un-diagnosable mild neurological problems Finally discovered that the cheap poly mattress I had been sleeping on was the source due to super sensitivity to flame retardant chemicals. BTW, these are bad for almost everyone and are in most low-mid, even expensive mattresses due to CA law (Which changed finally in 2014, but so recently).

       Does this include memory foam?

       I don’t think that is my issue, but who knows what kind of chemicals they are leaching into us even if we don’t have symptoms.

       Think it depends on the brand and type of foam compound. TB117 is the CA Law from the 70s that required flame retardant treatments so most manufacturers just complied for all products. The infuriating and major hurdle is that there is no law or regulation forcing makers to reveal what the poly has been treated with. If it was manufactured in Asia you can be sure it was also treated with a healthy dose of industrial anti fungicides. In short, it's the VOC off gassing inside rooms which poses the threat. It accumulates over time (years) and does not dissipate. Never open one from the vac-seal indoors. RIP AB btw, terrible loss, will be missed.

       Jesus, yes.  The number of people who say things about depression like “just eat healthy and lift some weights” or “take up marathining  and eat less gluten” as though those are cures for it, appears to be unlimited.

       Ugh, get over yourself. If you feel like you aren't deserving of what you have then act in a way in which you are. You are your toughest critic, nobody cares about your efforts like you do. Either accept that people just want mediocrity (because most people aren't even good at what they do) or step up to do an amazing job.

       I know someone with imposter syndrome. It is almost (or maybe it is?) a form of paranoia. I don't think it is something that someone can just snap out of. That's like telling someone that hears voices to just tell them to go away.

       Just because you're satisfied being mediocre and not trying to reach doesn't mean the rest of us are. That leads to a bit of uncertainty. Pushing forward is hard, and scary. If you're 100% confident that you're doing everything right then you're either an idiot or woefully underachieving.

       People say this but it's so empty. There is absolutely no way to know that it will get better and I was right to think things would only get worse over the past 5 years. When does it get better? 10 years? 20? People need to stop saying that phrase imo because it's complete bullshit that gives nothing but baseless false hope.

       Research social defeat.  People who are losers and mean nothing can trigger deep sense of isolation and withdrawal - physiologically - because of how we evolved.  One such response is the loss of the *ability* to perceive future happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really have to have faith, like you have to connect to a future logically without the emotional anticipation.  It's tough.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a key thing is to realize *it's not you*.  Your brain is telling you you're the problem, but that's just a pre-programmed reaction due to evolution (again, triggered by assholes who don't matter).  When you realize "oh shit, I'm not actually the problem here", it give a little room to see the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       Writer's block freezes many. Maybe you need to start thinking about a world where you would be supremely comfortable living in, no matter how fanciful it may seem. Better yet, work on thought experiments of how to deal with the problems you foresee; although it may not fix it should you actually get in said situation, you'll at least be going at it with some confidence and inspire someone else there with you, or it might help you see something you wouldn't have otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with staying in now, arguably it's always now, now is always extra time when compared to the abyss of no time (i.e. nonexistence, absence of reality), and the future is just another now which will be congruent.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr well, you might be blind, but what else were you planning on doing?

       I hear you, my dude. I have found - at least for me - something that helps combat this feeling of existential inertia is to be taken outside of myself --- to focus on volunteering, finding a cause that I believe in and just doing my little part to help here and there. It gives me a sense of purpose and accomplishment and a reason to plod on. Another thing that helps me - depending on how bad the depression is going - is working on a creative hobby (though I know depression can just sap all motivation), mainly because a creative hobby offers an end product you can see and say "I made that!" Could be anything from cooking to crocheting to coloring. Another helping means -- going outside. Breathing in the air, soaking up some vitamin D, and just being among some plant life feels good - bonus points if it's by a nice quiet stream. Finally, not sure of your living arrangements, but I really miss having a dog. I can't have one at the moment because of my arrangements, but when I did have one, a furry cuddle and play time would always comfort me, and it helped knowing that I had a friend who loved me unconditionally. If you're not a dog person, maybe a cat, or some other domesticated animal, is worth considering for companionship (unless you're just not an animal person).
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, it's okay if some days you don't have the energy to do anything but survive. You can handle this, I believe in you.

       And on the other end of the spectrum you have chumps like me who are depressive and anxious... I'm mostly anxious because I think too much about my future.. I'd pay good money to be blind.. to be unable to see myself in any future. Better as a surprise anyway.

       I do not care what anyone tells you. You are important. You matter. Everything you do effects others. Even the most simple things you do can have a huge impact on the world regardless if you can see it. So give everything 100 percent because you never know how big of a positive or negative impact you have someone. All your shots matter. You just have to accept it.

       Yeah. I'm sorry but I just don't see this man killing himself. Most of the things he said like this about wanting to live came directly from him without being asked so its not like he was trying to cover up for his depression.  When people are depressed and thinking about killing themselves they usually don't say those types of things unless being asked. At least in my experience

       Sebastien Junger's Tribe - great book, powerful, easy, brief read. cant recommend it enough. its like someone telling you a truth youve always known but had forgotten
      </p>
      <p>
       excerpt:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "There’s no use arguing that modern society isn’t a kind of paradise. The vast majority of us don’t, personally, have to grow or kill our own food, build our own dwellings or defend ourselves from wild animals and enemies. In one day we can travel a thousand miles by pushing our foot down on a gas pedal or around the world by booking a seat on an airplane. When we are in pain we have narcotics that dull it out of existence, and when we are depressed we have pills that change the chemistry of our brains. We understand an enormous amount about the universe, from subatomic particles to our own bodies to galaxy clusters, and we use that knowledge to make life even better and easier for ourselves. The poorest people in modern society enjoy a level of physical comfort that was unimaginable a thousand years ago, and the wealthiest people literally live the way gods were imagined to have.
       </p>
       <p>
        And yet."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       description
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We have a strong instinct to belong to small groups defined by clear purpose and understanding--"tribes." This tribal connection has been largely lost in modern society, but regaining it may be the key to our psychological survival.
       </p>
       <p>
        Decades before the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin lamented that English settlers were constantly fleeing over to the Indians-but Indians almost never did the same. Tribal society has been exerting an almost gravitational pull on Westerners for hundreds of years, and the reason lies deep in our evolutionary past as a communal species. The most recent example of that attraction is combat veterans who come home to find themselves missing the incredibly intimate bonds of platoon life. The loss of closeness that comes at the end of deployment may explain the high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by military veterans today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Combining history, psychology, and anthropology, TRIBE explores what we can learn from tribal societies about loyalty, belonging, and the eternal human quest for meaning. It explains the irony that-for many veterans as well as civilians-war feels better than peace, adversity can turn out to be a blessing, and disasters are sometimes remembered more fondly than weddings or tropical vacations. TRIBE explains why we are stronger when we come together, and how that can be achieved even in today's divided world.

       Had the discussions with some friends recently
      </p>
      <p>
       I wondered if the "Italian way of life" is "superior" to that of other Western countries. The stronger focus on family, with people living together longer et cetera and a more "relaxed" approach to things.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is some irony when countries like Germany ( where I am from ) belittle the more southern countries for their lifestyle and missing wealth while they appear to be on average happier. And well what is life about if not happiness?
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe it is the sun, who knows...

       Understudied thematic, we invest billions into pills and stuff instead of learning how to live properly.

       i think its clear that by some measures countries like the united states are doing much better than others, they do tend to miss some fundamentally human things, and mental health stats reflect it
      </p>
      <p>
       at a certain point, access to more resources doesnt lead to more happiness. we need enough of the necessities (food, shelter,water), after that we need the things that make us actually want to be alive

       I always thought it is funny that some people have decided which "measurements" are good and which not. For example there is a strong focus on GDP, what does the poor person care about GDP. It is meaningless if there is a big wealth gap, yet people focus on it like it is the definitive way to judge the success of a country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things like "happiness" median disposable income et cetera would be far more relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe money in itself is far less relevant than we think. Like you said. Maybe sitting in a big group eating dinner for 90 minutes helps more than money in the back. But who knows. Hard to quantify such things.

       In theory, this would lead to solving the scarcity problem and freeing up time of people to do what they want but if the last 100 years have shown us anything then that this will not happen. The 40 hour week was introduced as a step forward long ago and still, 40 hours is the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a mathematical standpoint, there is no logical explanation why people should work 40 hours to solve needs that were solved by 40 hour weeks with far less efficiency. It is an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As dumb as it sounds Star Trek had a nice "utopic" vision of this but unlikely that it turns out that way. There are still people dying because they have no money. And we have a lot of stuff..... So don't expect to much from the future.

       this is so true and i hadnt even considered it. but the obvious answer is that OF COURSE companies will milk all they reasonably can from us for as little compensation as they can provide. i think its time for the 4 day work week, and we should reevaluate in maybe 20 years.

       The problem is the "money". In theory, such approaches would require redistribution of "wealth". But, whoever is in charge, has done a good job riling people up against this so we are likely stuck with the system. When robots will produce most of the stuff you still will see people scraping by. I assume the status quo in power distribution is considered beneficial by those who make the "decisions" so I don't expect this to change anytime soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about the utter obscenity that people die because they can't pay for shit while we churn out stuff 100 times more efficient than 100 years ago. Makes no sense whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always assumed that different socio-economic classes are good for power status quo because you can make the work against each other. Lower class thinks the middle class is the problem and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows maybe a "problem free" world will result in even more problematic for people. After all, like you said earlier on, there is some benefit to the daily struggle.

       I disagree.  The reverse is probably true.  We are made for a life of not working.  There is no rat race in nature, but now we're all in our hamster wheels with no end to it.

       People would have been happier in hunter-gatherer societies.  They eat when they need to eat, and just hang out the rest of the time without stress or societal pressure.

       you said you disagreed then agreed with me. im not advocating for a rat race. im advocating for doing meaningful shit. if you are pushing to meet your quota for selling pharmaceuticals you are doing it wrong.

       if you are going to haiti to build houses you are doing it right. the problem is that society has incentivized the wrong behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if they paid 6 figures to build houses for your neighbors, and paid a 3 digit tax write off for poisoning your neighbors.
      </p>

       fuck, if they paid them equally guess what job listing would remain vacant and which one would be at capacity?

       I disagree with this.  The reason for high suicide is the rat race that has taken us away from our evolutionary purpose of hanging out in small communities and freely fucking everyone without worry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you're enlightened and fortunate enough to be able to step out of the rat race, you're still part of society and its norms and expectations.  You can't easily live as a free lovin' vagabond, even if you can afford to buy that life for yourself.  It still comes with strings, and connections to other people who are stuck in the rat race.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have created a society that doesn't allow us to be happy.  You can try to find meaning within the rat race and if you're lucky you can survive without selling your soul to the devil, but you can never escape it or its effects.

       you dont agree that its built for survival? survival depends on constantly doing the right things
      </p>
      <p>
       you are rewarded for maintaining your shelter, providing your food, helping those in your tribe
      </p>
      <p>
       happiness assumes you will reach a state where this is no longer neccessary and you can just relax endlessly. but if youve ever been on vacation for too long youll realize your brain stops rewarding you for this. you want to get back to something more meaningful.

       thats what i meant. hunter gatherers are working for survival but have more leisure time than we do. they arent working for retirement. theyre working for dinner, and maybe this season

       I think survival is far easier than what we're doing now.  Look at bonobos or gorillas.  They survive with minimal effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of "constantly doing the right things" only makes sense in a post-agriculture world when there's a value in surplus.  Time becomes a resource in a way it isn't for many mammals.

       its not about being easier. nobody would say surival is easier! the ease and comfort is why we're sad. do you think depression is a problem amongst tribal peoples living in jungles hunting for their dinner and staving off predators?

       This is what I'm disagreeing with.  You think the need for survival has built in us this constant need to do.  I say it's the opposite.  Survival is easy, and resulted in a preference to do little more than leisure activities.  Most people aren't experiencing ease and comfort, and even people who can afford to live a life of leisure are still stuck in the trappings that come with having the wealth to afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Living today is not easy.  We did not evolve to think about anything more than eating fruit and fucking in a garden all day.

       our brains are wired not just from the last 1000 years of civilization, but from our years as homo erectus, habilus, some sort of chimp/bonobo hybrid, and further beyond. we were soft, easy prey for many predators. our psychology is built to keep us alive. we did this by trooping up
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no doubt that humans are safer than ever before. this tale can be told by the population growth and mortality rate. we are not built for this safety. humans treat social anxiety the same as we treat survival anxiety
      </p>
      <p>
       even though some people have it worse than others, nearly nobody is being preyed upon by tigers or bears, or dying from snake bites, or even dying from starvation. that is what i mean by easy
      </p>
      <p>
       i am not discounting modern day difficulties, i guess i am defining 'easy' differently.

       Hunter-gatherer societies were constantly working. Far more work than we do today. In fact, we do less work in modern times than ever before in human history, and the amount of work we'll need to do will be far lower in the future due to automation.

       Probably why the suicide rate in the trans community is so high, in addition to the constant harassment they endure.  You finally go through with an expensive and troublesome surgery, you fill up with hormones, you change your name.  You're now the right gender, but it's still not enough because you can never capture the experience of growing up with your correct gender.  You can make yourself a woman, but you can't experience your first father-daughter dance, your first period, etc.  For many, they'll never be able to have what they want and when they exhaust their options and realize they still don't feel woman or man enough, they give up.

       Right, he's an ex-heroin addict who was on methadone for years. You don't really get back to normal after that. I wouldn't be surprised if he was still hitting pills here and there.

       Also, depression isn't necessarily about what is happening in your life currently. Everything could be going swimmingly and it still doesn't change the way you feel inside. If you have clinical depression, it's all about how your brain perceives the world.

       Bourdains suicide doesn’t really surprise me that much. Last year I watched every show he was in and even a few documentaries on him. He had a substance abuse problem all his life. He admitted he was suicidal when he was in his 20s and shooting up heroin. He knocked the heroin but picked up drinking, and he DRANK hard. There were even a few episodes that aired and he wasn’t in them bc he was either too drunk or too hungover. His substance abuse got the best of him -took the joy out of life when you’re too focused on getting your joy from liquor or drugs. I’m not surprised. Rip.

       Skimmed through that article. Was he poisoned and positioned to look like a suicide ? Sounds like someone had it out for him because of whatever he said. Sick people trynna cover up a big problem and they're taking anybody out that's trynna expose them.

       I find it hard to believe the guy killed himself.
He has been brutally honest on episodes he has done in the past about his addiction and inner demons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he has openly talked about his issues....dont make sense he would keep this mental problem to himself and not seek help and kill himself.

       I understand what you’re saying, but I too am very open with those around me about my mental health struggles and I have a great and understanding support system in my life yet I STILL think about killing myself every single day. And not in a casual way - I imagine how I will kill myself, I imagine exactly what it will feel like, I go through the steps in my head that would take me from this moment to being willfully dead. I wonder about what kind of hallucinations I’ll experience as my brain shuts down and if it will be a happy experience. It’s not something based on logic or “making sense.” It’s an insidious feeling that lurks in the mind of every depressive personality

       Unfortunately being outwardly happy/stable/successful isn’t an indicator of good mental health. 
Avicii was I’ll
Kate Spade has always struggled with MH and said she was prioritising the brand which is distinctly unhealthy
Anthony has had a hectic life for decades, yes he was clean, but that never really leaves you. 
I have a great job, friends, family, girlfriend and yet I also struggle with my mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get the desire to question, but unfortunately there is a reason that the thing that is most likely to kill you before you hit 40 is yourself or a car.

       We did not know him. We cant say if suicide was in his character or not. We also cant say if he was likley to die from an overdose or not. We also cant say if he was likley to be killed by the deep state or not. We dont know the guy.

       I don't think every suicide is cover up, but I do think we need to take in consideration that celebrities live in a very different world with a very different set of rules, and not everything we're told/see may be the truth.

       This is true. And then she went on to date him (Weinstein). This is very confusing to me. Obvs Weinstein is a creep, but why would you ever willingly f*ck your rapist, let alone date him?

       He was suicided on Barbara Bush’s 93rd birthday. To someone “in the know” that should be all you need to know. Thelemites are a particular type of satanist (Crowleyism) and B.B. was the daughter of The Beast himself (Aleister Crowley). I assumed “they” would plot a mass murder today, but sacrificing a “star” is one of their calling cards, so I’m inclined to believe they tied up some loose ends by sacrificing him on a such sacred day as this to blue-blooded Thelemites.

       Depression is a complex thing. Also,even though it looks fun on camera traveling all around the world, I'm sure it becomes stressful and tiring after awhile. Never sleeping in your own bed or being away from your family. He also actively spoke about his depression and substance abuse. I remember reading somewhere that one of his favorite things was coming home and actually putting his clothes in his own washer and dryer and the peace it gave him to just sit there and watch his clothes dry. So my guess is him battling depression and trying to stay clean mixed with the high demand of his show and traveling constantly might have lead him to a breaking point. Still was very shocking and disturbing news. He will be greatly missed.

       &gt; Anthony Bourdain was someone who was so full of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should really read more of his writing and interviews. He was constantly in search of life because something was missing. He was not a "happy" person, he was a sad person who directed his drug-fueld thrill seeking behaviors into something more constructive.

       Bourdain was a heavy drinker with a lifetime of substance abuse issues... You could say he was “full of life” in reference to the great passion he had in doing what he did, but the writing was right there on the wall as far as him being a troubled man.

       Oh come on. Anthony Bordain was 'their' wet dream. I loved the guy, he was great, but to think 'they' would want him dead is ridiculous. He was all about embracing other cultures, travelling, spending time eating instead of being productive.. these are all part of the globalist agenda, and while he most likely had no idea how much he was helping, he sure as hell did!
      </p>
      <p>
       There was nothing to 'silence' or kill - he was doing a great job of convincing people they should spend their pocket money traveling, mingling with other cultures and eating. Thats what (((they))) want.

       HERE'S WHAT GOING ON; People are killing themselves or "dying" because they are privy to a world-ending event that is coming soon, likely the Extra-terrestrial invasion that's been built up and hinted at. They don't want to face what is about to happen, because it will be worse than what we depict in movies of alien invasions. It won't be a war, it will be an outright annihilation of all life on earth. There's a reason these things are kept from us, because the truth is too terrifying to handle. These are the large Reptilians that are coming, and possible a few other hostile races.

       Man I just took the most epic trip to see the solar eclipse last year and life was looking up. While the moon was about to hit C2, I had an intrusive thought, "now would be a great time to do it." Fuck me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The struggle is real. It eats at my psyche every day. All it would take is the wrong string of bad news and dealing with shitty people, and I don't know what I would be capable of.... Even all the therapy, pills, and good in one's life couldn't stop a determined-to-end-it-all type when the shit hits the fan.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I vowed to myself, if I was literally standing at the end of the rope or looking down the barrel, I'm throwing all the shit in my life away and running. Perhaps that's easier said than done when in the moment. The mere thoughts have a way of causing self destruction, leading to pain and suffering. Running would only cause guilt, pain, and suffering. Or would it? I don't know. But where would I go? What am I doing to myself?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fucking madness and mayhem in the space between my ears. But you'd never know. You'd see me zoned out or something and ask if I'm okay, but you would never know the philosophical debate I just had with the asshole in my head. I would simply reply to you, "I'm okay," while internally I'm saying, "Why would I tell you the shit that just went down in my head? It's dumb." But it's not. It's real. It's silly when all is kind of manageable, but when you hit that wall at the dead end, you really dwell on the 'dead' and the 'end' and that doing it feels right.
      </p>
      <p>
       When these high profile suicides occur, I can't help but think how fucked I am and that even if I get my ducks in a row, that asshole in my head will never be satisfied until I force myself to shut him up... permanently. You can run, you can hide, and you can change your life til you achieve all the greatest feats of wonder you ever imagined. But that asshole is still there. He doubts you and knows your deepest darkest secrets, regrets, and fears. He reminds you and shows you the black hole you can crawl into to escape. What lure will he use to get me to jump in? I don't know for sure, but there no harder mental chore than clinging onto the edge of that hole and pulling yourself out of it while the asshole in your head wants you to let go. And you gotta do this everyday... every. single. day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love my life and am proud of my accomplishments and have great people in it and things to look forward to. But sometimes the call of the void is tempting and sometimes I do rash and destructive things to justify the need to do it later. "What the fuck, asshole," is something I think all the time. That fucker makes this thing called life a huge challenge. In the end, either he wins or I live my life with him and I win. Either way life is filled torment until it's over.

       It's like there is a hole in your soul and no matter what you do to fill it up, it always feels empty. I drink myself to death almost every night, then I can snap out of it for a few days, and then right back to the bottle. It fills the hole up just enough for me to enjoy the life around me, but I'm drunk, peering through a window from the back of my head, not one bit happy, but content because the alcohol makes everything feel better. Then I pass out, and wake up and that hole is empty again, I'm heavily hung over, I'm angry at myself, and I want to fill that hole with something joyful, but nothing fits but the alcohol. I sit outside in the morning smoking a cigarette as my head pounds, my body aches, and I drink to stop it, and the hole fills up. I sit and I think about how I could possibly be happy with what I have, I have what many strive for, great kids doing wonderful in school, a beautiful wife, a house, my own business, but that doesn't fill the hole. I sit there in the morning under my crab apple tree listening to the birds, drinking my alcohol, smoking the cigarette, think how easy it could be to take the pistol off my hip and turn it to my heart and end it, just so that my wife and kids, and my mother have a face to look at when I lie dead in my coffin. When I think about that scenario it makes me not do it because it would be unfair to them because I did it to myself. But if I drink myself to death, that would just be an unfortunate side effect of addiction and would be better accepted, I would be considered troubled and an addict, not a selfish suicide. The hole will never be filled, and no matter how much money or love I have, it's always empty, and I fucking hate it.

       Nothing ever feels right when a bright, creative, good-looking, successful, artistic, and thoughtful person commits suicide in a seemingly spontaneous way (right in the middle of an episode shoot, leaving his corpse for his crew or friends to find). But it happens. People kill themselves, and sometimes they don't tell us why.

       As soon as I saw Jake Tapper's "let me shove this narrative down your throat" narrative before anyone had a real chance to investigate, I knew a major coverup is taking place.

        Did he report? Sure.

      <p>
       While I see your point of him doing his job, I also know that CNN's job is and has always been to disseminate the propaganda coming from the alphabet agencies and the State Department. So unless he was told what to propagate at 4:26am, I find very hard to believe that he had a reason to inject the narrative that Tony took his own life.

       Fair. Suicide is a conclusion from primary evidence. If the deceased was found hanging, or with bullet wounds, etc. we would typically need an autopsy or further investigation to make that claim. He could have at least put a qualifier on his assertion I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to play devil's advocate, I'd consider two things: (1) they worked for the same network and presumably knew each other well. The sudden discovery by Tapper might have clouded his judgment. (2) from studying journalism in an academic setting, and being a living breathing human, I have a strong distaste and distrust for the MSM business complex. Not even sinister conspiratory reasons, just a lot of people sucking at their jobs. As media business booms, and the field expands, the quality of the individuals declines on the whole. Same with our police force. Hire more police, you're gonna get more shitty police.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person like JT has all the incentive in the world to break story first, ask questions later. Jump to conclusions first, clarify later. It's quite possible he was jumping to steer a narrative with corrupt motive, or equally possible IMO that he is a sloppy imprecise "journalist." But I'm sure that possibility won't be received well here. And again I'm not denying the actual existence of an alternative set of facts, just that this tweet to me isn't compelling evidence of one.

       That's ok, I understand your point of view. But notice how quickly we accept the so called mainstream narrative as facts, while less than 12hrs later we are already assuming everything else as an "alternative" truth. That's job well done for the ones in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you know the mainstream media as a whole is a trillion dollar industry, and it's extremely important for the ones financing/profiteering to anchor the desired narrative early with the shock factor of the tragic event, for the highest possible impact on the population. 
We often see this with war reporting and false flag events where you are served with videos of children gasping for air accompanied with text stating that Assad, Saddam, or Gaddafi gassed his own people, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Tapper could've easily added a word allegedly, seemingly, or "it appears", but he didn't. I'm just too conscious and aware of these techniques, especially coming from CIA assets like Tapper, Cooper, etc.

       There is nothing suspicious about Bourdain's tragic suicide, once you realize his girlfriend was pictured canoodling with another guy in Italy just days ago. He adored her("she's my shelter from the strom"), so I can only imagine those images broke his heart.

       His girlfriend also accused Weinstein of rape then directly accused Clinton of knowing all about what he does!!
So, would a breakup cause someone to kill them self? Yeah. Maybe.

       I can. They are celebs that some folks here will automatically try to link to deeper conspiracy...and the others are just the faceless people that have given of themselves so that people like us can sit behind a keyboard and find the thinnest of threads to connect celebraties who (just like us) suffer each day with life.

       That doesn't even make sense. We don't know the circumstances of this alleged suicide. Nothing wrong with asking questions. I think you are just pointing your outrage in the wrong direction.

       I've been away from this sub for a while but the Bourdain "suicide" just doesnt feel right and I had to see some other opinions about it. I find it very odd that a man that basically lives on vacation is so mentally depressed that he offs himself. Not to mention that his wife just made a huge rah-rah speech to rally the people against the Hollywood rapist elite. Then I read about Kate Spade's husband and his connection to Pizza Gate, and I come here and find alot of comments about depression and chemicals. Either alot of people are taking the story for face value or this sub is filled with more people trying to push the narrative as apposed to those who are actually looking for answers.

       I'd be hard pressed to find ANYONE who ISN'T depressed.  Very few are gleeful or joyful these days. And no one within my immediate circle of family or friends are hanging themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when someone's girlfriend has direct ties with a rapist (Weinstein) who then goes after the Clintons for being the rapists' friend and not exposing him sooner well, 'suicide' by hanging can often follow!

       This is probably too soon and I do apologize if it's time-sensitive but I don't understand how 'they' immediately conclude a hanging is suicide without thoroughly looking into other possibilities!!! Because 'hanging' is also a method to cover up a murder too!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that that's the case here but Anthony's girl friend accused Harvery Weinstein of rape AND.....Anthony himself accused Hilary of knowing all about Weinstein's illicit affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidence? Perhaps. Does it deserve further consideration? Absolutely!!

       A single high profile case like this sets a precedent for you that all deaths reported by the police are either incompetent or a conspiracy? I don't know what you're getting at here.

       I'm not a conspiracy theorist. And on this note, are you implying you don't have faith in the police department in any country? (I'm assuming this what you mean by 'authority') Unless there is evidence to the contrary, I have faith in the police department in these types of matters.

       I apologize. I didn't realized you were literally asking me a question. So, what do I think they should be doing? It's a little too late. But what they SHOULD'VE done is report Anthony's death with 'details will follow'. I know they can do that for autopsy often take a long time.....and this should be no different than finding a dead body and reporting ONLY that.
But instead they not only say it was an 'apparent' suicide by hanging.... they include a 1-800 suicide hotline number at the end of most of their articles to further implying they concluded his death within hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were TOO quick to report this and it almost looks like damage control reporting.
      </p>

       The media is bought and paid for by politicians with the Clinton's influencing many networks and newspapers so.........do the math.

      <p>
       My 'hunch' is.....there's a lot more to this. Just like there is (probably) more to Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington's 'hangings' too. 
Hanging oneself is the most popular 'go to' method of suicide. Shooting followed by over dosing at the top two. Hanging is a horrible way to die. It's like jumping out a 100 story building. Very few do that. However....many murders are done that way to make it LOOK like volunteer jumping.

       So your logic is that any suicide that is

       a gunshot OR drug overdose is a covered up homicide. Right. That makes sense.

       It was pretty well known within the industry that Bourdain was depressed. It was also well known in general that Avicci nearly drank himself to death a few times, which is why he needed multiple liver surgeries.

       Should have seen this earlier. I just posted on here essentially wondering the same thing. He had a history with drugs, yes. That doesn’t mean he’s more likely to commit suicide. The fact that he was just beyond the middle-aged white male demographic makes him more likely to commit suicide than a drug history. There’s nothing that will ever seem right about these kinds of things, but my gut feeling says it’s a little more than that.

       Dude, Weinstein is already done, I doubt he's done worst shit than what's come out already. What's the point in having someone whacked now. Also, I see a lot of people commenting on Weinstein's potential prison sentence as karma would catch up to him. Let's not forget what's the most important thing to have in prison: money, and Harvey has tons of it, it'll be a walk in the park for him.

       It is hardto say. I suspect it was similar to Hunter S Thompson. Someone who lived a good life and was getting old and decided to go out on their own terms.

       I heard that Hunter S Thompson could have a connection the Larry King, and the franklin cover up. I think i remember hearing that he could have possibly shot a snuff film for Larry King. Read into this however you want.. just repeating some info i heard on a podcast a while ago.

       Yeah man, I was saying this back in 2016 when it was everyday a celebrity was dying.  I don't buy for a
       <em>
        second
       </em>
       that Bourdain committed suicide.  I believe it's a slow (but in the grand scheme of things pretty quick) erasure of our culture in the Anglophone world, the removal of our more salient and sane voices, our cool people.  One I thought was interesting that they didn't quite get was Sinead O'Connor who posted that video sobbing, saying she didn't understand why but she felt a compulsion to commit suicide.  Somehow she decided to take to social media instead of doing it.  Either "they" are somehow getting people to do it by fucking with their minds, or they're just being killed, or both.

       This. It's not like, as many other comments have said, that this is just "another celebrity suicide". There are threads and common characteristics that these most prominent people share. Many of them were particularly talented and, the most suspect quality,
       <em>
        virtue with an edge
       </em>
       . Bourdain, Prince, Heath Ledger, Robin Williams, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, and many others in the last 10 years. Where is the statistically equivalent horrible celebs doing the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       As an artist myself, I have noticed a tendency from outsiders to "frame depression" on me and other artists. It feels like you have to nod your head and say yes in a ritualistic manner, similar to the endless cancer/ALS/alzheimers/other malady charitable events. Every day another disease gets its own "awareness week", all the while some of the most unhealthy people are the very nurses who work in the hospitals and doctor's offices, trusting the establishment medical science, that cuts your ear to save your nose, cuts your lip to save your ear, and on and on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to cancer treatments with identifiable tumors (sorry to get off topic, but this needs to be said): a microwave beam emitter is not much different than the one you find in a microwave oven. If you turned it on and pointed it in one direction, you could pass your hand through it without too much of a problem. Change the wavelength or frequency and you can create an electromagnetic beam that will pass through nearly anything. Think x-rays, right? In common medical practice, they have to hit a sufficiently dense object to bounce back, and the receiver creates an image of the negative, and you can see bones. And we all know that the beams coming from our cell phones have no trouble passing through our bodies, building materials, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, so get yourself a lab that has electromagnetic emitters (or build your own), where you can dial the wavelength or frequency up or down (harder to do than it sounds, but quite doable). Take two of them and tie the dials together, so when you make a change, they both get altered. Arrange them around a large 90 degree protracting curve, so that they can slide along the curve and still point at the tip of the wedge. Set a glass of water at the tip. Turn on one of the emitters and "change the dial" so that you create a wave that passes through the water. Perform tests to ensure. When satisfied, turn on the other wave emitter, set it to the same wavelength and frequency, and point it at the glass of water. Test different angles with both emitters pointing at the water. When you find the right angle, at the right wavelength, frequency, and amplitude, the water will heat up. You will have utilized "constructive interference" to create an isolated "heat spot". Once you have found the right recipe, it is simple to scale the system up or down, narrow the beams or widen them. This could be used to destroy tumors with little to no damage to surrounding tissue, providing seriously useful treatment. It could also be used to seriously injure, fuck with, or kill someone, with very little, if any, damage seen from the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this is a pretty simple concept, and if you set a couple scientists working on it for a few years, if that, especially these days, you could create a working model and manufacture it without too much trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the burning question after all of this: where is this treatment? The device can certainly exist, and we have invented a thousand more complex things. All you need is a rudimentary understanding of electromagnetic waves (or possibly other wave-types: sonic, for example), the concept of constructive interference, the scientist's labor, material, and a lab for experimenting. "Zapped" is a good word. Keep in mind that in order for the vast majority of us to actually utilize something like this, we would have to build it ourselves.

       I dont believe he killed himself. I think he knew too much, maybe let his mouth run too much re: Weinstein. If you've read his books you know what he can be like. I guarantee Anthony Bourdain, Kate Spade, and others have knowledge or are tied in some way to human trafficking and they were killed off to keep them quiet. I don't believe what the media is telling us for a second.

       Most of them had their demons, and I don't see anybody saying anything other than some of these suicides feel off. Some people are interested in the truth, that involves asking questions. Others are complacent sheep who accept the narratives without question. You've made your choice, and you obviously think pretty highly of it.

       I have the opposite issue. All signs point to suicide and my family wouldnt be surprised if it happened. Thing is since Im very self aware about it and nonchalantly talk to people about my mental health issues I actually have no interest in suicide. Its like GoT to me.

       Anti-depressants have a suicide risk
      </p>
      <p>

      <h4>
       Antidepressant medication and suicide risk
      </h4>
      <p>
       Antidepressants can make depression worse rather than better for some  people, leading to an increased risk of suicide, hostility, and even  homicidal behavior. While this is particularly true of children and  young adults, anyone taking antidepressants should be closely watched.  Monitoring is especially important if this is the person’s first time on  depression medication or if the dose has recently been changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Signs that medication is making things worse include anxiety, panic  attacks, insomnia, hostility, restlessness, and extreme  agitation—particularly if the symptoms appear suddenly or rapidly  deteriorate. If you spot the warning signs in yourself or a loved one,  contact a doctor or therapist immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are concerned that a friend or family member is contemplating suicide, see
       <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/suicide-prevention/suicide-prevention.htm">
        Suicide Prevention
       </a>
       . The suicide risk is greatest during the first two months of antidepressant treatment.

       i’m sorry, did you know him personally? NO. you do not know what he was feeling like and you have no right to say “he wouldn’t kill  himself”. mental health is a serious problem. maybe he just couldn’t take it anymore. to judge how he seemed on the surface to the public and think that’s all he was like is narrow minded

       Lol this comment is typical of how idiotic suicide comments are getting. It is neither having a conversation about suicide NOR celebrating the person. The irony is lost on how narrow minded you’re being. You can’t even say anything about suicide anymore without people like you getting upset.

       Well, he was 61 years old so age could've been a factor.

       China is harming US diplomats in China and Cuba with sonic attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also killed off cultural icon Bruce Lee's bloodline so an attack on Bourdain might make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly though, Bourdain was well aged, kinda young still at 61 but tragic nonetheless.

       You're being purposefully obtuse, here. Anyone who has read or seen Bourdain's works knows that he carried emotional baggage. He discussed this several times over the years, including several episodes about his battle with addiction. And that's just what he was willing to talk about publicly! There is always way more going on in the background that the public doesn't get to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a conspiracy here, it'd be as much of a stretch as saying that the sticker companies committed 9/11 so that they could make billions on #NeverForget bumper stickers. Cui bono?

       Text on a screen doesn't normally make a sound. I can see how you got confused, though. That's just the text-to-speech program your social worker set up on your computer, because you can't read.

       As an older guy, I've experienced a few suicides in my circle.  Some of them were from depressed people, but some were from people who seemed completely cheerful until they were gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often people are just really good at putting up a good front.  This is particularly the case with performers...
      </p>
      <p>
       As my mother told me after the worst one - "Remember that suicide is often an impulse crime and doesn't represent someone's well-thought-out ideas about the world."

       Yes and everyone is extremely confident in spewing some kind of rhetoric because we all got fucked up from Robbin Williams killing him self. It made the general masses so much more aware of the hidden sides of depression that people even the world hold dear can hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Bourdain wasn’t a performer. He wasn’t a funny man, an audience man or the like. 
And if you know Bourdain from his writing and pre cnn tv, you just might think that this is just not the way he would have killed himself. It just seems too easy. It just seems too painless and void of emotion.

       Any casual fan who reads his books would know that he would never, ever do that. A bunch of bullshit in this thread about how he’s a “celebrity” and somehow that makes him an unknowable deity or something ridiculous. If you read his books, watch his show, and literally hear the words coming out of his mouth, you would know that this is an amazingly upstanding guy. People are using his drug addiction to discredit him entirely.

       Things I see going on that seem connected but you should do your own research and not even care what my assumptions are:
      </p>
      <p>
       Child trafficking networks seem to be unravelling, or at least we're scraping the top of what's hopefully a small iceberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Celebrities are offing themselves or being killed
      </p>
      <p>
       Avicii had a video that was about human trafficking iirc, it was posted here a while ago
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the first I heard about Bourdain calling out Weinstein but it's also possible he was in some way involved in trafficking or had the power to do something and didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guilt can tear you up, especially when videos of blood splattered restraints and child remains are hitting the internet.

       Anthony Bourdain was a very responsible person with a strong work ethic, if he was in the middle of shooting something, out of a sense of duty to his employer and especially his coworkers, he would have first finished his job first and then committed suicide, not during while on location, effectively screwing over those he worked with for years.

       I agree that it feels odd. My first thought was "what's the connection with Kate spade?" Is Weinstein the connection?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe Harvey is threatening to give up someone bigger than him in a plea deal and that person is offing people to intimidate witnesses? If Anthony was dating one of the first accusers than what better way to send a message then suiciding her boyfriend? Especially when that boyfriend is a bigger celebrity?  Was Kate close to any accusers?

       avicii and kate spade had a long history of depression, bourdain was a drug addict at one point and probably fell into the same. when you have all the money, possessions that you want, a family and you're still not happy. you realize happiness probably isnt coming

       I'm not sure why people aren't putting two and two together but these deaths, sans Kate Spade (who left a note) are clearly cases of auto erotic asphixiation. Same cause of death for Robin Williams, Chris Cornell, and Chester Bennington. This is something plaguing Hollywood and I can't believe no one is taking notice.

       Robin Williams did a movie before his death about auto erotic asphixiation. I'm convinced it's what killed him, otherwise where's the note? Chris Cornell killed himself specialized pullies and rock climbing ropes, that's a lot of trouble to go to when you are on the verge of killing yourself.

       A lot of people have been dying by hanging. Remember that pharma couple that died by hanging and that was declared a homicide? Yet when others die of hanging it's a suicide?
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually the pharma couple was first ruled a suicide but then a homicide.

        Canadian homicide detectives on Sunday took the lead in investigating the mysterious deaths of pharmaceuticals billionaire Barry Sherman and his wife, Honey, a day after relatives complained about the handling of the case.

       "People who commit suicide HAVE to look sad all the time" is such a common misconception about suicide and mental health in general. Often, those who have been battling with mental illness for their whole lives are the best at hiding it. You develop a different persona in public.

       It truly is tragic; depression is so permeating that it does not matter the positives that are going on im someones life, it catches you offguard, grabs hold, and drowns you while you fight for a breath of fresh air.

       In one of his shows he mentions his time in /first trip to Vietnam and it seemed he was young when he was there but I don't think he's a vet.

       Heroine &amp; the company's role in the drug trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around the same time that Joe Rogan started singing his praises the tone of JRE seemed to change. I think someone got Joe, I think Anthony befriended and influenced him. He's exactly the right way to approach Joe, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this is all guess work but it feels like a workable pattern. Maybe he got got by someone sending a message to the company, or maybe he pissed off his bosses or was a loose end. Maybe he relapsed and thought he couldn't kick it again. Maybe it's just depression. Depression is a sneaky mother fucker, especially in people not inclined to ask for help.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really liked Anthony's demeanor and work, regardless of my silly theory, I am very sad he's gone.

       anyone notice one of his last episodes if not the last was in Armenia. Which is the place that "Q" and other conspiracy youtubers have claimed that the deep state has a major presence in Armenia. I got a bad feeling when I saw the Armenia episode, it was also his first time going to Armenia.

       I think the "something's not right" part of this is our blindness to depression in famous people and mental health in general. I think that many feel that celebrities are immune to mental health problems because of their fame and wealth.

       Death by this kind of hanging is quick and relies on cutting off the carotid artery. Same principle as a choke hold. Passed out in 20 seconds. Dead three minutes or so later.

       Do you know what a choke hold is? Google it if need be. Same principle. You get dizzy and then pass out and die soon after. Makes it real easy if the person is on drugs or booze.

        The assistant eventually managed to open the door and found Williams clothed, in a seated position and "with a belt secured around his neck, with the other end of the belt wedged between the clothes closet door and the door frame," Boyd said. "His right shoulder area was touching the door, with his body perpendicular to the door and slightly suspended."

       I would say test it yourself but given that you could pass out in as few as 5 seconds, probably better not.

       I have thought the same thing given the timing of it. But there is evidence suggesting that his girlfriend left him and he was suicidal by own admission in the past when his first wife left him.

       Could be fishy, but not for the reasons you think. My bathrobe belt could easily be used to hang myself in this fashion. I guarantee it would work, especially if I was already wasted.

       On a side note, Bourdain's girlfriend account of Weinstein sexual assault beggars belief. According to
       <a href="https://people.com">
        people.com
       </a>
       she said,   “He asks me to give a massage. I was, like, ‘Look man, I am no f—–g fool,’ ” " Reluctantly, Argento said that she agreed to give the producer a massage. After, she said he allegedly pulled her skirt up, and forced her legs apart before performing oral sex on her while she asked him, repeatedly, to stop. Argento said she was “terrified” of Weinstein, adding, “It wouldn’t stop. It was a nightmare.” Did Weinstein threaten her with violence? How did Weisntein force her legs apart? Why didn't she just leave? I wouldn't be surprised if Weinstein did indeed rape other women but Argento's account kind of raises a lot of questions. Now that everyone knows Weinstein was a creep everyone wants a piece of the pot.

       It is a legitimate question. If someone starts doing oral sex on me and I don't want it I close my legs and leave. So I wonder why she didn't do that. Did he threaten her? Was he using force to hold her in place and force his face within her legs?

       Black Ops shit with conspiracies about Mk Ultra, coupled with the fact Bourdain has had run ins with almost all upper echelon elite social circles makes me think there is more to his death than meets the eye.

       My suspicion brought me here, and subsequently to his connections with Harvey Weinstein, someone who very likely has resorted to murder and has the resources to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm appalled that they are not investigating this and are ruling it a suicide before ever doing so.

       I don't necessarily believe any of these were murder, I haven't seen evidence of that yet, but all the people who explain these away with platitudes like "suicide isn't rational" and "you often don't see it coming" make it very easy to get away with murder.

       Of course they would make an assassination look like a suicide, why wouldn't they when so many people accept it without question?

       First of all. I lurk ,never post or comment. But this ,this is too much. If anyone hasn't already put the pieces together then here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many celebrities that have anything to do with (exposing / encountering ) sexual abuse ,child pedophiles etc. They all die the same way. Suicide by hanging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chester Bennington. Robin Williams , Anthony Bourdain . There's so many more. I just don't feel like digging today. The hanging suicide is always the way they go. Just remember ,the way bush sentenced sadam to death was by hanging. Wich hasn't been done ,and should've been a shock to anyone.

       Anthony Bourdain was an ignorant prick who was addicted to all types of drugs and bragged about how low he stooped. Only Netanyahu could replace such an aware-of-being-maleficent balloon of pomposity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You talk about Weinstein like the only reason you're dropping his name, as well as Bourdain's, is in allegory to the line of Shem which Abraham and now Bin Salman are a part of. What a stupid post. Don't even act like Weinstein going to prison is a bad thing, or like his nepotism hasn't engulfed film like a tsunami, if a tsunami could be a rapist. Bourdain's absolute intentionality behind everything he does mocks the powerless who cannot make choices. He shows up in Brazil for example and says "It looks like everyone is either fucking or on the way to fuck" in the second sentence that comes out of his mouth to a Brazilian WHILE being recorded &amp; before drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was an intentional slob, and a pig.
      </p>

       You know who's a real man who will be missed? Gordon Ramsay. He traveled around the world and did his own series.

       The insanity is always rich in threads concerning the death of someone considered a 'celebrity'. This thread is no different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seen in this thread is disbelief because he looked happy. He was in France. He was considered successful and rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumors of being offed for reasons such as population control, Weinstein links, #metoo, Israel and as a 'red herring'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Erotic asphyxiation's apparently not a possibility because he can afford to go 'sky diving' for thrills...ffs! To the rumor that this coincides with a movie being shown on TV and it's TPTB showing their hand!
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is, the public at large have no idea who the fuck the Spade woman was. As for Bourdain, there will be a little article in worldwide papers with most people either saying, 'who the fuck is he? Or...'oh, yeah I've seen t.v ad's for that dude on the cooking channel'. I'm sorry for his families loss and any people who are fans of his work but his sort of a nobody in the grand scheme of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few 'celebs' deaths have been reported as suicide recently and suddenly things are 'odd'? HARDLY! Considering the statistics from the WHO, I'd consider the 'celebrities' and 'rich' to be WELL BELOW AVERAGE in the suicide stats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suicide is the unspoken fucking epidemic. Never fool yourself into believing you know exactly what's going on behind the scenes of someones mask. Also never forget, 'humans are irrational and highly illogical' beings at times. Every 40 seconds, someone, somewhere, decides they want off from this world.

       Fuck you, dude. Just because someone LOOKS "full of life" doesn't mean there isn't an internal struggle happening. Shit like that minimizes the problem. You don't have to be dressed all in black and mopey all the time to experience suicidal ideation. And, it's not like suicidal thoughts pay attention to a schedule. "Oh, no...we can't bother him on that day, it's his son's birthday. We'll pop up a few days later." Fuck that.

       I believe that Bourdain was in some way involved with child trafficking and prostitution. Let's set aside, for the most part his time spent in places where that is a known practice in Southeast Asia. He has plausible deniability there at least, as an international food critic.

       Avicii made a video shining a light on child trafficking in a realistic way. Then he's dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chris Cornell, and what looks like John Podesta's son Chester Bennington, were looking too deep. Gone. Probably occult related at least in Chester's death.

        Anthony Bourdain was someone who was so full of life. He literally was in the middle of shooting an episode in France which anyone who reads his book would know he loved. He wouldn’t commit suicide there when he was also with his best friend Eric Ripert.

      <p>
       I hate to say it, but this is what people say about almost any suicide.  You never see it coming.  The people who end up doing this are internalizing an immense amount of pain.  They don't wear it on the outside, and that's why they're driven to taking their own life.

       We could take some bitter sweet comfort to believe this was some crazy high-level hit. It'd be more rational. But more than likely Tony took his own life and that's the shit thing.

       Does anyone think that his suicide has anything to do with Asia Argento and her being in the forefront of the Harvey Weinstein scandal? 
I mean no disrespect to Anthony. And I don't know details of the actual suicide, but something seems fucky.

       Speaking from personal experience, suicide isn't always a sudden thing. Sure, there are the people that just one day suddenly decide to do it, with no explanation; but it's not typically how it happens.  People who are suffering from depression, or anxiety, and contemplating it; start thinking about it long before they try.  In fact, many times, they'll try two or three times before either getting the help they need, or actually succeeding. You never really know what may be that one thing which finally pushes someone over the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my case, it was a phone call with a friend. We got into an argument, and after it ended I decided I was done. Done with everything.  I ended up spending close to a month in a mental hospital for it, and I am now in treatment for the anxiety that caused it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We really don't know what Bourdain was going through, or at least, what his last thoughts were.  What was the breaking point?  Was it a simple case of ‘L’appel du vide’ that got him, or something more?  We may never really know.
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘L’appel du vide’ translates to "call of the void".  The call of the void is the thought to jump off the ledge you are standing on; wondering what would happen if you drove your car into another car or person; it is the thought of "I could kill someone so easily right now" when holding a knife, hammer, or what have you. In the case of someone suffering from depression, this can very easily lead to a suicide attempt, or success.

       Anyone with hard drugs in their past is a more likely candidate for suicide. Not only do depressed or mentally burdened people more often seek out drugs, but drugs can bring out or exacerbate depression in those same individuals. There is a predication. Not all of those whom have used hard drugs obviously but there is a known tendency.

       My only question about a few of these celebrity suicides is how are they able to determine so quickly that they are indeed suicides? Doesn't an investigation take at least some time to conduct before officially saying the cause of death is suicide?

       The "love" of his life Asia Argento was caught in photos with another much younger guy flouncing around Rome. He made a big deal about how brave she was with Weinstein &amp; found out she is a tramp. He probably really loved her &amp; felt like a dope besides being depressed.

       It's very common for people with depression to be at their worst in these situations. They are doing their favorite thing in the world and still feel miserable, so why keep living if the best thing in the world still leaves you empty? He was a man that struggled for decades, it came as a shock but it's not at all surprising that he died this way

       The books Weinstein were carrying right before taken into custody are the key, I think:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Rodgers/Hammerstein - apparently initiators of "casting couch" (read: sexual exploitation)
       </li>
       <li>
        Kazan - post-McCarthyism witch-hunt, labelled Arthur Miller, etc "Communists" (now our modern-day witch-hunt - #MeToo - instigated by literal witches, Argento included)
       </li>
       <li>
        Black book - definition: " a book containing a list of secret contacts, or of the names of people liable to be punished"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       All are Jewish - Bourdain's mother was too. However, I do not think this is a Jewish conspiracy, rather a Hollywood / Establishment conspiracy, of which Jews are a part.
      </p>

       I don't have all the answers, but my take:

       Bourdain isn't dead, he staged his death on June 8, which is 9 years 6 months after David Carradine's suicide.  96 in numerology means 733. Its satanic freemasonry. On May 22 Bourdain tweeted to someone that they might die of auto erotic asphyxiation in a nod to Carradine.  Then on June 3rd Bourdain posted some tweets including one of a song "House of the Rising Sun" and June 3rd was the anniversary of Carradine's death.  The first known recording of this song was on 9/6/33 which means 7-33-33.  So they staged his death probably because he is retiring.  His gf, his wife, his crew, all part of the hoax. All the world's a stage.  It took me a few days to pull the hoax apart. CNN, the king of hoaxes and fake news, broke the news.

       What would be the M.O. behind murdering random celebs and making it look like suicide though? Maybe to glamourize it as a means of population control? At the same time they romanticize it in the media ie that netflix series.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be that the govt realized overpopulation is coming due to all the advances in technology and medicine, so they want to nudge undesirables into offing themselves.. "see, even successful people with great lives do it, so why not you?"

       Michael hutchens from INXS was an early closet hang. Probably same MO. I think if you try to leave the industry or say anything to damage its reputation they just break in and choke you out instead of dealing with it. Probably all hit jobs.

       It's well known that people who are exceptionally skilled at making others laugh can be hiding brutal depressing of their own - like Robin Williams. Anthony was likely putting on a similar front - depression isn't like being bored or unhappy, it's a total numbness to life regardless of where you're filming or what you're doing

       Yet I don't have a hard time believing their suicides.  Robin Williams had lifelong depression struggles then was diagnosed with Parkinson's.  Chris and Chester struggled always with depression and drugs.  Not too much of a stretch to believe Carradine was into kink, but I don't know what else he might have been involved with.

       Anthony has brought a LOT of attention to how US policies have had devastating effects on other countries.  He worked to help people.  People listened to him.  To me, this made him a target.  If he stepped too boldly on the wrong toes, a hit could have been taken out on him.

       Sometimes you just like to go down the rabbit hole because "reality" is too saddening. The rabbit hole puts meaning to things even if it might be more fucked up.

       Hanging yourself from the doorknob wouldn’t be difficult, just tie a rope to the back side handle and wrap it over the top. What’s the difficult part here? Not discounting this theory but I don’t know if that point supports it.

       Probably why the suicide rate in the trans community is so high, in addition to the constant harassment they endure.  You finally go through with an expensive and troublesome surgery, you fill up with hormones, you change your name.  You're now the right gender, but it's still not enough because you can never capture the experience of growing up with your correct gender.  You can make yourself a woman, but you can't experience your first father-daughter dance, your first period, etc.  For many, they'll never be able to have what they want and when they exhaust their options and realize they still don't feel woman or man enough, they give up.

       I think it peculiar that a woman at the top of her game with kiddos at home would kill herself. In addition, I find it to be an odd coincidence that Kate Spade worked with the Clinton Foundation in Haiti. Maybe they are connected? I could have sworn that someone who work with Hillary in Haiti and worked for Amber Alert was caught smuggling children from Haiti. Something is odd!

       Jim carrey touched on that, in the movie about the making of "the room",

       he said, after he made it with dumb and dumber and basically had everything he was working for, 
he was still unhappy,

      <p>
       and it was a big crashing moment where he went into a depression and was contemplating suicide

       why is it personal to you?  objectively, it takes longer.   look at the recent case of murdered billionaire Barry Sherman..  police said suicide, until the family hired their own investigators proving it was murder.. guess it takes $$ to get to the objective truth these days.

       Cool.  I see too many medical advice threads that may or may not have good advice, or at least advice that helped the OP, but they post them as if they are some medical authority who has all the answers and often are outright hostile toward medical professionals.  Hopefully most people take them with a grain of salt, or at least follow the advice but continue to have a medical doctor also, that could be dangerous for people who may take it as absolute fact (which is how they present it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, plenty of doctors prescribe by rote and are influenced by pharma reps, this just means a person must also learn about things and be actively involved with their doctor, if that is met with a negative reaction from the doctor, they should find a different one.  Despite the problems of overprescribing, the simple things are super important that can only be done by a medical professional such as blood tests and other lab work.  More people just need to learn how to “take control” and ask for specific ones if they have reason to believe it would shed light on health issues, and expect the doctor, if they don’t want to do a test, to explain why they don’t think it is needed or relevant.

       Sound quality was bad, at least for me. I couldn't make out most of what he was saying. All I heard was "they can do whatever they want" and something about burning houses down.
