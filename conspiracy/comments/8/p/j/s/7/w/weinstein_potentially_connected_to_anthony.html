       Anthony Bourdain was dating Asia Argento, an accuser of Weinstein..
      </p>
      <p>
       Bourdain played a role in helping the victims advance their case, as well as was personally involved with one victim. There's a high potential in my mind that the suspected suicide has more behind it. Discuss.

       I know he had drug issues in his earlier years, so there's definitely a potential for over dose.
However I wonder a lot. After following many of the Weinstein accusers, I noticed they had a common theme in that they all were harassed. He was quite proactive in helping them, supporting them and with the movement against Weinstein.. There's so many factors that could come into play.

       My immediate thoughts went right to this. And Asia is super close with Rose McGowan, another very outward victim &amp; accuser of Weinstein’s and someone who definitely got harassed by his goons. Ronan Farrow needs to report on this.

       Same here! I just saw Rose's tributes on twitter and IG - I'm heart broken. I'm glad someone else felt the same too. I really do hope Farrow reports on this. There has to be a connection in my mind, because I do not believe he'd just suicide.

       Exactly. Like, Ronan Farrow seems to be one of the few journalists willing to entertain “wacky” notions that sinister shit is going down, so at worst finds nothing...but I’m certain that won’t be true. Doesn’t hurt that early life experiences with pedo dad shaped a lifelong vendetta for actual truth.

       I have not heard of all those connections.  There might be something to it, but I always like to look what would be to gain from the act.  Maybe he had some information or witnessed something and "someone" took care of it.  Time will tell.

       That's exactly the angle I'm taking on this, personally. Was there something he knew? Did he have certain information? Was he being harassed too? A lot of people have tried to call me crazy for suggesting these things on this thread, despite the fact I've posted it in conspiracy which I find beyond hilarious tbh, I thought this is the place to discuss such questions but hey hahaha keep down voting me guys! It's an honest lot of questions to ask, considering when you look at the information that's out there surrounding harassment from Weinstein to his accusers to the deepest of levels. I mean, hey. Anything is possible, and I'm not sure why people get the shits about something they disagree with being proposed as a theory but all I can think is that there is obviously a group here that are against open thinking, which is a pity.

       Tony is kind of a textbook case for suicide. Intense drug addict for years in his 20s. Insanely driven and puts his self worth in his success in professional and personal life. A very neurotic, constantly traveling and away from stability.

       That's very true. I was thinking that earlier actually. He was pretty open about his struggles in his early years but I did notice as time went by he sort of started to put a mask on especially when he split with his wife which gives me reason to believe he obviously, like any normal person who'd been in his situation life wise, that he wasn't too stable because of the constant travel

       Isn't she the one that actually publicly dated Harvey after the supposed harassment happened? I know for fact she was his official girlfriend at one point and scored a few movie roles after that. She always seemed like the least credible, playing the game victim in the whole Weinstein thing.

       He fell in love with Asia. An attractive younger woman and she was losing interest and she was caught being very close with another man recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is we don't know what happens behind closed doors. Maybe he was struggling with mental health and the pictures of Asia and this other man was too much for him.

       Thanks for saying this. Depression is called the silent killer for a reason. People who truly have depression hide it very well. Sometimes family doesn’t even know about those demons. It seems like every single fucking thing that happens is some sort of conspiracy. Literally everything is a conspiracy.

       My apologies. I shouldn’t have generalized it. I forget my experience is limited to my perspective and from what I’ve read. I just meant that we’re good at functioning when we have to. Like at work. No one except my close friend knows what I go through.

       Certainly it's possible he actually committed suffice. But it's also possible there was foul play.

       We can consider both possibilities. We don't have to insist or believe it was one or the other.

       I'd say his daughter. Always without a doubt. But that's an answer also influenced by their father taking their own life at a young age similar to Ariane. But as we know both personally and from what we see happen every day, when depression is so very silent especially amongst men it doesn't matter who is more important at the darkest of moments.

       It is something people will possibly speculate over. But after some time, the rumor mills will quieten down. However, if there happens to be real substance to what you're saying. there will be an investigation, I'm sure. But how can anyone make an assumption like that? The gentleman was in France at the time. If there is real suspicion, there are many ways to follow up on it nowadays.

       Well this is true. I can't deny or disagree with the points you've made. It is purely speculation after all. We will know when the time comes at the end of the day, and there's many factors aside from this that come into play

       The thing is, a man who was living life to the full, was in a relationship which was going well, had a number of projects going on suddenly found to have killed himself? In situations like this, it's only natural to think there might be a conspiracy. Then again, it could have just been the old monster, depression. If someone manages to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together, it might be very interesting what comes up.

       Not saying that isn't the case. As I've mentioned in a number of my comments, I have experienced on a personal level and can very much relate to what his daughter is going through especially. But, it is all speculation at the end of the day including the cheating.

       Meh. He was a 61 year old white dude, his gf was leaving him, he's an addict, exactly the kind of demographic that commits suicide. He was a sensitive, intelligent, gentle soul who was vocally pro-immigrant rights and anti-sexist. Of course he want to get out of this shit plane called earth!
      </p>

       What I find interesting is the uptick in suicide in the news lately. Usually the topic is avoided because it encourages more suicides. Maybe now they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to encourage suicide? Thin the population?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, I predict Jim Carey will commit suicide eventually.

       He was clearly motivated and interested in this subject, especially since his ex was raped by Weinstein.

       Exactly. Some have accused me of allowing my imagination to run wild - but this is s/conspiracy after all. He had an interest and there is potential.

       I mean it sucks he died but I don't see how him being connected to Weinstein would have anything to do with it. For one Weinstein is nearly broke at this point. Two he has a lot working against him with so many accusing him. Three killing Bourdain literally gives him no advantage and helps his case in no way. Weinstein is fucked with or without bourdain in the picture.

       Sure, Weinstein is nearly broke at this point but that means nothing. If one is to believe the victims on the topic of the harassment they endured from him, whilst building their case then anything is possible. Open mind.

       The "love" of his life Asia Argento was caught in photos with another much younger guy flouncing around Rome. He made a big deal about how brave she was with Weinstein &amp; found out she is a tramp. He probably really loved her &amp; felt like a dope besides being depressed.

       Speculation, again - but potential. No one has confirmed she was cheating. No one reliable source has proven it. It's the daily fucking mail, but everyone's willing to believe it? Come on

       He was pretty open about his depression and heroin/cocaine addictions. He probably killed himself OP. It's sucks.

       Undoubtedly, but he was also open with his battle to stay clean - he kept busy with various hobbies including putting together his own comics and perusing jijujitsu. I just find it hard to believe. And there's always a possibility that there's more to the story, of course we won't know that for some time to come, but I do hope in due course we find that this is the case and nothing more sinister.

       I initially thought he was murdered too, until I saw how "close" Asia and Hugo clement are lately. Holding hands, embracing, her touching is lower stomach as they walked... Fucking weird.

       Agreed. I still wonder if there's more or even less to it, I mean the only source available seemingly on the subject is from DM - which as many of us know aren't exactly the best at what they do, and love a bit of sensationalism, BUT. In saying that there has been enough evidence photograph wise to show there may be a lot we don't know. We may never know, sadly. And if it is the case she cheated on him I will of lost all respect for her and many other of her friends.
