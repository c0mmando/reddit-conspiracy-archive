       Someone should look into his connections with the Clinton's and child trafficking. The last 3 celebrity suicides (Spade, Bennington, Cornell) have all been strongly linked to them.

       You've got to be kidding me. I've never seen people grasp for straws as much as this community. I find it hilarious how you think you're thinking critically, when in reality you're just embarrassing yourself. Child trafficking? FFS

       Totally agree. A former? drug and alcohol abuser and divorced with a young kid. He was a very passionate and empathic person (basing this on his life experiences and reflections in his writing and commentary). Depression is real and it kills people regardless of age, race, sex, religion or status. There could be more to the story but depression is the most likely motive.

       Profoundly sad. It's a terrible loss but this doesn't surprise me in the slightest? I can't tell if this sub has transcended to the peak of sarcasm or. Or these people are just beyond retarded. Ties to the Clintons? What the actual fuck? If you had asked me yesterday which tv personalities I think are depressed and may be suicidal, uh yeah Anthony was for sure top 5 RIP. I'm ashamed at what this sub has become.

       Gut reaction based on what? The guy was an ex drug addict that has dealt with depression in the past and is a somewhat heavy drinker. There would be no reason at all to murder him, he's a celebrity chef that made a couple comments about a dude that is fucking despised by everyone. There is literally nothing at all "fishy" about it. It wouldn't make any sense whatsoever to chance murdering a guy whose platform is a travel show and twitter. Why not murder people making allegations? And who is doing this murdering? Think Weinstein, a pariah if there ever was one, decided to have him killed and not any of the dozens of women who can make allegations against him? If
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is fishy to you then I'd imagine anytime anyone commits suicide it's fishy to you.

       Considering you latched onto the "gut reaction" it was kind of clear you don't know shit about the guy. Lets not forget you didn't just have a gut reaction, it was also fishy. Was your brain still off then?

       Nowhere does it say that gut reactions are based on nothing at all.  Where did you get it isn't based on anything? You're reacting to a guys suicide based on what? You just jump to that? Because if you just jump to that then thanks for proving my other comment where I said I bet you
       <em>

       jump to that. As soon as you heard about Anthony you thought something whether you think you did or not, in this case suicide. It's cool, it's very common around here. Also, way to sidestep the entire rest of what I wrote. Bravo

       Nice to knpe, we just ordered an ounce of various kratom strands after trying it at a Kava bar. The stuff felt wondetful, and obviously so natural. Doesn't taste wonderful but fuck it, everything is better than death by pharma

       just be careful my dude
      </p>
      <p>
       i personally wouldn't touch it unless you are already an addict...
      </p>
      <p>
       i myself have never done drugs except coffee and alcohol and i hate alcohol
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just speaking about what I observed which is that addicts who force themselves to be sober are much less likely to survive than the ones who learn how to manage their addictions.. It's like 5 percent who can stay sober and like 90 percent literally who can learn med management. I probably witnessed several hundred addicts over the course of about 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Props to the ones that can stay sober but I feel like AA and NA kind of rely on this placebo effect which relies on telling people there is no other way to survive besides being totally sober which is a lie and leads many people to feel like hell everyday and sometimes sucide or at least many times self destructive relapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could technically even learn to use heroin in a controlled manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Fentnyl, as demonized as it is, has actually a higher therapeutic ratio than morphine and is better at causing coma without death so it's used in surgery. Problem is just accurate dosing but the ratio of the dose that kills to the dose that just gets effects is like 3-5 times that of morphine so with proper measurement it's safer.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is just all these false drug dogmas.. sad cause it leads people to living hell and/or death. Best of luck.

       Oh, I know it acts on opioid receptors, we ain't tryina fly all day and night. But as an alternative to drinking heavily or smoking too much we wanna try it out. Kava is a little more controllable and take a lot to be potent (and a bit more expensive since it's so popular and takes years to grow).
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you work in a clinic or medical setting? Or just personal experience? I agree with a lot of what you are saying and I think the lesser of two 'evils' is a good gateway to a more sober life. Going full on cold sober works for a small amount of people, but that willpower is hard to achieve or physically extremely difficult to pull off depending on the level of addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kava bar offered it 'off menu' so I assumed it wasn't totally chill, but my friend(he's grown mushrooms and made DMT at our house) was very curious. I felt good on it but not trying to make it a habit. I appreciate you looking out for folks in any case

      <p>
       I volunteered with addicts and they would also "relapse" in the most destructive way possible right after they had been forcing themselves to be sober.. it's like a pressure cooker... people who are addicts LOVE drugs and have messed up brains and it's dumb that medical culture has this cookie cutter dogmatic approach which says they all need to be sober.... I've witnessed many suicides at the place i volunteered exactly because of this!

       Doesn't mean that he wasn't anxious, and craving opiates 24/7.. I have experience working with addicts for 10 plus years and some of the patients I met towards the beginning are still sober and still living a hellish SOBER existence full of craving and anxiety that mimics schizophrenia!! I know it's not purely schizo either because in the cases where the person started taking opiates again the symptoms disapeared. Even the mainstream corporate research says that it takes over 7 years for the brain to "heal" but you know that means it might not even happen at all!!

       "It is one of the central ironies of my career that as soon as I got off heroin, things started getting really bad. High on dope, I was — prior to Gino's — at least, a chef, well paid, much liked by crew and floor and owners alike. Stabilized on methadone, I became nearly unemployable by polite society,"

       Bourdain was at the top of his game.  Confident bordering on arrogant and definitely not suicidal  Hanging is a neat way for covering up a real murder.  Don't believe Spade or Bourdain would choose this particular way to die.

       French prosecutor says it reeks of foul play.  Very suspicious death - could've been suicide.  Just sayin' Clinton's goons paid him a visit a few weeks ago and it wasn't pleasant he said.  You nor I know how he was feeling, but you also don't know if he had been threatened lately.  You don't know how many people are suicided and make it look like they did it to themselves.  Until they rule out foul play, quit talking about how he was feeling.

       nah bro, hanging is such a clean way to murder someone. And he was tangentially connected to the metoo movement and said something once, so the people in charge suicided him (but none of those making allegations, but don't think about that)!! I just know that he wouldn't kill himself and definitely wouldn't do it in that way, and neither would Spade! He was successful so he just wouldn't, successful people

       You're an idiot    Bourdain said that Hillary sent her goons to harass him just a few weeks ago and it's wasn't a pleasant experience.  She's so evil and has had many people suicided before they testify against her.  It could be suicide, but I, just like you, have never met Bourdain, nor claim to know him.  It just reeks suspicious.

       Definitely seems unbelievable. The guy has a beautiful wife and daughter, a wonderful career travelling the world tasting great food, fame, fortune, and suddenly during filming decides he doesn't want to live anymore and kills himself in a hotel? It's ruled as a suicide with no explanation whatsoever right away. It just doesn't make any sense.

Edit: did a wiki, and apparently he divorced in 2016 and had been dating Asia Argento. Since 2017 he had been a vocal advocate against sexual abuse in Hollywood since Argento's allegations of sexual abuse against Harvey Weinstein. Raise any flags yet?

      <p>
       So you know so little about this guys life you didn't know he was divorced, but you know enough about his happiness/mental state that you know he wouldn't commit suicide. Got it.

       What about the 59 gunned down in Vegas, or the many dead high school students? Is that pretty acceptable to you as a side-effect of your "PURGE"? Or do you rationalize your complicity as necessary to achieve the coming Golden Age? Or are you just well paid?

       No they aren't. State-sponsored Stasi operations will kill innocents. I know they told you that only the guilty would kill themselves, but it's not true. Overt surveillance is designed to be able to kill anyone, guilty or innocent. Overt surveillance is conducted because it costs multiple millions of dollars to perpetrate. It's a profit model for the deep state. And you are one of the stooges we cheered to see Indiana Jones pummel when we were children.

       So you had no clue he was divorced, still pretty recent. That's stressful right? You at least know he had some hard drug issues in his past, right? Seems believable a guy getting over a divorce with a lifelong struggle with hard drugs could take his life, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know his show was shut down in the past mid-filming because he was too drunk and/or pilled out. He's still known as a big drinker... one of the biggest depressants there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       His current girlfriend not only was involved with Weinstein but actually was his legitimate girlfriend at some point after she was allegedly harassed by him.
      </p>
      <p>
       So right there are a whole bunch of pretty recent things that can cause mental distress to someone. And we don't know what his internal make-up and propensity for mental issues like depression was before all this stuff that has happened over past few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand why it's unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the only people I've seen say this so far seem to have no clue regarding facts about him and come off as extra childish and paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, It's not believable that a heavy drinking former hard drug addict TV personality chef killed himself but more likely he was literally just about to expose TPTB or Harvey(the girl he's been dating for like a year is the one with the info, not him) or pizzagate and was killed for it.

       Didn't he just come out with a scathing episode covering the Turkish genocide of Armenians? Would think Paris is certainly within their reach... if those closest to him say this is totally out of the blue, I would not be surprised to see Turkey behind this.

       Speaking out against sexual harassment in Hollywood could lead to a shortened lifespan. Very sad irrespective of if there is or isn't fowl play. Give how fresh the news is, one should log everything available and take a step back to investigate letting more details emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that these good people don't die if we carry on getting their message out there. He advocated for a range of good causes, speak out against sexual harassment, support real food, not processed rubbish and share your passions with the world. We need more passionate and caring people like Anthony Bourdain, best way to make that happen is to be one yourself.

       I can’t believe another hanging... just 3 days later. This is getting so out of hand.

       Because of their celebrity?  Suicide rates have gone up dramatically over the whole country.  You just don't hear about them because they're not famous.

       No, not because they’re celebrities. Because there’s been three hangings in three days - 2/3 were women, and women do not hang themselves. If you cannot connect the dots idk what to tell you

       Women do hang themselves.  It's just less common.

       If I was to take a blind shot, I would guess it was a combination of crippling depression, along with some strange thing that tipped him over the edge. For example, what If he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and had either the choice to stop eating the way he does?...or the alternative? As someone dealing with an unknown stomach illness for almost a year no, if I knew the rest of my life was going to be like this, I might opt out too. Especially if my career and family was reliant on it.

       Someone should look into his connections with the Clinton's and child trafficking. The last 3 celebrity suicides (Spade, Bennington, Cornell) have all been strongly linked to them.

       huh, my gut reaction is that Bourdain was profoundly sad, on the inside, to the point of medical depression... but I didn't know him I only saw him on TV.

       Go ahead,  portray a silly over-the-top character obsessed with paranoid word association in order to smear people with actual concern for the issue.

       Gut reaction based on what? The guy was an ex drug addict that has dealt with depression in the past and is a somewhat heavy drinker. There would be no reason at all to murder him, he's a celebrity chef that made a couple comments about a dude that is fucking despised by everyone. There is literally nothing at all "fishy" about it. It wouldn't make any sense whatsoever to chance murdering a guy whose platform is a travel show and twitter. Why not murder people making allegations? And who is doing this murdering? Think Weinstein, a pariah if there ever was one, decided to have him killed and not any of the dozens of women who can make allegations against him? If
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       is fishy to you then I'd imagine anytime anyone commits suicide it's fishy to you.
