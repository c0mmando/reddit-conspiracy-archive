"Top EPA officials have declined to review the study or be briefed by its experts on the findings, the internal communications showed." ... "EPA’s last attempt to update its assessment of formaldehyde in 2010 had been criticized by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) for failing to draw “clear links” between formaldehyde and leukemia." ...

A new study has found that formaldehyde is directly linked with leukemia, that is inconvenient for industry so they are attempting to cover it up and spread misinformation about the causes of leukemia.

       It's in safe specific areas meaning it's within our entire body being produced by the vast majority of our cells as a natural byproduct of enzymatic work. It's then transferred out of the cells and forwarded within the body to be processed again very rapidly which is another reason why it's non-accumulative. It's not like cholesterol, or dopamine where it's situated in only a few specific areas. It's everywhere within our bodies all the time being made and destroyed.

       This is an invalid comparison, one cannot compare the injection of micrograms/ml concentration with natural and widely dispersed production of nanogram quantities of formaldehyde-like hydrocarbons within the human body.

       As I said, the same as with stomach acid, stool, bile, it is a natural occurrence in a natural location, injecting these secretions into a muscle would not have some benign effect.

       This

        estimate here
       </a>
       concludes that with some vaccines have 80 times greater concentration of formaldehyde that the blood, and anticipates effects once the balance is upset (see quote below).  Then if we also take into account the abnormal route of entry and the toxic soup of aluminum, MSG, antibiotics, gelatin etc, that's a good chance the body will struggle to metabolize the formaldehyde, leaving the high concentration there upsetting the balance, potentially have a carcinogenic effect in the blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The formaldehyde concentration in the vaccines with the highest formaldehyde content are about 100mcg/0.5mL, equal to 200mg/L. This is 80X higher than the formaldehyde concentration in blood and assumed for most other body fluids (2.5mcg/mL or 2.5mg/L). Consequently, it is reasonable to suspect that the high formaldehyde concentration in the injection may produce local effects."

       I was using that source purely for the calculation from the pro-vaccine people, I disagree with their interpretation and conclusion, as they make too many assumptions and don't think about the bigger picture of the combination of substances and abnormal route of entry entry.

       Like you did in your previous post you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, the reality is that a normal child has 5-9 mg of formaldehyde floating in her blood, about
       <em>
        one million times more
       </em>
       than found in a dose of vaccine. You'd have to vaccinate a child with about
       <em>
        10-20 million doses
       </em>
       to to just slightly increase the formaldehyde level.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by all means, go think of the bigger picture and perform the necessary studies...

       and I just provided a bit of important context behind it as many people might not understand that formaldehyde is naturally produced in our own bodies and or that they think it is some foreign chemical who's only use is to prevent dead bodies from rotting.

       You are implying that if something is produced naturally in our bodies then it musy be safe to inject anywhere into our bodies.  However that theory is easily ended by thinking of the complications of injecting stomach acids, stools or bile.

       No what I've said is that there is more formaldehyde that is naturally produced in our own bodies on a constant basis than there is in any vaccine you would get. I'm implying nothing since i'll i'm doing is sharing information.

       There is no problem with concentration thanks to the body being almost entirely comprised of water, having a very fast circulatory system, and being able to move material within it to be processed. The concentration level is immediately dropped by a magnitude when it's injected into the body and as fractions of time go on it becomes further diluted by magnitudes as it spreads out and is met by further quantities of liquid present in our body. This dilution rate is faster than the rate of absorption by cells meaning the concentration levels will not cause any harm to injection site cells. What's more this entire post is about leukemia which is a blood forming tissue cancer i/e cancer within bone marrow and the lymphatic system. Injection sites for vaccines are not given in bone marrow or within the lymphatic system. By the time the injection reaches either part of these body systems it's concentration level will be drastically lowered and will match that of the rest of the body. So yes it might have 80 times the concentration but since it's such a small amount of material it loses that concentration immediately and lowers continuously in fractions of time as well as distance it travels within the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concentration level is a non-problem and it also ignores the fact that embalmers use embalming fluid which has a much much greater concentration level than vaccines but cancer deaths isn't vastly higher than normal which you would expect if the concentration issue was an actual issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is considering the fact that embalming fluid has a concentration of 1,678 grams of formaldehyde per liter or 1.678 kilograms per liter which is 8,391 times higher than that of a vaccine and 671,316 times higher than that of blood.

       While it’s it’s possible it gets circulated around there is no guarentee that the toxic soup gets separated, if anything the ciculation makes the situation more dangerous as the poison can get to parts of the body where it can do serious damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is known that feline vaccines can cause carcinomas in the injection sites, this suggests that the toxic soup can end up stuck at the injection site.

       Your obsession with vaccines is causing you to miss an actual conspiracy. Dont know how trivially small the vaccine amount is, but it is minute compared to the main exposure: pressed and laminated wood products. If it comes in a sheet, it has formaldehyde in it. Plywood, osb, particle board, mdf, laminate floor, engineered floor, bamboo floor to name a few. Especially cheap products. Look at the average house being built right now. Hundreds of pounds of formaldehyde are going to off gas from the sheathing, floors and finished goods like furniture and cabinets. Anecdotally, it seems like there may be a miscarriage cluster in a new subdivision of cheaply built houses my friend lives in. Definitely worth investigating!  Known bad chemical, potentially high levels, health effects you would expect from that exposure.  By jove, a real conspiracy. So how much are we talking with vaccines? Micrograms? Walk into a new house dude. You know that new car smell? Im guessing you hit that vaccine exposure level within the first 5 minutes. Maybe less.

       Vaccines safety should be a top priority, unfortunately industry has a different way of seeing things, for them researching vaccine safety is equivalent to them pointing a gun at their own feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately there are still brave, honest and independent researchers out there, the vaccine safety gave them a platform to present their findings to each other and discuss the failings of the current setup and science.   The conclusion you see in the presentations is that the science backng up vaccinations is poor quality and desperately needs to be improved, the current vaccine program could easily be doing a lot more harm than good, but the tracking systems aren’t good enough to tell us.

       It’s about the concentration, 80 times higher than in the blood, along with the abnormal entry route, this is what makes the formaldehyde in vaccines particularly dangerous.  Other forms of exposure are not good either, there are other real problems too like you say

       There are
       <strong>
        milligram
       </strong>
       quantities of formaldehyde in our bodies and there are nano to microgram quantities of formaldehyde in vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 milligram is 1000 micrograms. 1 liter is 1000 milliliters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human body has 2.74 milligrams of formaldehyde per liter of blood (2.74mg/1L). Average human has 5.5 liters of blood in their body giving them an average total of 15.07 milligrams of formaldehyde in the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 vaccine has 100 micrograms per .5 milliliters. Average vaccine dosage is .5 milliliters. Average vaccine has 100 micrograms of formaldehyde within it. 1 vaccine will increase blood formaldehyde levels by .1 milligram giving a human a total of 15.17 milligrams of formaldehyde in the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't go by concentration levels because as soon as it's injected into/entered into the body it will become mixed with other liquids instantly which will lower the concentration quantities vastly. The injection will start to flow throughout it extremely quickly thanks to the fast moving circulatory system i/e it takes 1 minute for blood to make 1 full cycle, which will further dilute it. The dilution is caused by numerous body functions including filtration, diffusion, and osmosis. Intramuscular injections take even less time to be absorbed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes even though if you were to take the vaccine dosage and multiply it by 2000(to get to comparable quantities) you would have a formaldehyde content higher than that of in the human body. You would also have to ignore the fact that it doesn't stay concentrated when it's injected as there is a large quantity of liquid(water mostly) present at the injection site which will dilute the injected material instantly. This means the concentration amounts of vaccines aren't really a viable measuring concept as they do not stay concentrated when injected. It's also important to note though that you will never get an entire liter of vaccine injected into your body as that would equal about 1/5th the total amount of blood you have in your body.

       This
       <a href="http://vaccinepapers.org/formaldehyde/">
        estimate here
       </a>
       from a pro-vaccine spin site concludes that with some vaccines have 80 times greater concentration of formaldehyde than the blood, and anticipates effects once the balance is upset (see quote below).  Then if we also take into account the abnormal route of entry and the toxic soup of aluminum, MSG, antibiotics, gelatin etc, that's a good chance the body will struggle to metabolize the formaldehyde, leaving the high concentration there upsetting the balance, potentially having a carcinogenic effect in the blood i.e. leukemia
      </p>
      <p>
       "The formaldehyde concentration in the vaccines with the highest formaldehyde content are about 100mcg/0.5mL, equal to 200mg/L. This is 80X higher than the formaldehyde concentration in blood and assumed for most other body fluids (2.5mcg/mL or 2.5mg/L). Consequently, it is reasonable to suspect that the high formaldehyde concentration in the injection may produce local effects."
      </p>
      <p>
       Your assumption that the vaccine will quickly mix into the blood and disperse would possibly hold if it was only formaldehyde being injected, but the reality is that the vaccine is a toxic soup of substances making it very difficult for the body to metabolize and detoxify.

       I would bet everything I own against a fiver that formaldehyde exposure from pollution and food is exponentially greater than exposure from vaccines. (Probably why this study's from the EPA and not the CDC/FDA).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also can you show where it says, as per your title,
      </p>
      <p>
       &gt; Leaked emails show that industry is trying to suppress new
       <strong>
        study showing that vaccine ingredient formaldehyde is causing leukemia.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the way you've editorialised the title makes it read like the study explicitly states that
       <em>
        formaldehyde from vaccines is causing leukaemia
       </em>
       , rather than what it actually states, which is
       <em>
        formaldehyde is linked with leukaemia.
       </em>
       with your own comment that formaldehyde is found in vaccines.

        Formaldehyde is a one-carbon, highly water-soluble aldehyde that is used in certain vaccines to inactivate viruses and to detoxify bacterial toxins.
        <strong>
         As part of the manufacturing process, some residual formaldehyde can remain behind in vaccines at levels less than or equal to 0.02\%.
        </strong>
        Environmental and occupational exposure, principally by inhalation, is a continuing risk assessment focus for formaldehyde. However, exposure to formaldehyde via vaccine administration is qualitatively and quantitatively different from environmental or occupational settings and calls for a different perspective and approach to risk assessment.   As part of a rigorous and ongoing process of evaluating the safety of biological products throughout their lifecycle at the FDA, we performed an assessment of formaldehyde in infant vaccines, in which estimates of the concentrations of formaldehyde in blood and total body water following exposure to formaldehyde-containing vaccines at a single medical visit were compared with endogenous background levels of formaldehyde in a model 2-month-old infant. Formaldehyde levels were estimated using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of formaldehyde disposition following intramuscular (IM) injection

       I added that it is a vaccine ingredient in the title as not everyone will be aware and it is important given the abnormal route of exposure bypassing the body’s natural protection mechanisms, allowing it to do far more damage than if it entered the body orally.
      </p>
      <p>
       The study you linked to uses modelling, if we assume formaldehyde is injected on it’s own the outcome will be better, but we need to realize there are going to be interactions between the ingredients which complicates the situation, a toxic soup is far harder for the body to clean up than just formaldehyde.  We need studies at the cellular level to see what is going on, it is criminal that such studies haven’t yet been funded and performed.

      <p>
       What natural protection mechanisms? The skin?  Formaldehyde is present in every cell, it's a common byproduct and intermediate metabolite in several metabolic pathways in every cell, and is rapidly converted by formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Exposure via IM injections does not introduce it to cells that would not otherwise have to deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, as your post is alluding to the idea that formaldehyde from vaccines is the cause of leukaemia, I'm curious to know how you think IM formaldehyde exposure is causing it, considering that leukaemia is disease that has its roots in bone marrow.

      <p>
       But I won't allow that to slide unless you can provide citations, specifically with respects to formaldehyde metabolism. Formaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes act rapidly and are ubiquitous (even present in anucleate cells).  I find it hard to believe the other ingredients in vaccines will influence the metabolism of formaldehyde to such an extent that it increases the risk of cancer.

       The title has an informative/educational element to it rather than a sensationalist one.

       If one orally consumes formaldehyde in a higher concentration than is present in the blood e.g. eating a pear, the stomach can regulate how much is allowed into the blood, if any, whereas if you inject directly in the body one has bypassed those defense mechanisms, allowing all the carcinogenic formaldehyde in.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to remember that the formaldehyde in a vaccine is mixed in with and surrounded by other toxic ingredients, that makes a huge difference as to how difficult it is to get rid off, the body knows how to get rid of formaldehyde when it is on its own, but being mixed toghether with e.g. a metal like aluminum makes, it difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to push the industry for more cellular and molecular studies, as if we only do epidemiological studies there are too many assumptions and we do not isolate specific substances to find causations.  Science isn’t about guessing, looking for correlations should not be the main focus of scientic efforts, we need to be seeing what is going on at the microscopic level, so as we can understand and build up our knowledge of science, moving it forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the three articles in the OP, you will see the timing of them fits in with the mainstream supression of the study linking leukemia to formaldehyde, this is how industry works, this is their Plan B for in case the study gets released, they want to point everyone in the wrong direction, poison the well, they want to confuse people with a smoke screen in the hope that we go and bark up the wrong tree.

       When you are pumping several and I mean several different vaccines all at once into a 8-20 pound infant every two months from the start of their life it is completely different then me a 200lb male at 32 yo eating food with these substances in them. You can't compare the two bc it is completely different.
