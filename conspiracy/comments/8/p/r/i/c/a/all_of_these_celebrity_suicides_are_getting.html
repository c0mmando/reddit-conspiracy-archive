    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t mean to make assumptions, my dude, but I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not a rich celebrity? The US is being more and more shaped into a 2nd world oligarchy, but that means, for the rich, it&#39;s more like an extravagant playground than ever (source: have friends that are rich). I don&#39;t think celebs struggle with feeling helpless (although some may feel like life is meaningless). Also, how many celebs are &#39;woke&#39;?</p>

<p>I think the more likely answer is, Hollywood is a morally bankrupt cesspit, and things that happen in morally bankrupt cesspits can sometimes be traumatic enough to lead to a situation where you&#39;d wanna kill yourself, even though you have everything going for you.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;ll bet at least a couple of these suicides are murders made to look like suicides. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there you go. You have these celebrities working in/for a morally bankrupt cesspit. Doing so could certainly leave someone depressed. It could leave some thinking, ‘what good am I doing’ ‘what’s the point in my work’ ‘what purpose does my life even serve’. </p>

<p>But also, chemical depression can affect anyone. Chemical depression robs people of their ability to feel pleasure on a chemical/physical level. It leaves food bland and tasteless, even the best food in the world. It makes all experiences, even the best ones money can buy, feel pointless and lackluster. </p>

<p>No matter who you are, you can get caught in the trap of thinking you aren’t good enough, not what you used to be, and/or not liking yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Big pharma is not effective at all at fixing the root cause of chemical depression and can only mask the symptoms for, at best, less than 35% of people with chemical depression. But they are great at causing the issue through unintended repercussions of some of their other medications they produce.  </p>

<p>Just because big pharma claims to be able to treat it, does not mean chemical depression is not real. That logic is comically wrong. It can be caused by several things (stress’s physical/chemical impact on the body, bad gut bacteria, head injury, anything that causes chronic inflammation at high levels) but all of those cause the body to stop being able to convert l-tryptophan to 5-HTP, the serotonin precursor. It’s surprisingly easy to heal this process and get the body back to making and regulating proper amounts of serotonin. SSRI’s do not fix this issue, so the body continues to fail to make enough serotonin and continues to register those lesser amounts of serotonin than needed as the proper amount. This is why over time, SSRI doses (in the less likely chance they work) need to be upped, because the body regulates production down to lower levels because its regulation is wonky. </p>

<p>You really should consider doing even just a little research on a topic before you falsely claim it does not exist. Just like the rest of the body, the systems that produce the chemicals needed for brain function can break down as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You really should consider doing even just a little research on a topic before you falsely claim it does not exist.&quot;</p>

<p>Have masters degree in psychology.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t exactly blame you for being wrong, because unfortunately pharm has utterly and completely co-opted almost every facet of the medical institution, and spread so much disinformation that even someone like yourself can walk around thinking they know what&#39;s what without having any idea that the &#39;research&#39; they looked at was actually pharm propaganda.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue with you either, but I will say this: ANYTIME you see something talking about how &#39;brain chemicals&#39; are the determining factor of ANYTHING, it&#39;s bullshit. Period. That very idea exist because the logical extension of it is, &#39;since it&#39;s just brain chemicals, we can use other chemicals to cure it&#39;. This is called toxicomania, and it&#39;s a blight on humanity.</p>

<p>Choose to believe this or don&#39;t. I&#39;m just a stranger on the internet. But a lot of our world and our &#39;knowledge&#39; is manufactured. We think you know things (like that Anthony Bourdain was depressed and that&#39;s why he killed himself, or that depression is caused by &#39;brain chemicals&#39;), we really don&#39;t know anything at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, so do I. I know damn well when I look at research who has made it. </p>

<p>I also know plenty of studies that show severely depressed people who have been suffering with symptoms for at least a year, without any life cause for depression, often have a complete reversal of symptoms through taking 5-HTP and vitamin D in 2 weeks time without having any bit of counseling. I also know that chemically depressed people always test high for chronic inflammation. Always. These things aren’t coincidence. It’s well known what process is happening here. And none of it is backed by big pharma research. If fact they don’t Iike it because it negates their drugs. Now I’m not saying everyone with depression has chemical depression. There are people who suffer depression as a result of behavioral patterns. But there is chemical depression and plenty of solid research, not done by big pharma is available if you ever decide to actually learn about this. </p>

<p>It’s well known and established that depression can be a symptom of disease in the body. I learned further about this when it happened to me. I’m a super positive person, have been my whole life, woke up one day and I as damn near suicidal. No life changes what so ever. This was a red flag to my doctor when I did get in to see him.  Turns out I had an infection. I got on the supplements and was back to normal in 2 days, treated the infection and am now fine. This happens routinely, is well established and researched and easily treated. </p>

<p>Again, you clearly need to do your research in this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>sigh...do we really have to do this man?</p>

<p>The original argument was that maybe Anthony Bourdain suffered from &#39;chemical depression&#39; and that&#39;s why he killed himself...obviously, when anyone says that, they&#39;re usually referring to the pharm myth that all of our emotions are somehow the result of serotonin or dopamine deficiencies. I chime in with my &#39;lol, bought the line the pharm companies sold you&#39;, and you respond with your little sort of off-topic pablum about how &#39;chemical depression&#39; (of which it turns out your definition is obviously different from the mass-proscribed idea that anyone that&#39;s depressed just has a &#39;brain chemical imbalance.&#39;) is a real thing that exists. And then you back it up with your little anecdotal story.</p>

<p>However, in your response you state &#39;It’s surprisingly easy to heal this process and get the body back to making and regulating proper amounts of serotonin&#39;. Sooooo, you think Bourdain didn&#39;t have access to the best health-care and wouldn&#39;t have been able to cure this, if it&#39;s so easy? You think he didn&#39;t consult with any doctors or nutritionists? If your version of chemical depression is so easy to cure, then that&#39;s probably not what he fucking had, is it? A chef doesn&#39;t know shit about diet? Get out of here.</p>

<p>So, since it&#39;s seems so important to you, I&#39;ll specify that depression can be caused by any number of factors, INCLUDING health (imagine being a body-builder that hurts himself and can&#39;t do what he loves anymore...that could cause depression, wouldn&#39;t you say? But it&#39;s not the injury itself, it&#39;s the loss of the ability to consume an object —time at the gym — that he uses to anchor himself to the world via his identity), diet, trauma (current or latent), death, sexual relationships, family relationships, a loss of meaning, instability in any arena, economic considerations, etc. etc. The list goes on, and on, and on. And I could go into the Lacanian idea of depression as the effect of an experience of a &#39;moral failing&#39;, or get into the dynamics of how repression of anxiety and keeping inhibitory psychic functions in the realm of the body act as catalysts to induce depression, but it&#39;s all apropos of nothing, because the only thing you need to know is that in that long litany of causes of depression, sole &#39;chemical imbalances in your brain&#39; is not one of them. The mind and the body are the same thing. Who we are is due to 75&amp;#37; nurture, 25&amp;#37; nature. If the environmental conditions aren&#39;t conducive to love and support (and you&#39;d be surprised how many people think they have those that — because they have the things that are ostensibly supposed to provide it — but in actually aren&#39;t getting what they need at all on an emotional, spiritual level), and provide meaning and purpose and something to live up to, you&#39;re at risk for depression and that&#39;s it. &#39;without any life cause for depression&#39;...I&#39;ll bet there was a life-cause for that depression, but the medical model is completely inept at properly diagnosing that because &#39;existential malaise&#39; isn&#39;t a DSM term. Your case of &#39;waking up and feeling like i wanted to kill myself because of an infection&#39; (if that&#39;s true) is .00000000000000001&amp;#37; of cases of depression, and if you really have a masters in psych, you&#39;d know that.</p>

<p>Everyone (especially in medicine) will bend over backwards to explain something away before they admit our society is sick as fuck and that has a huge pervasive influence on everyone&#39;s mental health. It&#39;s much easier to identify existential malaise and personal failings as &#39;brain chemicals&#39;, or &#39;improper body functioning&#39; but that&#39;s reductive, completely wrong, and teetering on dangerous misinformation. If Bourdain was depressed from a &#39;chemical imbalance&#39;, it was probably from taking Chantix (big pharm won&#39;t cure your depression, but they&#39;re happy to give it to you). Or for some other personal reason we don&#39;t know about. Or he was murdered. (Asia Argento satanic AF...look into it).</p>

<p>Lastly, &#39;I know damn well when I look at research who has made it&#39;. Yeah, but you don&#39;t know who funded it. And you don&#39;t know how they cherry-picked doctors until they found the one that would write what they wanted. Pharm FUNDS the &#39;objective&#39; agencies tasked with writing those &#39;scientific&#39; journals. NIH, NIC, FDA, CDC...all on the take. Maybe you&#39;ve heard of this quote from Dr. Angell, former editor for the NEJM:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”</em></p>

<p>She said that roughly 10 years ago. It&#39;s only gotten worse. I worked with doctors that were running national clinical trials that detailed exactly how they were asked to fudge their data.</p>

<p>Fuck you for making me write this. No more responses from me. Anthony Bourdain is dead, 5HTP wouldn&#39;t have saved him, and none of this is gonna bring him back, and it&#39;s a shitty way to honor his life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never once claimed Anthony Bourdain had chemical depression. The only people who would know Bourdain’s situation is him and his doctors. All I said was that chemical depression is real and can be fixed. Chemical depression is not the only cause of depression. You should know this. </p>

<p>Also, assuming that celebrities have the best healthcare is a truly false assumption. Many celebrities have found themselves misdiagnosed or dealing with issues where their doctors caused them more issues (as reported by countless celebrities). </p>

<p>Yes, scientific research is in a very rough state right now. But the research I rely on is the stuff some doctors use that has amazing success healing chemical depression, with no drugs required, and no indefinite treatments required. It works because people with chemical get better and no longer require treatment for depression. </p>
