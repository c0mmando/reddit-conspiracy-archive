The one aspect of our current Orwellian nightmare that drives me to drink is knowing that all data is collected and combed over 24/7 365 yet there are so few arrested or investigated for these heinous crimes. What we do with pedophiles and rapists and traffickers is for another discussion but to allow it to continue with very little pushback is sick. To answer the rhetorical question, I suppose there is too much money to be made to shut it all down (like the drug trade), and/or there are too many well connected elites that indulge on the flesh of the youth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People get away with a lot. And it&#39;s because they have each other&#39;s back. These cabals tape the people performing the acts. And they bond through this recording. It&#39;s a secret club and privileged members receive money and power in exchange of doing gruesome acts. The corruption is throughout the world. That&#39;s why it is so important to find out the links and connect it properly. Or else, it&#39;ll always be there and it&#39;ll reach a point, where no one will be able to stop them. We need to look past certain things. For example, female pedophiles, investment firms, small businesses. these are important clues.</p>

<p>so few arrested or investigated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Podesta e-mails piqued my interest, but it was researching into pedo/trafficking from the &#39;80&#39;s &amp; 90&#39;s that convinced me of the larger pedogate.  For the sheer number of people implicated, there&#39;s not alot of prosecutions or even investigations.  For example, in the aggregate, the Boystown kids serviced over 400 jons.  One person was prosecuted and not even for the sex stuff.  DynCorp is another example.  Their involvement, all with an apparent wink-and-a-nod from governments in whatever country Dyncorp is operating in, with pedo stuff is hard to believe possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t say that. And it’s not true. I believe several of the investigations into HRC were politically motivated. I believe Devin Nunez’ investigation into the Russia matter is politically motivated to discredit the Mueller investigation. I think the local sheriff or whoever conducted the investigation into the homeless camp found exactly that, a homeless camp. They probably investigated to the according to the policy and procedure that they follow for every investigation. 1400 something kids disappeared from under ices nose, why are we (you) worries about children in a pizza parlor basement that doesn’t exist or a homeless camp where there where children’s shoes and toys?

<p>Nah, you gave me some general answers and I&#39;m sincerely trying to hear you out, understand your position, and investigate for myself. </p>

<p>So if there is some way that <em>big data</em> plays into this conversation, I&#39;m not seeing the link; you get that people don&#39;t think in the same way, nor do we have the same experiences so something that seems obvious to you may be completely opaque to me.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t go that far - I&#39;m sure he&#39;s been wrong before; we all have been, and will be wrong in the future. </p>

<p>With that being said, I was a fan of Wikileaks and had hoped it would usher in a new age of transparency so that we could take down the cabal of corporation-government collusion that impedes on our progress and treads on our liberty, but over the years I&#39;ve noticed that they seem to be picking and choosing what they release, and what they don&#39;t so I&#39;m not as sure they are our great hope at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think perhaps we should start again - I was responding to this comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>17 million dollars spent on the Trump collusion witch hunt. After more than a year, not a shred of evidence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You state there <em>is not a shred of evidence</em> and then try to back it up with NLP/machine learning/big data. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a VC fund looking to invest with you, nor am I saying that I am aware of evidence that Donald Trump called up Putin and said, &quot;Vlad, help me become President,&quot; rather I don&#39;t think either side <em>should be certain of any outcome</em> at this point in the game.</p>

<p>We should wait and see what the IG Report says, what the Mueller Report reveals, what the SDNY/EDVA do, etc, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The tools I mentioned above facilitate processing this info to any desired level of granularity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, again how is this relevant? If you&#39;ve got some big data algorithm that can show that the timing of the raids on Michael Cohen coincided with 1,000 users on Twitter reporting FBI raids at the same time on their lawyers office, I&#39;m fucking interested as hell. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve got some conclusion, based on big data, that <em>something else is going on</em>, please do share --- my only argument is that anyone saying at this stage of the game, &quot;Russia is a made up hoax,&quot; is either lying or a fucking fool. </p>

<p>The Russia Witch Hunt <strong>could have been</strong> a made up hoax, had Trump team had never lied about <em>perhaps totally innocent contacts</em>, had reported their contacts properly the first (maybe even 2nd time) they filled out their background forms. </p>

<p>But they didn&#39;t. They lied. They tried to cover it up so now you have every rational human saying, &quot;What are you hiding?&quot;</p>

<p>Lots of those rational folks are wondering, &quot;Why won&#39;t you show your taxes - what are you hiding their?&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s nothing.</p>

<p>If so, cool - let&#39;s move the fuck on and keep MAGA!!!!</p>

<p>Now, Mueller&#39;s appointment specifically stated he should investigate any other crimes they uncovered during <em>the witch hunt</em> so people like Manafort and Cohen are probably fucked and that is a good thing, we need the criminals in jail.</p>

<p>If Hillary is guilty of 1/100th of what everyone thinks she is, put her in jail too. I&#39;m not a part of that <em>my side should be allowed to break the rules</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s why I shit on the US when we do something stupid and I stand up for her always because this is my home and I believe in all that <em>whitewashed history</em> where we are the beacon of freedom and hope for the world over and we should lead by example. I believe in <em>with liberty and justice for all</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Julian Assange is some one who takes a statistically sound approach to validating everything he has publically said</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see Julian Assange <em>looking out for the US</em>. Call me skeptical.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m not condemning Wikileaks for publishing the DNC Emails - transparency is a good thing; hopefully the fact that we all know nothing is private anymore will help us be a little more honest with ourselves and our fellow citizens. I despised how the obama administration treated whistle-blowers. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think Assange is looking out  for the ole USA and since all signs point to the fact that he&#39;s helping Russia, and we&#39;ve had a playbook on Russia&#39;s stance on <em>western democracies</em> for a decade now that appears to be playing out in front of my face, I am going to hold <em>every single thing with a russian backer/influence etc</em> to a much higher standard than I used to.</p>

<p>I was a huge proponent of us embracing Russia towards the end of the soviet era and up to their movements in Georgia. It became clear they were not desiring to be <em>the best Russia they could be</em> but rather <em>get back some old ground and some old power</em>. </p>

<p>Call me a hippie or a pussy, whatever you want, but the idea that we could start <em>winding down our weaponry on this planet</em> instead of ramping it up is one that seems both ideal and feasible at this point in history. </p>

<p>Assured mutual destruction has been reality for the vast majority of this planet&#39;s inhabitants entire lives so we should be focusing on peace through transparency and Wikileaks could help there, but it hasn&#39;t. It&#39;s only help has been to destabilize nations across the globe.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He has never been wrong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s lied. I clearly recall seeing him on TV lying about something years ago...it was fairly trivial but it showed an anti-us bias and helped me stop being a <em>snowden supporter</em> and become a tad skeptical of Snowden...still not sure on that dude. </p>

<p>Anyway, nice chat - if you have actual info I am super interested. Social Media and the information age is amazing because we can live life in real-time, and as you said you can predict things based on it; I read some predictions of Trump winning back in 2016 before the election and they were pretty interesting albeit seemed unlikely; but I was never one who said <strong>never</strong> - I was concerned about the Hillary hate and left-leaning voters falling off to 3rd parties or staying home, which is ultimately what put Trump over the top.</p>

<p>Certainly, but the norm in this country for decades has been for presidential nominees to share with the country their financial stakes.

<p>I&#39;m not saying corruption doesn&#39;t exist but to use this as an excuse borders on divisive language; as an American I want to see my laws applied equally to all and I&#39;m not naive enough to believe this happens every time, but if there is evidence that Flynn was wronged, I&#39;d love to see it. </p>

<p>Until then I have to take it with a grain of salt. I had heard rumors of Flynn being dirty long before the election when some thought he would run for President so my distaste for him pre-dates Trump. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>everyone knows flynn was innocent, even Comey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you say innocent, do you mean <em>did nothing wrong</em> or didn&#39;t lie to the FBI? </p>

<p>The judge that recused himself? </p>

<p>Either way, why hasn&#39;t he rescinded his guilty plea? </p>

<p>And finally, is <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/foreign-policy/305021-our-ally-turkey-is-in-crisis-and-needs-our-support">this</a> not proof of failing to register...granted it&#39;s not treason as some have claimed he&#39;s guilty of, but lobbying on behalf of Turkey while being our incoming National Security Advisor is probably a tad troubling to some. </p>

<p>Finally, like a lot of things going on these days, words are spun and their meaning misconstrued - remember the &quot;insurance plan&quot;?? I heard so many people say stupid shit like, &quot;Stzork and Page were planning an insurance policy for Hillary...,&quot; when the context of the messages makes it perfectly clear what they were actually talking about when she referenced insurance policy. </p>

<p>This one with Comey is perhaps a similar example. This is the line you refer to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey told lawmakers that the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe that Flynn had lied to them, or that any inaccuracies in his answers were intentional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some will want to spin that as, &quot;See Comey is crooked!!!!&quot;</p>

<p>But what <strong>if</strong> what he&#39;s saying is, &quot;No, the agents didn&#39;t think Flynn was lying so if we hadn&#39;t intercepted those calls to the Russian ambassador we wouldn&#39;t have known he <em>was lying</em> at all.&quot;</p>

<p>The field agents don&#39;t have access to all of the evidence so perhaps the agents did believe Flynn but other agencies had proof he was lying. </p>

<p>The truth is <em>we don&#39;t know yet</em> but I hope we both hope that someday we&#39;ll know the truth about every angle of this thing and we&#39;ll be a better country for it; regardless of who&#39;s predictions are more accurate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make some really great points and your committment to justice for all is admirable.</p>

<p>In response I will ask, is it better to be uncondionally just and die at the end of season 1 like Ned Stark, or is it better to ride into the final battle on the back of a dragon like Tyrion Lannister? I believe that in my heart, Trump is a man of justice and heart that believes in himself and wants nothing more than to be loved by his fellow man and citizens. At his worst he is narcissistic, but he never backs down and he loves the people.</p>

<p>Based on what I have seen, any lies from Trump or his trusted people have been greatly exaggerated and taken out of context by the media. There is a difference between lieing in a moment of passion and emotion and a calculated lie at other peoples&#39; expense. I dont think anybody has a right to be above the law, and Trump has not been, especially in regards to Russia collusion.</p>

<p>Strzok and Page&#39;s relationship is fake. Its a smoke screen. There are higher up bad actors behind them.</p>

<p>Thats a good find on Flynn&#39;s dealings with Turkey.  I forgot about that. I bet that was why he plead guilty, because he knew he would have been dragged in the mud for it making Trump look dirty. He took one for the team. I still think that he has done more good than bad, and has the knowledge and network to really blow the cover off the deep state though, and I am betting that will happen. Thats what all these pardons is leading up to. Also, assange will get extradited and pardoned.</p>

<p>It is true that Turkey is an incredibly important ally in the region, maybe even moreso than Saudi Arabia. Turkey is very much on the fence and has been for a while. Turkey cannot fall. Fortunately, I think the people in Turkey identify more with Europe than they do with the Middle East, at least what I saw while there.</p>

<p>The insurance plan was just the tip of the iceberg. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>any lies from Trump or his trusted people have been greatly exaggerated and taken out of context by the media</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a fair assessment, although I disagree with your perception, let&#39;s focus on one: </p>

<p>&quot;I have no deals in Russia&quot;</p>

<p>DJT said this himself while working on Trump Tower Moscow. Who exaggerated that? Who took that out of context? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dont think anybody has a right to be above the law, and Trump has not been, especially in regards to Russia collusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Manafort&#39;s text to Oleg, &quot;How do we use this to get whole?,&quot; are you still going to argue there was <em>no collusion</em>? </p>

<p>I thought we had moved on  to the part where you guys start saying, &quot;Collusion isn&#39;t a crime!!&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Strzok and Page&#39;s relationship is fake. Its a smoke screen. There are higher up bad actors behind them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, I&#39;ll bite; are the text messages fake? Or did Obama tell them to start a secret affair?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thats a good find on Flynn&#39;s dealings with Turkey. I forgot about that. I bet that was why he plead guilty, because he knew he would have been dragged in the mud for it making Trump look dirty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think he plead guilty to lying about his conversations with Kysliak. He claimed they did <em>not</em> discuss sanctions and they did. </p>

<p>It&#39;s my belief that the reason we did not see him charged with more crimes (like assisting a foreign nation without registering for FARA, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, etc) is because <em>he flipped</em> and is now a cooperating witness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>has the knowledge and network to really blow the cover off the deep state though, and I am betting that will happen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is wishful thinking and I believe these <em>hopes</em> come from the same place as the whole #DraftOurDaughters campaign. </p>

<p>Honestly, I believe that Crooked Hillary, Drain the Swamp, Deep State, etc all come from the same psyop team but it&#39;s purely a gut instinct.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, Assange will get extradited and pardoned</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this come from Q or some other place?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The insurance plan was just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. That&#39;s not true at all. Have you read the texts?</p>

<p>We know that Obama wanted a bipartisan announcement regarding the election interference and McConnel <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/joe-biden-mitch-mcconnell-wanted-no-part-of-bipartisan-condemnation-of-russians-in-2016">refused</a>. </p>

<p>So the reference to an insurance policy is an analogy, here is the complete message:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he gets elected — but I&#39;m afraid we can’t take that risk. It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you&#39;re 40.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The chances of dying before 40 is slim and the chances of Trump being elected are slim, but we should be prepared for either outcome.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stayed up to date on Q, I have kept up to date with right wing media and I have colleagues who are huge supporters and they constantly give me new info so I feel like I&#39;m pretty familiar with both sides of this story. </p>

<p>With that being said, nothing has indicated yet that the FBI acted out of protocol and no excuse or deflection provided has explained away all of the contacts and connections between members of Trump&#39;s campaign and Russia.</p>
