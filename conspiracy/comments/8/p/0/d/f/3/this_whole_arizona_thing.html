The thing that bothers me is why would the rich individuals build a massive underground complex to do this in?  the individuals involved mostly live in massive fenced in mansions/ communities.  Every insanely rich individual I&#39;ve dealt with doesn&#39;t want any sense of being uncomfortable or inconvenience.   Why do pedo raping underground in a dim bunker when it could be done on a yacht, or behind a walled mansion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The large crime syndicates may be involved at a different level. The gangs bring the slaves in through rat lines. It is a mass production process. Then the stable is culled for different purposes: cheap labor, domestics, underground medical experiments, organ harvesting. </p>

<p>Only the more attractive are taken away for brothels, porn production, private prostitutes, etc. Only smaller numbers are exploited for more extreme criminality such as pedo rape. </p>

<p>And nobody is going out to the tunnel for that. Any signs you see of sexual exploitation is more for the gangs, mules and MS-13 types. No local John is going risk going out to such a sketchy location for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean this is all true, it&#39;s so annoying to see this downvoted by people who haven&#39;t even dabbled on this stuff. Purple is the color of death and poison in every culture, and there&#39;s plenty of stories from people (see the Disneyland paedo ring stories, google that) and you&#39;ll see they use color codes to tell what kid goes where. Yellow and purple are bad stuff.</p>

<p>Come on now dude, this is silly.  My grandma and all her friends LOVE the color purple.  It&#39;s like their spirit color or something.  Next thing you know my grandma and her rotary friends are all going to end up accused of pedophilia on some nut&#39;s blog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the whole thing is bunk. If there truly is a massive underground complex for transporting children, why the need for some rinky-dink camp on the ground? Also, where are the supposed blueprints for this complex anyway? Why does this &quot;veteran&quot; group insist on waiting for people to come see it themselves rather than just posting it online? This entire story is based on conjecture, people refusing to believe any other suggestion on what the camp is. It also doesn&#39;t help that the only people spreading this are the same nuts who think Q and Trump are going to save the nation from the demonic Democrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Some sick shit might have gone on at that location, but it&#39;s really reaching to say that it&#39;s connected to the owners of the land it&#39;s on, or the Mayor of the town. My guess is it may have belonged to a pack of lowlifes.</p>

<p>And besides, if high levels of government are corrupt and sheltering international pedos, why would they need this piece of shit place? I&#39;m sure they have very well hidden luxurious facilities for their ... activities. Remember when it came out that the Art in Embassies program gave Podesta and others a private shipping channel that bypassed inspection? <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1855938">see voat post detailing here</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO granted I do not have a ton of info on the subject is this site is human trafficking layover run by the cartels.  Most likely the people being processed here are people of all ages that cant pay the 3-6k it takes to be smuggled over the border.  These people of all ages who are unable to pay become slaves for the cartels.  Some sex slaves others working slaves.</p>

<p>Illegal Immigration is a VERY dirty business and the trauma these immigrants endure is insane.  I personally know three people here illegally and all have insane stories about what they had to endure to get here.  Rape, robbery, assault are the common denominator.  </p>
