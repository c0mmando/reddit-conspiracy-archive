       This is not pizzagate. We're not supposed to be going off on rumors and lack of facts and information. If we let pizzagate get brought into this sub, it'll get this sub shut down.

      <p>
       If there is child trafficking in Arizona, it must be discovered through real evidence not through some hearsay. Trust me, this kinds of actions will be used to bring down this sub.

       THIS IS NOT PIZZAGATE.

       those are credible and to be remembered.

      <p>
       It's pretty easy to tell a lot of these people are off-kilter. let's not be afraid to call a snake a snake. That conspiracy didn't begin with tony but rather the emails laid the foundation that was further built upon by further investigation; following the money etc: it turned up a lot of dirt going on around the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not be surprised if these two conspiracies intersect; as it does involve many of the same players time and time again.

       I hope it doesn't intersect. In the end, not evidence was found. It was just seen as a way to make fun of conspiracy theorists and achieved nothing in terms of helping children. This needs to be different and the fact people are coming on here on this thread to suggest it should cross paths or coming in to naysay, shows I'm right. The ones interested in making the Arizona situation go away, are trying to connect it with Pizzagate to have it lose credibility and steam regarding the public's perception.

       So it's pure coincidence the 'oddly sexual' camp was found on land owned by a company directly funded by the CF to build homes in Haiti?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also coincidence we're back to the CF so easily time and time again.
      </p>

       but really what you're saying is: "nothing to see here." and we're bad for theorizing with overwhelming circumstantial evidence.

       In the meantime

        this

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The contracts ended up going not to small local companies but to large international ones. Thor Construction, based in Minnesota, received $18 million, and CEMEX, a Mexican company, got over $7 million

       Cemex is partially owned by wealth management firm Bronfman Rothschild: CEO of Bronfman E.L. Rothschild is Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who is both a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and confidante of Hillary Clinton. In may 2016 Hillary's 100k-a-head fundraiser was headed by her.
      </p>
      <p>
       so they were friends. But check out this
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bronfman">
        boardmember
       </a>
       of Bronfman wealth: *
       <em>
        Bronfman's sister, Clare Bronfman is the Operations Director of the Clinton-connected NXIVM sex cult, while his other sister, Sara Bronfman, is a Clinton Global Initiative member.
*
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       A whistleblower from that boards says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "She's the enforcer-the brutal one. Clare's running the [operation] now, and she's the most ruthless of them. I'm issuing an absolute warning now.
        <strong>
         Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there's a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her
        </strong>
        ."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Most of the $150million dollars the NVIXM obtained was given by Sara and Clare
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman &amp; Rothschild.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including
        <em>
         Nancy Salzman
        </em>
        and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton's foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But it may just be coincidence this Tucson business happened under the nose of the Mayor, a Rothschild. Not to mention NVIXM is already in hot water for alleged sex trafficking
      </p>
      <p>
       researching hard here but haven't seen shit on Telmex, so please help a brother out.

       Maybe I'm dumb but I don't see what you're getting at. In fact they seem like separate deals.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it seems money was funneled from Clinton projects into mining operations to support a Haitian rebuild effort (years after the quake) and now a trafficking camp was found on the property of one of the firms. The fence article refers to CGI and not CGEP. Possibly related but separate things.

       Pizzagate has been amazing at discrediting in the public eye any research into actual child trafficking rings. Anybody trying to tie "pizzagate" to legitimate cases is poisoning the effort to stop child sex trafficking.

       The term "pizzagate" was designed to distill an entire global phenomenon into a myopic partisan political football to be kicked off into the periphery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The loaded (and kind of dumb) word should not be used as a descriptor for every one of the inevitably widespread occurrences of human trafficking, slavery, ritual murder, molestation or any abuse.

       Yeah I feel like that stupid term and bringing back the symbols of it is one big psyop to meld both occurrences together. This needs to be different. Arizona sex trafficking is real and there needs to be real proof to show it. We can't rely on rumors.

       No, it came about because people literally thought there was a basement and children were being abused in a place of business.

       Also the emails. Most of the terms of which were not written by Podesta. And pedophiles are always looking into any instance of "pizza" to find their sick interests.

       I hope it doesn't intersect. In the end, not evidence was found. It was just seen as a way to make fun of conspiracy theorists and achieved nothing in terms of helping children. This needs to be different and the fact people are coming on here on this thread to suggest it should cross paths or coming in to naysay, shows I'm right. The ones interested in making the Arizona situation go away, are trying to connect it with Pizzagate to have it lose credibility and steam regarding the public's perception.

       <a href="https://bostonreview.net/world/jake-johnston-haiti-earthquake-aid-caracol">
        this
       </a>
       article says
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The contracts ended up going not to small local companies but to large international ones. Thor Construction, based in Minnesota, received $18 million, and CEMEX, a Mexican company, got over $7 million
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Cemex is partially owned by wealth management firm Bronfman Rothschild: CEO of Bronfman E.L. Rothschild is Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who is both a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and confidante of Hillary Clinton. In may 2016 Hillary's 100k-a-head fundraiser was headed by her.
      </p>
      <p>
       so they were friends. But check out this
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bronfman">
        boardmember
       </a>
       of Bronfman wealth: *
       <em>
        Bronfman's sister, Clare Bronfman is the Operations Director of the Clinton-connected NXIVM sex cult, while his other sister, Sara Bronfman, is a Clinton Global Initiative member.
*
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       A whistleblower from that boards says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "She's the enforcer-the brutal one. Clare's running the [operation] now, and she's the most ruthless of them. I'm issuing an absolute warning now.
        <strong>
         Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there's a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her
        </strong>
        ."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Most of the $150million dollars the NVIXM obtained was given by Sara and Clare
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman &amp; Rothschild.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including
        <em>
         Nancy Salzman
        </em>
        and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton's foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But it may just be coincidence this Tucson business happened under the nose of the Mayor, a Rothschild. Not to mention NVIXM is already in hot water for alleged sex trafficking
      </p>
