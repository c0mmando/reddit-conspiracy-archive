<p>you still sound like your tying these together.</p>

<p>obviously we don&#39;t want to lead back into that because shills already have very established stories; so getting Tucson to equate to PG would be a loss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>those are credible and to be remembered.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to tell a lot of these people are off-kilter. let&#39;s not be afraid to call a snake a snake. That conspiracy didn&#39;t begin with tony but rather the emails laid the foundation that was further built upon by further investigation; following the money etc: it turned up a lot of dirt going on around the globe.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised if these two conspiracies intersect; as it does involve many of the same players time and time again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope it doesn&#39;t intersect. In the end, not evidence was found. It was just seen as a way to make fun of conspiracy theorists and achieved nothing in terms of helping children. This needs to be different and the fact people are coming on here on this thread to suggest it should cross paths or coming in to naysay, shows I&#39;m right. The ones interested in making the Arizona situation go away, are trying to connect it with Pizzagate to have it lose credibility and steam regarding the public&#39;s perception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>help me out bro with a link, would love to get my story straight!</p>

<p>In the meantime <a href="https://bostonreview.net/world/jake-johnston-haiti-earthquake-aid-caracol">this</a> article says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The contracts ended up going not to small local companies but to large international ones. Thor Construction, based in Minnesota, received $18 million, and CEMEX, a Mexican company, got over $7 million</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cemex is partially owned by wealth management firm Bronfman Rothschild: CEO of Bronfman E.L. Rothschild is Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who is both a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and confidante of Hillary Clinton. In may 2016 Hillary&#39;s 100k-a-head fundraiser was headed by her.</p>

<p>so they were friends. But check out this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bronfman">boardmember</a> of Bronfman wealth: *<em>Bronfman&#39;s sister, Clare Bronfman is the Operations Director of the Clinton-connected NXIVM sex cult, while his other sister, Sara Bronfman, is a Clinton Global Initiative member.
*</em></p>

<p>A whistleblower from that boards says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s the enforcer-the brutal one. Clare&#39;s running the [operation] now, and she&#39;s the most ruthless of them. I&#39;m issuing an absolute warning now. <strong>Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there&#39;s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her</strong>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the $150million dollars the NVIXM obtained was given by Sara and Clare</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman &amp; Rothschild.</p>

<p>Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including <em>Nancy Salzman</em> and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton&#39;s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it may just be coincidence this Tucson business happened under the nose of the Mayor, a Rothschild. Not to mention NVIXM is already in hot water for alleged sex trafficking</p>

<p>researching hard here but haven&#39;t seen shit on Telmex, so please help a brother out.</p>

<p>Thanks for the CEMEX funding article.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>US President Bill Clinton, notorious Mexican telecom magnate Carlos Slim, and Canadian businessman Frank Giustra, who has made a career out of major investments worldwide in mining, from gold and diamonds to uranium, among other industries.</p>

<p>The visit was ostensibly to promote a local project of the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP), which both Giustra and Slim finance with $100 million donations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I&#39;m dumb but I don&#39;t see what you&#39;re getting at. In fact they seem like separate deals.</p>

<p>To me it seems money was funneled from Clinton projects into mining operations to support a Haitian rebuild effort (years after the quake) and now a trafficking camp was found on the property of one of the firms. The fence article refers to CGI and not CGEP. Possibly related but separate things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope it doesn&#39;t intersect. In the end, not evidence was found. It was just seen as a way to make fun of conspiracy theorists and achieved nothing in terms of helping children. This needs to be different and the fact people are coming on here on this thread to suggest it should cross paths or coming in to naysay, shows I&#39;m right. The ones interested in making the Arizona situation go away, are trying to connect it with Pizzagate to have it lose credibility and steam regarding the public&#39;s perception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>help me out bro with a link, would love to get my story straight!</p>

<p>In the meantime <a href="https://bostonreview.net/world/jake-johnston-haiti-earthquake-aid-caracol">this</a> article says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The contracts ended up going not to small local companies but to large international ones. Thor Construction, based in Minnesota, received $18 million, and CEMEX, a Mexican company, got over $7 million</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cemex is partially owned by wealth management firm Bronfman Rothschild: CEO of Bronfman E.L. Rothschild is Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who is both a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and confidante of Hillary Clinton. In may 2016 Hillary&#39;s 100k-a-head fundraiser was headed by her.</p>

<p>so they were friends. But check out this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bronfman">boardmember</a> of Bronfman wealth: *<em>Bronfman&#39;s sister, Clare Bronfman is the Operations Director of the Clinton-connected NXIVM sex cult, while his other sister, Sara Bronfman, is a Clinton Global Initiative member.
*</em></p>

<p>A whistleblower from that boards says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;She&#39;s the enforcer-the brutal one. Clare&#39;s running the [operation] now, and she&#39;s the most ruthless of them. I&#39;m issuing an absolute warning now. <strong>Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there&#39;s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her</strong>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the $150million dollars the NVIXM obtained was given by Sara and Clare</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman &amp; Rothschild.</p>

<p>Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including <em>Nancy Salzman</em> and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton&#39;s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it may just be coincidence this Tucson business happened under the nose of the Mayor, a Rothschild. Not to mention NVIXM is already in hot water for alleged sex trafficking</p>

<p>researching hard here but haven&#39;t seen shit on Telmex, so please help a brother out.</p>
