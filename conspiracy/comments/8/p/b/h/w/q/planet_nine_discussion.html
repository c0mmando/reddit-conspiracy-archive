        Caltech Researchers Find Evidence of a Real Ninth Planet
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Caltech researchers have found evidence of a giant planet tracing a bizarre, highly elongated orbit in the outer solar system. The object, which the researchers have nicknamed Planet Nine, has a mass about 10 times that of Earth and orbits about 20 times farther from the sun on average than does Neptune (which orbits the sun at an average distance of 2.8 billion miles). In fact, it would take this new planet between 10,000 and 20,000 years to make just one full orbit around the sun.
       </p>
       <p>
        The researchers,

         Konstantin Batygin
        </a>

        <a href="http://web.gps.caltech.edu/%7Embrown/">
         Mike Brown
        </a>
        , discovered the planet's existence through mathematical modeling and computer simulations but have not yet observed the object directly.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine," said Konstantin Batygin, a planetary astrophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California, whose team may be closing in. "If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve. All of a sudden, you have five different puzzles, and you must come up with five different theories to explain them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While NASA originally denied the presence of the planet, they are now making the case that the planet almost certainly exists. Which is, in my opinion, suspicious. Let's discuss their motives and the ninth planet itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would NASA make a case that planet nine almost certainly exists, while they originally denied the presence of the planet?
       <br/>
       Would NASA tell us when they found this planet?
       <br/>
       What would the impact of such a planet be when it gets in our solar system again?
       <br/>
       Is the ninth planet populated?
       <br/>
       When will it return to our solar system?

       Maybe they denied it as a "yeah whatever loser scientists, we have the best shit in the world to detect another planet and we haven't seen shit"

       What is concerning is that the estimated orbit of the Sun. When was the last great flood/disaster?
      </p>
      <p>
       A planet with a mass 20 times the size of Earth, if it orbits close enough, could definitely fuck up the tides. With the moon pulling the tides one way and this surly bastard pulling them another way, it doesn't take a genius or active imagination to ponder on what that would mean for the Earth, which would be turned into a huge sloshing ball of seawater.

       Very interesting point you are making.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think a great global flood, as described in the Bible and in
       <a href="http://www.icr.org/article/why-does-nearly-every-culture-have-tradition-globa/">
        many other ancient cultures,
       </a>
       was caused by such a planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Graham Hancock theorizes those stories might indicate
       <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/environment/did-a-comet-impact-cause-massive-wildfires-that-extended-the-ice-age/">
        the meteorite impact
       </a>
       12800 years ago, but such an impact would not only have caused floods, but also earthquakes, fires, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earthquakes, multiple floods and fires are not mentioned in 95&amp;#37; of those stories, just one great global flood.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is however funny that 66&amp;#37; of the stories tell that the flood was caused by the wickedness of mankind.

       To be honest, I'd be more afraid of meteors being launched at us by the disturbance of such a mass coming into the solar system, than I would be about tidal issues.

       It could have been a combination of flood and meteor. Who knows what cosmic space crap is being pulled along by the gravity of Planet Nine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Messing with the tidal swell would create a flood. It would also shift glaciers at a high speed during an ice age.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how much evidence would be still around after 20,000 years and two great floods.

       It would have to get so close to the earth though that it would basically be a comet at that point. Jupiter is over 300 times the mass of earth and a fuck ton closer than this ninth planet would be.

       I think you're reading into it the wrong way.  They only 'denied' it by saying that there's no evidence of it - at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If i don't know about something like.. whatever, say.. electrons.  If at the time i'm unable to detect them, i'll say that they don't exist because of a lack of evidence.  If later on someone else proves it, that doesn't mean that i was trying to cover anything up, just because i couldn't prove it at the time.

       NASA just denied the existence of the planet, altough they were familiar with the hypothesis. With the influence of NASA, telling the public that a planet does not exist (based on "we have never seen this planet), is very wrong and causes people to not research on this topic anymore.
Maybe that is what they wanted?
      </p>
      <p>
       But then why are they telling us now that planet nine probably does exist?

       They're scientists, they won't confirm that something exists until it can be empirically proven.

       So given that, they won't say it's real until it's been confirmed.  I think that's fine.  They'll say that "yes, this most likely exists, but we can't actually prove it yet".

       So they build bunkers to live in ok. That's not going to last long, and what exactly will they do when they emerge, they will have no family, friends or loved ones to go to. A huge part of the population gone and what's left will be scattered across the globe. Can't exactly start a NWO of sorts as there will be nothing to order.

       Hmm pretty sure they have been looking for this thing for at least 30 years. I suggest you look up Dr Harrington and the new York Times article about the 10th planet. Also it's hard to guess the real mass because of time dilation effects from such a huge mass hurtling through space.

       If it's a dark star. A second son. That would actually make the warnings in the bible make more sense.

       Did you know there are brown dwarfs out there colder than anywhere on earth. But they also produce infrared radiation from processes happening underneath the surface. Also a brown dwarf the size of Jupiter has a magnetic field stronger than our suns.

       I have a funny personal theory about Planet Nine...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Killed_Pluto_and_Why_It_Had_It_Coming">
        Noted Discordian Mike Brown
       </a>
       discovered the planet Eris and in doing so, he relegated Pluto to non-planetary status.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had Pluto not been demoted, Planet Nine would be Planet 10... or Planet X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait, wait, it gets better.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, according to the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine#Naming">
        Planet Nine Wikipedia page
       </a>
       a couple of the names that Brown &amp; co. have used for Planet Nine have included Jehosaphat, and George.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Jehosaphat and George are euphemisms for the word God, or Jesus. ("Jumpin' Jesus!" / "Jumpin' Jehosaphat!" / "By God!" / "By George!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if we take all the rumours and conjecture and outright fantasy surrounding Planet X to be true, when it reappears we are in for some trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Bible, when Jesus reappears, we are also in for some trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I guess my theory is that Mike Brown is trying to bring about the end times by simultaneously resurrecting Jesus and bringing about the reality of Planet X.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, I know... I must be a genius to have figured this out.

       First of all, love this theory. The Bible has more stories that can be linked with astronomy, like for example
       <a href="http://christinprophecyblog.org/2017/08/investigating-the-great-sign-of-revelation-12/">
        Revelation 12
       </a>
       . Is the Bible a warning for something that is coming?
      </p>
      <p>
       Planet X is often linked with Nibiru (Sumerian' planet), what do you think of that?

       Honestly, I don't think we can say or know anything with certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like the Bible and other ancient holy texts contain a lot of wisdom. Some of it is pretty explicit, but there's also a lot of deeper meaning (particularly in the Bible). I personally do not think it is the literal word of god though.
      </p>
      <p>
       We humans are certainly very skilled at making interpretations of signs in the heavens... and who knows, maybe just by believing in such prophecies, we inadvertently bring them about through some kind of collective unconscious will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: Sitchin/Nibiru... honestly, I think Sitchin got a little bit ahead of himself with his translations. But I suppose we'll find out soon huh? All of these myths and imaginings spring from somewhere deep in our collective mind, so I suspect there is some truth to it, but it's more akin to us saying "That is a grey wall" when really, it is an elephant.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, I am sure that I am onto something with my theory on Mike Brown's Erisian motivations!

        Then, effectively by accident, Batygin and Brown noticed that if they ran their simulations with a massive planet in an anti-aligned orbit—an orbit in which the planet's closest approach to the sun, or perihelion, is 180 degrees across from the perihelion of all the other objects and known planets—the distant Kuiper Belt objects in the simulation assumed the alignment that is actually observed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       At it's closest approach to the Sun it's 180 degrees offset. Meaning it would be nowhere near to Earth and have no impact. Not in this article, but I remember another stating the closest perihelon possible was around 40 AU. KBO are around 80 AU.

       Would that bring it close to other planets or asteroid belts? An impact anywhere in the solar system could sent massive trouble our way. Not even necessarily impacts, if it comes close to a belt just the gravity alone might sent an entire flock of objects our way.

       Your not understanding it's orbit. It's eccentric and prependicular in relation to the planets during perihelion. At closest approach to the sun it's actually not close to any planet. Think 3D.
      </p>
      <p>
       It passes through the plane we are on around the KBO at 80 AU. In essense can only interact with KBO(Ignoring very light gravitational tugging on Pluto or Neptune).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for gravitational slingshots, remember that the point of slingshot will become part of the new orbit and not some wild new trajectory. In addition from the article the KBO are being tugged by it and not in close enough proximity. It's morr an orbit alignment than a completely new orbit. We are also talking about orbits more distant than Pluto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probability wise it's extremely unlikely.

       NASA changes their mind as evidence changes. If they developed new tech that detected it, they would change their opinion.

       It's almost certainly not populated as a planet with that orbit would not be livable

       NASA would immediately tell us as all their research is public domain
