       I already posted this before but I'll continue posting this as many times as it takes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hi guys. So I've been thinking a lot about recent events, a lot of people are frustrated with the shilling and there have been a lot of downs from our side because of the censorship going on at reddit. There are dark powers that don't want the corruption we talk about here to reach others so we are constantly under attack... Since a lot of mods that are loyal to the conspiracy community have exposed the brigading, the constant attacks and the stalking against them to the admins and there has been almost no response, It's safe to say that there is a lot of corruption going on in reddit itself. I'm not saying all the reddit staff is involved but considering some mods get death threats often, well we have reasons to be paranoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       User
       <a href="/u/magnora7">
        /u/magnora7
       </a>
       created a new website called Saidit. I was hoping you guys would join us over there in order to have a better control of the attacks going on against us, but It's also to weaken their monopoly of information. Basically I'm not telling you guys to quit reddit either, I think we still gotta keep up the fight over here. As I already said, the people in power don't like the fact that we expose the corruption going on in nearly all governments and as much as I think the quality of reddit itself has gone down, this place still reaches a lot of people. So I think It's important we take the responsability to continue posting about the political conspiracies. No I'm not trying to turn this into a fight of political conspiracies vs non political vs alternative stories, those of you who follow me know that I post about all that kind of shit. I'm just explaining the importance of exposing the corruption of politics. If we can weaken their monopoly of information we will be able to get a whole bunch of people not only on our side, but also against the true criminals behind the conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we gotta constantly keep up the fight over here, organize ourselves at Saidit at the same time, while using all our resources to convince regular users to leave reddit by exposing them to the corruption going on and make them go over there too. So I'll need all the help you can give me to make regular users see the truth. All political subs, no not just here but even outside reddit itself have huge amounts of censorship and exaggerations of political correctness going on and we are probably the biggest community out there that knows about the secrets the people in power keep hiding from everyone, so we better take offensive actions don't you agree?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also call the guys of TMoR and shills in general that attack this sub to surrender. I don't know what caused you to go down this path, be it apathy or a need of money or whatever, but for all the reasons I talked about before, you gotta admit there is a meaning in what we do if the information we talk about here reaches others and the constant attacks and demonization against the conspiracy community make that difficult. I admit we have our flaws but nobody is perfect. You can't use the excuse that what we do here doesn't matter anymore... so If you can tell us why you do it, who do you work for and if you can expose them in any way, I'm sure we would all appreciate it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you have all noticed it, but we are in the middle of an information warfare.

       Can you prove that you are not closely allied, or the same users, as TMOR? Can you prove that your precise aim is not to break up r/Conspiracy even more than it is now fracturing?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, that's a direct accusation. Getting another little Voat-like constellation going will do nothing to actually make progress on conspiracy action items - which I think you know very well.

       Did you even read the post? I'm not telling you guys to leave this place and go to saidit in order to create another echo chamber. I think we gotta constantly keep the fight over here while we re-group over there at the same time and try to convince regular users of doing the same. Your accusations make no sense.

       It wasn't gamesmanship, it was just addressing that your claim was equally baseless as the claim you addressed was baseless. You claimed you were speaking with sock puppets, but without providing proof, even something circumstantial or something that would explain your reasoning, your words were equally unhelpful.

       Honesty and goodness are hard to come by here, but it's those sentiments, in spite of all the absurdity, that comprise the basis for my username. Didn't at all mean to have the appearance of jumping down your throat, just wanted to address the inconsistency that immediately jumped out. I'll check out what you suggested.

       It's not worse here at Reddit than anywhere else, in my experience it is better than in some places on the internet I have known which claimed "here you can speak about anything you want" but in the end were censoring you left and right and anything inbetween. But maybe that's just because I finally accepted to tread like on eggshells and that's all...

       The very fact we aren't sure what these words imply in an internet forum speaks for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all anonymous, so we can say anything we want without consequence in the real world. We are subject to an "incentive plan" that gives us "karma" not for honest opinions, but rather for "leading the pack" into voting one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are all sorts of other economic activities, short of outright shilling, amounting to PR and advertising, that might be involved in how we shape and self-audit our comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, we have the opportunity to open multiple accounts and switch between them, carrying on as different personae and saying in one disguise the opposite of what we said in the previous one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honesty implies that when we speak or write, our ONLY concern is to say what we actually believe, from our inner core, and not willfully deceive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Goodness is an effort to live and act in such a way that others are benefited and uplifted. Goodness implies that we try, to the best of our ability, to seek and do the right thing, knowing that we may fail, because it will always be difficult to see the outcomes of our present actions on future events.

       Building isn't the problem. Such systems exist, but getting people to use them is hard. Also usability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until recently when the narrative shaping and disinfo got turnt up to 11, it was very very hard to convince people to give up their low / zero-barrier-to-entry echo chambers and put a bit more effort into their interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully the value there is now becoming super clear to those who give af. You don't sound like you'd take much convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully in a coupla years we'll be on the same footing as the think tanks, analysts and agencies that are already using the same sort of tooling against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cynicism. Yeah, that's also a problem, but I think one born of this sorta problem space.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it's so hard to even clearly define / have a conv about the problem(s), it makes solving them feel like some sorta Sisyphean task.

       Just a side note to nobody - every time I get massively upvoted at the same time tmor is likely involved - i feel a bit queasy. I always wondered how you could just produce 10-15 votes out of thin air...

       It is news to me too (and quite worrying too) that there are mods here on Reddit who got death threats. If this is true, it can't be something which should be taken lightly.

       Did you even read the post? I'm not telling you guys to leave this place and go to saidit in order to create another echo chamber. I think we gotta constantly keep the fight over here while we re-group over there at the same time and try to convince regular users of doing the same. Your accusations make no sense.
