       OK, so I posted this topic last week and I think there is more to "Q" than just Assange. The fact that his internet is cut, then the Great Awakening board is down, makes it seem more and more plausible. As to why the posts continue.... I have also said in the past that I think Bannon, Roger Stone, Assange got together to create this whole deal and I think one of them have picked up the posts once he was cut from internet access. I think they sent out a message the board had been compromised as cover, then picked up the posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone find this disturbing? Take out the fact that this guy is acting as a proxy for the president of the United States. I mean, I wonder how much stuff was given to Assange/Wikileaks during the election that he buried? Things that would have made Trump look bad. You know damn well that he got stuff but since he was Pro-GOP in the election, only DNC/HRC things were leaked. Once the Wikileaks Task Force started leaking their convos with him, I lost all respect for his "showing the truth". There is an agenda here and it isn't trying to show that Trump is saving the world. It is to cover Trump's ass when the shit from his dirt starts hitting the fan.  This whole deal just stinks to me.

       Also, their "voice" has not been consistent. They write in code, then they don't write in code. Like it's just a bunch of nonsense.

       Q being 12-year-old Barron Trump trolling in his bedroom is more convincing to me than anyone with actual power/intel.

       This entire post is literally you snowballing one "thought" into the next...most of these thoughts have absolutely 0 factual weight behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the past two years, Julian Assange has definitely proven to be a little less apolitical than many of us originally thought, but comparing Assange to "Q" is absolutely ludicrous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q is a fucking joke and I would bet the person who made it all up is 18 years old +/- 2-3 years.

       This is a conspiracy sub right? The only thing that has no factual weight is my assessment that Assange is "Q". Do you not find it strange that the day after his internet is cut, the page is shut down?
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a lot less apolitical than many thought? He was blatantly for the GOP in this election, which is why his own circle leaked his convos with them. He was no longer apolitical.
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe you are right, I bet Barron Trump is "Q".

       In that case, I would guess you haven't been seeking out conspiracy knowledge because pretty much everything he said was cherry picked from other discussions on Reddit/4Chan and then tied together in a fantastical fashion.

       <em>
        'What has Q accurately predicted?'

       on the usual shady parts of the net, and one of the 'proofs' was a mention of the phrase
       <em>
        'tip-top'
       </em>
       on one of Q's cryptic word salads... and then on the Eastern speech there is Trump saying

       . Quite a coincidence... or just proof Q is some insider joker (maybe Jr?) larping a psyop designed to keep the Trump base hopeful and supportive.

       Or tip-top is a fairly common turn of phrase and if posting endless numbers of word salad posts, eventually one of the common words or phrases in them is likely to end up in some important speech, merely out of coincidence?

       Trump could be reading Q’s posts and playing into the effort. All he would have to do is look for obvious signals like this and then fit them into his speeches or tweets.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could even have a staffer read the posts and tell him what to include.

       He did link to a pirate copy of a book with 2 letter Os turned into Q.

      <p>
       That's about as far as I can see the link.  Didn't Q post some pictures from a plane?  I don't think Assange could have done that.

       In that case, I would guess you haven't been seeking out conspiracy knowledge because pretty much everything he said was cherry picked from other discussions on Reddit/4Chan and then tied together in a fantastical fashion.
