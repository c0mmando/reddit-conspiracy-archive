<p>That&#39;s the most racist nazi alt-right comment you could have made. Obama was brilliant Intellectual and best President we ever had who gave poor people tax funded Obama phones and Obama care which is pretty close and one step away from single payer when no one else did shit because white privilege, and the city I live in has had a massive influx of Muslim refugees which is the best for Diversity and to even out the white privilege folks and we now have record numbers of beautifully built mosques everywhere because America needs to be diverse no mater what racists say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that true when they come from his personal account and not the official POTUS account? People often forget that the vast majority of these tweets are coming from @realDonaldTrump, which is his personal account and not @POTUS (the official account). </p>

<p>Also - Is everything Trump says an &quot;Official Statement of the President of the United States&quot;? Has that always been the case or is this a new thing in the last year and a half? Is this something we&#39;re going to retroactively apply to presidents? How about all those &quot;hot mic&quot; moments from past presidents, are those official statements? </p>

<p>This is a mostly-honest question (the second half is kinda snoody, I agree). I&#39;m really curious if we&#39;re now considering things the president says when not acting in an official capacity (on his personal account) as official statements. I&#39;m really curious, if true, when and where (and why) this started. </p>

<p>So how does that apply to other things, as I&#39;ve asked? Are hot-mic moments also official statements, if they are made public? How about a speech given to WH employees which is then leaked (thus made public)? </p>

<p>And also, can you cite the source of this law? I don&#39;t, frankly, care what you <em>think</em> is true. I&#39;m actually really curious about the law here and how that&#39;s going to be applied historically and in the future. </p>

<p>(1)</p>

<p>The term “documentary material” means all books, correspondence, memoranda, documents, papers, pamphlets, works of art, models, pictures, photographs, plats, maps, films, and motion pictures, including, but not limited to, audio and visual records, or other electronic or mechanical recordations, whether in analog, digital, or any other form.</p>

<p>(2)The term “Presidential records” means documentary materials, or any reasonably seg­regable portion thereof, created or received by the President, the President’s immediate staff, or a unit or individual of the Executive Office of the President whose function is to advise or assist the President, in the course of conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President</p>

<p><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2201">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2201</a></p>

<p>So yeah tweets from the president are considered official records. You&#39;re welcome for doing your research. </p>

<p>This is the problem. Is talking on his personal twitter account &quot;constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President&quot;? Has that ever been tested and tried? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing &quot;documentary material&quot; -- documenting what the president says is vastly different from being &quot;Presidential Record&quot; or an &quot;Official statement of the President of the United States&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m aware of that, as well. But again, that doesn&#39;t make them actual official statements. </p>

<p>The claim here is &quot;What Trump tweets are official White House statements&quot;. I don&#39;t really care how people think of his tweets. That doesn&#39;t really concern me. I&#39;m far more interested in the legality (can we call it legality? I&#39;m not sure of the right word) of if his tweets are <em>actually</em> official statements or not. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very interesting topic, IMO.. how the internet is going to shape future presidencies. So far, I haven&#39;t been able to find an answer (and I&#39;ve been looking). The most I could find is people saying that the Presidential Library is &quot;documenting&quot; his tweets. But again, documenting is a lot different than official statements. </p>

<p>What I find to be of dubious value is your contribution here. As if, being on reddit for 9 years, you have an expectation that it is compulsory for me to reply to every comment that you think I should. I think you know better than that, as if you have not seen a comment section before that an OP wasn&#39;t babysitting and fighting with everyone. I think you know that was not really the purpose and intention behind my post.</p>

<p>I think you are just trying to be a dick, just to be a dick. I guess that&#39;s fine with me, that after 9 years on reddit, you appear to have come so far and learned so much. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that you made the statement that your post would be met with a &quot;deafening silence&quot;... it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I dont need 9 years on reddit to see what your refusal to acknowledge that you were wrong (not just wrong but pretentious and condescending about it) says about you, dick.</p>

<p>I kinda love the fact your knee jerk reaction is to check my account age. That tells me that had my account age been below some threshold you alone deem appropriate, you&#39;d have immediately called me a shill or troll.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t need 9 years on reddit to understand what that says about you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One&#39;s a vertical merger (ATT/Time Warner) which means it&#39;s danger to US power, while the Sinclair deal strengthens a mostly non-vertically structured holding company in one struggling industry: local media. </p>

<p>vs </p>

<p>But really they are both negative for society, but the greater danger in terms of corporate power vs state power is supply chain monopolization of TW-ATT. The sinclair merger is more related to media control in the us. Since it&#39;s currently controlled entirely by rapists and assholes, the ultimate impact is fewer assholes with more industry control, so basically a push in terms of quality corporate reporting: definitley not better, but probably not worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually not true.</p>

<p>First off anti-trust laws are completely arbitrary, you&#39;re being lied to about the real reason for them, which is government control. Let me explain:</p>

<p>Oh you&#39;re selling a product really really cheap? DUMPING - ILLEGAL! 
Oh you&#39;re selling a product much higher than competitors? YOU MUST HAVE MONOPOLY - ILLEGAL!
Oh you have same price as your competitors? COLLUSION - ILLEGAL!</p>

<p>Study history. Historical facts do not match up with what you&#39;re describing (typical econ theory). Standard Oil had 90% of the market share and it was in a free market (no regulation). Now according to your theory about how monopolies work, the price of oil should have gone up and the quality of oil should have gone down. What actually happened? The prices decreased and the quality increased. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Because Rockefeller understood that if he jacked up prices or decreased quality he opened himself up to competition, which he didn&#39;t want. The truth is that companies that EARN monopolies in free markets, by producing at lower cost but higher quality, not only deserve it, but that its a good thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s when you have governmental interfere to FAVOR a company (subsidies, tax breaks) and then it creates a monopoly, where other companies CANNOT compete fairly. The government interference ruins the market.</p>

<p>Fun fact - what was the competitor who beat out Standard Oil? 
Electricity... god damn the free market is awesome</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, what the fuck kind of an-cap libertarian Koch brother Heroin are you smoking?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil_Co._of_New_Jersey_v._United_States">Standard Oil Co of New Jersey v. United States</a> was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey guilty of monopolizing the petroleum industry through a series of abusive and anticompetitive actions. The Court&#39;s remedy was to divide Standard Oil into several geographically separate and eventually competing firms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What the fuck are you talking about, the competitor who beat out Standard Oil? Two remnants of Standard Oil are ExonnMobil and Chevron, two of the largest corporations in the world. </p>

<p>And to refute your more general incomprehensible &quot;free markets only&quot; rabble, I&#39;ll refer to Adam Smith himself (the father of capitalism):</p>

<p>On cartels: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment or diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On monopoly: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“monopolists, by keeping the market constantly understocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smith’s words are the philosophical backbone of our antitrust laws. Anyone with the capacity to fucking read a book should have the ability to sniff through your batshit-insane interpretation of our nation&#39;s anti-trust laws</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so read and comprehend this time since it escaped you the first time...</p>

<p>Found guilty under the Sherman Antitrust Act... which I already explained to you is a completely arbitrary law used as a club against companies... remember this:
&quot;Oh you&#39;re selling a product really really cheap? DUMPING - ILLEGAL!</p>

<p>Oh you&#39;re selling a product much higher than competitors? YOU MUST HAVE MONOPOLY - ILLEGAL! </p>

<p>Oh you have same price as your competitors? COLLUSION - ILLEGAL!&quot;</p>

<p>That is how the Sherman Antitrust Act works, so the fact Standard Oil was considered illegal under it is not an argument, its just proof of governmental abuse to control companies... LOL</p>

<p>Also, you&#39;ve completely ignored what ACTUALLY happened, historically and factually TRUE data - which is that even with the Standard Oil monopoly prices DECREASED and quality INCREASED.... which is exactly opposite of what you are imagining would happen when you said: &quot;the captains of industry can abuse their power to extort payment, reduce competition, and squeeze every last dime out of their customers&quot; - you are wrong, this does not and has never happened in a free market, ever. This is a theoretically made up premise that has never actually happened historically. </p>

<p>The only REAL monopolies that have ever been detrimental are the ones that the government enforces through subsidies and tax breaks, therefore manipulating the market.  Monopolies in the free market do not do what you are imagining, and its proven historically.</p>
