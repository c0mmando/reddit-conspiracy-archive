       The goal is not to cover the hurt parts of ourselves back up, the goal is to enter our pain fully and heal it. Follow the crippling anxiety. Feel it until you fully digest it. Then you are forever free of that particular anxiety and have grown to a new level of self-actualization/self-mastery

      <p>
       Can psychedelics assist in opening one's mind? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they necessary to do so? No.

      <p>
       Are there potential downsides to using them? Yes.

       Yes, but not as a rule. There are other ways to go about it, but I also feel like hallucinogens can be a great tool to break through whatever conditioning you're under. Microdosing might be the happy medium

       You work way up from microdosing to full dosing and then to multiple at the same dosing and when you reach those thresholds and your mental construct navigation map sequence mind generator adapts to the modus operandi of deminsions you have traveled into, then you start titrating your lsd with ever increasing amounts of DMT crystals so the merging of Dan Tians happens in rapid motion of all 3 becoming one mega omnipresence dan tian of all information available at all time while the entuties embue with mega downloads of secret matrix intitiation code of truth fluctuations and your being transcends all existence but that's not where it ends, you have to also source out Iboga and incorporate the mega supreme trip beyond time and space which constitutes 10 LSD tabs, a mega dose of Iboga, and just before the body dismantles into crystalline non-binary informational complexes via junk DNA activation factors for reality control performance manifesting in real time carbon based molecules via thought and will is when you vaporize the correct temp DMY crystals which sends you to the Ultimate dimension that transcends the lower ones the people originally thought were the higher ones

       I think its BP is 165c. or 350f. or so. You vaporizor should work fine. The dan tians are far superior to the chakras and are deeper and more fundamental and they themselves are conscious living being that are within you and you can merge with and experience their level of reality, and also when you reach god tier dimension through multidosing lsd with dmt and iboga then the body stops breathing and chi automatically starts breathing and enliving the body on its own and with the afterglow from the trip with the chi still pumping through thr dan tians you reach inedia where you dont need to eat and are sustained by the chi (they call it Bigu in QiGong) and I didn't eat anything for 3 weeks besides water and was in optimal energy levels juts knew intuitively to enter into a fast to purify the dan tians and the chi starts pumping even more when you are in afterglow post fast stage

       UDT is the center of sentience but it has to be awakened in enters into halo expanded state and light and then connects to the heart which science shows has brain neurons as well as the gut having brain neurons and is also LDT and all 3 of these are living sentience that exist in their own dimensions when awakened with their own intelligence that is completely way beyond transcending everything that is status quo existence like basically you enter such heightened sensitivty to tap water being poisoned w fluoride and non-organic foods, wifi, tv signals, cell signals and its literally only in the woods you are safe and connected to the tree/nature energy creates a feedback loop by giving out a nature based chi that interacts and pumps the dan tian chi with its own so you are connected to nature consciousness and the elements and spirits that exist with the forest. People dont even think any of this is possible but the psychdelics open up matrix like movie type unfathomable realities and aspects of your being like the subconscious that most dont even have access too

       I'm not sure if u/beardbrawn is right, that 
u/OT-GOD-IS-DEMIURGE is pulling your leg. But when OT says things like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...the mega supreme trip beyond time and space which constitutes 10 LSD tabs,.."
      </p>
      <p>
       And then this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "People dont even think any of this is possible but the psychdelics open up matrix like movie type unfathomable realities and aspects of your being like the subconscious that most dont even have access too"
      </p>
      <p>
       That shit is just asking for some potentially serious trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/u/OT-GOD-IS-DEMIURGE">
        /u/OT-GOD-IS-DEMIURGE
       </a>
       ,
      </p>
      <p>
       Gtfo with that shit. Even working your way up with years of safe trip, doing that much LSD, especially adding DMT to the  mix, is asking for trouble. Especially if you get fixated on bullshit like the second quote. LSD will not give you fucking matrix powers but taking 10 doses and fixating on some fairytales some stranger told you online is a good way to wind up jumping off a building or frying your brain or giving yourself a heart attack or a stroke overheating and on and on and on. This is not the kind of advice that should be given out lightly or too strangers online and it's not the kind of thing anyone should say to try and troll someone for lulz. OT, c'mon man, either that's a shitty trol or shitty advice, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than working your way up, OT didn't give out one bit of advice on harm reduction and/or how to set yourself up for a safe trip, like make sure and hydrate, don't get caught up tryng to extend your trip past the first dose, don't keep more tabs or drugs and alcohol were you can get to them too easily, make sure you are in a safe environment with friends, make sure you don't have access to car keys, make sure you don't get naked in public, consider having an experienced "trip-sitter" with you, etc. etc. I'd advise skipping the LSD all together and going for a very low dose of mushrooms from a proven source unless your LSD source is rock solid and the dosage undeniably small if you are in-experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure and cement it in your brain that while drugs may expand your consciousness and open the doors of mental perception, no drugs will ever give you super powers. There is always an equal and opposite reaction to everything. While you may feel your consciousness expanding with psychedelics in particular, you also have to deal with impared judgement and hallucinations while making what could be life altering decisions.

       The weak of heart and mind will still try. you're playing a game,lvl 1. given  nothing but a stick. someone tells you there's a cheat code to literal godly powers that you can use right away. Are they going to A. slowly grind up to that stage, or B. use the cheats straight away. 
Food for thought.

       Whoever is supposed to reach god mode will, everyone else will be prevented from it. I've shared these experiences with a lot of people, but none of them have ever gone on these journeys besides doing a half a tab or a quick trip into non-breakthrough dmt elf realms, and those 2 alone filter out the weak

       I'm not saying there's no place for information like that to be given to people, but filling peoples heads with ideas of grandeur could lead people down a path they are not fully prepared for. while true, the weak will be prevented that won't stop them trying, wont stop them seeking more stronger psychs to get to that stage, and that can ultimately leave our side, the free thinking side, down someone. if you want to teach someone to take that's fine, but do not convince them of godhood on the first lesson.

       But reaching "god mode" for humans via drugs does not ever truly entail:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...the psychdelics open up matrix like movie type unfathomable realities and aspects of your being like the subconscious that most dont even have access too."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just way too vague and open to misinterpretation. Just the fact that you think reaching "god mode" is actually possible for some people without qualifying that statement a little better shows your real level expertise and understanding and near complete disregard for the safety of people who may be inclined to take you advice, from the grade-schoolers to the mentally unstable to people who weigh less than you or just have a low tolerance. Oh hey, look at the clock, it's right about the time the entire West coast just got out of school and maybe got home just in time to jump online and see what's interesting on Reddit today.

       I don't see death and worries and warnings like you do. That, and doing Lucy, DMT, and iboga will knock your meat suit on its ass and there is no getting back up until things sort themselves out, which is why I'm not worried

       So basically total disregard for the safety of the person to whom you were apparently try to help find enlightenment. So whether that person may be a child, or emotionally unstable and immature or just have a biological intolerance to the chemicals you recommend you only gavr the most cursory of warnings and only after I prompted you too and then you doubled down on your own ignorance because you're such an enlightened tough guy and who cares the advice you gave (not someone else) to a stranger online, without you having any forethought whatsoever of the consequences and the fact there very well could be a direct line from that shitty advice to the person who received it jumping off a fucking building. If that happens, oh well, psychedelics are just "self-filtering" right? Whatever happens was meant to be in the cosmos or whatever else bullshit makes you feel ok about doubling down on said shitty advice?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're no sage OT. You are being ridiculously stubborn and you sound a bit fucking unhinged to be honest. Yes OT, I know what the fuck I'm talking about when it comes to this shit. Unlike the person to whom you gave such shitty advice and is obviously is new to this shit as I'm afraid you are too. Just because you blew your brains out on DMT and LSD and saw the big bang and shook hands with a fucking monkey doesn't give you the right of way to give others advice that could devestate their life with a near complete disregard for their safety, especially under the guise of trying to help people find enlightenment, not to mention "matrix like movie type unfathomable realities." Go home rookie.

       I'm not worried about the rest, this is all a simulation anyway and right now you have downloaded the "cream the fuck out and worry that he's talking about these secret ways to escape the matrix because what if someone gets hurt," program your sim mind is operating on.

       So you and u/pokeurmom (note the username) have had prior exchanges where you established that this person was indeed somewhat experienced already and prepared for the advice you gave here:
      </p>
      <p>
       "You work way up from microdosing to full dosing and then to multiple at the same dosing and when you reach those thresholds and your mental construct navigation map sequence mind generator adapts to the modus operandi of deminsions you have traveled into, then you start titrating your lsd with ever increasing amounts of DMT crystals..."
      </p>
      <p>
       And here:
      </p>
      <p>
       "you have to also source out Iboga and incorporate the mega supreme trip beyond time and space which constitutes 10 LSD tabs, a mega dose of Iboga,.."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here too:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...when you vaporize the correct temp DMT crystals which sends you to the Ultimate dimension..."
      </p>
      <p>
       And another:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think its BP is 165c. or 350f. or so. You vaporizor should work fine."
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's more say advice:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...also when you reach god tier dimension through multidosing lsd with dmt and iboga then the body stops breathing and chi automatically starts breathing and enliving the body on its own..."
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course this doozy:
      </p>
      <p>
       "People dont even think any of this is possible but the psychdelics open up matrix like movie type unfathomable realities and aspects of your being like the subconscious that most dont even have access too"
      </p>
      <p>
       And you did it all on an open sub Reddit again, without so much as a warning that what you were talking about will knock even the most experienced drug user flat on their ass until I did it for you. Even if you had prior contact with the person you were talking to, which I highly doubt, what about all the other people reading?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even gonna bother waiting the rest of the last comment you made to explicitly point out how ridiculous you sound, but suffice it to say, you deciding that this whole thing is a "sim" and that kids won't have access to this shit or they will be afraid or telling me that someone dying seems like the end of the world, when I'm not the one giving out potentially deadly advice and it's the loved ones of the people you are giving advice to that will be the ones who think it's the end of the world if your advice results in tragedy.

       You are God and you are using your own sentience to sit on reddit and argue with others. He is speaking about using your sentience to "upgrade" your own DNA (in whatever way you allow yourself to be "upgraded")
      </p>
      <p>
       You can literally do this all with meditation, psychedelics can help break you open, but there's no point in repeat openings if you haven't learned how to handle it while sober.

       "you deciding that this whole thing is a sim and that kids won't have access to this shit or they will be afraid or telling me that someone dying seems like the end of the world but it really isnt is fucking beyond ridiculous."
      </p>
      <p>
       You are creating these "endangered kids" in your reality simply by thinking and KNOWING they "exist" somewhere, here, in this plane with you. This is how powerful YOU (the big you) are.... (ignore your little mind that bashes its head against its own walls of logic/belief)
      </p>
      <p>
       You are using your sentience to create fear. I would suggest creating love and enthusiastic joy :)
      </p>
      <p>
       That's "my" goal for now; learn to enjoy this experience and transmute fears back into raw information that can be discarded.

       And once you have mastered the Mind (alchemy), it is a beautiful process of your newly awakened consciousness re-entering the body and transmuting matter back into the light we forgot we are.

       I'm not the one that asked for advice. Try reading through all the relevant threads first before jumping down my shit next time. Otherwise after you have had a real negative experience with the compounds mentioned then come back and talk to me. Even if you don't know someone whose life has been turned upside down by psychedelics or know someone who has been injured or died as a result of using these chemicals or know anybody who took this shit regularly before they were even in their teens, or know anybody who was put in a mental institution after overdosing and trying to commit suicide, and I know plenty of the aforementioned mentioned examples personally, all you need to recognize is that I was telling OT to include a warning with his hastily given advice. Anybody who argues against that, with or without proper context, is a fool. I'm all for safe psychedelic experimentation for some people in some circumstances, it can be a great experience when done the right way. The advice OT gave is fucking ridiculous and should not be given out to strangers in a public forum without warning, period. Especially strangers that appear to be inexperienced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even get me started as to the irony of your comment warning me to not to take psychedelics too fast when that is exactly the same thing I was chastising OT for not doing with the advice he gave in the first place.

       Thank you for caring so deeply about the potential harm this could do.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're helping me realize we need both aspects to have a meaningful experience here, fearlessness and caution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, a aspect of my mind keeps saying "You only need caution when you are not filled with Faith in your own sentience"
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, that would be far too great a consequence/lesson learned for somebody to completely derail their life just to know what they aren't ready for or haven't cultivated enough self-love and faith to experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another aspect of my mind understands the world is terribly overpopulated (or so it seems...)
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe "survival of the fittest" is what we need, sooner than later. 
I would prefer we all learn to work together to heal the deep trauma that runs in humanity's bones. The same trauma that causes these psychedelic experiences to go haywire. It's a tricky and delicate process indeed. We're figuring it out as we go, so I thank psychonaughts such as "GOD-IS-DEMIURGE" for attempting to break free and blaze a trail for those who aren't ready nor capable. And I also thank people such as yourself for making sure we do so intelligently and with caution.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole experience is just a game; Time vs. intensity. Ascension is inevitable; but that could be lifetimes or even moments away
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between Bone-shattering traumatic experiences and Intelligently-ecstatic Blissful experiences is razor-thin. We are figuring out how to stay on the "high road" while we "walk back" out of Time-Space into the 5th dimension, where our sentience has always, and will always, reside.
      </p>

       See what happens when you lay some truth out there OT? people shove their mom'd-ness down your throat in order to "dissuade any novice trippers who might be reading," as if they could obtain the ingredients, inquiries and intentions necessary to initiate the trip of inward infinitude. Keep shining the light man. I'll smile at each dv i get for sayin you rule.

       No not at all. I tell everyone what I do. I mean shits a little deep for a childs mind so I generally leave god, life, and the such out of the few conversations I have with kids. Also DMT will not kill you. Mushrooms either. LSD may cause you to do some shit that causes death but im not a proponent of a man made chemical. Also Its not my job to censor the internet. Its a parents job to properly raise their children.

       So what if the person you are talking to is "weak of mind and heart"? Oh well? Survival of the fittest or some shit? What if u/pokeurmom is a 12 year old? Note the username. Did u bother going through their post and at least trying to assess their level of intellectual development before handing out such sage advice?

       listen, its simple: I know a lot of people who will take a half or 3/4ths tab or take a quick 10 minute trip into dmt elf realms and after that they are done and dont dare go for break-through. Not a single one. Its not even easy to get lucy, dmt crystials, or iboga

       12 year olds dont know how to access these things and would be scared AF to do it anyway. But that's besides the point. People die all the time and it's literally part of life and normal and there's nothing wrong w it.

       The combo I referred too puts you on your ass and there is no getting up until it's cleared up, that and there literally 100s of site and forums talking about these things and how awesome they are, and yet you don't see any psychedelic epidemics on the news everywhere do you?

       Otherwise, you're doubling and tripling and quadrupling down on your own stubborn ignorance and the mental gymnastics you are demonstrating to make yourself feel better about offering up some shitty advice rather than just going back and editing your original response to include a stern warning is frankly kinda disgusting.

       If I was a 12 year old then I have some shitty parents. Also if a kid can find DMT then that kid is genius. Oh and did you ever consider that before op replied that maybe... just maybe they checked out my post history and saw I talk about this shit all the time. Or that I subscribe to the DMT sub.... I mean really wtf are you doing here being a social warrior?

       Explain what that means though. I'll try it. Children, go to erowid and study before you do any thing stupid. Drugs are strong ok. These sorta of substances are probably better for adults anyway. Remember set and setting. Your frame of mind and location are very important. Also having trusted fellows to assist or watch over. Happy surfing. Try to feel love and excitement about flying in space on a biological spaceship. And that's the boring 3 dimensional reality that we can easily see, who knows what's hiding behind the curtains.

       WTF  " do you know how old the person your talking to is? Fuck off!!!! Seriously. Stop transferring the responsibility of properly raising children to the community. If there are kids in here then it is a parenting issue. NOT A COMMUNITY CENSORING issue. Also instead of beating us with a wall of text; why not bring some clarity  ( Since you seem like such a fucking pro) Oh prob b/c you have clue about the topic. Your just some opinionated asshat that thinks they are making a difference when all you doing is more of the shit that has caused the country to fall apart.... that being complain, complain and complain with no tact, logic or resolution. You are the reason why terrorist fly planes into buildings. " you also have to deal with impared judgement and hallucinations while making what could be life altering decisions." See this statement here is all the proof. If you understood anything about either mushrooms or DMT then you would know that this statement is the dumbest shit ever said!
Get out of your box and live life.... cause the way your going now is ....

       Yes, it's common. One time I suggested to people that they stop watching porn and experience intimacy/human contact as a way to break out of a destructive cycle and I got down-voted into oblivion because there is a bunch of losers here who are addicted to masturbating.

       The American Dream, in my opinion, is one of the biggest distractions to all the fucked up shit going on in our country and the world. When I say the American Dream I use it as an umbrella term, including concepts such as capitalism, consumerism, materialism, all that stupid shit that Americans seem to be so caught up in. Call me crazy, but this all just seems like a distraction from either realizing or caring about all the fucked up shit going on around us.

       That's the point. We all assume that the stories of Plato et al are 'ancient', thousands of years old, etc.

       Not sure if they will do the trick for everyone, but I can say that psilocybin mushrooms led to some of the more profound and life-changing experiences I've ever had.  Experiences that have permanently altered my perspective of the world, reality, relationships, etc.  I became more empathetic and in tune with my own emotions and thoughts.  You do need to be careful about consuming psychedelics in the proper environment though, because a bad trip can be pretty traumatic, especially if you don't have much experience with hallucinogens.

       This!!!  I quit watching the news October of 2001. Went full dark (mostly) by getting rid of cable about a year ago. Maintain Netflix for the occasional movie. Limit online time, and read news. It makes a tremendous difference. Get back to nature. Hiking, fishing, hunting, raising chickens, a garden....something pastoral and fulfilling.

       as someone who spends wayyy too much time sitting infront of my computer, nothing compares to the feeling when you're out in the middle of the woods with the dogs breathing in that fresh air. All the bull-shit ceases to exist and its just you alone in the universe. It's extremely therapeutic.

       Just one week. We all owe it to ourselves to give our minds and body one week free from toxins. You can always go back to the toxins later, they will be waiting for you. But one week will do wonders.

       They're a part of one possible solution. Psychedelics allow you to reprogram your brain's basic operating system, your culture if you will. They can be used for good -- that is, waking somebody up from mind control. Or they can be used for bad -- changing the traditional, family-oriented western culture of the 1950s to its neo-liberal in the 1970s, putting them
       <em>
        into
       </em>
       mind control.
      </p>

       They're a powerful tool, and should be respected and used accordingly.

       No. Start with meditation and yoga. I am a firm believer also in psychedelics, but I have seen many people change for the worse with hallucinogens. I have had friends that never came back. And became victims of a different mind control, their own broken one.

       It is thought that psyliciban in mushrooms can help to regrow nueral pathways. It's difficult to get conclusive studies done but if the hypothesis that psyliciban actually helps grow new brain cells and nueral pathways is correct then that's a hard science and biology type result, not just a philosophical opinion. If it's true it sure would shed light on why tptb want to keep it illegal. Can't have an all natural compund that anyone can grow in the privacy of their own home undoing all these years of sociatal indoctrination and msm brainwashing undone by a silly little mushroom.  Search for "Does psyliciban regrow nueral pathways" and have a look. This article looks like a good place to start:

       Drugs typically open one up to spiritual influences. I’ll leave it up to you to decide whether that is good or bad.

       The key is wanting to walk down the path.  Psychedelics are just a walking stick: A great aid some couldnt do without, something fun to play with to others, and still just some fucking stick I'm carrying around to others.

       No. They alter your thinking for a while, but they only make you think you're having profound thoughts when the reality is that you can't focus on the same thing for more than 5 minutes and will completely forget what you've thought about before those 5 minutes is even up. The thoughts you do have tend to be very circular and self-congratulating. The biggest change is that your perception of what is real and what is in your head blurs, so you can absolutely convince yourself that a bunch of bullshit you thought up is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why bad trips are so awful and why ego death is a thing. All of the bad things you think about yourself suddenly become extremely real to you.

       Doing drugs to improve your mental health is like kicking a machine when it's broken. It might work, maybe. Or make it worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really to want become all that you can be, practice meditation and energy work and study the Kabballah and the Law of Attraction. Those are kinds of tools that put you in conscious control of your mind and your reality.

       No. Absolutely not. You will never 'break free' of manipulation by changing yourself, only becoming ever increasingly resistant to it. The only way to definitively 'break free' is to end the manipulation at its source.

       I think that all drugs are a false path for most people. If you get too hyped up on coffee, you get road rage. If you drink too much, you can end up homeless. We know where hard drugs can lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Traditionally, psychedelics were used to break out of a problem situation where the patient was stuck. But, now they are used for entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can take them if you want, but be careful. For some people, they have no negative effects. Other people die as a result of their use. There is no way to predict how you will react to any particular drug before you use it that I know of.

       A good dose or two can really open your mind up, see your old world view objectively and form a new one. Its not necessary, its not for everyone, but psychedelics do help to open some peoples minds up. They did for me. However they are powerful drugs and should not be used very often.

       To be really aware of what an altered state of mind actually is a person needs to experience this for himself/herself. I think that it is best to do this while you are still young. As we get older we tend to "cement" our view of the world more and more which can cause traume when introducing a psychedelic drug into your system.
