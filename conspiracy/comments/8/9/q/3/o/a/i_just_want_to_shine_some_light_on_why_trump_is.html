       Trump has been bailed out by Russian billionaires several times in reality he has no real money it’s all controlled by the Russians so they can launder money through real estate deals. Before his first bail out he was a registered Democrat. After he switched to the most right wing person you can find. This has been a long con like history has never seen before. They had to build his character for years to be believable enough for the average citizen not to question his utter destruction of the US. I’m calling it right now Putin is going to admit to it in the next couple years. If the Russians didn’t want us to know about their voting fraud we wouldn’t they control the country completely and allowed those videos to be leaked so the world knows Putin is in charge because he says so. He’s going to own up to fixing our election which would throw us into chaos and weaken us immensely. The Cold War never ended it just went subzero and the citizens didn’t get to watch it anymore. 
This might be a more basic conspiracy for the die hards on here but remember. If it sounds stupid or simple to you you’re not the target audience

       The stock market is rigged. Work and build with your hands. Never acquire debt and never use your money passively or in a way where you are ‘hands off’. Grab some rentals and be the property manager if you want to play passively with your $

       So you want me to just let inflation drag me down by letting my money sit in a bank until I buy property. I’m working on the real estate side of it though. Gonna buy acres of forest in bufu, Missouri, clear cut it, sell that lumber, then turn it into either a campground (cause it’s literally charging people for a square of dirt, or a Christmas tree farm

       No I want you to use it with purpose and I want you to have control. Your idea with land is spot on. Two things will always be fought over, religion and land, and there is only so much land.

       Your losses aren't make believe, but the idea that the stock market is some organic thing that isn't controlled by "them" is DEFINITELY make believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you have no say in "politics". It doesn't matter who you vote for or who eventually gets in office. The train will keep rolling along no matter what.  Best to not get too caught up in it and treat it like the distraction that it is.

       It’s all rigged. Remember when George Bush(R) and John Kerry(D) were running against one another in ‘04?
      </p>
      <p>
       In college they were both members of the Yale secret society

        Skull and Bones

       , who only accept 15 students a year. What are the odds!?
      </p>
      <p>
       When a real person like Ron Paul makes a go at the presidency they are subjected to all manner of dirty tricks to ensure their failure. A more recent example would be how the DNC screwed Bernie Sanders by locking out his supporters, etc.

       Not at all. It used to be understood what a farce politics is. It’s a shame quite a lot of you are undoing the work this sub has done to expose the farce that is politics. Turn off your tv and take care of your neighbor. You are handing over your free will to those false idols. We don’t need a single one of them

       No it’s the Russians the same people who used him to launder money and the same people who stand the most to gain from weakening America. Why would Israel want america to go down when we give them billions in aid yearly. I just read it was close to 10 million a day. Rationalize that for me real quick

       He was bailed out by banks why do you think Wilbur Ross is the secretary of commerce. You can even find a cnn clip were he said they were bailing out Trump cause he is useful to them. Trump also has mafia ties that aren't russian. Fuck I'd love it if Russia was this much smarter then the us at manipulation.

       He can be bailed out by two different groups. Trump can have ties to more than one illegal body if he’s in league with the Russians why can’t he also be working with the mafia/being made to work with them by the Russians

       Where is your evidence? You sound so confident and even though I believe that Trump is in fact not as rich as he claimed to be - which is also part of the reason why he hates Bezos so much -, I have seen absolutely zero evidence to support your claim.

       Both of these are actually different from the claims OP made. The first one is extremely easy to explain:

        https://www.realtor.com/local/West-Palm-Beach_FL
       </a>
       (prizes per square foot in palm beach have gone up very rapidly since like forever, might be a bubble but the Russian simply paid what it was worth at that time)
The second one is simply Russians investing in golf courses built by Trump, am I missing something?

      <blockquote>

        Wyden's letter outlined how Donald Trump bought a 6.3-acre property in Florida for $41.35 million in 2004 and then sold that property to a company owned by the businessman four years later. The sale price to Rybolovlev more than doubled Trump's initial investment, to $95 million. The property's appraisal in 2008 fell short of that sale price by $30 million, Wyden said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The property was not even close to be valued at 95 million. Properties don't double in value while the rest of the housing market went to shit in 2008.

        Wyden's letter outlined how Donald Trump bought a 6.3-acre property in Florida for $41.35 million in 2004 and then sold that property to a company owned by the businessman four years later. The sale price to Rybolovlev more than doubled Trump's initial investment, to $95 million. The property's appraisal in 2008 fell short of that sale price by $30 million, Wyden said.
       </p>

       Except for the fact that appraisal and average prize for a m2 is not the same. Often in good neighboorhoods or blooming areas houses and property go way, way above their appraisal. Source: lived in both Amserdam and London. I've seen houses go for 3 times their appraisal and people still making a profit off it. I'd be surprised if the guy who bought it, doesn't make a nice profit of it, considering the area it is in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want there to be Russian ties, believe me, I can't wait to see Trump gone, but this nor the SOHO or Panama cases directly implicate Trump to be in debt to the Russians.

        In addition to the mansion intrigue, Rybolovlev and Trump recently have drawn attention in another peculiar way.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Federal Aviation Administration records reviewed by the Palm Beach Post and other news outlets have tracked Rybolovlev's private plane to cities where Trump has traveled, during his campaign and into his presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       In October, for example, Trump appeared at a campaign rally in Las Vegas. Rybolovlev's plane arrived in that city an hour after the campaign event started.

       That is indeed quite interesting, but there's still also this quote in the article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The vacant property's hefty price is proof the acquisition price, although steep, was worth it, according to Cattell.
"Given the ongoing sale process ... there is every chance the investment in the property will yield a good return," Cattell said.
And even though Rybolovlev paid an astronomical $95 million for the house, Cattell said his client still got a good deal.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also Trump bought it through an excecution, which lowers the price by a shitton, as they will most of the times literally take any offer made on the day itself. Alot of people made alot of money during the crisis this way. Housing market plummets, people are forced to sell all their property by the bank, so all you need is a lot of money and then to wait some years for astronomical returns.

       These are world figures and I’m a random citizen how would I get my hands on real proof. The first person to discover Saturn did it by the wake it left on other planets, never by seeing it with his actual eyes. I can be right without having any proof and I am. Real proof for this stuff with probably never come out because who ever tried to publicize it would be killed.

       Your premise is moronic. Trump's first major round of financial problems connected to his real estate holdings was in 1991 and 1992. This was during the breakup of the Soviet Union but years before control of its nationalized industries was given to the politically connected (in other words, years before the "Russian billionaires" you talk about were even created).
Putin didn't gain control of Russia until 1999, but he gained control of Trump in 1991?

       As I said, you claimed that the Russian billionaires took him over when he first had money troubles, when in reality Trump first had money troubles long before the Russian billionaires even existed, because those assets they own now to make them billionaires were at that time still centrally owned and controlled by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was years after Trump's first two bankruptices that Putin rewarded his cronies by handing them control of those assets (like the oil companies) and making them billionaires (instead of those assets being sold off for the benefit of all of the people of Russia).
