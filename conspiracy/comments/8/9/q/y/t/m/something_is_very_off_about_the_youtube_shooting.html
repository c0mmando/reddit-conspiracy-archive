       Let's put aside the fact that the supposed shooter was yet another person trying to become famous, like many of the other perpetrators, witnesses and family members seen in other high profile events.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find odd is the timing: right at the same time that the public outrage over YouTube's censorship policies were gaining traction, along comes this event to paint YouTube as a victim to gain sympathy. This reminds me of when pedogate was taking off and a supposed shooter went to Comet Ping Pong to assassinate an innocent hard drive and a floor tile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both events had the effect of shifting blame from a suspected organization back to the public as the "bad guys". It's all just a little to convenient in my opinion.

       As soon as I heard first reports that the shooter had been a disgruntled YouTuber, I became suspicious. What's to stop YouTube or it's allies to pass off the notion that anyone who opposes them or their policies is a potential threat. And now I fear that if you don't  "stand with YouTube" with regard to censorship, etc., you will be labeled as uncaring and being just as guilty as the shooter.

       Unfortunate times, my friends.

       There are plenty of crazy people in the world that do crazy things, I'm just saying it is not out of the realm of possibility for other parties to use tragedies such as this one to their advantage.

       And you are on r/conspiracy, so it shouldn't be shocking to see a few conspiracy theories.

       That's why I don't make posts about every shooting, most of them seem legit. This one however, has some oddities that bear further investigation instead of blindly accepting the words of known liars (the media).

       Maybe we should all be like you and not believe that conspiracies exist, that there could never be a staged shooting or tweet or terror attack, NASA is a legitimate government agency, yet still hang out in a conspiracy forum for some reason anyway.

       Another thing to consider... This was on her website:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for 
personal short term profits &amp; do anything to reach their goals even by fooling simple-minded people, 
hiding the truth, manipulating science &amp; everything, putting public mental &amp; physical health at risk, 
abusing non-human animals, polluting environment, destroying family values, promoting materialism &amp; 
sexual degeneration in the name of freedom,..... &amp; turning people into programmed robots!
"Make the lie big, Make it simple, Keep saying it, And eventually they will believe it" Adolf 
Hitler... There is no free speech in real world &amp; you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not 
supported by the system. Videos of targeted users are filtered &amp; merely relegated, so that people can 
hardly see their videos!
.There is no equal growth opportunity on YOUTUBE or any other video sharing site, 
your channel will grow if they want to!!!!!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Funny, this is actually pretty true. It also doesn't jive with how she acts in her videos, and she never speaks english (as far as I can tell), yet grammatically it's written as if native English speaker.

       Yep, it's a clever false flag at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the middle of the fallout from the
last school shooting, Youtube places
restrictions on Gun Videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, lo and behold, when Youtube gets
shot up, it isn't some kind of American 
gun-loving Second Amendment supporter
who is accused of pulling the trigger.
Instead, it's some vegan yoga-loving 
woman with strangely colored hair from a
Muslim country.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the shooter had been "a usual suspect",
every aware person would think it was
all a "false flag" to demonize gun owners
and the those supporters of the Second 
Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the shooter didn't fit the usual 
stereotype, the media and Youtube can
go on to suggest that the elimination
of the Second Amendment is even more
imperative since it isn't just white right-wing
gun nuts who go on shooting sprees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something fishy about the whole set up.

       "See... These gun loving people are a problem and need to be stopped."

       I feel like we all try to project some narrative when there isn't one. I also believe that if it was a false flag and the "usual suspect" was at fault, it would have more power to push an agenda.

       What I'm wondering is why there were so many early reports, supposedly from people in the building, that she had been dating someone there and this may have been some sort of lovers quarrel. Maybe it was the "news" taking or making any scoop they could, but it seemed too prevelant before we got confirmed identity. Assuming a witness was telling the truth, there is a bigger story there, assuming theyre lying, it looks terrible for local outlets. Up until the identity release (I was on the road most of the day but was listening to streams over the course of the event) the only confirmed information was female shooter, multiple victims of multiple genders, one being male.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please correct me if I'm off, there were serious gaps in my information intake.
