        Current version of article
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow. KRON4 still hasn't removed Source's claim from the article actually. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and aasume that's unintentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       This
       <a href="http://abc7news.com/sources-youtube-shooter-identified-as-user-nasim-aghdam/3298575/">
        ABC7
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ABC7 News sources confirm the YouTube shooter was a user of the platform. Nasim Aghdam has a website with an alleged manifesto that targets YouTube for censorship and demonetization of her video content.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       news sites never link to or show the manifesto. If they don't want to show it for some reason, then they shouldn't even mention it in thw first place
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, her website is still up,
       <a href="http://nasimabc.com/">
        http://nasimabc.com/
       </a>
       (
       <a href="http://archive.is/P3YGZ">
        archive link in case it goes down
       </a>
       ), I also noticed that visiting the site via https instead of http brings up an invalid security certificate warning and continuing to the site pops up a bunch of dead links that still work when you visit via http, so  idk what to make of that really tbh.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a
       <a href="http://nasimabc.com/Videos.html">
        videos page
       </a>
       (
       <a href="http://archive.is/BeWkm">
        archive link
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I also just noticed that daily motion has not removed
       <a href="http://dai.ly/x5wbp3el">
        this video of Nasim
       </a>
       that is posted on the front page of her website. So props to daily motion I guess for not participating in the fevered campaign to scrub this lady's existence from the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway back to the manifesto, if they're referring to what I think they're referring to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        BE AWARE! Dictatorship exists in all countries but with different tactics! They only care for
personal short term profits &amp; do anything to reach their goals even by fooling simple-minded people,
hiding the truth, manipulating science &amp; everything, putting public mental &amp; physical health at risk,
abusing non-human animals, polluting environment, destroying family values, promoting materialism &amp;
sexual degeneration in the name of freedom,..... &amp; turning people into programmed robots!
"Make the lie big, Make it simple, Keep saying it, And eventually they will believe it" Adolf
Hitler... There is no free speech in real world &amp; you will be suppressed for telling the truth that is not
supported by the system. Videos of targeted users are filtered &amp; merely relegated, so that people can
hardly see their videos!
.There is no equal growth opportunity on YOUTUBE or any other video sharing site,
your channel will grow if they want to!!!!!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not much of a manifesto really if you ask mel
      </p>
      <p>
       She was an eccentric person no doubt. Also pretty. Cherished her right to free speech, passionate about animal rights, and
       <a href="https://archive.fo/eQYDv/f822428964384d067ca46646fc8f0d80dc0a195c.jpg">
        her country as well
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This shooting defies prejudices and stereotypes all over the political spectrum that are at the center of a lot of controversy in the USA right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       While tragic, I also think it is an opportunity for a lot of people to look inward and hope it becomes one somehow for us all to grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: KRON4 still hasn't removed Source's claim from
       <a href="http://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/possible-active-shooter-at-youtube-in-san-bruno/1098585330">
        the article
       </a>
       . still 2nd sentence, with the police statement at the very bottom. I am no longer willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, this is almost certainly intentional.
      </p>

       CNN is also
       <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/03/us/youtube-hq-shooting/index.html">
        continues to push this claim in it's primary article on the shooting
       </a>
       despite
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite more recent updates being reported ftom multiple sourced, such as
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/04/nasim-najafi-aghdam-youtube-shooting-demonetisation-payments-father">
        the guardian
       </a>
       directly countering these claims
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Aghdam was “upset with the policies and practices of YouTube”, San Bruno police chief Ed Barberini said at a press conference on Wednesday. “This appears to be the motive for this incident.”
       </p>
       <p>
        No evidence had been found linking her to any individuals at the company where she allegedly opened fire on Tuesday, he said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is an official statement made by the police chief at press conferenxe today. i am having trouble figuring out exactly what tjme the press conference was held. if anyone knows please comment thx.
      </p>
      <p>
       worth noting here that the cnn obviously utilizes youtube far more frequently than less video oriented outlets.
      </p>
      <p>
       will update with what msnbc, abc, etc are saying as well

       Yeah this would be swiped under a rug really quickly. Remember Pedosta emails praying it's a white male after a shooting? If it's not it must reworded and removed...

       It does appear that someone attempted to do damage control from YouTube, trying to get ahead of the story.  My friend mentioned her channel was demonetized and she shoot her boyfriend, and that made no sense to me.  Thanks for the timeline.

        I also noticed that visiting the site via https instead of http brings up an invalid security certificate warning and continuing to the site pops up a bunch of dead links that still work when you visit via http, so idk what to make of that really tbh.

       That site is a crappy Yahoo template most likely from 2011 when she created that domain.  Her not having a HTTPS set up seems pretty normal for such a cheap product that isn't doing any ecommerce.

       Do you pay money to keep certificates valid or how does that work?

       If you are doing e-commerce and taking Credit Card info you need an SSL certificate.  You can choose how many years that certificate is valid for when you purchase it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what happens if you try to access a website through https when that website has never had a SSL.  Would the error message say security certificate not found or report an invalid security certificate like you see with this site?
