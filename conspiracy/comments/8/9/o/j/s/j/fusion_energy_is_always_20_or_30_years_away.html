       There's a story on the front page of this sub about the SR71 being 60's technology. I agree with this idea. There's no way you go 50 years without making any real progress in any area of technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what does this have to do with fusion energy? Same deal. We've known how fusion works since the first H bomb was built. We've known that a reactor requires plasma temps and pressures and a strong enough magnetic confinement field. And we've known all of these things and been working on the problems since the 1950's. I highly doubt that the major nations of the world couldn't come up with a breakthrough when they've had 60 years to work out the wrinkles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's some proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/science/lockheed-martin-patents-nuclear-fusion-powered-fighter-jet-2/">
        http://www.theeventchronicle.com/science/lockheed-martin-patents-nuclear-fusion-powered-fighter-jet-2/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Oho! A fighter jet with a fusion powered engine... really? We can't build a practical reactor that would be the size of a power plant, but all of a sudden there's a patent for a version that would work in a fighter jet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are we seeing this now? Because just a week or two ago the Russians claimed to have a
       <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/russia-reveals-unstoppable-nuclear-powered-cruise-missile/">
        nuclear powered cruise missile with unlimited range
       </a>
       . This fusion fighter patent is probably the US reaction to the Russian claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that practical fusion energy has been possible for several decades. But the tech has been suppressed for a couple of reasons. One, it would be too disruptive to the established energy industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       For another thing, the tech would spread quickly to other countries. The US had the atomic bomb all to itself for maybe 5 years before the Russians did their first test. I can imagine a world where China starts building their own fusion plants less than ten years after the first American one goes online. Now China no longer depends on imported oil and their industry gets even more of a boost?
      </p>
      <p>
       No. I think we could have had fusion power years ago. But someone higher up decides it would help someone else out more than it would help us. So it's been held back on purpose.

       Then the stepping stones necessary to develop the tech. Assume methods have application in other areas as well. What cascade of developments come out of the ideas that work here? Anything else with disruptive potential? Destructive potential?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nuclear power development created power for the collective efforts of one country to destroy the planet. What happens when we move to develop the power for a singular individual to destroy the whole planet? How long before someone crazed takes up that potential? Hell, imagine zero point energy were actually tapped? The lesson learned is that maybe sufficiently advanced technology needs to be locked away as long as possible to prevent proliferation and risk of misuse.

       No, the Soviets did. And their country went to shit. But yes, the Russians probably have too although not as advanded probably since they had less time and money to invest on it.

       Very doubtful. WWII ended in 1945. This would mean that nuclear weapons existed since 1895. And it would mean that stealth technology, GPS, personal computers, etc all existed in WWII.

       I don't think it is. Academia usually knows the knowledge needed to make tech. They just aren't paid to put it together. For instance, stealth technology was widely known to be possible among relevant academics. They just didn't have the budget to do it like contractors did. Any released discovery follows a similar pattern.

      <p>
       At least historically, there's some foundation for that. On the campaign trail, Carter promised to open UFO files that the federal government was holding. Once he got into office, he went back on that promise for national security reasons. There is speculation that the UFO sightings he refused to release were of stealth bombers test flights at night.

       Something that uses a lot of energy. Submarines and warships come to mind (i.e. anything currently fission powered), but as there is virtually no radiation risk you could put it on something that is airborne.  Maybe a

       Also, regarding the tech spreading to other countries; Lots of countries
       <em>
        are already
       </em>
       cooperating on fusion energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In southern France,
        <strong>
         35 nations
        </strong>
        are collaborating to build the world's largest tokamak, a magnetic fusion device that has been designed to prove the feasibility of fusion as a large-scale and carbon-free source of energy based on the same principle that powers our Sun and stars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thousands of engineers and scientists have contributed to the design of ITER since the idea for an international joint experiment in fusion was first launched in 1985. The ITER Members—
        <strong>
         China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the United States
        </strong>
        —are now engaged in a 35-year collaboration to build and operate the ITER experimental device, and together bring fusion to the point where a demonstration fusion reactor can be designed.

       Fusion reactions are really hard to control. And they take lots of energy to contain, making the issue about finding a way to harness it so that more energy is produced than required to maintain the reaction.

       The point i’m Making is it’s harder than even sixty years of research to get past. I’m not a physicist but I was a chemist, and I went to a few presentations by leading fusion researchers a few years ago. These are really smart, really dedicated people. It’s just really damn hard to contain the reaction in a way that generates net energy (and doesn’t level the research facility).

       theres no formula that you can use to see how long a discovery will take.  It could have been discovered 40 years ago or we might still need another 1000.  My money is on us having figured it out already though

       The thing to consider here is the aspect of DARPA and all the hundreds of billions spent every year on black budget programs. Consider how the Manhattan project was compartmentalized and kept secret, only revealed to the world after the bombing of Japan. The us military has no tactical reason to reveal it's research to the world, quite contrary, that would be best kept secret. Every year the US patent office declares thousands of patsnrs national secrets, which takes ownership of ideas away from their cresrors and leaves them with no recourse, they can't even talk about the idea without the threat of long prison sentences.

       I just ballparked the number, way off I guess. Someone told.me about that long ago. Still the terms of the declaration preepmt any and all legal action. Sounds like one loaded legal solution.

       There's something called materials science.  You aren't going to build any sort of futuristic technology until advancements in that area are designed first.  For example, the Oxcart program had to create multiple new materials and composites to build their jet.  It was also the first all titanium airframe ever built.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turning theory into a working product takes years and in some cases decades of design and iteration to get the breakthroughs needed to achieve particular feats of engineering.  That's why you're seeing F-22s and F-35s being built now and not 30 or 40 years ago, because there were multiple programs that needed to be successful first, F-117, B-2, Harrier Jump Jet, to name a few.

       That's also making my point.  If you think there are not programs out there that have not been developing thin exact thing,  you're ignorant.  The only difference is we don't see it,  unlike Jets and their technology.  What we see when we see it has probably already been developed 5-10 years prior.

       Not ignorant just realistic.  It is incredibly difficult to harness a sustained fusion reaction for energy production.  The idea that the government or powers that be having a working design currently shelved at the moment is laughable.  There have been thousands of people working on fusion reactors for almost six decades now all over the world.  Most of the work they have done up to this point is confirming theory and designing/testing possible reactor prototypes.

       Those are just the projects we actually know about. here is the lockheed patent for Fusion propulsion in a jet-engine sized package.

       If they have this, They have already worked their way down from a full sized reactor.

       First off, this patent is for only one major component of a fusion reactor.  Second, you can submit and be awarded patents without actually having built anything, companies do it all the time, especially when they are planning to begin working on major projects with new technology.  Also, this patent isn't specifically for a fusion powered jet, that is just erroneous assumptions by individuals who do not understand how patents are submitted in the US.  It says what it is in the title,
       <em>
        Encapsulating Magnetic Fields for Plasma Confinement
       </em>
       .  It is quite literally a design patent for a plasma containment vessel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, putting a fusion reactor on a jet at this point in time is closer to Star Trek and other science fiction then it is grounded in reality.  Lockheed Martin simply did what any other aerospace company would have done and included aircraft as part of the scope of what is protected under the patent.  And when Lockheed Martin manages to get a working reactor the size of jet engine, if that is even physically possible, which is highly unlikely.  It'll probably be past the year 2200 at which point jet engine propulsion will probably not be the desired means of propulsion for an aircraft.

        fusor is a device that uses an electric field to heat ions to conditions suitable for nuclear fusion. The machine generates an electric potential difference between two metal cages inside a vacuum. Positive ions fall down this voltage drop, building up speed. If they collide in the center, they can fuse. This is a type of inertial electrostatic confinement device.*

       Free energy is just the tip of the iceberg. All of science has been misdirected and corrupted from the top. It's all upside-down to sense. Nobody can figure it out because we are working with very little real understanding of mechanics at the quantum level.

       No. Of course the conservation of energy is not wrong. Would you say the same to some scientist working on hot fusion even though they're working on an over-unity energy technology -- meaning we get more energy out of it than we put in by tapping the nuclear energy and turning it into heat. We use the passive energy stored in nuclear bonds to get more energy out than we put in. That doesn't violate the conservation of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is in realizing that there are other, more efficient ways than hot fusion to passively tap into stored nuclear energy and turn it safely to heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the narrow answer. The broader answer is that there are other sources of energy surrounding us that science has no idea exists, let alone how to tap into those sources. At least, the science which is publicly paraded around and which is a subtle but powerful misdirection from the truth, which is hidden.

       For one thing Fermilab isn't quite done yet. While CERN is doing their thing with the LHC, the guys in Batavia are planning on repurposing the Tevatron as part of a newer type of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_acceleration">
        frame-dragging accelerator.
       </a>
       This might also lead to some fun stuff if they ever focus their efforts on
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_fermion">
        Majorana Fermions.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it might be getting into stuff like fields that carry the acceleration component that gives things inertia/gravity and weird stuff like that. Stuff that sounds more sci-fi than what's involved with usual energy production and projects dealing with more known things like the usual fusion models. This may also tie into revamped efforts to either detect or produce dark matter. It's like another side topic to delve into while the other accelerator at the forefront is more focused on antimatter and researching its behavior and properties.
      </p>
      <p>
       But who knows if that relates any to what's gone on in the black sector research that taxpayer dollars just disappear into. (If so, they're comparatively late to the game.) Seems the secretive part of the government has still been able to keep a pretty good lid on that compared to what happened with fission based nuclear research.

       . Stuff that sounds sci-fi probably is sci-fi. In fact they've misdirected mainstream physics to such a degree that it often sounds like science fiction. That is on purpose. All of the stuff you are talking about in your comment is part of the mainstream misdirection.

       Thanks! I have to wonder how much overpopulation would be a problem in a world with cheap, limitless, clean energy. Also, historically, increased living standards have gone along with a lower birthrate, not a higher one. So it could very well slow the growth.

       I’m going to respectively disagree. Sure maybe some Facebook post said “millennials arnt having kids” blah blah. But at the beings of the 1900’s the industrial revolution raised the standard of living and population levels through the roof. If third world countries had there own industrial revolution we would not have a decrease in population.

       This has nothing to do with Facebook posts and nothing to do with millenials. You are right that the industrial revolution was accompanied by a huge population growth. But what we've seen in the US, European, and other developed economies in the last century is that economic prosperity has been followed by a reduction in the birthrate. In some countries the birth rate is even below replacement levels. So the relationship between economic prosperity and population growth is not so straightforward. It seems to be more of an inverted-U shape, contributing to population growth until some point then lowering it. I guess it's an open question of what impact free energy would have on population growth in the short run, but in the long run it should reduce it.

       Watch the documentary THRIVE (don’t discredit it because it talks about crop circles) it explains how this free energy exists and how big oil and the CIA go out of there way to suppress it. I mean they can build bombs from splitting atoms but the idea that free unlimited energy exist is sooo crazy? Lol I mean come on. Don’t trust a government when it’s citizens blindly trust the establishment.

       Asking you for examples of free energy existing is perfectly normal.  If you told me you had violated other accepted physics I would have asked for examples as well.

       It is interesting that every free energy person I speak to gets this way when I ask where the actual power plants are using their tech, hell they get upset when I ask why they use them to power their storage building...

       Yes, he basically says that almost everything in physics is wrong. Though in many cases the errors that result are rather small. The problem though is that even small errors tend to compound over time, so he had to go back to the beginning to fix what was wrong. So he never shows what is wrong without fixing it and moving forward. The discoveries he makes as a result are astounding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow, I'm impressed you already made it down to the 170th paper he posted there. That was fast. But if you had read the paper, you would know what it is he says complex numbers are being used to hide. Here I'll quote the relevant paragraphs; the key is in the second one:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now, the reason this sort of math works in electrical engineering and in quantum electro-dynamics is that this expansion into ordered pairs gives you four dimensions from only two initial variables. You get a sort of matrix with four degrees of freedom. As a heuristic device, it is clear why this would be useful. But it is also useful as a device of mis-direction and obfuscation, since two of these dimensions or degrees of freedom can exist in the dark, undefined and unnoticed. This serves to hide the mechanics, and the very existence of the mechanics. Because these dimensions are imaginary, no one asks mechanical questions about them. The math hides real interactions under confusing variables or functions, and no one ever looks at them. This is just one more reason that the foundational electrical field or the charge field has been defined as "virtual." It is smashingly easy to turn the switch from "imaginary" to "virtual", since they are basically the same thing. Virtual particles are imaginary particles, ones that do the mechanical fudging where the imaginary variables did the mathematical fudging.
       </p>
       <p>
        But why would physicists want to hide the mechanics under confusing math? Because they know how to do the math, but they don't know much about the mechanics. They have fit the math to the data after the fact, but can't explain the data mechanically. To be specific, they have followed Lagrange in this creation of extra degrees of freedom out of nothing, and it is because, like him, they recognized they needed them. But since neither Lagrange nor anyone since could assign those degrees of freedom to anything physical, they have hidden the physics. They have buried the physics under the math, so that students of both math and physics would not ask them the hard questions.
       </p>
       <p>
        To be even more specific, no one has seen that both the data and the math require a second field in physics beyond the gravitational field. Or, if they have seen it, they have not been able to say what that field is. So it was best to hide the fact. But the field is just the charge field, as I have shown in dozens of papers. The old equations already contained it, including Newton's gravitational equations, the Lagrangian, Laplace's field equations, and so on. What is more, the electromagnetic equations have also been unified all along, containing gravity. Coulomb's equation, like Newton's, is already unified. That is why both celestial mechanics and electromagnetics have required these extra degrees of freedom: the math of both has to represent the unified field, whether the mathematicians and physicists can assign the variables or not.

       No, it isn't. But you have to understand that I've had many discussions on-line where the other person is able to quickly dismiss or quickly refer to some deeply buried point as if it was at the tip of their fingers. Sometimes it's to dismiss the findings of a 40-minute youtube video within 5 minutes. In this case it's not so clear cut but still hard to grok. I don't know how you managed to wade through the work so quickly. It's a good but imperfect sign of a disinfo agent. Another is the lack of substantive content in your remark. If I am wrong, then I apologize for my snark.

       They want to keep everyone oppressed because there is much less need for them if you have your own energy. Look at all the states that don't allow you to have solar panels and use rain water. Almost every city has a law requiring you to use power and water. They force you to use their utilities or they will condemn your home.

       I'm usually a bit skeptical that the elite are more than maybe a decade ahead of us, but I gotta admit that article has my head spinning.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claim against fusion is always the massive amount of input energy required to start a successful fusion reaction, which currently (if we believe what we're told) can only happen in a few (or really only one) massive lab, and even then, really doesn't create a self-sustaining reaction. If this article really is true, and this patented design both works and is fielded soon, then your premise is correct - we'd have been able to produce power via fusion for at least a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm reminded of my school days, where we were told fusion was just on the horizon - that was back in 2013. Course, they also told us we were on the edge of a nuclear Renaissance, which was a lie, so I never really believed them about fusion either.

       Well we’ve achieved nuclear fusion on earth many times, the problem is maintaining it for long enough for it to produce energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Decades ago we couldn’t do it at all. Now we are perfecting it, every test lasting longer and longer. It’s only a matter of time before we can do it for long enough to use commercially. Just because it’s taking a while doesn’t mean it won’t happen.

       SMH that's the whole point of this post. If this patent is real, and a successful jet fusion reactor is constructed soon, then it would mean that we would have been able to do it commercially for a long time now, but that the tech was withheld from us. If we can't create an exothermic fusion reaction in the lab, how could we do it in a jet? The reverse is true as well - if we can do it in a jet, then obviously we can do it in a lab, or in a power plant, etc.

       Of course!   I’ll try to keep this brief. A friend sold tech to Raytheon about 12 years ago. The tech is disturbing and another conversation for another day. During negotiations there was reportedly a 4 star general in the room. One of his partners was discussing the 25,000 Chinese soldier march that was a popular email at the time.  Basically China could line 25,000 men of fighting age on their beach and march them into the ocean and drown them. They could do this into infinity one line after another due to their massive population. The discussion revolved around how this had to be disconcerting for a military leader. The general said, ‘we could wipe China off the map in 7 minutes’. The partner, brought up that it takes like 28 minutes for a full nuclear exchange and how was that possible. The general replied, ‘nuclear?!, you’re thinking way to 1960 son’ and would say no more. That was 12 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does it surprise anyone here that there is a significant amount of suppressed technology when we can’t even get truthful news about the days events?!?!!!

       They don't even need to be nuclear. The US Navy has railgun technology already, if you get a 10kg tungsten slug getting a gravity assisted impact at an already incredible speed you'll do some damage from a potentially almost undetectable source. Now add in a relatively quick RoF or a battery of weapons/satellites and you can saturate an area in minutes.

       The more likely explanation is the many ballistic subs that can be parked off their coast undetected. Each boat has a boatload of missiles and each missile has many independent Hbomb payloads.

       I’m not doubting nuke missiles in space, I’m just doubting they’re in sufficient quantity. Plus, you risk irradiating your own country trying to send them up if the rocket fails to deliver.

       I'm doubting nukes in space. Governments can tell when other governments put stuff in space. Rocket launches are not discreet. Putting nukes up in space would not go unnoticed, and it would not be without political repercussions. Do you think China and Russia would just stay quiet if they noticed the US putting nukes in space?

       Nuclear weapons from space, being able to fry their optics from earth using a laser and ABM countermeasures are the game chargers.
Turning satellites into floating debris using just a laser is crazy when you think about it.

       there's nothing bullshit about the suppression of cancer cures, 100% there are alternatives out there that would help us immensely compared to radiation treatment.
Do you know how much money gets put into cancer cures, treatments + charities? 
It's just common sense that they will slow down the progress but still release shit at a slow pace to make it look like they're not suppressing.

       Sustained fusion is happening right now at several research centers worldwide. What isn't happening is a net positive fusion reactor - one in which more energy is produced than it takes to sustain the reaction.

       It's taking a long time because it's very hard, not because TPTB are suppressing it. Otherwise there'd just be no research at all.

       Seems plausible.  Note that they were electrochemists rather than physicists, and so they werent aware of what they werent allowed to propose.  All nuclear deep theory needs to remain obscured as a born secret, maybe.

       There is no money in free energy,  of course it's being suppressed.  I'm honestly surprised how much electric vehicles are starting to catch steam,  I guess with Elon money you're harder to intimidate?  There is a safe somewhere with patents of awesome and world changing technology,  but they are owned by governments on controlling elites who will not see profits or control diminished.

       Progress doesn't mean going from zero to a workable design. If that's your definition though, then you have to admit there are thousands of examples without scientific breakthroughs from long periods of time. Gonna have to choose one. Both can't be true.

       About a year ago I read a story that the scientists had figured out the theory to real fusion power. The main problem now is actually building it, that they still don't know how.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was watching a periscope by Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert. He talked about that story and said he called a scientist friend of his who was in the know. He asked him about how long it would take to figure out the tech side, the friend said 5 years tops because once you figure out the theory the physical side is just a matter of time.

       Yes, definitely.

      <p>
       I often comment about how solar has already made fusion obsolete. Costs have been dropping rapidly and nations like China and India have been moving ahead with solar by leaps and bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the tech and futurology subs, you often see articles talking about how solar is already cheaper than coal in many applications. The only thing missing is grid level storage and the tech already exists for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think about how fusion is still 20 years away. Keep that fact in mind and then look at where solar will be in 20 years. Who's going to want a billion dollar fusion plant when they can have 100 solar ones putting out more energy for the same price?

       Also economically speaking, solar is decentralized, and adds jobs to the local area instead of funneling it all to some central point.Most likely it will need to be backed up by wind power but that is easily accomplished.

       It's as if, none of the people in this thread have heard of a tokamak reactor before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Iter, which is an experimental reactor under construction right now in France, that the US is providing funding for.  Oh and by the way, it's huge and fucking expensive and they don't even expect to get a 1:1 fusion reaction.  The reactor is purely experimental and for research purposes, because reliable man-made Fusion in practice is still based on theory.

       Yeah for anyone saying they don't have this technology yet...Take a look at the google patent page and tell me they done have this down to a science... They have probably been working on Fusion propulsion for 30 or so years. If they are able to create a system that can fit in a jet, they already built a full size reactor for testing. Patent:

       The thing to consider here is the aspect of DARPA and all the hundreds of billions spent every year on black budget programs. Consider how the Manhattan project was compartmentalized and kept secret, only revealed to the world after the bombing of Japan. The us military has no tactical reason to reveal it's research to the world, quite contrary, that would be best kept secret. Every year the US patent office declares thousands of patents national secrets, which takes ownership of ideas away from their cresrors and leaves them with no recourse, they can't even talk about the idea without the threat of long prison sentences.

       This is absolutely retarded, one of the stupidest conspiracy theories I’ve heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read about fusion energy. Do some research. Just because you don’t understand why it’s hard, doesn’t mean it’s being held back.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main problem with your theory is this: fusion energy offers complete energy independence, no more reliance on fossil fuels. There’s nothing the government wants more than free, infinite energy. That goes for every government, bar the few oil producing countries. It would absolutely screw over Russia and Iran for one. Every corporation, except for those in the energy industry also want nothing more than infinite free energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ask yourself, if almost every government is desperate for it, and almost all of our corporate overlords are desperate for it, why the fuck is it being held back? Answer... it’s definitely not. Especially as our energy needs grow infinitely and our resources shrink.

       Shows what you know. Just look at solar. In some nations, it's advancing by leaps and bounds. But in nations where there's already an established fossil energy infrastructure you hear about promoting coal because jobs and you see rollbacks on tax credits.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they want to do is transition over a period of decades. We probably could have gone over to fusion years ago but it would have been too disruptive to the big players (like Big Oil).

      <p>
       Yep. And with fusion, they would suddenly be independent of the power of the petroleum industry. That means nations like China would be a lot harder to keep in check.

       Think of oil like you'd think of heroin. You might not be the dealer, but you control the supply. When someone messes with you, you can crash the price or you can jack it up.

      <p>
       If/when fusion ever becomes a thing, the oil industry would become irrelevant in a very short time. That's because fusion can power everything on electricity. As soon as you've got enough juice to power 20% of your transportation, the drop in demand for petroleum will crash the price. Usually that leads to increased use which means a price rebound. But fusion would cause a permanent decline in demand.

       The oil industry, with all their trillions, is going to try and keep that from happening for as long as they can.

       Usually, those are just big antennas. It’s not free. We just pump a bunch of EM around, so there is plenty of “available” (not “free”) energy to harvest.

       Fine, just "after" then. Point is a lot of government r&amp;d started during &amp; after ww2 so obviously the rule about secret tech being way ahead of public tech wouldn't have applied during that era
