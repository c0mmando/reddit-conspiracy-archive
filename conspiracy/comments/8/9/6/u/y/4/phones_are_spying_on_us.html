    <div class="md"><p>Unlikely your phone is spying on you for that ad. If you have a digital set top box all of the programming you watch is logged and that data is sold. I used to work as a developer at a large cable/satellite company, this was a pretty large revenue stream. If you logged into that set top box with Facebook or there are other personally identifiable characteristics belonging to your cable account (like phone number) and your google or Facebook account, then these relationships between two seemingly different and isolated datasets can be easily made and then you’ll be subject to ad retargeting just about everywhere. A good rule of thumb is, if it has an internet connection, your data points are being logged and analyzed and if its worth anything at all, it’s being sold as well.</p>
