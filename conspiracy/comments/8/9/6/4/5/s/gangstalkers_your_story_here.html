The reasons for this can vary greatly,but ultimately the goal is to harass, discredit, alienate or kill the victim. 
Im currently trying to piece together as much information on the topic as possible and am hoping you may have stories of your own, examples or just links to resources that can be used. 
Why do you think this happens and to what ends? 
All replies welcome. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I knew someone that got shot by a Norteno when he was selling some coke. Guy was meant to kill him as an initiation ritual. Dude had to testify against the dude that shot him, and the Nortenos gangstalked him until he had to leave town.</p>

<p>Also, know a guy that got kidnapped for 72hrs by MS13, and they showed him pictures of all his family members coming out of their work and told him they had people waiting to kill them if he didn&#39;t do what they said. He ended up having to ditch town too.</p>

<p>And, shouts out to John Lang. </p>

<p>It can definitely happen. I just don&#39;t think it happens unless someone has something valuable to another group of people, or are deemed a threat in some way by some organization (ie. not the majority of us)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically GWEN is a satellite system that was developed in the 70’s by NSA. The purpose of the system is to control/elicit emotional responses from a geography.  At the start of the program it was reported they could control/elicit emotional response in an area the size of a large city. By the eighties the size of a neighborhood (he said Rodney King riots were “enriched” with this tech). By the early nineties a single person. My source believes it is part of the reason behind an increase in lone shooters.  He also believed it was coupled with other programs such as MK Ultra, and others I had never heard of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s the question isn’t it. I think more than anything it was a study on the mechanics of human emotion. The concept of the Christ consciousness grid...where we as humans can allegedly “tap into” others emotions by some other sense.  Like multiple discovery, where two unrelated scientists discover the same thing at about the same time. There is no rationale explanation behind it other than a sense we have forgotten.  My thought it was a study into this alternate sense. In the meantime they’ve created a weapon of sorts. </p>

<p>Do we really have free thought?  We have the ability to think freely yes, but are we actually contemplating thoughts that are based on reality or even original?  The news, religion, education, history, political ideaology, etc is all highly skewed through propaganda and controlled media. Truly asking, Do we really have free thought?  If what we are contemplating during our moments of clarity are concepts fabricated by “them” is that free thought?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We had the same situation, but we lived out in the woods, 15 miles from the nearest small city. We would have frequent flyovers of black choppers going right over our house.</p>

<p>My step-dad was a navy SEAL, but i always had a feeling he was into some weird shady shit when he served in South America. The guy never told me details of what he did besides saying he saw UFOs while on a boat in the gulf. He was the first person to tell me the CIA sells drugs...</p>

<p>The deeper conspiracy is that i feel like a group has been secretly reading my thoughts/ influencing my mind. Lately the shit has been making more sense, with strange coincidences and such that have me sure that last summer/fall i was under heavy mental attacks and had an intelligence operative &quot;handler&quot; trying to mess with me.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be my first encounter with intelligence handlers either. Some things i wont talk about here, but when i was 18-20 i had strange stuff going on in my life. Possibly alien abductions too, but that would get me in trouble.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, OP, OP... please do some basic research.</p>

<p>Gangstalking is a complete misnomer. They use sophisticated technology to create illusions. Most of the so called gangstalkers are not even aware they&#39;re being manipulated in such a way.</p>

<p>Read as much as you can about this, and you will realize the extent of this technology. In the overwhelming majority of cases it is not some low tech bullshit relying on &quot;boots on the ground&quot;.</p>

<p>On the gangstalking victims Facebook groups there are victims worldwide. Even Israel, China, etc. The people behind this program have loyalty to no nation. It&#39;s above everything.</p>

<p>My personal theory is that this program truly has no real &quot;purpose&quot; except as a bullshit excuse to siphon more money for the military industrial complex. They just come up with bullshit reasons to target random people because &quot;experiments&quot; &quot;national security&quot;. It&#39;s basically welfare for the MIC. It&#39;s basically like in that movie Cube Zero. Bunch of tools being paid to harass people, but even those tools are being watched by other tools. Nobody really knows wtf is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the information. This IS my basic  research, its suprisingly hard to find information about this side of gangstalking. My basic summary was more of the cold war- KGB-esque style of gangstalking, something which according to several Irish victims is allegedly still a thing. 
But i digress, if you have and links i could follow for more information id appriciate it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a combination of intentional and unintentional harassment. I noticed you said <em>most</em> are not intentionally harassing, so you seem aware but I want to clarify. There are definitely people out there that actively harass others. They&#39;re so numerous that when you go to the store, they don&#39;t have to send someone to the store to bug you, odds are someone will already be there doing their day to day. </p>

<p>They remotely affect unknowing people to perform certain actions to create the illusion of having an even larger influence, or coerce a victim to lash out at an uninvolved person. </p>

<p>The harassment is a side product of a highly connected group, or group of groups. It&#39;s not a huge operation designed specifically to target people, its a huge operation that has the capability, among other things, to target people. </p>

<p>Great seeing this kind of information posted. I often see gangstalking discussed in a way that misses the mark, but what you&#39;ve written seems pretty close to accurate in my experience. For anyone that has had any experience with it, it pretty much eclipses all other conspiracies. </p>

<p>When I found out about targeting in 1 week they induced fake paranoia, followed me a lot by repeated stalkers cuz there wasn&#39;t enough where I live lol, controlled my heart rate, controlled my speech to say stuff, induced sensation of lot of pressure moving around under my scalp, eyes forced in different directions, light flashes in the air around me, induce of different voices, virtual reality dream of being killed on the last night. About 2 months prior they&#39;d induced an image in my mind of an occult symbol.</p>

<p>Then they tortured me lots for few months after, they stopped when I typed in google I&#39;m not going crazy and did an alien communication with a Nordic or Pleiadian, communicated by emotion with glowy GIFs in my mind and shortly after I saw a light orb UFO outside my house that &#39;turned on&#39; twice when I looked in it&#39;s direction, I swear I&#39;m not making this up or experience this kind of shit often...it&#39;s just when stuff like this does happen you tend to remember it.</p>

<p>One time they made me black out, controlled to do something and totally erased my memory of it, I met another very young target in Iran that spoke about a similar experience, it&#39;s like some people experiencing lost time or possession.</p>

<p>atm they induce pain everyday at very specific times, they&#39;ve been changing when/how much pain through time, right now it&#39;s pretty low cuz I stopped redditting too often, usually while I&#39;m typing, reading, drawing, whenever I meditate, someone upvotes me or sees my name in their inbox, when I&#39;ve only thought about redditting, for a while was when strangers would look at me outside, sometimes they&#39;d make my leg vibrate for half an hour sleeping at friend&#39;s houses. Excruciating pain a few times when I was with lot of friends like brain zapping or shock under my brain top of my spine that could be intensified and felt through whole body.</p>

<p>Before I knew about targeting I&#39;ve recognized gangstalking in my life going back to when I was about 13/14 I moved to US and it&#39;s much more obvious there, lot of fake stares and harassment of my mom/dad got worse during that time. This one guy that&#39;s done lot of stuff to harass my family for many years was our next door neighbor conveniently for 2 years before I moved, it doesn&#39;t take a year and constant hammering on the wall I happened to sleep next to to refurbish a tiny apartment. Experienced lot of construction wherever I move to since and heard lot of targets speak of same thing.</p>

<p>Around 18/19 while in america people&#39;s attitude completely changed, there was more vandalism and fake drama I swear like they&#39;d possess some people around me or induce emotions of severe anger suddenly, they&#39;d electronically induce orgasms and keep me asleep during night idk how many times but they let me wake up once to make me feel embarrassed lol I didn&#39;t give it much thought at the time but always felt like someone was intentionally fucking with my life, identifying the fucking factor has brought lot of needed balance to my life. Also vague p-gate experience with US guy when I was 14 feels too convenient, said he was some high ranking army person and I feel all this goes back to military and intelligence groups.</p>

<p>Interesting thing imo is Hillary Clinton shaking her head was this technology being used on her and so many other celebrities/news anchors experiencing the same thing blamed on mk-ultra or possession and psychotronic weapons are rarely talked about, also tells me these people are the ones controlling US politicians and media, can do so much fucked up shit and go unnoticed.</p>

<p>Many will say they&#39;re stalked by online bullies constantly or there&#39;s no physical harassment I believe this is manipulation. From my experience it&#39;s various harassment over many years that&#39;s organized and intentional to ruin lives, you can throw their asses in jail or get away with killing a perp but they just coming. My worst targeting has been people messing with me irl, using technology or whatever means to alter my life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you give an example or two of the phisical and online harassment&#39;s forms? 
I.E. was it subtle things or much more clearly harassing things. 
Have you found any way to fight back? 
Who do you think could be doing this? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend of mine is certain he is being gangstalked.</p>

<p>I lost contact with him about a year ago and ran into him at a gas station recently, the inside of his car was all ripped up and windows smashed etc. I couldn&#39;t tell if he had a mental break down or if there were legitimately people gang-stalking him, his mental composure was same as always (by which i mean he seemed mentally stable) and I had to basically force an explanation from him.</p>

<p>The man worked at a charity and dealt with a huge amount of people on the daily, he said a few months ago it had started and almost every single night someone had been breaking into his car - or knocking on the windows of his bedroom at night, he said he would get home and furniture in his house will have been moved to the other side of the room, real creepy shit. He said half of the damage to the inside of his car was done by himself and he was certain someone had planted recording devices etc inside the vehicle. </p>

<p>Anyway, we laughed about it for a bit and went our separate ways - i&#39;ll have to get in contact with him soon to find out what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since satellite surveillance became available, stalking is no longer &quot;boots on the ground.&quot; Only high value targets are stalked by foot and by vehicle and targets that are attempting to elude and relocate. Both high value targets and low value targets are geo-stalked by spy satellite, wireless networks, etc. See the Geo-stalking wikis at</p>
