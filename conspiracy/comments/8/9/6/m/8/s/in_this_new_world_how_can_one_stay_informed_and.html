       This whole sinclair thing, and the news recently about Facebook and Cambridge analytica has got me totally rattled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm terrified that the views and opinions that I have are not my own, but have been brainwashed into me by manipulative, sophisticated tactics. While I don't watch much news, I was very active on mainstream social media, and am still quite active on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even now it has become a huge concern of mine that Reddit is not a completely safe place either. However, I value being informed, and really want to feel like I'm connected to the world. How can I do this but not feel like I'm being coerced into thinking or feeling a certain  way?

       It's not easy, but the way to do it is to consume a large variety of all media and related content, with higher priority given to primary source documents, videos, emails, witness testimony, etc., and ideally you have enough experience and historical knowledge to identify common themes or give you the proper context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another easy rule of thumb is: be very suspicious of anything the MSM is pushing.

       A honest relationship with God/Jesus is a surefire way towards spiritual discernment which always cuts through the filth and tells your gut what's what.

       The only God. Yes, likely many religions, even Christianity, have been perverted over time. No, I don't not believe Jesus is a myth, in fact, very few people doubt His existence, but plenty of people debate over who He was/is.

       Remember everything presented to you comes with a bias. I like to get a conservative take and a liberals take from people I respect , then I look to see if something in the middle makes sense. 90 percent of the time somewhere in the middle does make sense. When it doesn't I come here.

       That strategy has it's own built-in bias, namely that you're calibrating your worldview based on the current Overton window of your time and locale. This is the real issue with the Hegelian dialectic as employed in the political sphere: you're presented with a thesis from one side, an antithesis from another side, and the idea is that the "best" answer is a synthesis of the two. But if both the thesis and antithesis are flawed, missing something, or based on the same erroneous assumption, then the synthesis will be flawed as well.

       I make conscious choice to calibrate my  worldview to the morality instilled in me through my upbringing. No doubt I bring that bias into the process and I’m fine with that bias being part of the determining factors for what I accept as reality. Can anyone presented with serious issues, like some of the stuff in this sub, not bring there own initial bias?

       You can’t. I swear 50% Answers are just made up and false. You can only rely on your experience and your logic. It’s hard to handle at first. But the first step is realising you are being manipulated. Everything gets easier after that first hurdle. Good luck with it all

       Basically learn to read through the opinions and to recognize the narrative. Sort through it for some tidbits of fact. Look everywhere. Understand that MSM is 80-90% MANUFACTURED. Not embellished, or opinioned to death, but created in a writers room for consumption. Read other country’s propaganda...the truth will be somewhere in between.

       Take in a broad spectrum of sources. Not just the US "left" and "right," but as broad as you can find. Libertarians, socialists, communists, anarchists, voluntarists, etc.

       Learn about and pay attention to common manipulative and deceptive tactics, and about how your own mind is swayed by them.

       When taking in new information, determine exactly where it originally came from. Good journalists will provide you with their sources so you can check the information out for yourself. You should also see if you can find information that contradicts the original information or provides greater context for it.

       Let me point out all of the major areas of potential bias in your local news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sinclaire is a broadcasting company which owns local TV stations, which pay a licensing fee to run network programing. So sinclaire might own the local ABC and the local FOX stations in your city.
      </p>
      <p>
       These affiliates provide their own catalog of news content available for their affiliate stations.  Sinclaire may also subscribe to the AP, or other content providers.  The local sinclaire station then has it's own general manager, news director and local reporters and local advertisers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Sinclaire itself can promote their own agenda, then there is the agenda of the particular affiliation(nbc/abc/fox...), the agenda of the station manager(don't forget to local advertisers) the news director, and the individual reporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth of the matter is that unless you gather information from every angle and reach a decision for yourself, then you are brainwashed with other people's ideas.
