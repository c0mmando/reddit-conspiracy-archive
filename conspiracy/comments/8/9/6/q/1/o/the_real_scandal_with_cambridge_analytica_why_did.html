       Then you might say, "Oh but back then it was with the users' consent"
      </p>
      <p>
       But the users are clearly too dumb to understand that they're being exploited.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the whole consent-aspect doesn't change what Facebook is... it's a surveillance/mapping tool. It started on the day when Lifelog was shut down (
       <a href="https://www.wired.com/2004/02/pentagon-kills-lifelog-project/">
        https://www.wired.com/2004/02/pentagon-kills-lifelog-project/
       </a>
       ). Lifelog was a social mapping tool, like the ultimate totalitarian surveillance technology... but Lifelog had failed and closed down due to the need for users' consent. Then Facebook emerged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we're at a point where data-collection for mass manipulation has become talk-of-the-town... but the argument goes that 'consent' would make it OK. (That's supposedly how the DNC techniques were acceptable.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Next step? Multiple types of Facebook accounts:
      </p>
      <p>
       'Normal' for normal people regular laws etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Benefactor' for
       <em>
        helping Facebook
       </em>
       by surrendering some rights and sharing an invitation to become manipulation-data provider.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Martyr account' the ultimate sacrifice! An agreement that, if you sign it, you will be targeted with experimental manipulation and tools and apps.

       Facebook being sacrificed in order to bring in draconian internet regulations. CA being singled out because they helped Trump.

       A lot of the CA stories came through UK journalism from Ch4 and the Guardian because of Brexit. Two organisations that would have little interest in Obamas campaign tactics. The corporate media would have ignored both Obama and trumps manipulation if they could.

       I wonder if there is another reasonable explanation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it have nothing to due with Democrat/Republican liberal/conservative biases in media and more to do with now there is a lot more attention being paid to this issue because a forgein nation acted to subvert our democracy?  Yeah, I think that's more the reason, no need for a liberal media conspiracy of them working for the Democrats.  Oh and pay no attention to Fox News being the defacto mouthpiece for the GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, everyone knew Facebook and others were selling our internet habits for money.  Not hard to realize social media is free because we are the product being sold.  This isn't some new revelation, except to a few oblivious idiots.  And American news media generally caters to the lowest common denominator.  What is news is just how sophisticated and affective online manipulation has gotten now, and the full extent to which Facebook was unethical in selling/handing over our data.  Russia's use of social media trolling is what is making this a big deal, not that the liberal media was purposely staying mostly quite about all this until a Republican won the POTUS.

       No one seemed to care as long as the golden calf sat in the whitehouse, he lied to the masses just like the mockingbird media does.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took a shock to the system to wake people up and finally get angry enough to desire the truth. When a traumatic event takes place, many people make it their mission to seek out the contributing factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crap media hyped obama &amp; hillary while trashing trump to the point that they made themselves irrelevant and untrustworthy.

       They're supposed to be the "trusted sources" but after repeatedly giving false narratives and flat out lies, people have stopped buying what they're selling.

       You know Fox News is mainstream, as they have the largest number of viewers, or at least they did for a long time.  They demonized Obama and Hillary non stop, often over more trivial stuff.  Shit is flung both ways.  But Trump is objectively worse, and it should be obvious to all those who aren't in a bubble.

       I'm not doing it because the news tells me to or implies I should, I don't watch cable news.  I genuinely think he's bad.

       Rampant nepotism, under or whole unqualified persons in cabinet positions (the Secretary of Edu is a young earth creationist who want government handouts to private school! Ben Carson was a brilliant surgeon but not qualified for HUD Sec and he's also a YEC who think the pyramids were grain silos.  I don't want people in power who have the kind of worldview that comes with being a YEC, especially if they are poorly qualified on top of that, it terrifies me!), a few federal judge appointees who couldn't even get rubber stamped by an R controlled congress, appointing Ambassadors who say blatantly wrong things about the country they're serving, the hypocrisy on oh so many issues and then the fucking Tweets and his pattern of speech!  The man goes on barely understandable rants.  He is really good at talking without saying anything of substance.  It's funny and scary just listening to him talk with other political leaders, and his body language is not good either.  Trump and his administration get called out all the time for being caught lying. Surely you have to be aware of some of the lies? I don't get my news from MSM TV, so I don't know how in depth their coverage of the administrations lies, blunders and incompetence actually .  But I do see how far conservative news is willing to go to suck up to him and downplay all the shitstorm of controversies.

       Yes, the center and left leaning media are hard on them, but not nearly enough IMO.  They were too easy on Obama IMO, too.  But at least they weren't the sycophants Fox News has become to Trump.

       I don't think Trump is at risk of being assainated by whoever it all was behind JRK and RFK, or whoever their protegé are now.  I have ideas and suspicions, but I won't claim to know who they are, or their true motives, or how cohesive and unified all the players are because I don't know for certain.  So I'm not going to let myself construct a narrative to follow which may not entirely be correct. A fool thinks he knows more than he actually does. A wise person tries to identify what they do and do not know for sure and work from there.

       Trump's incompetence and susceptibility to influence is convenient for the rich unpatriots.  He's the smokescreen and excuse which allows the rolling back of environmental regulations, and getting rid of financial laws and regulations that benefit regular Americans and inconvenience the ultra rich.  But his incompetence and occasional unpredictability can cause problems such as this stupid trade war.

       The leg work on CA was done by Ch4 and The Guardian. The US corporate media would have let both US parties get away with manipulation.

       Drumpf was not supposed to win = Pure Satan and everything is hell and Russia narratives.

       So basically if Obama or Hillary did it, it's OK, but if drumpf then impeach now, omg, Russia, Mueller, it's so over for him this time for sure.

       It's not about left or right. It's about Intelligence agencies and their control. right/Left is just a strawman.

       I'm not doing it because the news tells me to or implies I should, I don't watch cable news.  I genuinely think he's bad.

       Rampant nepotism, under or whole unqualified persons in cabinet positions (the Secretary of Edu is a young earth creationist who want government handouts to private school! Ben Carson was a brilliant surgeon but not qualified for HUD Sec and he's also a YEC who think the pyramids were grain silos.  I don't want people in power who have the kind of worldview that comes with being a YEC, especially if they are poorly qualified on top of that, it terrifies me!), a few federal judge appointees who couldn't even get rubber stamped by an R controlled congress, appointing Ambassadors who say blatantly wrong things about the country they're serving, the hypocrisy on oh so many issues and then the fucking Tweets and his pattern of speech!  The man goes on barely understandable rants.  He is really good at talking without saying anything of substance.  It's funny and scary just listening to him talk with other political leaders, and his body language is not good either.  Trump and his administration get called out all the time for being caught lying. Surely you have to be aware of some of the lies? I don't get my news from MSM TV, so I don't know how in depth their coverage of the administrations lies, blunders and incompetence actually .  But I do see how far conservative news is willing to go to suck up to him and downplay all the shitstorm of controversies.

       Yes, the center and left leaning media are hard on them, but not nearly enough IMO.  They were too easy on Obama IMO, too.  But at least they weren't the sycophants Fox News has become to Trump.
