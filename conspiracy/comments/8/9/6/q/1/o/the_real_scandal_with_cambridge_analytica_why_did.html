<p>Then you might say, &quot;Oh but back then it was with the users&#39; consent&quot;</p>

<p>But the users are clearly too dumb to understand that they&#39;re being exploited.</p>

<p>And the whole consent-aspect doesn&#39;t change what Facebook is... it&#39;s a surveillance/mapping tool. It started on the day when Lifelog was shut down (<a href="https://www.wired.com/2004/02/pentagon-kills-lifelog-project/">https://www.wired.com/2004/02/pentagon-kills-lifelog-project/</a>). Lifelog was a social mapping tool, like the ultimate totalitarian surveillance technology... but Lifelog had failed and closed down due to the need for users&#39; consent. Then Facebook emerged. </p>

<p>Now we&#39;re at a point where data-collection for mass manipulation has become talk-of-the-town... but the argument goes that &#39;consent&#39; would make it OK. (That&#39;s supposedly how the DNC techniques were acceptable.)</p>

<p>Next step? Multiple types of Facebook accounts: </p>

<p>&#39;Normal&#39; for normal people regular laws etc.</p>

<p>&#39;Benefactor&#39; for <em>helping Facebook</em> by surrendering some rights and sharing an invitation to become manipulation-data provider.</p>

<p>&#39;Martyr account&#39; the ultimate sacrifice! An agreement that, if you sign it, you will be targeted with experimental manipulation and tools and apps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if there is another reasonable explanation?  </p>

<p>Could it have nothing to due with Democrat/Republican liberal/conservative biases in media and more to do with now there is a lot more attention being paid to this issue because a forgein nation acted to subvert our democracy?  Yeah, I think that&#39;s more the reason, no need for a liberal media conspiracy of them working for the Democrats.  Oh and pay no attention to Fox News being the defacto mouthpiece for the GOP. </p>

<p>Look, everyone knew Facebook and others were selling our internet habits for money.  Not hard to realize social media is free because we are the product being sold.  This isn&#39;t some new revelation, except to a few oblivious idiots.  And American news media generally caters to the lowest common denominator.  What is news is just how sophisticated and affective online manipulation has gotten now, and the full extent to which Facebook was unethical in selling/handing over our data.  Russia&#39;s use of social media trolling is what is making this a big deal, not that the liberal media was purposely staying mostly quite about all this until a Republican won the POTUS.  </p>

<p>The crap media hyped obama &amp; hillary while trashing trump to the point that they made themselves irrelevant and untrustworthy. </p>

<p>Only in the eyes of those fully brainwashed by media...</p>

<p>So,  he&#39;s  <strong>subjectively</strong> worse.   </p>

<p>Anyone seeing the whole forest and not just the trees,  however,  knows that Trump is battling the same forces that murdered JFK. </p>

<p>Railing against Trump because the TV says to do it it supporting the same forces that have previously killed a sitting president. </p>

I don&#39;t get my news from MSM TV, so I don&#39;t know how in depth their coverage of the administrations lies, blunders and incompetence actually .

<p>Yes, the center and left leaning media are hard on them, but not nearly enough IMO.  They were too easy on Obama IMO, too.  But at least they weren&#39;t the sycophants Fox News has become to Trump.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Trump is at risk of being assainated by whoever it all was behind JRK and RFK, or whoever their protegé are now.  I have ideas and suspicions, but I won&#39;t claim to know who they are, or their true motives, or how cohesive and unified all the players are because I don&#39;t know for certain.  So I&#39;m not going to let myself construct a narrative to follow which may not entirely be correct. A fool thinks he knows more than he actually does. A wise person tries to identify what they do and do not know for sure and work from there.  </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s incompetence and susceptibility to influence is convenient for the rich unpatriots.  He&#39;s the smokescreen and excuse which allows the rolling back of environmental regulations, and getting rid of financial laws and regulations that benefit regular Americans and inconvenience the ultra rich.  But his incompetence and occasional unpredictability can cause problems such as this stupid trade war.  </p>
