       Because today they are using Donald Trump to rehabilitate the Republican Party. No matter what ultimately happens with Donald Trump, the Republicans will appear more moderate afterward -- they may even use Donald Trump to make themselves become heroes "of the left." These propagandists are brilliant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just another critical reason why the Donald Trump administration is the best thing possible for TPTB.

       I see it a bit differently. The media has hated him for so long, it's suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they may be using Bush to appeal to the older conservatives in the country. He'll probably be quoted saying he disagrees with some policy Trump supports. I think it's possible their trying to split the conservative base up.
      </p>

       Is this supposed to be some sort or mock? You're gonna need a mirror.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You believe what TPTB SAY. "Oh, we want Hillary," as they do things that indicate the exact opposite -- like running him against too many others to possibly have anyone beat him, or give him billions of of free publicity, or attack him in juvenile ways that are just ridiculous and cause a reaction, or have their worst neocons say they support Hillary to complete the outsider LARP.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "Americans" voted nearly three million more for the other candidate against Donald Trump. The fact that you would imply such a total piece of Fake News against what everyone knows says more about you than about any legitimate reason to support Donald Trump.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Then, when Donald Trump is declared the winner, the stock market goes crazy high just to prove how much TPTB love Donald Trump. They get their giant tax cuts and their "deconstruction" agenda that goes all the way back to the 1930's. Yes, this would definitely be a government of the purest oligarchs of TPTB.

       George Bush was the 43rd president of the United States of America. His birth date is July 6 1946. He is married to his loving wife, Laura.
      </p>
      <p>
       George likes to paint in his spare time and to reach out to people in his community who are not as privileged as himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is a good man that donates to charity and helped broker peace deals throughout the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
       As President, he had a wonderful time in office but recalls "the toughest part of the job was seeing 9/11 happen in front of me on CNN."
      </p>
      <p>
       George W Bush retired from office and politics when President Obama took office in 2009.

       He didn't watch it happen though.. He was reading to some school kids when it happened, and he looked like he was not in on the shenanigans... Either that, or he is one hell of an actor and missed his true calling..

       "The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can “throw the rascals out” at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy"

       While I wouldn't rule out what you suggest, this isn't only confined to politics, it's a very common issue on reddit. As far as I can tell, the purpose is less the specific content or post, and more the idea of building up account karma in a way that looks natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll see this a lot in TIL and AskReddit, where one account will repost a popular post from several months or years ago, then other accounts will repost popular comments from the original thread. Some of the initial upvotes are probably seeded by the botnet, but subsequent votes come from people who simply like the comment, as the original also received upvotes. These accounts are then likely either sold or rented for astroturf and vote-bot purposes. The accounts look real enough if you search through their history.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/TheseFuckingAccounts/ documents many of these.

       You trying to tell us that people naturally copied the top 6 comments out of the post from a year ago all for precious upcotes? This is blatant botting and it's probably fully allowed by the reddit team they probably even charge for the service. "Ok guys what threads are on the agenda today?

       I think it is interesting how Ronald Reagan was considered at the time of his presidency &amp; for quite awhile thereafter as being "one of the greatest American presidents" by a large percentage of the population. BUT.............. George Bush Sr &amp; HW were certainly never considered "great presidents" AND if you walk into many mass bookstores you can't find many or any books about Reagan upfront on the main displays as you walk into the bookstores.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush &amp; Clinton's are everywhere. Interesting that Obama is nowhere near the front of the displays either even though he was loved by many people (I'm not one of them, but not blind to other people's affection for him).
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that The fkn Bushes &amp; Clinton's are everywhere upfront in those bookstores main displays. It's been like that for quite awhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 3 presidents &amp; wife of a president that sold American jobs out to slave wage labor countries &amp; lied about wars as 'interventions' have seemingly never ending promotion of positive books about them. Fk Bushes &amp; Clintons.

       There is social grooming underway to rehabilitate Bush back into power. Into an undisputed head of state role that supersedes 'presidency'. None of you will believe me until it really happens.

       One of the common karma farming methods is to repost the top comment from the original post.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I doubt this is a bot, just someone who was desperate for karma.

       Wow this is scary. Great find OP. I have noticed a lot of strange pro Bush comments this past year on reddit. Its mind boggling considering the destruction he wrought. Bush is the worst president in modern history in my opinion and I don't think its even close. If his legacy is anything but negative then there is something seriously wrong. Just thinking about his presidency makes me frustrated.

       Ya I'm perma banned for /TIL for posting Cooper predicting 9/11, last 9/11. Well, actually the mods censored my post and ridiculed me for being a conspiracy theorist. But they didn't like it to much when I called them Nazis and said Joseph Gobbles would be proud of them.

       Nice try reddit damage control team but go fuck yourselves with this non sense explanation.

       You trying to tell us that people naturally copied the top 6 comments out of the post from a year ago all for precious upcotes? This is blatant botting and it's probably fully allowed by the reddit team they probably even charge for the service. "Ok guys what threads are on the agenda today? Well we have to improve Bush's image, we need to post some stuff about Elon musk and bill Gates"
