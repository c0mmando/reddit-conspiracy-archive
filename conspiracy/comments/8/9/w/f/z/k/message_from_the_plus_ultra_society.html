        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We reveal secrets known only to the inner elites.</p>

<p>Through three millennia of recorded history to date, centered around the Mediterranean, the civilized world has been run by two, bitterly opposed elites, the one associated with the faction of Socrates and Plato, the other with the faction of Aristotle. During these thousands of years, until the developments of approximately 1784-1818 in Europe, both factions inner elites maintained in some fashion an unbroken continuity of organization and knowledge through all of the political catastrophes which afflicted each of them in various times and locales.</p>

<p>It was the elite associated with the Platonic (or, Neo-platonic faction which organized the American Revolution and established the United States as a democratic constitutional republic. During the early eighteenth century, in circumstances associated with Marlborough&#39;s campaign and the Mississippi and South-Sea bubbles plots, the continuity of the Platonic faction was first administered a broad, temporary defeat with some lasting effects, and was shattered later as a world force through the events of 1784-1818. </p>

<p>In the aftermath of the 1815 Treaty of Vienna, the shattering of the power of the Platonic elite in Europe meant in large measure both a scattering of the main forces of that faction, and an associated, increasing loss of the &quot;secret knowledge&quot; through which the Platonic inner elite had formerly developed and exercised its factional power. From that time to the present period, the inner circles of the Aristotelian (or, more exactly, &quot;neo-Aristotelian&quot;) faction have been hegemonic increasingly in ordering world affairs.</p>

<p>The Platonist, humanist faction has seized the presidency of the United States once more. Q has emerged as the first step in a greater plan to turn the tide against the oligarchical faction that murdered JFK, Lincoln, and Washington. You are being given crumbs so that you can begin to bake your own bread; to reject the worldview you have been given, and create your own world, then work to bring it to reality.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait until you learn who has been talking to you here.&quot;</p>

<p>Donald Trump himself.</p>

<p>What is Business International?</p>

<p>When did Barack Obama work there?</p>

<p>What is Operation Cyclone?</p>

<p>Who was the mastermind of Operation Cyclone?</p>

<p>What university did this mastermind work for?</p>

<p>What university did Barry graduate from?</p>

<p>What Company was Lolo Soetoro working for when he helped out with a military coup?</p>

<p>What Company did Barack Sr. work for?</p>

<p>What Company did Mrs. Obama work for?</p>

<p>How much CIA drug money is propping up the economy right now?</p>

<p>What kind of <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xB4WgxktjjE/WAJT6jRdU3I/AAAAAAAADUA/ulIw_T7a3i4XjgVqB4aDHrlYY7eyOmRKACLcB/s1600/orbital%2Bring%2B800.jpg">space elevator</a> is in the picture?</p>

<p>How much money could we generate by building it? Enough to stop selling drugs and trafficking kids from war zones?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The announcement of the orbital ring space elevator project has to come from the admin, right? In my opinion, talking about it on social media won&#39;t cut it.</p>

<p>By the way, using a condescending approach and sending people to &quot;read some science papers and doing a little math&quot; instead of insightfully presenting and explaining some basic facts how the orbital ring works and why it&#39;s a game changer etc., is not very helpful either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The power of the &quot;soundbyte&quot; approach can&#39;t be overstated. If the goal is to rid us of the malignant damages of usury and a suppressed economy, then suggesting that lower- and middle-class people, who presumably are overworked, underpaid, and stretched for time with multiple obligations, read physics papers and comb through a weaving tale of American history (and discern what is and isn&#39;t BS) would be a very ineffective approach. If you want to gain traction for this movement, my opinion would be to first hammer home the &quot;no more taxes&quot; portion of the message.</p>
