    <div class="md"><p>Spartacus Educational has one of the largest JFK data bases in the world. That and Mark Lanes &quot;Rush to judgment &quot; are great places to start. I just did a post talking about how 5 years or so ago I went heavily into JFK and SE would come up when you put in JFK or Conspiracy but now it doesn&#39;t show up as a suggestion. You need to go directly to their site and you will get tons of info. Also look up the 1978 House Assassination committee investigation. They actually said there was clear evidence supporting a conspiracy but it was , surprise, never followed up on. One of the star witnesses of that George Demorensheld(spell) was shot in the face with a shotgun days before he was supposed to testify for them. He was a known CIA operative and got Oswald the job at the book depository.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am nearly certain the government killed him (as most people are, I mean really people were only looking for confirmation).  Given that, does anyone actually think a <em>single document</em> actually states this!?  Fuck no, the CIA and chain of command going up to the VP are not ever going to put in writing “we did this.”  Even with no redaction, that isn’t there.</p>

<p>What they are hiding is evidence of a coverup or
Any loose ends that could further bolster the claim.  Stuff like written analysis of the <em>uncensored</em> Zapbruter film, and things that would show purposeful incompetence or conflicting narratives.  There is <em>no</em> actual “smoking gun” admission because there could never be or have been one.  No one would have been that stupid.</p>
