        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>From the moment I first saw the picture of the woman who allegedly shot the place up,  I immediately felt something was off. It just had this weird vibe from the very start with me. </p>

<p>The more the story develops,  the less sense it seems to make. </p>

<p>When I first saw the shooter, my immediate thought was, that&#39;s a dude,  not a woman.   Her appearance is rather bizarre,  and seems off for some reason to me, but what really raised my suspicions was the tidbit about police interrogating her mere hours before the shooting.  </p>

<p>Apparently her brother called police over Easter weekend,  and reported her missing. Police found her asleep in her car,  in close proximity to Google HQ, interrogated her,  then called her parents (at 2:00 am supposedly) letting them know they had found their daughter. </p>

<p>The parents then told police that she may want to cause violence at Google because she had claimed it was ruining her life. </p>

<p>So the police knew she was mad at Google,  and she had driven up to their HQ, potentially planning to cause violence there,  and then did absolutely nothing?  It seems to me that when the parents of the girl told authorities she was mad at Google and perhaps planning violence there,  that they&#39;d take that threat more seriously. They even told her parents that they&#39;d &quot;be keeping an eye on her&quot;, which apparently they didn&#39;t,  or they really were,  and then stood down and allowed this shooting to happen. </p>

<p>Another thing that doesn&#39;t add up is her only shooting 3 apparent random strangers, and allegedly shooting one in the leg,  one  in the arm,  and the third in the stomach at point blank range, before turning the gun I  herself. </p>

<p>It seems to me,  she surely would have been shooting to kill,  and at that range surely knew that shooting someone in the leg and arm isn&#39;t going to kill anyone.  Also the fact she stopped after only shooting 3 people, before killing herself doesn&#39;t add up either. </p>

<p>Lastly,  I find it incredibly odd that we have the Saudi Crown Prince in the United States,  traveling the country trying to gather support for direct action,  perhaps militarily, against Iran, and who just arrived in Silicon Valley the same day, then all of a sudden an Iranian women goes and shoots up a Silicon Valley based company.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know,  perhaps I&#39;m being a little too skeptical here,  but something just seems off to me, anyone else get the same feeling?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a photo of her as an infant and child and she always had a sharply defined chin and a bizarrely thick, tendonous neck. Both are traits of a kind of mild genetic issue and functional retardation  - I don&#39;t know the scientific name for it but when I was younger there was a family of children that rode my bus and they all had it to some degree, some more functional than others, all with the same physical traits: abnormally slender, long tapered chin, thick neck, piercing but zoned out eyes.</p>

<p>That or she&#39;s an alien/grey hybrid- half joking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I saw it posted here in conspiracy but I didn&#39;t save it. As a toddler she had a boxy but weak (ran into her neck) chin and as a girl of maybe 10-11 her chin was already very pointed, her neck already thick- moreso than any masculine male children I grew up with were at that age. There&#39;s something very up with her but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily hormonal. </p>

<p>In order to arrest someone, police must have probable cause to believe they <em>have</em> committed a crime. They can not arrest you simply because someone tells them you might commit a crime at some point in the future. I&#39;m pretty sure you wouldn&#39;t want it any other way.</p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<p>Just under half the time, trained police officers miss their target altogether. Why would you expect some crazy bitch to be a better shot than trained police officers?</p>

<p>Basically, you sound like you <em>want</em> to believe there is a conspiracy and are simply grasping at straws to justify your belief.</p>

<p>First,  I never said I think police should have arrested her.  Second,  you are wrong about the police not being able to do anything.   Receiving a specific tip,  from a family member that a person may be planning violence is all the probable cause any law enforcement officer needs to open an investigation into someone,  especially when that person drove hundreds of miles and is in close proximity to the person they&#39;re potentially planning violence against. True they couldn&#39;t arrest her,  but they absolutely could get a warrant to monitor her cell phone and do more extensive searches.  I personally think that because she was a muzzle, that die to political correctness, and the fear of being labeled a racist likely stimied the police officer from looking any further.  But they absolutely had more then enough probable cause to monitor and keep an eye on her,  like they even told her parents they would be in that very strange 2:00am phone call.   Clearly at that point they thought there may have been some validity in her parents tip.  </p>

<p>In fact,  I&#39;m pretty sure that California has laws on the books that state if a family member contacts authorities about someone potentially hurting themselves or someone else,  police can Baker Act the family member,  and detain them,  based solely on the parents tip.  I know many states have this law on the books,  and I find it very hard to believe that a liberal state like California wouldn&#39;t have the same. So I&#39;m thinking you&#39;re again wrong,  when you say police couldn&#39;t do anything. </p>

<p>You could be absolutely right about this,  she may have sucked at aiming,  especially if she hadn&#39;t practiced beforehand,  but I&#39;m a little confused why you brought up Las Vegas into the discussion.  I&#39;ve never once said anything about Vegas being a conspiracy,  and you bringing it up here in this thread is puzzling.  I still find it hard to believe that she would have stopped after only firing 3 bullets though.  She surely would have at least emptied the clip before turning the gun on herself. </p>

<p>That still doesn&#39;t add up to me. </p>

<p>Essentially I don&#39;t believe a single thing which is broadcast on mainstream news, until I&#39;ve researched the event myself,  and gathered enough information to form am opinion of my own.  I absolutely start with the premise that the mainstream media is lying,  or completely making up the story.  They&#39;re proven liars,  believing anything that comes out of their mouths at face value,  without discerning the information yourself is incredibly naive. </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite hard to say what went through her mind. If she did what you said, she couldn&#39;t have shot herself with an empty magazine.</p>

<p>But the main point is that this was probably first murders she had attempted. Three shots, then there is shouting and blood, she probably couldn&#39;t stomach it, weak ass vegan. </p>
