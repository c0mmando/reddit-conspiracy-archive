    <div class="md"><p>Ok, but here’s the thing. If I posted this video of Steve Pieczenik calling George Soros a Jew rat. I would not have gotten banned. Pieczenik was a high ranking official in the US state department and has a lot of inside knowledge. He speaks out against Soros, Netanyahu, and Kushner by calling them Jew rats, when he is a Jew himself. It’s not like I was calling all Jews rats. I was calling this one guy a rat and truth be told he has rat like features. So it’s more truthful than it is bigotry. You just assume the stereotype behind it. If I called Trump a white rat, no one would bat an eye. Or even if I called Obama a black rat. </p>

You are a victim of those who enabled and groomed you through your life to be irritable and attack people for their heritage, race, or religion.

<p>You can be as rude as you like about someone&#39;s ideology, religion, politics, culture etc, but we draw the line on blatantly racist labels which dehumanise people, and debasing animal metaphors are on that proscribed list (ie a Jew rat, a Muslim dog, black monkey etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t say anything of that nature. Read the comments and you’ll find out what I said. </p>

<p>And honestly where would we draw the line? What if Google or the government felt the same way about people saying things like “I think we should build a wall” as you feel about someone saying things like “I think all gays should be murdered.” Free speech should include offensive speech. They just keep closing in on what we can say, the window of what is politically correct continues to get smaller.

    <div class="md"><p>Building a wall, although I think it&#39;s a waste, is a discussion of enforcement of border security. It&#39;s automatically an attack on Mexican people. &quot;Stop all the Mexicans - they&#39;re rapists!&quot; would be a pretty bigoted thing. </p>

<p>I&#39;d argue the wall is ineffective, has a high cost, and is mostly a campaign slogan to appeal to racists, but that does not make all proponents of the wall racists or bigots. You are not a racist for believing in the wall. And the proposition of the wall in and of itself is not bigoted. </p>

<p>Also, one community =/= google. Communities have their own unique goals. Not having this place sound like bad kids on Xbox live is the goal of this particular community because we are discussing complex topics. </p>
