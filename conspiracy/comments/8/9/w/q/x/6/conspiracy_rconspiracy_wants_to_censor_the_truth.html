       I called Kurt Eichenwald, that Liberal reporter at Newsweek a Jew rat. I believe he once made a comment that all Conservatives should die. But it’s no different than Steve Pieczenik, regular guest of the Alex Jones show, and a Jew himself calling George Soros a Jew rat. I don’t get it

       Ok, but here’s the thing. If I posted this video of Steve Pieczenik calling George Soros a Jew rat. I would not have gotten banned. Pieczenik was a high ranking official in the US state department and has a lot of inside knowledge. He speaks out against Soros, Netanyahu, and Kushner by calling them Jew rats, when he is a Jew himself. It’s not like I was calling all Jews rats. I was calling this one guy a rat and truth be told he has rat like features. So it’s more truthful than it is bigotry. You just assume the stereotype behind it. If I called Trump a white rat, no one would bat an eye. Or even if I called Obama a black rat.

       I'm not offended at all by your comment, but that's pretty blatant. You've got some issues with self awareness or some major issues with certain ethnic and/or religious groups. Saying something like that is one thing, being surprised it is considered bigoted  is kind of odd and naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is "censoring the truth" by prohibiting that language; they're making a more civil place where hostile and destructive bickering doesn't dominate the threads like on YouTube comment threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're not a victim of the people who removed your comments. You are a victim of those who enabled and groomed you through your life to be irritable and attack people for their heritage, race, or religion. How you treat people is a reflection on your self image and satisfaction with life. Work on that.

       You can be as rude as you like about someone's ideology, religion, politics, culture etc, but we draw the line on blatantly racist labels which dehumanise people, and debasing animal metaphors are on that proscribed list (ie a Jew rat, a Muslim dog, black monkey etc).

       Tru. Although this site can be reached by a lot of people not in the U.S. Some people quite literally don't understand the American 1st amendment or the philosophy behind it. Their governments are usually born from or blossom into a dictatorship.

       I don't know what you said that was considered "bigotry," so I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you aren't entitled to just go about saying for example "death to all whites" or "gays should all killed" etc. wherever you go and not be removed by the bar, party, restaurant, company, or forum for being an asshole. Where you draw the line might be different than mine, or where the people who run then show where you are present, but that is life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see pretty racist shit here all the time by users that are not banned so it seems likely you must have been pushing the envelope into either obnoxious or especially blatant, or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, maybe I'm wrong. Who knows.

       I didn’t say anything of that nature. Read the comments and you’ll find out what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       And honestly where would we draw the line? What if Google or the government felt the same way about people saying things like “I think we should build a wall” as you feel about someone saying things like “I think all gays should be murdered.” Free speech should include offensive speech. They just keep closing in on what we can say, the window of what is politically correct continues to get smaller. I might be crazy, but unlike you, I don’t want to live under 1984 like conditions

       Building a wall, although I think it's a waste, is a discussion of enforcement of border security. It's automatically an attack on Mexican people. "Stop all the Mexicans - they're rapists!" would be a pretty bigoted thing.

      <p>
       I'd argue the wall is ineffective, has a high cost, and is mostly a campaign slogan to appeal to racists, but that does not make all proponents of the wall racists or bigots. You are not a racist for believing in the wall. And the proposition of the wall in and of itself is not bigoted.

       Also, one community =/= google. Communities have their own unique goals. Not having this place sound like bad kids on Xbox live is the goal of this particular community because we are discussing complex topics.

       Funny, I completely disagree about u/aleister. His addition to the mod team really made me happy. He's one of the genuine ones, and I think it's a very beneficial thing to the community that they were added to the mod team.

       I don’t know for sure if it was him, but he did remove a comment of mine earlier because I insulted some ANTIFA member with a personal insult AFTER he did the same thing to me. So I just assume he was after me and banned my account too

       And look at u/aleister  and all of his comments. The guy is clearly drunk with power, he’s removing and deleting content left and right.

       Tru. Although this site can be reached by a lot of people not in the U.S. Some people quite literally don't understand the American 1st amendment or the philosophy behind it. Their governments are usually born from or blossom into a dictatorship.

       I don't know what you said that was considered "bigotry," so I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you aren't entitled to just go about saying for example "death to all whites" or "gays should all killed" etc. wherever you go and not be removed by the bar, party, restaurant, company, or forum for being an asshole. Where you draw the line might be different than mine, or where the people who run then show where you are present, but that is life.

       I see pretty racist shit here all the time by users that are not banned so it seems likely you must have been pushing the envelope into either obnoxious or especially blatant, or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, maybe I'm wrong. Who knows.
