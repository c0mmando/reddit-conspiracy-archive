        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you watch documentaries, go to the reliable original sources, itâ€™s incredibly likely Kurt Cobain was murdered by a hired killer, most likely by Courtney Love. Not crazy, just telling facts. I once though he commuted suicide too.</p>

<p>After looking at all that crazy evidence nobody spread around, what evidence is there he actually did kill himself? Really wanna know the truth to the death of one of my idols. Thank you</p>
