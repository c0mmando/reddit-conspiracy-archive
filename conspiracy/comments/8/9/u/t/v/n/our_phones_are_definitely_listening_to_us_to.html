<p>So we decided to do a little experiment to test this out. We thought of something I’ve never really searched before or seen recent ads for: gum. I was scrolling through instagram and said aloud phrases such as “Wow wish I had some gum right now”. </p>

<p>And what do you know a few hours later I’m seeing various ads for Mentos gum and Trident. </p>

<p>Pretty ridiculous, anyone know a way to turn off the mic in a way that advertisers aren’t spying on my private conversations? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was replying to someone who deleted all the apps that had permissions (presumable for things like the microphone and camera).  If that person is concerned about those specific apps having permissions, then then simply revoking the permissions is sufficient to prevent THOSE apps from using those features.  Any app developer can tell you that.  If you believe that your smart phone is still spying on you regardless of what permissions you give apps, then simply deleting apps is not going to protect you.  You shouldn&#39;t even have a smartphone then.  So your reply would be better directed at sheyLboogie than at me.</p>

<p>how-to-listen-to-and-delete-your-google-now-voice-history</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I did find this, which maybe is what alot of us are experiencing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of apps and games are monitoring smartphone users through their microphones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s obvious governments have the ability to utilize any microphone connected to a network, they even bragged about it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CIA CHIEF: WE&#39;LL SPY ON YOU THROUGH YOUR DISHWASHER
But they would never utilize it more than they needed too, or people might figure out how to block it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Btw, if you wonder what the quotes are, you should be able to find the sources easily by using google, i dont want to direct link to sites (even though i only ever link to &quot;mainstream&quot; sources), because thats why i got shadowbanned once or something, promoting links lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No because it isn&#39;t happening. Just think about it, they have  to record audio and run some natural language processing on it to extract meaning. Sure you could explain the &quot;shark vacuum&quot; more simply but taking everyone&#39;s examples  requires far more contextual knowledge. </p>

<p>The obvious answer is that it is a coincidence and unrelated to what you have said. There are so many other ways that you are targeted ads that they really don&#39;t need to record  voice to achieve these things.</p>

For instance I booked a few different hotels in China a few months ago and for like a month I kept getting Chinese hotel advertisements.

I&#39;m also already enrolled and attending the Canton import export fair but for some reason keep getting advertisements about it.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this.</p>

<p>If I already bought something on ebay then how likely am I to buy another one immediately afterwards?  That makes the ads seem pointless and annoying most of the time.</p>

<p>The stuff listed on their site is in categories so it wouldn&#39;t be hard to pick something from an adjacent category that I didn&#39;t buy, but is in the same area as what I did just buy.  Maybe the ads would be useful to me then, instead of being an annoying one way thing that I want to block.</p>

<p>Like recently I bought some running shoes and might find ads for joggers or water bottles to be useful, instead of ads for more running shoes.  I only have two feet and they know I already bought them.</p>

<p>Same with knives on amazon - why do I need to see more knives when they know I just bought some?  How about a chopping board or some saucepans?  No, I just need more knives apparently.</p>

They don&#39;t see the ads on phones like most people so I wonder if they would notice what they were thinking about in other ads like billboards or commercials. Or what if they didn&#39;t watch tv, would the ad find its way anyway?  I wonder if it&#39;s the social media apps who are responsible or if it&#39;s the phone supplier who is. It&#39;s most likely both, but I wonder, who is more to blame? What do you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if instead, the targeted ads or specific things you looked at online put the idea in your head in the first place, and then the algorithm is designed to show you ads of the thing it was designed to suggest? Mind control of the most insidious kind, the kind that makes you think the idea was yours when it was a planted suggestion. The illusion that the choice is your own. This is what I think government mind control is in practice. &quot;You are free... to do as we tell you.“</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So accepting the terms of condition and giving permission to use your device in any possible way didn&#39;t tip you off. I don&#39;t read before accepting, but in the app manager there is a recap of what the main points are. Question; did you think the companies just put in the terms that basically hands over all functions to them &quot;just in case&quot;? How can there still be frequent posts where people like OP sound like they uncovered a nefarious hidden scheme that nobody suspected? It&#39;s been right there, if you bothered to look for it, ever since you downloaded the app. There&#39;s a summary of the main points of the agreement in the app manager, nobody should be surprised. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I shit you not, I didn’t know I had a bunion until an ad suggested that I did. My friends and my girlfriend are always teasing me when I’m barefoot because my pinky toe is all deformed and nasty looking and it curls under the rest of the toes. On a few separate occasions they have just roasted me while describing the entire deformity in a satirical way. A couple weeks ago I got an ad for bunion treatment options. This seems like the type of ad not many people would find useful, so to me it just seems like the entire existence of the ad was conspicuous. I could just be paranoid, or my phone could have heard my friends making fun of my toe all the time and realized that I may have a bunion. Who knows. Still creepy in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made comments on the topic of US drones today too. Looked it up like 2 years ago and articles said that the decisions of who gets put on terrorism lists and when a &quot;terrorist meeting&quot; calls for a drone strike is all up to computer programs and AI that make networks of people based on cell phone connections, proximity, etc.</p>

<p>Drones decide who and when to kill. All a human does at this point is &quot;authorize&quot; the computers decisions. </p>
