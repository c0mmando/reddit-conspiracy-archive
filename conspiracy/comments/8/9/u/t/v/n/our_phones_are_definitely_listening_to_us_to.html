       My friend and I have suspected this for a while after noticing weird coincidences of things we’ve said and later seeing an ad related to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we decided to do a little experiment to test this out. We thought of something I’ve never really searched before or seen recent ads for: gum. I was scrolling through instagram and said aloud phrases such as “Wow wish I had some gum right now”.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do you know a few hours later I’m seeing various ads for Mentos gum and Trident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty ridiculous, anyone know a way to turn off the mic in a way that advertisers aren’t spying on my private conversations?

       I was replying to someone who deleted all the apps that had permissions (presumable for things like the microphone and camera).  If that person is concerned about those specific apps having permissions, then then simply revoking the permissions is sufficient to prevent THOSE apps from using those features.  Any app developer can tell you that.  If you believe that your smart phone is still spying on you regardless of what permissions you give apps, then simply deleting apps is not going to protect you.  You shouldn't even have a smartphone then.  So your reply would be better directed at sheyLboogie than at me.

       I know it was a smart ass comment, but i was being serious, and the logic behind my comment is that in todays day and age, almost any device can be remotely accessed, and if the device could be remotely accessed, then the mic, the camera, etc., all could be turned on, or tapped into and listened/seen through.

       It's obvious governments have the ability to utilize any microphone connected to a network, they even bragged about it.

       Btw, if you wonder what the quotes are, you should be able to find the sources easily by using google, i dont want to direct link to sites (even though i only ever link to "mainstream" sources), because thats why i got shadowbanned once or something, promoting links lol.

       ...gum is a pretty generic ad to get. In a few hours you can get plenty of different ads. It's not crazy that you got a gum ad. What would be telling is if you thought of something super specific and had strict time frame within you would look for it.

       This happened to me a few weeks ago. My friend and I were talking about hair transplants (not 100% seriously though) as he’s losing his hair quite rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn’t google it or look up online at all then a few days later on Facebook I was getting suggested ads about places that do hair transplants.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought this was all pretty much common knowledge though?

       As someone who builds apps - it's pretty easy to look into. This isn't some secret under the hood encrypted stuff. You can see every packet in and out of a device. You can proxy the SSL and de-encrypt them too, showing the raw data.

       They also can't get mic access while running in the background. And you can only have one AV session running at a time, so nothing besides the app using the shared session can have mic access when something is playing (Except for siri).
      </p>
      <p>
       (for example - you have spotify playing in the background and open facebook - facebook can't access your mic without taking over the active session, turning spotify off)

       No because it isn't happening. Just think about it, they have  to record audio and run some natural language processing on it to extract meaning. Sure you could explain the "shark vacuum" more simply but taking everyone's examples  requires far more contextual knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious answer is that it is a coincidence and unrelated to what you have said. There are so many other ways that you are targeted ads that they really don't need to record  voice to achieve these things.

       OP probably looked up a vacuum to compare the price online.

       One person mentioned Facebook app data is encrypted using a proprietary method called FB_ZERO. I'm sure NSA doesn't have access to it. It's disgusting how the alphabet companies have pretty much admin access to all of it (watch the movie "Snowden" and you'll see what I mean, they showed they can edit any posts, messages or content the users uploads).

       This literally happened to me today. I was at Target shopping for vacuums and i was facetiming my boyfriend to try and help me out. He goes "what brand is that one?" I said "it's a Shark vacuum" 
Not even 2 hours later an ad for SHARK VACUUMS popped up on my instagram. Our phones are for sure listening to us. I'm honestly scared for the future..

       That and other blue tooth tracking devices. I read somewhere that they track how long you spend in a certain section of the store. Say, for example, you spend some time looking for curtains in Target, so Target will start sending you ads for curtains/ other interior decorating items. It’s creepy.

       There is marketing technology called Data Management Platforms that “anonymously” create a digital construct of your identity using combinations of mobile device IDs, browser IDs and cookies to follow your behavior across the web and applications, which then allows your behavior on one site to become a segment for another. Advertisers don’t even need to know your name to be able to target you based on your behavior.

       I wouldn’t call this tech conspiratorial in nature in that the ultimate identity of individuals is still “hashed” and abstracted from First Party Data (data companies own about you), which makes it legal for them to share with other companies as Second Party Data, allowing both sets of companies to pool their data while protecting your identity but also allowing both to know who you are and what your  doing as they can engage you with targeted messaging.

       This is why people who love knives and read articles about them on one site can go to another site and see and ad about knives, even though they’ve never visited that second site before.

       I get pissed not because they are listening but because most of the ads are from stuff I already bought. For instance I booked a few different hotels in China a few months ago and for like a month I kept getting Chinese hotel advertisements. I already booked my fab hotel if you were smart you would send me ads related to staying in China other than accommodations. I'm also already enrolled and attending the Canton import export fair but for some reason keep getting advertisements about it. Talk about smart advertising.. they need to really work in their ai algorithms.

       Full disclosure, I accidentally bought woman's shoes (stupid page didn't make a distinction and they were the model and make I wanted... ) so all I get are woman's running shoe ads.

       Exactly this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I already bought something on ebay then how likely am I to buy another one immediately afterwards?  That makes the ads seem pointless and annoying most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stuff listed on their site is in categories so it wouldn't be hard to pick something from an adjacent category that I didn't buy, but is in the same area as what I did just buy.  Maybe the ads would be useful to me then, instead of being an annoying one way thing that I want to block.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like recently I bought some running shoes and might find ads for joggers or water bottles to be useful, instead of ads for more running shoes.  I only have two feet and they know I already bought them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with knives on amazon - why do I need to see more knives when they know I just bought some?  How about a chopping board or some saucepans?  No, I just need more knives apparently.

       I've been noticing this way too much also. Do you think someone with no social media is also being listened to and having data collected? They don't see the ads on phones like most people so I wonder if they would notice what they were thinking about in other ads like billboards or commercials. Or what if they didn't watch tv, would the ad find its way anyway?  I wonder if it's the social media apps who are responsible or if it's the phone supplier who is. It's most likely both, but I wonder, who is more to blame? What do you think?

       Hey! Just a friendly paranoid reminder, your phone/laptop camera also tracks every facial movement so they can track and profile what part of a web-page you are reading, how fast or how long you look over parts of a webpage, and what emotional reactions your face says about the info you are processing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the constant sound recordings from your phone are fed to an AI computer programs that reconstruct your surroundings from the acoustic properties of the environment.

       Just a few of the things i have proof of that were developed 5-10 years ago. The scary part is we have psychos running things.

       Drones decide who and when to kill. All a human does at this point is "authorize" the computers decisions.

       This evening I mentioned to my wife about how I should've picked up pizzas at earth fare ('healthy', overpriced grocer). I immediately open my phone and both Instagram and Facebook have given me ads for pizza; dominos and Pizza Hut- both of which I have not gotten ads for since ads first became the norm, and I had those companies hidden because 1, I'm a vegetarian and 2, I hid/reported every major corporate ad as soon as theyd happen.

Probably a coincidence but I don't doubt that certain apps people have do listen to speech

       What if instead, the targeted ads or specific things you looked at online put the idea in your head in the first place, and then the algorithm is designed to show you ads of the thing it was designed to suggest? Mind control of the most insidious kind, the kind that makes you think the idea was yours when it was a planted suggestion. The illusion that the choice is your own. This is what I think government mind control is in practice. "You are free... to do as we tell you.“

       So accepting the terms of condition and giving permission to use your device in any possible way didn't tip you off. I don't read before accepting, but in the app manager there is a recap of what the main points are. Question; did you think the companies just put in the terms that basically hands over all functions to them "just in case"? How can there still be frequent posts where people like OP sound like they uncovered a nefarious hidden scheme that nobody suspected? It's been right there, if you bothered to look for it, ever since you downloaded the app. There's a summary of the main points of the agreement in the app manager, nobody should be surprised.

       I shit you not, I didn’t know I had a bunion until an ad suggested that I did. My friends and my girlfriend are always teasing me when I’m barefoot because my pinky toe is all deformed and nasty looking and it curls under the rest of the toes. On a few separate occasions they have just roasted me while describing the entire deformity in a satirical way. A couple weeks ago I got an ad for bunion treatment options. This seems like the type of ad not many people would find useful, so to me it just seems like the entire existence of the ad was conspicuous. I could just be paranoid, or my phone could have heard my friends making fun of my toe all the time and realized that I may have a bunion. Who knows. Still creepy in my opinion.
