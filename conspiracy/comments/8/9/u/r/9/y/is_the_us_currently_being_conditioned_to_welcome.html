       I think that a total dis-trust OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM is now being SOLD to the American people. Your kids will get gunned down at school. Your local police grunts will shoot YOU dead with a hail of gunfire in your own backyard with no questions asked, and no accountability afterwards. Your FBI has become incompetent tools, or worse, they coordinate mass shootings and other false flag events designed to affect your vote. Your local and national news media outlets are all straight-up corporate propaganda, as all have been bought and paid for. And your Government Officials can’t walk and chew bubble gum, or even remember what they campaigned on a year ago, and they don’t even try to hide it anymore. Billions vanish into thin air and when they get called out on it, they simply shrug it off.
I mean, if TPTB take all of the agencies that keep our systems functioning and then artificially or purposely drive them into the ground, plunging us into chaos.. how many people would gladly “bend the knee” to a functional foreign government entity that dangled “a way out” in front of them?

       Actually you're only half right. I think the plan is to have Trump mostly do a good job (at least on the surface for americans to see), that way the masses are supportive of the their government as the NWO continues along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about what things are gonna look like by 2020 re-election:
-Possible peace with North Korea
-Possibly no Russian collusion found (makes Trump look good, makes "deepstate" boogeyman look bad)
-Good economy
-Wall is going up (illegal immigration appears to be slowing down)
      </p>
      <p>
       People are going to be dying to have the puppet in office, and these things aren't really in the way of the NWO agenda. People have been waking up on a large scale so instead of trying to maintain the same strategy or finally taking complete totalitarian control and exposing the truth - they've come up with this brilliant idea of giving the people what they want but controlling it the whole time. People wanted someone like Trump who is "anti-establishment", someone to fight against globalism and leftist policies. So that's what they've given us, but he's a puppet and now they can continue to bring on the NWO while Americans who aren't paying attention are supportive because they think they've got a guy who's on their side. Why have the people get mad at the establishment? That makes them harder to control, at a time when more and more people are privy to what's going on. You could just manufacture the revolution so that you control it.

       What part of it is so dreamy? They are doing peace talks this year. FBI just said that Trump is not currently a criminal target, the economy is (reported) to be better and the wall is well on it's way to being built. It's all completely possible. Why is everyone on reddit so sure of themselves like they've seen the future? I don't know what's gonna fuckin happen, and neither do you so piss off.

       Yes and certain nations will provide certain functions. I believe the US saw this on the horizon 70 years ago and made moves to be the police/military sector and not end up the manufacturing/production sector like China.

       "Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond [i.e., an "extraterrestrial" invasion or Russians!!], whether real or promulgated [emphasis mine], that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government." —Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991

       If you are defending the United States, you are defending the global government.  That's why the US has a shit ton of military bases around the world and declared an unending war.  I don't know how conservatives can keep believing that there is a difference between the US and the so-called "New World Order" that Kissinger and Bush Sr. called themselves.

       The people calling the shots are not omnipotent and do not know everything, as much as they pretend.  The system looks stupid and incompetent because it is stupid and incompetent; perhaps deliberate incompetence because the rulers don't care, or are arrogant.  Part of wielding power is finding people dumb enough to be manipulated to do your bidding, rather than finding someone who is ethical and considerate; the only way an authoritarian, hierarchical society can persist is through forced ignorance.  It would be the same whether it's a tin pot national dictatorship, or a global government.  Even if there weren't a tendency of hierarchical organizations towards incompetence, though, governing is (duh) hard, and there are real material difficulties with 7 billion plus people on the Earth's current resources which would push people towards ideologies like population control and eugenics.  (The question of population isn't an insurmountable one, but sadly given a free choice too many people will pursue eugenics ideology, and too few will take the steps necessary to stop eugenism.)

       Trump is freaking people the fuck out and if/when the backlash comes, Democrats are going to rally behind the safest, least controversial, most "electible" choice they can find, and it will be a Globalist and people will run willingly into the globalists arms just to save them from Trumpism.

       Actually you're only half right. I think the plan is to have Trump mostly do a good job (at least on the surface for americans to see), that way the masses are supportive of the their government as the NWO continues along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think about what things are gonna look like by 2020 re-election:
-Possible peace with North Korea
-Possibly no Russian collusion found (makes Trump look good, makes "deepstate" boogeyman look bad)
-Good economy
-Wall is going up (illegal immigration appears to be slowing down)
      </p>
      <p>
       People are going to be dying to have the puppet in office, and these things aren't really in the way of the NWO agenda. People have been waking up on a large scale so instead of trying to maintain the same strategy or finally taking complete totalitarian control and exposing the truth - they've come up with this brilliant idea of giving the people what they want but controlling it the whole time. People wanted someone like Trump who is "anti-establishment", someone to fight against globalism and leftist policies. So that's what they've given us, but he's a puppet and now they can continue to bring on the NWO while Americans who aren't paying attention are supportive because they think they've got a guy who's on their side. Why have the people get mad at the establishment? That makes them harder to control, at a time when more and more people are privy to what's going on. You could just manufacture the revolution so that you control it.
