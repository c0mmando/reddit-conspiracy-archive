Pedophilia in the &#39;elite.&#39;  Not just pizzagate (get past Comet and Podesta and see the string evidence), not just savile, not just Haiti, all of it. 
What could be proven if we actually tracked links and found enough evidence to do something.  If 41818 could get enough traction on some bullshit surely we could find enough coincidences to get something going</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you see the <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/observer.com/2017/05/law-order-svu-recap-dick-wolf-mariska-hargitay/amp/">Law &amp; Order SVU “Pizzagate” Episode</a>?  A congressman’s email is hacked and a “fringe website” is framing him as a pedophile...he asks SVU detectives for help.  They discover the CP on his home computer was all downloaded while the congressman was out of town.  Turns out they were planted there by an Alex Jones lookalike man who singlehandedly runs the website EndLessTruths.com.  The accusations now debunked, the congressman takes his daughter to eat at the restaurant to assure the neighborhood it is safe.  Suddenly, an armed man in head to toe camo sees the congressman with a young girl in the restaurant, rushes in and shoots him dead, leaving the young girl crying over her father’s bleeding corpse.  Everyone then shakes their heads collectively in disgust...<em>Look What Fake News Did Now!</em></p>

<p>P.S.  That was the last SVU episode I watched after 18 seasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we could get everyone to realize the powerful people of this country and world were involved in such sick things, I don&#39;t think we&#39;d have to worry about the things you mentioned.</p>

<p>I agree with you, we see these things coming, but who else cares.  If you mention it you&#39;re a conspiracy theorist.  If we could get people to wake up to TPTB and pedophilia then the police state could crack down, then the corrupt media could try to hide it, the chemicals in our food and everything would be blown open by this fact.</p>

<p>This is the biggest conspiracy that could bring everything down. We can&#39;t just focus on things normal people don&#39;t care about </p>
