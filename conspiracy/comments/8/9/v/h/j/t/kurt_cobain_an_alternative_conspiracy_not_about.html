<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>“My mother encouraged me to be artistic. It was written in a contract at an early age that I would be an artist.” – Kurt Cobain</p>

<p>That is kind of a strange quote, isn’t it?</p>

<p>In 8th grade (this was the 2000s), I discovered Nirvana, and my life changed forever because I felt as though I finally found music that I could connect with on a deeper level. At the time, Nirvana seemed revolutionary to me. Though I still enjoy the grungy simplicity of Nirvana, now that I am older, I have had some suspicions about Kurt Cobain and grunge itself, and I feel there was a deeper agenda behind the music. While I could explore many types of music in this post, I wanted to focus mostly on Kurt Cobain and grunge itself, as well some strange connections, solely for this post. This post is meant to be more “fun” than “serious”, but I will do my best to provide evidence for some of my theories. Anyway, it is always nice to have a break from politics or the NWO agenda (though, this is really still part of it!), and I would love to hear your thoughts! Again, this is a <em>conspiracy</em> post, so in the end, you can decide what you believe. Is there something darker than self-pity behind Cobain&#39;s music?</p>

<p><strong>Hidden Messages</strong></p>

<p>Again, growing up, Cobain’s lyrics seemed dark and relatable, but as I have had time to reflect on his music, as well as grunge music in general, I see there seems to be a sort of “agenda” aimed toward the youth who enjoy his music.</p>

<p>Unlike music of previous generations, grunge was the first genre to make “not caring” popular. Grunge revolutionized music at the time. According to the Guardian, “And this is significant why? Because grunge wasn&#39;t just another musical or youth trend - it was the ultimate expression and fusion of most of the defining cultural, ideological and social threads of the modern western world. Feminism, liberalism, irony, apathy, cynicism/idealism (those opposite sides of one frustrated coin), anti-authoritarianism, wry post-modernism, and not least a love of dirty, abrasive music; grunge reconciled all these into a seminal whole.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/31/grunge">Read more here</a></p>

<p>A younger version of me did not see the hidden messages in grunge. Sure, I understood the apathy aspect of it, maybe even the rebellion against conformity, but I could not possibly have understood the deeper undertones as a 13-year-old girl. All I knew at the time was that Kurt Cobain was different, like me, so he had to be right about something.</p>

<p>As a young woman, one thing I loved about Kurt’s music was his appeal to feminism. Still, there is something deeper here then than just Kurt respecting women.</p>

<p><strong>Feminism</strong></p>

<p><em>“Never met a wise man, if so it’s a woman.” – Territorial Pissings</em></p>

<p>One of Cobain’s songs, “Mr. Mustache”, seemed to speak out against machismo culture. Cobain considered himself a feminist, and according to GoMag, “In an interview with PBS, <a href="http://gomag.com/article/men-love-remembering-kurt-cobain-feminist-lgbtq-ally-ahead-time/">Cobain pointed out how society treats women unfairly, again referring to his childhood experiences: “Because I couldn’t find any friends—male friends that I felt compatible with—I ended up hanging out with the girls a lot. I just always felt that they weren’t treated with respect. Especially because women are totally oppressed.”</a></p>

<p>Look, I am not against Cobain being a feminist. As I said, his feminist positions appealed to me at the time. What I am saying though is that Cobain seemed to condemn masculinity in his music, as if masculinity is “inherently” wrong. The point is the younger version of me may have not been picking this up. Instead, I was thinking how cool it was that he advocated for women; still, I was not taking in the undertones that “men and masculinity suck.” It might be important to note that Cobain himself was a bisexual, which was pretty radical at the time, and he had some pretty strong positions about the LGBTQ community.</p>

<p>Today, many men feel attacked simply being men or having masculine qualities. This demonization of men did not start with Cobain, but he certainly contributed to it. </p>

<p><strong>Apathy/Nihilism</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;Look on the bright side, suicide.&quot; - Milk It</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/2014/06/Was-Sixties-Golden-Age-of-Rock.html">There’s a theory that the counterculture of the 60s was actually a psyop, and you can read more about that here.</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-illuminati-stole-the-mind-soul-and-body-of-hip-hop">Or maybe you feel like reading about how the “illuminati” infiltrated rap and hip hop.</a>.</p>

<p>[Or take a look at the secret meeting that changed rap music](<a href="http://www.hiphopisread.com/2012/04/secret-meeting-that-changed-rap-music.html">www.hiphopisread.com/2012/04/secret-meeting-that-changed-rap-music.html</a>).</p>

<p>Whatever you believe about these theories, for a moment, entertain that it is possible that there are some larger, more sinister forces in control of the pop music industry. Why? Well, it is no surprise that music has a phenomenal impact on the masses. The question is, though, is music merely a reflection of culture and society of the time, or is there something more sinister behind the music industry? That is up to you to decide.</p>

<p>If grunge has an agenda though, what is it?</p>

<p>Well, going back to Cobain, the theme of all of his music encompassed these points:</p>

<p>• Life sucks, but there is nothing you can really do about it/emptiness (I hate myself and want to die/Smells like teen spirit)</p>

<p>• Broken-heartedness (Heart Shaped Box, You Know You’re Right)</p>

<p>• Depression (Something in the way, Every Nirvana Song)</p>

<p>• Do drugs to get a temporary high or break from life (Dumb, On a Plain)</p>

<p>• Women’s issues (rape, abortion, etc.) – (Pennyroyal Tea, Polly, Rape Me, Been a Son)</p>

<p>• Fun, Meaninglessness, Pointlessness (Drain You, Molly’s Lips)</p>

<p>• Feeling like an outcast/anti-conformity (Lithium, In Bloom, Come As You Are)</p>

<p>Those are just my interpretations, by the way, so do not freak out if you are a big Nirvana fan and disagree. The point is that the songs may make a statement, but they are more about “acceptance” of things vs. changing anything. With the exceptions of songs about women, the other songs produce apathy, depression, and even bitterness in the listener. The message is overwhelmingly, “Life sucks and is ultimately meaningless, but maybe we can have some fun sometimes and escape with drugs.” My friend told me the other night, “I never liked Kurt Cobain – all he did was complain and whine.”</p>

<p><em>&quot;Hey, wait, I got a new complaint.&quot; - Heart Shaped Box</em></p>

<p>Look, I am not saying that these songs do not have a place – as noted earlier, I connected to this music. On a larger scale, though, the agenda seems to be to get a generation to buy into apathy and meaninglessness. <strong>Nihilism.</strong> If you wanted to rule the world, what better way than to produce a generation who cares about nothing? What about a generation who complains but does nothing to change anything?</p>

<p><em>I miss the comfort of being sad.</em> (Francis Bean Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle)</p>

<p>(I did always like that lyric). </p>

<p><strong>Strange Connections</strong></p>

<p><em>“Married. Buried.” – All Apologies</em></p>

<p>When looking at Cobain’s life, it is important to note some strange findings. </p>

<p><em>Courtney Love</em> - How can we mention Cobain without Love? It is important to note that I am not really going to be discussing Cobain’s mysterious death in this post, as there are thousands of sources on that. If you want to watch <em>Soaked in Bleach</em>, I heard it was good (though despite being such a big fan, I have not watched it).</p>

<p>Anyway, Courtney Love has CIA connections. This source is not the best, but if nothing else, a fun read:</p>

<p><a href="http://themetalden.com/?p=64919">http://themetalden.com/?p=64919</a> (warning before clicking!)</p>

<p>According to this site, &quot;Kurt was purportedly under the control of Hank Harrison, Courtney Love’s father, a CIA operative/manager for the GRATEFUL DEAD.”</p>

<p>It makes a decent (if not entertaining) argument that Cobain was nothing more than an MK ultra victim – I mean have you seen all the pictures of him <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kurt+cobain+wearing+dresses&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC3pGT66HaAhVMzIMKHXkbDagQsAQIKA&amp;amp;biw=1093&amp;amp;bih=521#imgrc=BtiAaS8tGQWxmM">wearing dresses</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, getting men to wear dresses is a pretty big deal in the entertainment industry. Even ask <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbFRYF-bbM">Dave Chapelle</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, there are some other arguments made on that site (the one I warned about clicking), and I find them intriguing. I warn you it takes a while to load and has blasting metal music in the background – but a fun read, nonetheless!</p>

<p>Speaking of MK Ultra, I always thought this lyric from &quot;Lithium&quot; was interesting, as many MK Ultra victims are said to shave their heads for various reasons (think Britney Spears):</p>

<p><em>&quot;I’m so lonely, that’s ok I shaved my head, and I’m not sad.”</em></p>

<p>By the way, Lithium was about Cobain’s bipolar disorder…(or maybe alter egos?)</p>

<p><em>The 27 Club</em></p>

<p>Kurt Cobain also either committed suicide or was murdered at 27, joining the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/a-brief-history-of-the-27-club-20131112/brian-jones-0069953">infamous 27 club</a>.</p>

<p>Was Cobain some type of illuminati sacrifice? If he was murdered, why was he murdered?</p>

<p><strong>Some More Questions</strong></p>

<p>You probably know that Kurt Cobain was not the best guitar player, so other than some catchy songs, how exactly did Kurt Cobain get famous?</p>

<p>Well, things seemed to come together when Cobain met Love. According to Biography.com, “While his band was struggling to make it, Cobain made a fateful connection in his personal life. In 1990, Cobain met his match in an edgy rocker named Courtney Love. The two met at a show at the Portland, Oregon nightclub Satyricon. While they were interested in each other, their relationship did not get off the ground until much later.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biography.com/people/kurt-cobain-9542179">Learn more here</a>.</p>

<p>That same year, he was able to connect with Sonic Youth, and in 1991, signed a major record label. Perhaps this could not have been done without Courtney Love, the one with the CIA connections?</p>

<p>The rest is history.</p>

<p><strong>Stealing Music</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;Somewhere I have heard this before. In a dream or memory, I’m sure.&quot; - On a Plain</em></p>

<p>It is rumored that Cobain stole a lot of his music. Here is a site that lists the rip-offs/influences. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nirvana/comments/3k6bd3/the_songs_nirvana_ripped_offinfluenced/">You decide</a>.</p>

<p>While this may not be a conspiracy, it certainly does show you something about Cobain’s character. Further, one does not necessarily have to be that great of an artist to rise to fame these days. So, what exactly did Cobain due to get so famous? (Sold his soul?)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/pixies_claim_kurt_cobain_ripped_them_off_and_confessed_it.html">By the way, even the Pixies claimed Nirvana ripped them off</a>.</p>

<p>The point here is that Cobain did not get famous until after he met Love, and much of his fame could simply have been ripped off. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion/Some Mysteries</strong></p>

<p>I did not get into everything I wanted, especially Cobain’s suicide or the conspiracies surrounding that. However, that might wait for another post. The point of this post is that I feel that there are larger agendas when it comes to these rock icons, and I do not think “Random Fame” is anything but an oxymoron.</p>

<p>In order for someone to become famous, I believe that one has to either have to literally or metaphorically sell their souls. Maybe you can ask <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YiqZvM1Pyo">Bob Dylan about selling his soul</a>.</p>

<p>Further, I believe there are specific agendas behind pop music, and grunge is no exception. For me, writing this saddens me both literally and physically. Let me explain.</p>

<p>When I look at Cobain now, it feels like he was nothing more than a tool or puppet. At the time, he seemed revolutionary. This saddens my inner, depressed teen. </p>

<p>At the same time, I listened to Nirvana’s music as I wrote the post. I grew very depressed, and I do not think this is just a coincidence. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-listening-to-music-lifts-or-reinforces-mood-051713">Music unquestionably affects our emotions</a></p>

<p>While we likely seek out music that is a reflection of who we are, I still do not appreciate the hidden agenda of “abortions are great” and “men suck” behind this depressing grunge music I once loved. Feel free to listen to Pennyroyal Tea, which appears to glorify abortions if you do not believe me. </p>

<p>Anyway, this post is meant to get you to think. Maybe it is all bullshit, or maybe there is something to it. Who was your musical hero? Is there a darker story there? </p>

<p>No matter what the true story is behind Cobain, there is no doubt that Cobain was deeply dissatisfied with the façade that many put up. There is no doubt that he was, in a way, aware of his own flaws and his own hypocrisy at times. I’ll give him credit that he at least had an accurate view of modern society.</p>

<p>So do you like Radiohead</p>
</blockquote>

<p>love this post, thanks for taking the time to write it!</p>

<p>while reading it, my mind kept going to radiohead, because growing up in the mid-late 90&#39;s, when all my friends were into nirvana, i was obsessed with radiohead (still am to this day).. the reason i kept going back to them, is because it had me wondering about them, and what impact &quot;the industry&quot; had on them, and their becoming &quot;popular&quot;.. i have always maintained that one of the aspects of my love of radiohead is that they have always been, or at least seem to be, genuine.. and unlike nirvana, radiohead always have had this sort of beauty and escapism to their music that nirvana lacked.. like back then, my friends would give me such a hard time and go on about radiohead being music for pussies, depressed people etc.. but i always saw it differently.. radiohead helped me see the beauty in the shit around us.. and i think the way thom&#39;s dark lyrics intertwine with the beautiful melodies and rhythm&#39;s etc, is what set them apart.. </p>

<p>anyway, when i look at how radiohead&#39;s career has gone over the past three decades, i feel like they truly are outsider&#39;s and used the industry to their advantage, then dropped them once they were big enough to &quot;go their own&quot;.. would love to hear your thoughts on this as well!</p>

<p>also, i feel like morrissey in another &quot;pop star&quot; that always did things on his terms, and because of it, was constantly vilified in the press and within the industry, up to this day.. he&#39;s labelled racist, xenophobic, far right etc.. </p>

<p>anyway, awesome, thought-provoking post! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My 14 year old self finds this all very interesting. I loved Kurt n Nirvana back then and read all the books, bought all the CDs, and had a shit ton of Nirvana merchandise. </p>

<p>The only thing I can contribute to this post is Kurt often wore dresses and at no point to I believe it was because he was told to. There&#39;s a lot of photos of him as a teenager wearing a dress on stage, I feel like because he was a feminist and was told at a young age his mother wanted a girl not a boy, is the reason why he wore dresses. I feel like it was a, fuck it, sort of attitude towards it.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my two cents. But thank you for writing this up, it&#39;s made me feel very nostalgic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I have written about music on many levels </p>

<p>I thought this would be an interesting post because when most think of Kurt Cobain, they think of his death.</p>

<p>Also, I cannot deny there seemed to be an agenda behind his lyrics, whether intentional or not.</p>

<p>Are music stars purposely bred in some sort of MK Ultra playground...?</p>

<p>Or am I reading to much into this.</p>

<p>There is a theory that Cobain&#39;s dad did actually work for the government, but could not find a semi-decent source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>John Potash&#39;s book <strong><em>Drugs As Weapons Against Us</em></strong> has a lot of information about Kurt Cobain&#39;s activism, and Courtney Love&#39;s tragic CIA MK-Ultra past.  Combining the book with the film <strong><em>Soaked In Bleach</em></strong> is eye-opening.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s been known for decades and even reported in &quot;mainstream&quot; news sources that the FBI keeps files on all celebrities due to their public influence.  Celebrities can even request a FOIA copy of their FBI records -- and the FBI will release some partial info to them.</p>

<p>Years before former Beetle, anti-war activist John Lennon was murdered, the U.S. government tried to deport him.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The &quot;stars&quot; are made, not found</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a whole intelligence operation to create the counterculture of the <a href="https://dangerousminds.net/comments/classic_rock_conspiracy_theory_weird_scenes_inside_the_canyon">1960s</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thomas McGrath: Tell us about Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon. What is this new book’s central thesis?</p>

<p>David McGowan: To the extent that it has a central thesis, I would say that it is that the music and counterculture scene that sprung to life in the 1960s was not the organic, grassroots resistance movement that it is generally perceived to be, but rather a movement that was essentially manufactured and steered. And a corollary to that would be that for a scene that was supposed to be all about peace, love and understanding, there was a very dark, violent underbelly that this book attempts to expose.</p>

<p>Thomas McGrath: How convinced are you by it and why?</p>

<p>David McGowan: Very convinced. It’s been a long journey and virtually everything I have discovered – including the military/intelligence family backgrounds of so many of those on the scene, both among the musicians and among their actor counterparts; the existence of a covert military facility right in the heart of the canyon; the prior connections among many of the most prominent stars; the fact that some of the guiding lights behind both the Rand Corporation and the Project for a New American Century were hanging out there at the time, as were the future governor and lieutenant governor of California, and, by some reports, J. Edgar Hoover and various other unnamed politicos and law enforcement personnel; and the uncanny number of violent deaths connected to the scene – all tend to indicate that the 1960s counterculture was an intelligence operation.</p>

<p>Thomas McGrath: You propose that hippie culture was established to neutralise the anti-war movement. But I also interpreted your book as suggesting that, as far as you’re concerned, there’s also some resonance between what you term “psychedelic occultism” (the hippie counterculture) and the “elite” philosophy/theology? You think this was a second reason for its dissemination?</p>

<p>David McGowan: Yes, I do. Hippie culture is now viewed as synonymous with the anti-war movement, but as the book points out, that wasn’t always the case. A thriving anti-war movement existed before the first hippie emerged on the scene, along with a women’s rights movement, a black empowerment/Black Panther movement, and various other movements aimed at bringing about major changes in society. All of that was eclipsed by and subsumed by the hippies and flower children, who put a face on those movements that was offensive to mainstream America and easy to demonize. And as you mentioned, a second purpose was served as well – indoctrinating the young and impressionable into a belief system that serves the agenda of the powers that be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post!</p>

<p>I agree with a lot of what you said here. I think Kurt was a mind control victim. Not in a direct MKUltra type way but in the same way we&#39;re <em>all</em> mind control victims. There is no doubt the whole apathy is cool movement of the &quot;grunge&quot; scene was right up the alley of TPTB&#39;s agenda and was one of the main reasons that scene got so huge. (Aside from the fact that there were some really decent rock bands there)</p>

<p>He was in the right place at the right time, his point of view and musical aesthetic was perfect for that time period and echoed a lot of what gen X was feeling. The 80&#39;s rock scene of &quot;show us your tits&quot; and total debauchery had grown stale and very old. People were branching out not only musically but also politically and we didn&#39;t know quite why but we knew we were all pissed. At the time I really could relate to the helplessness and apathy. </p>

<p>In the end I see him as a tragic figure, he really was just a kid. He was the type of guy that had so many constant negative thoughts that it lead to him being very easily manipulated. Love is definitely a huge part of this and I don&#39;t overlook her fathers connections in all that for a second. </p>

<p>The beat goes on I guess. You even can notice it today in pop music. There will always be the popular artists there to promote the party and don&#39;t give a shit lifestyle. Although now it&#39;s more geared toward a mass consumer life style but at the end of the day that is party and don&#39;t give a fuck in a modern sense. </p>

<p>1Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος. 2οὗτος ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν θεόν. 3πάντα δι&#39; αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο, καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν.</p>

<p>&quot; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with (the) Godm and God was the Word. He (the Word) was with (the) God in the beginning. Through him (the Word) all was made, and absent him nothing was made.&quot;</p>

<p>This concept of the close relationship between the spoken word and the manifestation of Reality is a theme throughout the Bible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plato wanted to ban the Lydian scale because it was “too relaxed” for “warlike men.” I don’t think he really had a grasp on how to enjoy music and instead saw it as a tool. The Lydian IS very mellow, but it’s very fun to play and is used in a lot of genres. There is nothing wrong with it, but yet it should be banned because it doesn’t envoke feelings of anger or high energy? Sounds to me that Plato was more on the “let’s use music to control” side rather than the “ban controlling music” side.</p>

<p>Anything else they produced afterwards had no real hit potential but was heavily pushed by video production style and hype.</p>

<p>To me they looked weak compared to (in no particular order) Soundgarden, Faith No More, PJ, Screaming Trees, Smashing Pumpkins and even Stone Temple Pilots which imho felt closest to Nirvana.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His guitar sounds good. What more matters? You say you&#39;re a fan, but there are very few bands with that kind of killer guitar sound dominating the music that don&#39;t have multiple guitarists (Pat Smear era notwithstanding)? Zeplin for sure, but not many others.</p>

<p>Cobain&#39;s guitar has a firey energy unmatched by anyone not named Hendrix. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like a debate between Neil Young and Eddie Van Halen. Sure, EVH can play rings around NY, but much of it just comes across as musical masturbation. Meanwhile NY can play a simple solo with mostly whole notes but the end result sounds sweet as hell.</p>

<p>Point is, complexity is just one possible method to sounding good. It&#39;s not the end objective in and of itself. Cobain&#39;s guitar dominated the alternative era, because he was better at making it sound good than other guys.</p>

<p>Take a listen, for example, to Weird Al&#39;s parody of Teen Spirit. I&#39;m sure he hired very experienced professional studio guys with far more versitilty than Cobain to play on that track. Yet the backing music isn&#39;t anywhere close to Nirvana&#39;s version, even if the notes are the same.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Xambk1JkWrE">https://youtu.be/Xambk1JkWrE</a></p>

<p>Kurt added some wrong notes to his power chord which gave it a distinct sound. Purposely? Who knows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a bit like saying from a technical perspective, Shaq sucked at basketball.

    <div class="md"><p>Right, nirvana became legends by being good musicians who could create music that people wanted to hear.</p>

<p>A good guitar player is someone who can proficiently play difficult music across all genres and have a better than average technical prowess. Think Tosin Abasi or Steve Vai. </p>

<p>Basically, if you hand Kurt a guitar, the most you&#39;d get out of him is power chords. That to me isn&#39;t a top 20 guitar player. Kurt is a top 20 musician though. That&#39;s the difference. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a junior in high school living very near to Cobain&#39;s hometown. Kids used to play Bleach (which I never bonded with) and then Nevermind on the stereo in the lunch room. I always felt his music to be uplifting for it&#39;s aggressive tones. I never fixated on the lyrics but the guitars are what got me. I can see getting apathetic and depressed from fixating on the lyrics. I never did. Nvrmnd was one of those albums we listened to in the weight room or on the way to go skiing, before wakeboarding in the summer to get riled up. It was up there with Smashing Pumpkins Gish and the classic Metallica albums for getting your energy level up. I was skater athletic, not jock athletic, but even the jocks listened to Nvrmnd before football. Guess testosterone makes all the difference.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he was as apathetic in real life as he was marketed to seem. There was an entire sub-culture of kids who hated mainstream MTV hair metal. The Pacific Northwest just breeds a lot of dark themes in art because of the constant grey skies. There also used to be and still is a rich history of anit-establishment mentality. I can definitely see how his music got less aggressive over time. </p>

<p>The great thing about the early grung scene was kids could relate. The stars weren&#39;t untouchable royalty. They were real guys and gals in jeans playing pawn shop instruments and rocking out in their garages and killing it. Seattle grunge destroyed the spandex wearing, big hair, L.A. bands that were the status quo. Too bad it got co-opted, but I suppose it was just to good not to.</p>

<p>You need to watch that documentary I think another user recommended. The one with the P.I. that secretly recorded his interactions with Kourtney Love. If there is a conspiracy, it was with her. The rest just seems to be a confluence of circumstances, particularly when they hooked up with sub pop. Their producer Butch Vig is a wizard. We still have a lot of great talent up here perfectly happy to fly under the radar. The fact the Foo Fighters turned into one of the greatest bands ever without even really trying too hard shows they had real talent deep into the roster. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The unplugged stuff has grown on me a bit and I thought it was cool when they first did it, but it never blew me away like Nevermind did. Their unplugged stuff was mellow, but that&#39;s not what I wanted from Nirvana. I already had a pretty solid foundation of acoustic music from blues and blue-grass and 70&#39;s rock and so the level of craftsmanship just wasn&#39;t there in that regard during Nirvana&#39;s unplugged sessions. Nirvana had a raw energy when fully suited up and plugged in that was just phenomenal and the tones they and their producer coaxed out of instruments you could buy at a pawn shop was off the charts. It was simple in it&#39;s construction and they were only a three piece band but the sonic depth they achieved was amazing. I was young and fed off that electric energy. Can&#39;t really get jacked up to go launch off a cliff on skies or hit a skate spot with the acoustic stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great points. But I have a strong suspicion that grunge not only destroyed hair metal, but the rocknroll music in all. There are always some good and great bands, but rap and hiphop (the worst kind of it) are now, sadly, the dominant power and cash cow in the music business. Rock is not edgy anymore, it sounds recycled and pale in comparison to it&#39;s influences and it&#39;s competition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just went back underground. The &quot;rock&quot; on the radio now is very much over produced and not really the cutting edge and best representation of the genre anymore. There is actually an explosion of great heavy underground rock now. The amount of good doom/psych/metal/stoner/thrash bands out there right now is mind blowing. </p>

<p>This this this so much this.</p>

<p>Me and my friends,who were all around thirty y.o., first generation metalheads(zep,maiden,priest, etc...) were absolutely overjoyed when nirvana teamed up with beavis and butthead to murder hair metal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that Music is a form of Magick. It creates thoughts and emotions in millions of minds that may lead to tangible actions in Reality that otherwise may never have been. Some of the oldest human artifacts are bone flutes found in caves some 30k years old. Music has always been a part of the human experience- and it has a powerful psychological effect on us.</p>

<p>Because of this, I believe that most music produced today for mass consumption is indeed tainted. The Recording Industry serve as the gatekeepers- for music unleashed is a powerful tool for good, but music controlled is, well, a powerful tool of control. The Record Industry is one of the three main arms of control- the other two being the Media and Hollywood. You make a very interesting case for Cobain and based on my own thoughts on Music and the Industry itself, I can see the scenario you paint as being far closer to Reality than many would like to admit.</p>

<p>That said- I believe that there is still good music being made today, though it is harder to find and doesn&#39;t get a lot, if any, radio time. Some of my personal favorite bands of all time are Pink Floyd and Judas Priest, and the messages of many of their songs are multilayered and ultimately hopeful and inspiring- though at first they may not seem so. And those that aren&#39;t hopeful or inspiring are often trying to seek to get across a deeper Truth of life. I&#39;ll leave you with a couple of my favorite songs by these groups.</p>

<p><strong>Judas Priest</strong></p>

<p>Dreamer Deceiver (awesome BBC live version)- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvlq1F-X6Ko">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvlq1F-X6Ko</a></p>

<p>Heading Out To The Highway- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKuuHfMx3CQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKuuHfMx3CQ</a></p>

<p><strong>Pink Floyd</strong></p>

<p>Another Brick In The Wall- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U</a></p>

<p>Breathe- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrojrDCI02k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrojrDCI02k</a></p>

<p>If you choose to listen to any of these, I&#39;d be interested in your thoughts. </p>

<p>On a slightly different note- when I was younger I was way more into JP&#39;s faster songs but as I&#39;ve gotten older I&#39;ve really started to dig into some of their slower stuff like Dreamer Deceiver and gained a new appreciation for their entire catalog. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know Priest gets a ton of credit but I still don&#39;t think most people realize just how fucking good they were. Even when they were pretty much old men they were putting out top notch stuff well into their career. Like Painkiller, that album was better than half the shit young bands were putting out at that time. </p>

<p>I did the same thing you did with Priest, at a younger age I liked all the more popular albums and never really dug into the catalog until later in life. Boy was I glad I did! The early albums are incredible, Stained Class being my favorite. Priest has definitely become one of my favorite bands these days. </p>

I’ve often thought about how my depression started alongside my obsession with Nirvana, AiC (my favorite, oh how I loved Layne Staley), PJ, Soundgarden, Corrosion of Conformity, the list goes on.

    <div class="md"><p>That’s a good question. After reading your post I think it’s possible the entire “grunge” ideology has permeated my life. For example, distain for authority: I’m a libertarian. Did this music somehow shape my personality in those formative years when I was moving from adolescence to adult? I don’t know. I think it’s possible. </p>

<p>An aside, programming generations is totally plausible in my opinion. If you’ve ever visited r/elsagate you’ll see what youtube content creators are putting out for Gen (? 2 - 8 year olds). Self-harm, learned helplessness, kidnapping fantasies, scat and urine fetishes. These videos are real - I saw one on H3H3 before I ever stumbled on elsagate on r/nosleep, then here. If they aren’t for manipulation of a child’s mind, I have no idea of their purpose.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some get shut down, but others will just pop up and take their place. It’s so difficult to monitor because they’re just mixed in with regular videos. It’s sort of a “gotcha!” when one pops up. There’s a post on the elsagate subreddit that has a huge list of the ones that have been canned and the ones that are still active. </p>

<p>I don’t know about the CIA or MKUltra. But youtube is so anal about giving copyright strikes for say, gamers slipping up and having music playing in the background, how do these channels manage to get away with this blatant infringement? Disney MUST be aware of their existence. Why aren’t they doing something?</p>

<p>There’s a great article from Medium on that sub as well. It’s linked in the intro thread. I believe the title is something like “Something is Really Wrong With the Internet.”  I’d link it I weren’t on my mobile. </p>

<p>There’s also a post on r/nosleep written by someone who worked in the production company for one of these smut factories. While most of those stories are just that, I tend to believe this one isn’t fiction. There are tons of links &amp; info in the comments from the OP and others. </p>

<p>My daughter was exposed to this garbage and told me she saw a video of Anna and Elsa “eating poop and drinking pee.” She doesn’t have access to YTkids (she couldn’t get on YT) or the Internet. I was horrified and sick for days thinking about my innocent first grader seeing that - it can’t be unseen. I hate these people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s purposefull and aimed at people that are relaxed with what their children watch on youtube. You could start with any innocent cartoon and will get to these satanists in matter of 1/2, 1 hour, by means of &#39;recommendation for you&#39; .... I&#39;m 100% sure they do this on purpose and it&#39;s not oversight on part of youtube. I&#39;ve watched a few of those videos, they have a strong omnious undertone to them. It&#39;s programming for sure.</p>

THEN came this FORCE.  We were at the age, we were sick of the junk on TV, being teens / early 20&#39;s we were NOT YUPPIES, we were not making BIG $$ like they were... society was depressed, recessions, the end of the 80&#39;s, we were raised on TV, Movies &amp; Music.  We wanted MORE... then music divided ... Hip Hop/ Rap &amp; Gangsta Rap, POP/ROCK &amp; ALTERNATIVE.  We found something!  It was fitting for the time &amp; really a lot still applies today.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I submit both Cobain and Love are lifetime actors playing a role in the cultural wars. The whole operation reeks of trauma based brainwashing as you well describe. Love is the proto-personifaction of hyper-dog-eat-dog feminism and is a self proclaimed “bitch”. Her motto is &quot; I found my inner bitch and ran with her.&quot;</p>

<p>Other contributions to the culture include, “The most sick and twisted bitches I know, are the ones I am proud to call my friends.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the most revealing messaging came at a eulogy Courtney Love gave for Cobain. It is hostile and rather anti-male. She read from an alleged letter from Cobain in which he comes across as whiney, weak and a bum and not a good representation of manhood or fatherhood. Love angrily calls Cobain a slacker and a quitter and used profanities against him in front of his fans.

Just take another shot and fall into the land of nod death will be comfortably and numb. Also your whole mentality changes when you get high, before your hit you could kill someone easy, after they are like a saint surrounded by puppies and rainbows and you&#39;d do anything for them.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t see someone that high killing themselves with a weapon when they could just as easily take one more dose. According to the toxicity reports he would have had to inject three full syringes in a row to get there. That never made sense to me. </p>

I will never think about Nirvana the same again, that is how powerful your writing and insight is. I don`t know if you are right about it all but damn, I think you are about a lot of it (or close) and especially the part about the music industry/cia creating stars and fitting them into their goals. Well done, and thank you for posting. My mind is now racing thinking about all the tragic lives of previous musicians and what really happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post and glad to see something other than the usual political / NWO conspiracies.</p>

<p>While I agree it&#39;s plausible that stars can attract handlers to hide them in a certain direction, I&#39;m not sure that is the case with Nirvana and specifically Kurt Cobain.</p>

<p>I too discovers Nirvana in my early teens, which was the mid 90s, I was just a year or 2 too young to see then live but remember the scene and the day he died.</p>

<p>KC wrote a heap of his own songs, there&#39;s a heap of underground bootlegs of songs which were on Nevermind, Inseticide and In Utero that they performed BEFORE 1990. Grunge is actually not grunge, it&#39;s post-punk, but that argument is for another thread.</p>

<p>Furthermore, KC shadow-wrote half the songs on Doll Parts. He was also fairly poor at songwriting and often created the melody and then made the lyrics fit. It&#39;s one of the biggest criticisms music-snobs have about Nirvana.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to appear to being &quot;making excuses&quot; for every point you raised because I really enjoyed your theory. However, the reason KC was a feminist is well documented, is parents divorced and he spent a heap of time with his mum and sister from a before teenagehood. He also watched his mother in a domestic violence relationship. </p>

<p>And as for the depressive overtones in the music, the &quot;it&#39;s all not worth it feel&quot;, Remeber that KC was not only a drug addict from fairly early, he was a full blown junkie by Nevermind, and there&#39;s strong evidence to suggest he was bipolar, which if you have, often starts shoeing symptoms after puberty and into late teens-early 20s.</p>

<p>Great post, I&#39;m not sure I buy it for this particular rock star. Also, let&#39;s all agree, fuck Courtney Love. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thought out, however I tend to disagree with some of the content. I feel there are things you have overlooked. He was very sarcastic and his lyrics and quotes were to be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>I would divulge further and add links, but I am on my shitty Samsung Galaxy Ace (yes some of us haven&#39;t evolved). If I have time I&#39;ll add some later.</p>

<p>For me, I got into Nirvana 2 years ago after watching Kurt and Courtney. I then became a bit obsessed with their music. Before this I was a big hip hop fan, which was a bit of a change for me. After a while I watched Soaked in Bleach and my opinions changed completely. I personally believe Kurt Is one of the most talented, intelligent musicians ever and such a great shame that he passed before he went onto other genres - listen to the incredibly beautiful MTV unplugged. </p>

<p>On listening to Nirvana, some of you have mentioned it how it coincidentally (or not) came at the same time as your depression. For me i oddly had the opposite effect. I had depression and anxiety issues after my 3rd child (I&#39;m male). Listening to Nirvana invigorated me and definitely helped me get through those hard times.</p>

<p>Apologies if I have gone off on a non coherent tangent. As I say I have a terrible phone and can&#39;t be bothered to proof read or add any input. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First let me say, I really liked your post. Really compelling theories about a few things.</p>

<p>Let me also say that I am one of those un? lucky bastards who saw Nirvana play live before they were famous. Kurt Cobain was nice, very down to earth, hung out in the audience before he played as well as after. It was only maybe 5 years later I realized who I&#39;d seen live because although I liked the music, it was forgettable almost. I now like their music, for what it&#39;s worth. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much of this conspiracy I agree with. I feel like the grunge &quot;message&quot; was one that generation needed, just like the one from The Cure, or The Pixies, or Nine inch Nails or even the Dead Kennedy&#39;s to name a few. </p>

<p>But music of the 90&#39;s is about changing the status quo of what it meant to be a pop star and celebrating the outsiders. They made goth mainstream, and heroin, and blue hair. They made &quot;alternative&quot; music which is now just as mainstream as the rest of pop. They took something which was about celebrating differences and made it bland.</p>

<p>I think this story wasn&#39;t about making the masses complacent, I think the story is about showing people who stand up and are different that they&#39;re not that different after all -- and then using that to make them conform by redefining the norm. </p>

<p>I grew up in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. I remember what it was like to try and seek out Manic Panic from the only store which actually sold Doc Martens. I remember what it was like to have a body piercing done in a back alley and then to be the only person I knew with one. I remember what it was like to wear ripped jeans when everyone thought it looked sloppy and shameful. I was <em>different</em> from the status quo, and instead of being able to hold on to that my peers were re-absorbed into the mainstream and forced into normalcy. Unlike my peers, I didn&#39;t continue to strive to be different because I was unwilling to insert bars of mental into my forehead or hang from hooks using my back skin, I was unwilling to cover my face in tribal tattoos or sink deeper in to the counter culture just to retain my identity from the mainstream. </p>

<p>I coalesced. And so did most people. </p>

<p>The conspiracy here is that &quot;they&quot; took music scenes which were special and different and normalized them to make more money and to take away our individualism. It isn&#39;t that the TPTB wanted to control the masses by making us complacent with depressing lyrics, it that they saw in us what they see in the teens today, something to fear and they manipulated it into a known thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t agree with a lot of this. You&#39;re misinterpreting so much of what grunge was about and I just can&#39;t even... You&#39;re just not understanding the level of anti and aggression that was aimed at GenX by their parents. WE were to BLAME for <em>every</em>thing. Our parent&#39;s divorces, crime, drugs, abuse, everything. </p>

<p>There reason that Kurt was gone by 27, it may have something to do with Courtney, but ultimately he was an addict and someone who suffered immense mental anguish. </p>

<p>As so many of us did/do. </p>

<p>Pink Floyd is music that is depressing to me. I love it, but it&#39;s got an influence about it, much as <em>some</em> Nirvana music does. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s easy to paint things into Nirvana from 25+ years down the track, but you&#39;re interpreting so much of it wrong. You can&#39;t apply a contemporary filter to something that is of another era and assume you&#39;re getting the essence correct. It&#39;s just not the right way to interpret things if you want your opinion to be validated or agreed with. </p>

<p>Your post has honestly made my head hurt and my heart sad. You&#39;ve just got it all so egregiously incorrect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most of the movements we saw/had were planned. But most backfired. The 60&#39;s brought peace and love instead of psychedelic drugs melting brains and degeneracy - they ended it with the Manson crimes blaming on the Beatles. Jim Morrison (his father was at the USS Liberty incident iirc), Beatles and Stones were heavily influenced in their music.</p>

<p>Then we have the 70&#39;s, Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Sabbath. Heroine, cocaine and destruction. Which also backfired since the youth now were protesting and not giving a fuck about laws, rules and TV. They ended the experiment with Lennon&#39;s (kinda stretch here) and Bonham&#39;s death (end of Led Zeppelin). </p>

<p>So we got the 80&#39;s, electronic, ecstasy, party, overdose. Which was also brought down with Grunge - suicide, depression, sadness. All of their plans to mold us backfired, so they killed cobain. That&#39;s why we have the 27 club (Robert Johnson created the blues, Jim Morrison, Cobain, Winehouse, Moon, so on).</p>

<p>Maybe they perfected the idea and that&#39;s why we see the 2000&#39;s and 2010&#39;s with Katy Perry, Spice Girls, shitty rap music, shitty popular music everywhere (brazilian funk for example, when brazil always had great musicians - bossa nova, samba, brazilian 80&#39;s punk rock as Legião Urbana).</p>

<p>We need a new movement, but a pure one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My forensic linguistics training is leading me to believe that Miss u/polkadotgirl has returned.</p>

<p>My take on Cobain is, in the mythos of pop culture, it was Kurt Cobain who was aware that consumerist capitalist culture eats everything, chews it all into a grey mush and shits out only itself. He was aware that there is no alternative to it, and that even alternative anti-capitalist music was inevitably absorbed into the beast.</p>

<p>He was aware that being real, sincere and truthful had a part to play in the spectacle. He was aware that the videos played most on MTV were videos against MTV, that his life was a pre-scripted cliche of what a rebellious rocker should do, that the rebellious rocker should wear a &quot;fuck mainstream rock magazines&quot; shirt on the Rolling Stone cover.</p>

<p>And the spectacle strangled him, leaving no air unvarnished and pure. There was no escape from the always rolling cameras. So he killed himself, hoping to find the authenticity that this world could never provide him.</p>

<p>But the tragic irony of it all is that suicide was the ultimate pre-scripted cliche for the rebellious rocker. Nothing is untouched and left real by the spectacle. A tortured soul was thrusted into a market needy for representations of tortured souls.</p>

<p>And to play Devil&#39;s Advocate to your position that Cobain was pushed by shadow forces to promote ennui and nihilism, here are some direct quotes that offer another view of a complicated soul.  </p>

<p>“We can pose as the enemy to infiltrate the mechanics of the system to start its rot from the inside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All in all is all we are.&quot; Pretty damn inspiring if you ask me. </p>

<p>“The duty of youth is to challenge corruption.” </p>

<p>“There&#39;s good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad.” </p>

<p>“Drugs are a waste of time. They destroy your memory and your self-respect and everything that goes along with your self esteem.” </p>

<p>“There are a lot of things I wish I would have done, instead of just sitting around and complaining about having a boring life.” </p>

<p>“Art is sacred.
Punk rock is freedom. 
Expression and right to express is vital. 
Anyone can be artistic.” </p>

<p>&quot;To be positive at all times is to ignore all that is important, sacred and valuable. To be negative at all times is to be threatened by ridiculousness and instant discreditably.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I wish him peace. I can only say that music is a reflection of an artist&#39;s soul. His soul seemed very troubled, if nothing else.</p>

<p>I believe that even if Cobain was not a nihilist himself, his music produced a nihilistic generation (to some extent).</p>

<p>Is Cobain the only one responsible? No. I mean, this post was just a snippet of something.</p>

<p>I definitely could have included every band I loved at the time including Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, etc., but would anybody want to read a 300 page post on this? Probably not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your argument of an artist being the source of a nihilistic culture, opposed to a reflection of a nihilistic culture, is inherently flawed. A nihilistic generation would have been born in that era, no matter if they listened to Cobain&#39;s angst or Pat Robertson&#39;s preaching. Many factors of causality create a weltanschauung.  </p>

<p>As I suggested in my first response, it might serve you well to explore the philosophical essence of nihilism so that you can strengthen your ability to diagnose causes of nihilism in our society and discover its true meaning. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Precisely. And my point being is that Cobain (and those other bands you name) were mirrors to a nihilistic culture, that became popular because they spoke truth to the undercurrents of a zeitgeist, of the emotions millions had felt across the world as reactions to a system that did not care for them. They were able to make sense of themselves and their world through music that acknowledged their melancholy. </p>

<p>I only reiterate this point because your post suggests that art has to be promotional of happy states of mind, and if it does not, then the Illuminati must be the ones behind promoting it, in their mission to spread darkness and nihilism through pop culture. Your theory confines art, instead of expanding its potential. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder who could be behind this post!</p>

<p>I agree with a lot of what you wrote. Nirvana&#39;s music promoted nihilism and apathy. In the wake of Kurt&#39;s &quot;suicide&quot;, there were dozens of copycat suicides around the world. Many of my friends who grew up on Nirvana&#39;s music, have since died of heroin overdoses.</p>

<p>But to say that Kurt wasn&#39;t a &quot;good guitarist&quot; is just balderdash. While he might not be skilled technical player in the Yngwie Malmsteen sense, Kurt can actually play quite well and invented a new tonal style, distinct from other grunge bands or any other music. His style is purposefully rough and dirty.</p>

<p>Also, to say Nirvana ripped off their music is equally absurd. Yes, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was probably inspired by the rhythm of Boston&#39;s &quot;More Than A Feeling&quot;, that&#39;s where the similarities end. The rhythm isn&#39;t even the same, let alone the chords, tonality, etc. They borrowed heavily from other bands for sure, but it&#39;s not even in the same ballpark as what Led Zeppelin did—actually <em>stealing</em> songs.</p>

<p>This reminds me Beatles&#39; conspiracies, where the claim is The Beatles songs were all written by Theodore Adorno and because he died The Beatles had to break up. The Beatles may have been LSD jingle-makers for the CIA&#39;s social engineering program, but when you look at the post-Beatles work of the four lads, it&#39;s obviously the same individual songwriters.</p>

<p>Anyway, watch <em>Soaked In Bleach</em>. Without a doubt, Kurt was suicided. He may live on Elvis-style, but the official story is a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>great post.  I will just give my two cents.  I suspect Kurt Cobain was most likely abused and that is why he has an aversion to machismo.  C. Love very likely could have CIA connections, she worked over seas as a stripper according to her biography (I think the Poppy Z. Brite one, but it has been a long time since I read that).  Also recently I watched a video with the Melvins saying they disagree with the portrayal of Cobain in &#39;monatage of heck&#39;, <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/59856-melvins-buzz-osborne-slams-kurt-cobain-doc-montage-of-heck-says-90-is-total-bullshit/">https://pitchfork.com/news/59856-melvins-buzz-osborne-slams-kurt-cobain-doc-montage-of-heck-says-90-is-total-bullshit/</a> ;</p>

<p>Cobain obviously had a cynical world view, and I think that grunge was marketed as a lifestyle.  Really interesting theory, and worth discussing further.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serendipity exists.  Life IS randomness.  Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction, so I understand where you&#39;re coming from.  I just don&#39;t think that Kurt knowingly tried to influence people to commit suicide or whatever.  He was a sad, depressed, messed up, drugged up individual.  But I don&#39;t think he would have been able to bring a child into this world if he wanted to spread the message of suicide.  My personal opinion on that same matter is he didn&#39;t actually kill himself.  I believe his wife at the time hired someone to kill him and make it look like an accident.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This rambling, incoherent post is a total fail. Are you really serious? Cobain an mkultra victim? Do you know anything about him at all? Have you not read his journals? Nothing in there indicates any such nonsense. His dad was a misogynist asshole, thats why he was pro women. You listed a song he didnt even write...mollys lips is by the vaselines. Kurt was not bi, he had a gay friend in high school, so people thought he was gay. He said he wished he was gay just to piss people off. These are words out of his own mouth. </p>

<p>On signing to geffen and fame: kim gordon of sonic youth was behind nirvana getting signed. Kurt went for it because he WANTED to be huge. Nevermind was slick and polished as hell, compared to bleach; multi tracked guitars and vocals, not to mention noise removed. Thank andy wallace for making nevermind a household name. Teen spirit is a catchy pop song, thats all there is to it. It was on top 40 radio, not just rock radio. Kurt had pop sensibilities, he wanted a commercial record. The cia didnt make it happen. </p>

<p>Courtney loves dad managed the grateful dead at one point. She herself was in a band before kurt. But she didnt make shit happen for him. She was estranged from her dad and was def a fucked up individual. She certainly covered up that he had been forcibly injected with a lethal dose of heroin while already on the nod, and then shot to cover the needle mark on his throat, etc etc, thats old news, but thats because she was a money grubbing attention whore piece of shit, not a government asset.</p>

<p>Kurt was surrounded by vampires and hangers on. This is typical of famous people. The cia didnt have to do anything. His story is sad but common, and says more about human nature and greed than government boogeymen. You seem to be projecting a lot of things on to a person whose music you like. I love nirvana and have looked VERY deeply into his death and the circumstances surrounding it, and i can say honestly that the cia was not involved. When you are surrounded by junkies, this sort of thing happens. I am also speaking from experience in that department, having sold drugs, lived in trap houses, been surrounded by iv users, crackheads, methheads, and all kinds of other scum. His death was par for the course. Heroin was huge in seattle and if his life was being controlled so was every other grunge band.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw Nirvana back before they got famous too.</p>

<p>Cobain was a useful idiot that helped the major labels appropriate the punk/indie scene.</p>

<p>Back then, you could go see gigs almost nightly and they&#39;d be cheap, fun shows. The music scene was very anti-corporate DIY and most venues were run independently.</p>

<p>The punk scene was getting bigger and top 40 music was getting lamer so the labels needed a new sound.</p>

<p>Grunge as a music genre was completely fictional. It was a corporate made up genre coined by a publicist. No one ever used the term &#39;grunge&#39; until after Nirvana came out.</p>

<p>Every city had their own style. Seattle&#39;s scene was a mix between punks and headbangers and they weren&#39;t as political as DC or hardcore as NY or as pretentious as bands from LA.</p>

<p>Me personally, I think Geffen had him whacked after Cobain threatened to quit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of this post is true, but a lot of it is inaccurate. I do think Kurt was possible an MK victim and ritually sacrificed. I think Courtney Loves dad was CIA. Even though Kurt shunned traditional masculinity, his music still had a very angry masculine energy. It’s a lot more masculinity than the music you hear today.
Also “Somewhere I have heard this before, in a dream my memory is stored.” I think he’s talking about deja vu you get from a dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even though I was in the right age range (born in &#39;75), I didn&#39;t pay any attention whatsoever to Nirvana or any other &quot;grunge&quot; band, and during the &#39;80s I didn&#39;t pay any attention to hair metal. The only types of music I liked during the &#39;80s and &#39;90s was old country (e.g., Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash, George Jones, etc.) and old Rock and Roll (e.g., Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, and most anything else prior to the Beatles and the music they influenced, which I didn&#39;t like at all).</p>

<p>I never really heard any of the grunge music until 1995 when my friend Ian came home from the Air Force with a huge collection of CDs. He had all that stuff: Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, etc. He would play one and I&#39;d say, &quot;That sucks,&quot; so he would play another one and I&#39;d say the same thing, and so on. Out of his entire collection of hundreds of CDs, the only ones I found that I liked were AC/DC, Guns N&#39; Roses, and George Thorogood.</p>

<p>In any case, I have no doubt that many, if not most, famous musicians are selected and controlled by various cabals as tools for furthering an agenda, especially the ones that most appeal to the youth of the day. </p>

<p>I see you write from the heart.  i appreciate you sharing this personal experience as well as the information you&#39;ve come across, and your transformation in the way you view this particular popular character - what he meant to you before and what he means to you now.  it takes a true sense of maturity to really examine oneself like that.</p>

<p>it seems to me that the (dark) occult and the controlling factions of our world like to take anything beautiful and turn it upside down.  it is possible many of these forms of music, including rock and hip hop and their various subgenres, may have originally started from the roots as an interesting local thing that really spoke to people and grew organically in its local areas, but whenever anything becomes widespread enough, there seems to almost always be an agenda behind it.  it&#39;s like it&#39;s not even allowed to gain mass exposure until it is corrupted enough to receive that exposure - until it serves some kind of purpose of those who are in the very position to widespread the artform (or the message or whathaveyou) in the first place.</p>

<p>as someone passionate about music from... perhaps, more remote places... i noticed something similar with music from places like africa.  the more organic music one can find there in the 60s through the 80s, on both record and cassette (though i personally find early local cassettes to be the most interesting overall).... and then, the music that started getting international exposure by around the 80s or so.  their sound always changes so dramatically from what they sounded like in their local, independent (and sometimes illegal) cassettes, from what they then sounded like in their international releases - that is, if they get international releases at all.  many musicians, depending on the circumstances, faced imprisonment, death, or exile from the country - but that&#39;s a whole other rabbit hole.  basically, from what i can tell, the 60s through the 80s in music from many parts of the &quot;third world&quot; was both the most wonderful time of recorded music in the whole world (in my view), yet also a freaking massacre of the world&#39;s greatest musicians from all corners of the globe - whether through death, imprisonment, exile, etc. or through the selling of their soul for international exposure.  i mean, it was a goddamn bloodbath, and largely the death of truly organic music worldwide by about the 1990s or so (though recently there has been some revival through cell phone recordings shared privately through bluetooth and such).  </p>

<p>but very, very few people know about this sort of thing.... even people who are passionate about african or asian music... well, some get it but many don&#39;t.  but the older generations of locals often say they hate the new &quot;counterfeit&quot; songs and long for the music of their past, though some are thankful their people ever had such interesting music at all, even if it &quot;wouldn&#39;t survive in the market today&quot;.</p>

<p>anyway, i hope to someday make a blog exposing this hidden world of sound.  music designed to uplift the spirit rather than suppress it.  even if you don&#39;t understand the words, you can feel the organic, raw energy in the sound.  i could be wrong, but i think there may be a universal appeal despite the very unprofessional sound quality (which i actually think adds a warm layer of information to the sound anyway), a lot of it just connects.  there is a night-and-day difference between this area and the current mainstream... music that was so very far outside of the global control system in every sense.  but copies of the music have largely been destroyed over the years by regimes and is considered &quot;impossible to find&quot; today.  but i will do what i can to make connections to find physical copies, despite my social anxiety... though luckily i&#39;ve already made a couple at least.  i hope to make more in the future.  </p>

<p>You make some great points. I find I do not really like music that uplifts. It may be important to note that I had a really messed up childhood. I wonder how that came to impact the type of music I liked/like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, okay :)</p>

<p>i had a bad childhood as well.</p>

<p>actually, the music can be quite dark and abrasive, depending on the type.  places of very high tension need an outlet, so some of it goes quite far off the deep end, especially when funded by warlords, rebel military factions, etc.</p>

<p>by uplifting, i mostly mean personal or community driven rather than an agenda pushed by the mass media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post. It is spot on. I had not seen that quote about his “contract” before.</p>

<p>“Sell the kids for food...” - In Bloom. </p>

<p>That’s what made me wonder what kind of environment Kurt grew up in. Seeing he had no father and how he ended up with Love, who has CIA ties, I wouldn’t say it is hard to conceive he might have come out of an MKUltra program.</p>

<p>I really wonder if Love was even born a woman. She kinda makes me want to vomit whenever I see her. Same thing happens when I see Mikey(Miley)Cyrus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent post. I&#39;m convinced that there is an agenda behind the music industry to implant ideas in our subconscious. Laurel Canyon definitely deserves investigation for those who think that&#39;s out of left field.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve been wondering is what type of music should be listened to? Classical? Jazz? Indie (although this is hit or miss as it&#39;s hard to tell who&#39;s behind what)?</p>

<p>Even instrumental music can have its own hidden manipulations. If you haven&#39;t investigated Pythagorean tuning it is a great rabbit hole to climb into. The short version is our modern day tuning of C at 440 Hz is 8 Hz higher than it should be. 432 Hz is a much more &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;harmonic&quot; tone whereas 440 tuning has been reported to create a feeling of unease and general negativity in some people. Other people think its a load of hokum. But hey, that&#39;s why we&#39;re in r/conspiracy right? To make up our own minds. Not have them made up for us.</p>

<p>Also, you may be interested in the Song of the Siren episode of the Higherside Chats podcast with Chris Knowles. He stretches preeetty far for my tastes, but I definitely think there&#39;s a couple kernels of truth in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting post, and actually I&#39;ve had similar thoughts with regards to trends and specifically popular music. </p>

<p>I was actually at this show. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ea/2a/05/ea2a05a751e79f0e72b43751f46fa325.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ea/2a/05/ea2a05a751e79f0e72b43751f46fa325.jpg</a>. That was in 1989. Nirvana was an opening act that I had never heard of, and was there to see 247 Spyz (a band no one now has ever heard of). I remember a friend of mine commenting that they heard Nirvana was going to be the next big thing. How they heard that, I have no idea. </p>

<p>For reference, the Outhouse was a tiny venue in the middle of a cornfield in Lawrence, KS that would attract a pretty big audience. It was nuts, and I loved it. The audience for the Nirvana/247 Spyz show was tiny. There was almost no one there. It was be possibly the smallest shows I&#39;d been to out there. Yet they went from that to super-stardom in less than two years.</p>

<p>And yeah, about that time the Outhouse went from one of the best and interesting music venues that was just fun for the sake of having fun, to something that eventually catered to what everyone else would want, to be profitable, to what it is now, which is a BYOB strip club. That&#39;s basically sums up the evolution of the whole scene in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting read,  thanks for submitting OP.  I found it interesting how you related to the lyrics whereas some people like me related to the music.  The lyrics were important for the rhythm,  but I never really dug into their meaning or really cared because I connected with the melodies and however they made me feel.  I can honestly say with Nirvana I probably would have committed suicide as a teen,  so I have no doubt that music can influence and change us on an emotional level.     </p>

<p>As long as I live,  and if asked on my deathbed,  I will gladly state Courtney Love is a cunt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a long time fan of Nirvana, I just want you to know that you are looking into Kurt&#39;s lyrics a little too much.</p>

<p>He would write poems as a creative outlet (he also painted as well, but that&#39;s beside my point) and would stitch bits and pieces together to fit to a tune or melody. It&#39;s not that uncommon of a technique, honestly. Tons of artists do this. </p>

<p>If you want any sort of hidden message, he even jokes about it in <em>On A Plain</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>One more special - message to go,</p>

<p>And then I&#39;m done - and I can go home</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, some bits are more coherent than others, and some songs are exceptions. But for the most part, if he needed to fill a verse or chorus or bridge, it was often just lines spliced together.</p>

<p>From an artistic standpoint, that&#39;s where Nirvana&#39;s music really shines. It can mean anything, to anyone, anywhere. That&#39;s the beauty of it. The ambiguity of it all allows the listener/audience to internalize and reflect upon their own meaning to the song. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/A0IhuHucAc4?t=19">Here&#39;s the first clip I could find.</a> Not trying to bust your bubble or anything. Just enjoy Nirvana&#39;s music and be grateful he was able to share it with the world. Not a lot of people get that chance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the same boat as you- in 8th grade I became hooked. Inspired me to play guitar and everything. Then in m yadutl life I found out Kurt has the same &quot;personality&quot; as me (for fun, I&#39;m a geek about pop psychology) &quot;INFJ 5w4.&quot; I was like, &quot;oh, that makes so much sense.&quot; No wonder why I was so obsessed without without knowing why. I can&#39;t hear lyrics, and their lyrics seemed pretty gibberish to me at the time; I was in it for the melodies. When did rock become so melodic? Drain You is amazing! But Kurt always seemed like a sensitive, neurotic flower masquerading as a careless, closed off and jaded rock star. Growing up I heard my uncle explain how PJ +Nirvana were both <em>heavily</em> affected in a negative way about the fame they received, explaining how PJ canceled tours and wrote the song &quot;Limelight&quot; and that definitely seemed evident in Kurt&#39;s behavior as well. He really did seem like he 1. had mental health problems 2. had drug issues which exacerbate mental health problems and 3. fame induced mental health problems. I don&#39;t particularly think it was any agenda, though it&#39;s a fun theory.</p>
