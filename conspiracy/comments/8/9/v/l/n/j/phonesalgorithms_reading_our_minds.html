    <div class="md"><p>That idea is ridiculous...  the power to do so would be far too lucrative to <em>not</em> be more exploited.</p>

<p>What is happening is that you are far more predictable and susceptible to subliminal marketing than you realize or want to admit.  Nothing is <em>reading your mind</em> you are being <em>prompted to think certain things</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt that.  There are tons of marketers on Reddit and elsewhere posting threads to attempt viral marketing and power of suggestion... all it takes if for a tracker to know which of these you read on social media or the internet and what links you clicked to predict with some level of accuracy what you may be thinking about.  I would say it is more “memetic marketing” than any sort of “mind reading.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok it’s hard to figure out something that I haven’t discussed, searched or viewed any related content. But I’ll try.</p>

<p>The last subject I was focusing on was a Misfits baby onesie. While I have been viewing baby clothes I knew it had been 3-4 years since I’d had any discussion or searched any content related to the Misfits or Danzig. Maybe a few times a month I listen to a Misfits song on Pandora or on a Spotify playlist, but I listen to hundreds of songs every month from every different genre and didn’t think it was enough to standout at all.</p>

<p>And I got nothing at all. I made sure to think about every day multiple times and also Misfits memorabilia &amp; imagery but seriously got nothing. </p>

<p>Maybe that’s too fringe of an item?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was another post about this. It&#39;s far fetched that it&#39;s possible to read our thoughts but more so possibly better ai listening to convos picking up on different things - my theory based on my example. Last year I tried to quit vaping by buying nicotine gum but it hurt my teeth so I stopped the gum and started vaping again. The other day was telling my friend I&#39;m quitting vaping, said nothing about gum nor did I search for it. Next day I was thinking I want to try sugar free gum this time. I search &quot;ice packs&quot; on Amazon and on related items was sugar free nicotine gum....how it&#39;s related I have no idea just thought it was super spooky and it felt like Amazon was in my head.</p>

<p>Could be a coincidence. Could be listening to my quitting vaping conversation and somehow knows I want gum in stead. Noooooo idea. I can&#39;t think of any other examples but I know I have has it a few times where somethings popped up and I&#39;ve thought &quot;weird I was thinking about that&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The tv program “Towards 2000” featured software called “agents” over 20 years ago. These programs monitored all user behaviour and mapped patterns. The developers found with enough input their agents were soon dictating what people would decide in advance. (I think it was meal and exercise/timetable related at the time, due to technical limitations, but it could still output what people would decide to do in the following days.) The input side of the software was very simple then, as users had to manually input each decision. Obviously, with current resources these agents could operate autonomously and without user interaction, or knowledge.</p>
