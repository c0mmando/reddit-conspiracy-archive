       Now you're trying to repeat CNN as much as you can to try and poison the well. All sorts of news stations who have nothing to do with CNN, including local outlets, as well as regular people on twitter, all agree it was a car attack. You can't discredit the story with facts so you're just trying to ad hominem it with CNN references. Yall are so transparent. All this little shit like pretending you misheard "wave" as "point" and repeating "4th street" while repeatedly omitting the fact that Justice Park is three full blocks away from the crash site. It's obvious what's going on here and who you're running interference for.

       Considering the videos and pictures show a car going into the people, I do believe it was a "car attack."

       If it was on purpose, which we'll find out what evidence the police have when it comes to trial than it was for a political purpose. Which is the definition of a "terror attack."

       If you were driving, and a bunch of nazis were on the steet and one waved a rifle at you with the intention of scaring you, and then you got in a fatal car accident where you killed someone
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you murderer? Did you commit a car attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you open to the possibility James Fields is not a terrorist, but merely reacted badly in a situation where he panicked and feared for his life and his intention was only to secure his own safety?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree if it was on purpose, but we do not know that. i think its likely he was just panicing and had no evil intent. It sounds like you think its likely he intented to harm people. These are reasonable positions
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is that the establishment, the mainstream media, is backing the antifa narrative that it was definitely a terror attack

       I'm open to the possibility. I just haven't seen any evidence outside of people desperate, like yourself, to cling to the idea that someone on the right didn't do this. Until there's evidence and not just conjecture, I'm not convinced. All the present evidence looks like a malicious attack to me.

       suppresing nationalist political movements. Banks dont want nationalism, they want globablism.

       It true that antifa is aligned with citybank and the establishment. Please tell them.
      </p>

       The establishment hates the unite the right people. They use antifa as useful idiots. Antifa is not a danger or working against the establishment, they are their footsoldiers violently oppressing the political opponents of the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whose side is CNN on? Whose side is the establishment media on? They are on Antifas side. They are both claiming the terror attack narrative.

       Maybe they have the same story (along with Fox News and every other media outlet that was there - why are you so hung up on CNN and ignoring everyone else?) because that's what happened...
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN is center-left/neoliberal/mainstream. Antifa is radical anarchism with some radical communists also sometimes showing up. They do not get along. The fact you brought up who funds antifa shows how little you understand - antifa isn't a real organization, at least not in the tradionial sense. Anyone uses the name. I'm antifa. You're antifa. My cat is antifa.

       Is it what happened though?
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought you and me agreed that its possible it wasnt a premediated terror attack but could have been a guy panicking and fearing for his safety and reacting badly. Both the media and antifa say it was 100% a deliberate attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is CNN bakcing up Antifas narrative? Is it because they are on the same side? I know it upsets antifa to learn they are useful idiots to the establishment, used to violently attack actual political dissent the establishment finds dangerous and unacceptable.

       Also establishment. CNN and fox are both establishment media. They are on opposite sides on many issues, but on the same side of many -- unite the right was a terror attack, Assad is bad, we need to go to war in Iraq, we need to go to war in Iran, Saudi invasion of Yemen is justified, Israel needs 4 billion a year, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW unite the right is firmly anti war. Many members are former liberals who opposed dubyas invasion of Iraq.

       Considering that a lot of people and groups at unite the right want to amp up the war on terror and expand it to muslims in general (and want ethnostates - which are impossible without violence), I'm gonna call bullshit that unite the right was "firmly anti war."

       The alt right things the war on terror are wars for Israel and want no part of it. Richard Spencer was agianst the war in iraq, syria, iran, etc

      <p>
       Do you have ANY evidence the alt right supports any war on muslim countries? Any alt right leaders ever supporting a current past or future war in the middle east? Or any other war? Or even alt right people, not leaders, expressing such desires?

       Richard Spencer calls for an ethnostate, which is impossible without violence. Christopher Cantwell has been calling for war in America. Michael Hill spoke in defense of slavery in 2015. That's just three of the speakers that I briefly googled. These are all violent acts that would lead to war. Trying to paint them as "anti-war" is very disingenuous to their views.

       I truly don't know. Some may be but they also make other statements about violence. I don't really care if there are one or three places they don't want to bomb if they are still advocating for large-scale changes that would cause violence that doesn't make them anti-war. GW Bush never wanted to bomb China but that didn't make him anti-war.

       violence will be upon us whether we choose it or not. Multiculturalism will lead to ethnic conflicts with america. We already see it in europe with muslims and blacks. There are more murders in london than in nyc now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not like the alt right is diverging off a path of flowers and sunshine.

       Do you think multiculuralism hasnt brought violence to europe? Importing a million muslims and blacks is an act of violence agaisnt European people.

       From the ones I encountered last year with that cop that got off for a murder. Ya theyre not the most organized people. Prob a ring leader giving out instructions. But anything that has to do with antifa reminds me of how OPERATION GLADIO started.

       Watch for yourself, the car starts
       <em>
        speeding up
       </em>
       at the beginning of this video, which is a block and a half away from where the gun-waving occurred. The street behind him is nearly empty as you can see around 0:25. It also doesn't help your story that
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       ramming into the crowd he backs up
       <em>
        right toward Justice Park again
       </em>
       toward the gun-waver you think he's so terrified of.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was already a block and a half away from Justice Park, in a nearly empty street, facing down a crowd of people, and he
       <em>
        sped up
       </em>
       , causing people to
       <em>
        run
       </em>
       out of the way. He was trying to kill protesters, I don't know how it could be clearer.

       If a few second before that clip started someone waved a gun at him, as Dwayne Dixon claims to have done on that street(4th street) and then at second 3 on your clip we clearly see someone swinging a baseball bat at his car.... maybe the poor dude just panicked and reacted badly and caused an accident?
      </p>
      <p>
       What proof do you ahve that he intended to kill protestors, rather than he felt in danger and react very badly while trying to get away
      </p>
      <p>
       It all happened very quickly. Why do you think it was intentional murder as opposed to a guy reacting to fear for his safety?

       The baseball bat was swung AFTER he was already going into people. As defense. From an attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the park isn't even viewable in the videos when you get a distance shot. Are you claiming this guy was driving in a blind panic for blocks after seeing one gun at an event that was filled with people carrying guns?

       It all happened really quickly. The car slows down, a guy swings a baseball bat at the car, and the car accelerates again
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm claiming that Dwayne Dixon admits to waving his rifle with the intention to scare James Fields, while James Fields was driving his car, on 4th street.

       So a guy swings a bat at a car about to drive into a crowd? Yeah, that sounds perfectly reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note - in no way am I being sarcastic. At worst he was trying to get the cars attention as it was about to hit people. At best he knew what was going on.

       the car was slowing down a bit before the guy attacks it with a bat. And then accelerates after. Do you agree with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the James Fields made the right decision. Just that his decision making wasn't "i want to kill people", but "omg omg im scared is that guy waving a gun at me...."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what happened is someone waved a gun at him and he panicked and caused a deadly accident, but he wasnt intenting to harm people, only to get away from danger
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not even saying he is completly innocent. There should be a trial. Maybe he is justly guilty of manslaughter.  But I do think he was motivated by fear and panic and things happened quickly, rather than motivated by wanting to harm anyone

       Video prior to him accelerating. If there was no threat directed at him at that moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if there was evidence he was threatened I'd still consider it possible and justified he committed manslaughter. Even if you feel in danger you cant drive into a crowd of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also why was he going around the block several times? If there is no reasonable explanation like 'all the intersections were blocked' maybe he was looking to cause trouble.

       Dwayne Dixon says he waved a gun a James Fields with the intention to scare him.
      </p>

       So if that happened I think James intention was to get away from the guy trying to scare him with a rifle. i think Dwayne succeed with his stated intention.

       Since this seems to be your crusade for the day, I'm curious with a real question - is there any evidence you could see/hear that would convince you that it was an on purpose attack and attempt to harm protesters?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the trial shows evidence beyond reasonable doubt? What if he admits to it and pleads guilty? In your world, what could make you accept that this guy was bad and hurt people?

       No one believes you, even though you're pretending like you're interested in facts and evidence. If you were, you wouldn't start off with insults and logical fallacies.

       What exactly do you think antifa and banks are doing together? Or where they align? It's even a stereotype of antifa smashing bank windows at protests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the establishment is entirely republican right now. What makes you think a radical left anarachist group wants to help republicans?
