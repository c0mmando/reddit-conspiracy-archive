       Why isn't anybody talking about that UFO footage taken by a passenger on a commercial jet. it was black and it was extremely long and was kind of hovering Above the Clouds. It was great footage not nothing grainy or something moving super fast that we can't see anything. I saw it on fox when Tucker was reporting. I was assuming when I searched up UFO on Google it would be everywhere but not a trace of it. Is it that new that nothing's coming up? kind of reminded me of the UFO that was in the movie "arrival"

       It made the rounds a week or two ago as well. I think it's just another in the recent string of "soft disclosures" that started when NYT and WaPo ran articles on UFO's on the same day back in December.

       Very fucking interesting!!  I love how the NY Post describes it possibly being an alien space craft and then completely tries to normalize it by stating they hope they have better customer service than human airlines. WTF?!  Don’t worry sheeple.....nothing to see here.

       Since NYT and WaPo ran those twin articles in December about UFO's and the DoD, it seems that the MSM has been sort of normalizing this stuff. It really does seem like soft disclosure honestly, which is really fucking bad news because to me it shows that Blue Beam is still on track and likely.

       I did see that. I love how every article refers to it as “like the burning Bush in the Bible”. Interesting analogy for them to use. So, normalizing  us further to alien encounters....actual encounters or holograms?  It could serve many purposes....

       That's what I thought at first but the more I watch it the more it doesn't look like a flock of birds it just moves too well and is extremely solid black until the end I could be wrong though

       Right. Grackles. How does this relate to the video in question? Are those trees 30,000ft high? Because that’s how high a plane is at cruising altitude.

       Could be a fighter jet. Showed the video to a budy and he said they look like that at high speeds. The air is moving at twice the speed of sound so its gonna look werid.

       The bird theory sounds cooler though.

       That thing looks like a submarine for the majority of the video. Maybe at the end when it starts becoming more of a vector gradient can it be mistaken for a fighter jet, but not during the rest of it.

       The biggest flock of birds I’ve ever seen was what must’ve been ten million black birds while we were duck hunting. It was like a train the run was so long and so nonstop and so, so loud. One of the coolest things I’ve ever seen in nature. But obviously that was barely just above tree level.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’ll also see huge migratory flicks of geese but they’re definitely not that high when you see them.

        One aircraft flew perpendicular to the path of another crossing behind it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is a simple example:
       </p>
       <p>
        Frame 1
Frame 2
Frame 3
In all of these images, the cylinder is exactly the same size and shape, and pointing in exactly the same direction. The only thing that changes is the camera moves from being slightly above the cylinder, in line with its major axis, to being off to the left hand side of its major axis.
       </p>
       <p>
        The apparent shape of the cylinder changes from being short and pointing straight up, to being long and pointing off to the left.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's exactly what you see in the video, except instead of a cylinder you're seeing a vapour trail (or the shadow of it) from another aircraft.

       Actually there's a famous scifi short story about that from the 50s(?). I forget by who. The aliens have really low tech, but they have stumbled on something very simple (that humans have missed) that allows them to travel interstellarly very fast, so when they arrive they have very simple weapons and not even electricity etc...

       Because you know how UFOs operate, right? Who knows if that is really smoke, it is just the same color....doesn't really behave like smoke, IMO. Like I said in a comment earlier, it looks like the Smoke Monster on Lost.

       So it's not smoke? It's just disguised to look like smoke? Or it is sentient smoke? Come on, guys. I know we are in

       It's obvious... if you are looking for a rational explanation rather than some bullshit "Aliens!" explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       One aircraft flew perpendicular to the path of another crossing behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a simple example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NYncDb6.png">
        Frame 1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/p95QM6M.png">
        Frame 2
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MpPV5zb.png">
        Frame 3
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In all of these images, the cylinder is exactly the same size and shape, and pointing in exactly the same direction. The only thing that changes is the camera moves from being slightly above the cylinder, in line with its major axis, to being off to the left hand side of its major axis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <em>
        apparent
       </em>
       shape of the cylinder changes from being short and pointing straight up, to being long and pointing off to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's exactly what you see in the video, except instead of a cylinder you're seeing a vapour trail (or the shadow of it) from another aircraft.

       I seriously saw the same until I realized I was looking at a black contrail of some mystery plane flying away from the camera. Still weird there is some random plane leaving black contrails in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like this :
      </p>
      <pre><code>                    ^ - Camera moving this way on plane 1.

 Camera Lens |   - - - - - - - - - -&gt; plane 2 moving this way.
                           Black Contrail
</code></pre>
      <p>
       As the plane moves past the contrail is looks like it's raising and falling. It's a weird optical illusion but all this talk about what isn't actually happening on camera takes away from the fact that some weird plane out there is leaving black contrails behind it. What the hell is it powered with?

       Considering they'd be far beyond our technology to travel so far and under our noses to us, who knows what we'd see when we see the first aliens. Agreed. People don't use their imagination enough, even times like this when the situation calls for it.

       Found a video of a plane posted a year ago. It gives you another view of a plane with black contrails. Easily debunks this post.

       Have you ever been driving and seen somthing on the side of the road, either moving away from you or static? Is the object changing direction? Id venture to guess your are turning your head as your keep driving..not the object changing direction.

       It might be a mistake to assume that those are clouds per se: if this is in fact taking place over open water, especially over water in close proximity to land, that could be a ground level fog viewed from above. The fog layer can extend from ground level up to several thousand feet, allowing for the possibility that this is a swarming flock of birds (e.g.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling#/media/File:Starling_murmuration.jpg">
        starlings
       </a>
       ) arising through the top of the fog layer, viewed at a distance from an aircraft on approach or just after takeoff, viewed from the side, and at about the same altitude.

       This was posted and reposted and reposted and reposted.... And the reason it wasn't exciting is because it is fucking stupid for grown assed adults to not know that the shadow side of contrails is dark and that parralax motion causes things to look like they are moving faster in some directions than they are because of your own motion and the differing amounts at which objects at different distances change their angle relative to yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a ufo.  It's a plane.  It's not smoke it is in shadow.  It was never moving strange, it was appearing to move relative to objects in your view.

       <p>
        Another byproduct of an engine swap on the B-52 will be the disappearance of the jet's characteristic long black exhaust trails, which will be a loss for some nostalgic types but a great victory for the environment.

       Pilot here, and that is another airplane. We see this daily. It's great that you pay so much attention to your surroundings and notice details like this, though.
Nevertheless, the object is indeed another airplane that had crossed the path of yours underneath and has consequently been cleared to climb to a higher level. The shape of the contrails is nothing out of the ordinary and indicates a medium sized airliner and the change of shape is due to the high relative velocity. Mind you, you are on a diverging course with the other aircraft and you're flying with an approximate speed of 850 km/h / 530 mph. The lack of other visual references to hold on to makes it hard to identify it as what it is.
Later on in the video the other airplane seems to have been cleared to proceed in the same direction as yours which is why it stopped getting smaller.
Up in the air, airplanes need to maintain specific separations as safety margins to fly the same routes (yes, we actually do have 'highways' in the sky) and that is most likely the reason why the other airplane first crossed your path and then flew parallel to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you cannot make any sense of what you are looking at AT ALL: the dense dark cloud are the contrails (water vapour + exhaust gases) as you look at the other airplane from behind. You're looking at its tail as it flys away from you which is why the contrails look so dense. Then, as you pass the other airplane the contrails stretch out as your perspective changes rapidly (due to your high speed and the close proximity of the other airplane).
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is remarkable though: the contrails are rather dark on this airplane. Normally, they are white for modern airliners and sometimes can appear darker compared to the background when they are in the shadow of other clouds.
This one is very smokey. Probably an older aircraft which have less efficient combustion which leads to black smoke.﻿

       that does NOT look like a plane. I've seen planes before. Not saying alien, but ufo still stands for "unidentified flying object" right?

       Very fucking interesting!!  I love how the NY Post describes it possibly being an alien space craft and then completely tries to normalize it by stating they hope they have better customer service than human airlines. WTF?!  Don’t worry sheeple.....nothing to see here.

       That thing looks like a submarine for the majority of the video. Maybe at the end when it starts becoming more of a vector gradient can it be mistaken for a fighter jet, but not during the rest of it.
