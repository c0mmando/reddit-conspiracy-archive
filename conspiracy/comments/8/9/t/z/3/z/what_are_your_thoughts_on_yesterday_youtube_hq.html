    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  She just has(d) a thick neck for her size - which kind of made her look a bit ambiguous.  However, she used to work out a lot and was really into physical fitness - as there are various pictures of her flexing her arms and, although she had a thinish frame, she had nice guns on her for being thinner - so I can see how that could have given her some &quot;strong, male-like qualities&quot;.</p>

<p>Definitely seemed like she was born a female to me, however.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen no bulge on her.  Do you have any pic that might indicate that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which females don&#39;t at all tend to have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Females actually absolutely <em>do</em> have a bulge.  It&#39;s <a href="http://medicalpicturesinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Pubic-Bone-2.gif">the pubic bone area</a> that covers their genitals.  The bone varies from female to female, but some females can have quite a round and protruding pubic bone - so yeah, females actually <em>do</em> totally tend to have that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll feel pretty &quot;silly&quot;?</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>...Okay.</p>

<p>Well...I&#39;ll wait and see.  Produce whatever picture you think you have when you find it.  Come back and link it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be right here waiting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ban all guns today, there is no way to get all of the ones already in existence. That’s how it’s different than cfcs. 100 years from now there will still be guns available and they will still work. So your saying that eventually the guns will die off Bc new ones won’t be manufactured, but what do you say to the people already be today who don’t want to be defenseless for the rest of their lives?

<p>This is a direct quote by you with a few different words cuz I’m not going back that far. So bringing up prohibition directly responds to this statement.  They got rid of the legal market and it didn’t help at all. And I’m not saying these two two things a exactly alike so saying “it’s different” is not a good response in my eyes. I am perfectly fine with being swayed on this as I am not tied to either stance, im just looking for a good argument other that “it’s different”.  That’s all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, good, we&#39;re back on solid ground.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the primary difference between firearms and drugs and alcohol.  Yes, firearms can be created by home amateurs, but doing so <em>in volume</em> and <em>at speed</em> requires a level of logistics and capital investment that is difficult to do at any level approaching major manufacturers.  Drugs and alcohol are different.  You can make alcohol in a bathtub with potato skins.  You can make cocaine with a poppy field and a wooden shack.  Mass producing firearms to factory tolerances isn&#39;t nearly as widely accessible as creating drugs and alcohol.</p>

<p>Second, Prohibition &quot;failed&quot; in the sense that it did not completely eliminate alcohol, but it <em>succeeded</em> in the sense that it drastically reduced alcohol consumption while in effect.  It&#39;s hard to measure use during prohibition, but there is better data on legal consumption; when prohibition ended and legal sales resumed, American&#39;s average alcohol consumption <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470475/">was less than half that when Prohibition began</a>.  Moreover alcohol related health issues and crimes (such as public intoxication) fell by commensurate amounts.  Yes, a determined person could still find alcohol during the ban, but it was harder to do and people consequently used much less.</p>

<p>So, yes, if you managed to choke off the most common source of illegal guns -- straw purchases from legal gun dealers -- by placing tighter regulations on legal sales, reduce thefts and borrowing by mandating safe storage and holding people liable for harm caused by loaned weapons, and reduced or restricted private sales, you&#39;d probably see an uptick in home manufacture and cross-border trafficking to make up the demand for illegal guns. But these alternate sources almost certainly would be unable to <em>completely</em> make up the shortfall created by closing the easiest channels.  Some criminals, perhaps many criminals, would still be able to source weapons, but the number capable of doing so would be reduced.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly those are all good points. The only difference tho is that drugs and alcohol in numbers was down but it was still in the millions when in number of people consuming it.  The amount of people using guns to murder is way less. It only takes one determined person with enough connections to acquire an adequate enough firearm to kill potentially tens of people at a time. </p>

<p>It is also different in that people that use drugs and alcohol don’t generally go out seeking to kill other people. Most drunk driving accidents are just that, accidents. Everyone knows that if you never leave your house then you have a smaller chance of being killed by a gun or by a drunk driver.  Hell even if you have a gun you still have a chance of being killed by another gun.  I just think it’s hard as a government to tell it’s people that they may encounter a situation in which they will have to defend themselves against a gun and we are taking away your best chance in doing so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;d say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The amount of people using guns to murder is way less. It only takes one determined person with enough connections to acquire an adequate enough firearm to kill potentially tens of people at a time. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as mass shootings focus attention, that&#39;s not really what I&#39;m thinking about because it&#39;s such a tiny percentage of gun deaths.  Plus more than half of those kind of shooters legally bought their own weapons after a lifetime of staying mostly within the law.  That&#39;s hard to guard against, and would require pretty draconian rules to stamp out.  I&#39;m thinking of cheap hand guns.  That&#39;s what&#39;s used in almost al gun violence, and most gun suicides.  Sure, a determined person might still be able to get one, but that doesn&#39;t mean you reduce the overall number.  Maybe if you add a couple forms to fill out, a depressive guy doesn&#39;t get a gun and have it nearby when he has suicidal thoughts. Or it gets harder for some mid-level hustler to throw some cash at his girlfriend to drive to Indiana to buy a few pistols to sell to street-level petty gang members.  But some of this would involve registries and electronic record-keeping that freaks people out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is also different in that people that use drugs and alcohol don’t generally go out seeking to kill other people. Most drunk driving accidents are just that, accidents. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read some some stat once saying that the biggest cause of gun violence was &quot;personal disagreements.&quot;  In other words, Vegas and Sandy Hook and such involve some motivated person planning to rain down death, but most gun violence isn&#39;t like that.  Most gun violence is more mundane.  A spontaneous escalation of tit-for-tat attacks between rival gangs.  A guy gets mad at his ex-wife.  Someone cuts someone off in traffic.  Some half-drunk idiots start talking shit to each other.  In other words, most gun violence arises from some confrontation that could either end up with broken bones or a coffin, depending on the weapons within reach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just think it’s hard as a government to tell it’s people that they may encounter a situation in which they will have to defend themselves against a gun, and we are taking away your best chance to do so. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the thing I&#39;m trying to say, though.  The restrictions that make it harder for legal purchasers to buy <em>also</em> make it harder for criminal purchasers to buy.  So, the easier it is for <em>you</em> to obtain a weapon to defend yourself, the easier it is for <em>everyone else</em> to obtain the weapons you might need to defend yourself against.  Plus, if you&#39;re an average person, the odds that you&#39;ll ever need to use a gun for self defense are lower than the odds you or someone in your family commits suicide or has an accident with that weapon. So the expected value to your safety is usually negative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to look at the way we treat vehicles as a model.  We require people to be licensed before taking them out in public, including after a safety test; we have a year-long probationary period before allowing that license; the legal owner of every vehicle is registered and kept in a database; you have an affirmative duty to tell the DMV if your vehicle is stolen or transferred; you have to carry insurance on it; you might be held liable for anything anyone else does with your vehicle.  Some of these things already exist but aren&#39;t routinely enforced, and I also think there should be some requirements to store a gun safely.</p>

<p>There is some balance that needs to be struck here between the Second Amendment and reasonable regulations, and I also don&#39;t want to lock out lower-income people, so I&#39;m not sure exactly where those lines are.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t come across anything like that either, but A) I read some people mention it yesterday, like I said, and B) although she very clearly was <em>very</em> unstable, her actions were so extreme that the simple demonitizing of some youtube videos doesn&#39;t seem to be enough of a motivation to go there intending to kill some people and then kill yourself.</p>

<p>Again, yeah - she was absolutely VERY unstable, but what she did still seems extreme for the level of crazy that even she was.</p>

<p>Why is everyone afraid to say that?  It doesn&#39;t mean I support her actions but when you&#39;ve made a career of something and someone takes it away and there isn&#39;t even a representative you can talk to it&#39;s frustrating.</p>

<p>How many YouTube rant videos have been on top of <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a>?  A shit ton, and 99.99% of people won&#39;t shoot anyone over it.  It&#39;s that 0.01% of people you gotta be prepared for.  It only takes 1.</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s an interesting shooting.  The media is generally all over any boring story about FANG companies because everyone is familiar with these companies and will click to read stories about that.  A pissed off female shooter coming in to shoot up the place?  That&#39;s juicy.  Personally, I want to know all the details and watch a made-for-television mini-series about it.</p>
