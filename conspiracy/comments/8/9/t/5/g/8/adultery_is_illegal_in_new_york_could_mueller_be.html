        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems like all of the Stormy Daniels posts have been scrubbed or buried from the sub, and I noticed that adultery is illegal in New York. Could Stormy Daniels be working with Mueller to bait Trump into a perjury charge similar to what happened with Bill Clinton?</p>

<p>This would explain some of the distraction stories which have been running lately and the sudden disappearance of Stormy Daniels stories. It could also be one of the strategies Mueller is planning to execute to get Trump on a perjury charge, or maybe even on an adultery charge since it is illegal in the state of New York.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, its nobody&#39;s GD business.  If they figured out a way to move past this (as many couples do) then leave them the fuck alone about it.  It happened before he was a political figure, it happened before he took an oath as president.  Trump has his flaws, and we could discuss this all day long but Jesus Christ the constant attacks on every little thing he has done in the past is ridiculous.  Maybe he should have just sealed every aspect of his life like BO did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He used company and campaign resources to pay a woman $130,000 for her silence a week before the election.  Regardless of what you think of the affair itself, it&#39;s important to know how our president goes around covering up embarrassing information, as well as understand what other information is out there that the president is trying to keep quiet and that nefarious people might try to use as leverage to influence US policy.</p>

<p>There are two documents in which she signed stating she did NOT sleep with Trump.
