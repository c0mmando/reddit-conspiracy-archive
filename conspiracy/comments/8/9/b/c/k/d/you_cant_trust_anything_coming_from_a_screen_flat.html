       Not that I subscribe to the idea, but in one theory there is no such thing as gravity. The force pulling us downwards is precisely what you just described (moving upwards and being pushed back down towards the ground)

       It would take more work to convince yourself the earth is flat especially in the face of the past 100 years of tech and science advances. The ‘evidence’ your looking for is on the side of the flat earthers argument to show a pic of the edge of the earth or the giant ice wall they claim is there. The evidence on the side of popular science, satellites, rockets,  planes etc are clear evidence enough that earth is not flat since it takes incredible math and calculation for these things to exist

       Most of the evidence for a globe earth is purely circumstantial.
There is room for it to be incorrect.
All of science is built upon assumptions.

       Assumptions and science definitely do not go together. It’s important to realize science is not a noun but a verb.. it is something you do, not a fixated concept. That being said I implore you to read Demon Haunted World by Carl Sagan. He outlines the possibility that it is the failure of critical thinking that allows pseudoscience or divinity to take the place of science. When I look at flat earth theory it is a flimsy premise; for example, they don’t believe in gravity which again would be more work to prove scientifically unless you assign a divine or like you said, assumed role. I tried giving flat earth a chance because I love conspiracy theory. But the nail in the coffin for me was to find the end goal of the theory socially, politically which was ultimately creationist theory. That’s why at the end of those flat earth videos they have biblical scriptures.. I find it unnecessary to involve creationism to the theory but apparently that’s the glue that allows it to side step a lot of practical, proven sciences. Like gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it’s Far more likely that this theory like the Mandela effect theory, is merely a symptom of media garbage set on by the modern world. It undermines the intelligence of young minds by trying to scramble and rewire curiosity into skepticism by using pop culture and internet culture against itself. It is dangerous bc you end up shouting at others through a gilded cage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this: does the Shape
Of the earth determine its fate? To me the same problems exist for humans whether on a sphere or cube. If you find out people think you’re okay looking instead of super hot and attractive does this change what YOU do? No. If you realize you were adopted instead of birthed would that rewrite your achievements or failures? No.. it doesn’t seem reality weighs solely on what we perceive but what we do with what we allow ourselves perceive

       That’s just not true. Every scientific theory has assumptions built in. The less assumptions the more chance of being accurate.
Over the course of history many things were certain, until someone came along and showed otherwise.
If you were to fast forward 100 years it’s entirely possible that we were wrong about a lot of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example look at the assumptions that must be made in order to determine how far away the stars are from us and what elements they contain.
There is so much room for other possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, I do have a lot of problems with FE. Most of the info online is so obviously false. But I do know some very smart friends who believe in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested I suggest you look into the curvature of the earth and why we can’t actually observe it.

       The stick in the ground experiment by the greeks is evidence for either a round earth or a FE with a close sun.
Ships going over the horizon has nothing to do with curvature. It is a visual effect. Zooming in on them with a more powerful telescope brings them back into view.

       I think you're merely stating that any theory is an assumption. Which is a logically like saying any choice is an opinion. You see there isn't much meaning in that argument. Also if any theory is based on what you're defining as "accurate" it would be in the sciences and math. Again, shooting rockets let alone designing rockets involve an incredible amount of calculated effort on the part of many people to pull off. This would be determined by variable forces as well like the atmosphere and weather.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think when you say a theory is an assumption it can work in other fields that are creative. Like philosophy, music or the arts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far looking into it, as I've said I looked plenty into it. But these are my thoughts. I think you could rid yourself of these dilemmas by simply studying more on perception itself and less on the perception of the material world. Why bother with a conspiracy as generalized as FE when you can explore other exciting fields of thought like ontology or epistemology. I promise you those will keep you plenty busy with questions on perception

       No you are missing my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not being semantic about the word theory - like how creationists are about the
       <em>
        Theory
       </em>
       of evolution: “it’s only a theory”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m saying that theories are based on certain assumptions, and sometimes those assumptions are shown to be false and we are back to the drawing board.
Newtonian physics vs special relativity for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to question the theory we must first find out which assumptions it makes and question them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if we found out the actually the speed of light is not a constant, then that would cripple special relativity.

       Everyone gets that. We make models to explain the phenomena we see.

      <p>
       Even if you dont believe a single shred of evidence from NASA (Or the dozens of private space companies...) the current globe model is the best most concise model.

       I don’t actually have an answer for that. The movement of the sun and the time zones are the strongest point.

      <p>
       Remember I’m not a FE.
BUT I do hate how people will argue weak points without thinking. There is no critical thinking involved. People just parrot what they are taught without stopping to think.
If people were critical then I think we would have much more definitive proofs for things.

       Typical FE thinking. You will refute any and all arguments simply by stating that evidence can be faked, that millions of people are all 'in on it' etc., all without showing so much as a single testable idea supporting the FE argument.

       Of course it is proof. Especially taken in to the context of all the 1000s of such videos that exist. So in fact, you are the one with the lack of critical thinking. It's not Critical Thinking to simply deny everything, you must also know when to accept proofs.

       Video evidence can be faked. You can’t take it as definitive proof. What’s hard to understand about that?
That’s not scientific.

       One video is proof, but whether you think it is
       <em>
        enough
       </em>
       proof or not is subjective. In any case 1000 such videos is enough for most people.
Think about what they do in court cases, they have to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. This is similar.

       But you did suggest that any video evidence has a high chance of being CG. Which, you are not wrong, but with something like a rocket launch, that is seen by thousands of people with their own eyes, you can't fake that.

       You know a plane flies in the air but don't know why, so it's a silly post in general. When your views align with an objective truth you don't need to know why.

       Actually I do know why. But even the general public can see planes. Most have been on a plane. Everyone they know has been on a plane and seen them.

       It’s not comparable.
The only real evidence that makes people think the earth is round is pictures and videos (which can all be faked).
So it’s really not the same level of belief.
No one knows anyone who has seen that the earth is round.

       There is mountains of evidence to prove the earth is round, like the coriolis effect, sunsets, timezones, stars etc etc etc, not just pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       The heliocentric / globe earth model explains perfectly what we can observe, the flat earth model fails to account for very basic things.
       <br/>
       You don't need a government agency to tell you the earth isn't flat.

       They're told the earth is a ball, they think about it, and they agree, because what we observe matches up with the fact that the earth is a ball.

       I don’t think there is much that we observe that could tell us the shape of the earth.
If you told everyone from birth that it was flat then anyone coming along saying it was a sphere would face the same ignorance as FEs today experience.
I’m not saying it’s flat. Just that people mostly parrot what they are taught without question.

       There's the pole stars, shipa going over a horizon, 2 different constellations in different hemispheres, 24hr sunlight in certain parts of the world, even sunsets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theyre all observations that prove the earth is a globe,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       2 different constellations of stars and 2 pole stars. Flat earthers have tried to make that work for years on their flat earth model, bit can't. It's only possible on a globe.

There are other theories like ‘density’.

       Fair point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not too versed in it so feel free to follow up with your own study.
But basically objects will fall or rise to their density level. 
I’m sure you’ve seen the density experiments with water, sugar, mercury etc. Materials with greater density than water will sink, lower density will float.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FE idea is basically the same except their ‘density’ is what governs everything, not gravity (which they say doesn’t exist)

       Well that may work to some degree in earth but what of the astronomical data on asteroids and being effected by coming close to other objects.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have used the sun's gravity to send proves into deep space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only argument I have heard from FE on this is denial. Space is fake and all space agencies are liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a stretch. Most of these agencies work gets ripped apart by third parties who are itching to find mistakes the "big boys" miss.

       Learning history is one way of finding the truth. Housands of men have measured this world by hand over the last five hundred or so years.

       In grade 11 algebra we learned to use spherical algebra to corroborate the data. If it was flat simple Euclidean geometry would have sufficed. Pythagoraus' theorum doesn't not work for distant places on earth.

       The tech just has to be calibrated to work. They follow the equipment.
The pilots aren’t auditing the information that is given, they are just acting on it.

       Have you seen Wag the Dog? Its not a great film, from memory, but it was interesting. The USA create a fictional war for some reason, probably approval ratings, I think it was against Arstotzka or somewhere like that

       I haven’t. I heard a lot about it recently. Who Built the Moon is a fun read as well but part of me feels like it’s a bit of a limited hangout. I grew up enthralled with outer space. The Drake equation made me certain there were aliens. I was convinced there is a base on the back of the moon. Now, stepping back, I really have to consider the hoax goes much further than I have considered. So much is CGI, excuses, profit, etc and the hugeeeee amount of shilling for this government agency on a conspiracy forum really makes me pause. The one government entity so closely tied with Hollywood is the one this sub since “nah, they are straight shooters”- it’s just off. The nature of our world is being intentionally hidden from us. So we got to ask, why the lie?

       Hey Fitz, I too got a chuckle out of the car in space.  "It looks fake cause it's so real".  Obviously I am aware of your part in these threads.  I respect your opinion but find you to be very naive to trust a government agency, especially NASA.  Have you thrown out a Gish Gallop at anyone recently? "Argggh, too many links to debate!!!"

       Fly on a plane, I traveled from Aus to the us and saw the curvature on my travels. If that's too expensive to prove it then don't bother questioning because flying is the easiest way to physically see it. Another would be watching a ship from the beach. It rises up from the distance. Like watching an ant on an orange. If it climbs up we see it eventually. But if it's flat we would always see the ant. We don't always see the ship

       You definitely didn’t see any curvature. It’s not visible from planes...
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason ships appear to go over the curve is because of the horizon and perspective. Watch

       Is it because when they do it disproves their assumption?

       <li>
        <p>
         Lunar eclipse only proves that the earth casts a round shadow, not that it is spherical. A penny would cast the same shadow as a marble.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As I said in another comment, it isn’t proof of a globe earth. The Sun could be closer to the earth so that the angle of its rays is greater.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sunset isn’t a proof of anything. It is an effect of the horizon and perspective, not curvature.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This is one of the stronger points imo. I haven’t found a good FE rebuttal to this.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As far as I know the Coriolis effect isn’t proven. There are scientific videos myth busting it.
Either way it isn’t really proof. Just another piece of the puzzle.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yep
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Not really an argument.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       When you start looking into proofs for the globe earth, you start to see that there really aren’t any strong ones that you can actually determine yourself. It’s mostly down to authority.
The curvature test is one of the ones you can do yourself and from my research no one has been able to demonstrate a visible curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I’m not a FE, but I also do not want to believe things just because everyone else does. That is a mental illness. We need more people with greater critical thinking skills.

       I’ve just spent some time reading up this because it’s been a while.
So from what I can tell the only examples of the Coriolis effect are on large weather patterns, like cyclones.
I was wrong. They have a tendency depending on which hemisphere they are in.
But it is FALSE that the Coriolis effect works on small scales, like toilet flushes.

       The problem is that almost everything that is listed as proof, isn’t proof.
It is merely evidence that points to a certain conclusion.
But everyone blindly

       the earth is a globe, without knowing why.
That’s the big problem I have.

       This may come as an eye-opener to you, but in science (with the exception of math), there is no proof. (which is why I wrote 'proof'  earlier)
       <br/>
       There is only evidence.
       <br/>
       All science is merely the current best model; Science is impermanent. It is, by definition, in constant flux.
You can never have 100% proof of anything; There will always be doubt.

      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no.. not everyone believes blindly that the earth is a globe. There is just tons of
       <em>
        evidence
       </em>
       supporting that notion. Globe earth is the current best model because it works - in all the scientific fields I described earlier.

      </p>
      <p>
       If the earth is flat, it would be impossible for the sun to light clouds from below. Yet I see it on a regular basis with my own eyes.

       Most of the debunks I see require some argument for authority, or they straw-man the position. I’m left with no answers and more questions.
If you’re going to debunk something it should be solid.
Link me a debunk and I’ll have a look. I’m open to new ideas. I don’t really care about the shape of the earth. More just about thinking critically.

      <p>
       I haven’t looked in that. I’m not copping out. I just don’t know every aspect of the FE theory. What you’re saying does make sense though.

       Discussion is argument. People today feel an argument is yelling at each other. Well it ain't.

       If there are 1000s of such videos taken by different people at different times for different reasons, all showing the same thing. Then I can only conclude one thing. Should one of those videos be fake, it doesn't matter, because there are so many others and it wouldn't make much sense to say ALL space videos are fake.

       So you are proposing that ALL videos that can be found online AND ALL videos that have been shown on TV since the Moon landings (and probably before if any) AND ANY and ALL videos available to researchers and scientists and engineers in universities around the globe etc etc. have ALL been faked?

       You are not allowed to discuss this subject without the same characters brigading the thread.  They are already in here doing damage control and "debunking" like they always do.  It would literally be insane if they spent this much time combating a "fringe conspiracy" every single time someone mentioned NASA not being legit.

       I've researched the subject for over 3 years and can not find any actual evidence of a spinning ball Earth.  Once you research the subject and try to prove the ball earth to yourself you will realize how much faith is involved to have that belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have faith in NASA images and research the subject no further.  Others will tell you the big "proof" is the 2000 year old Earstothenes experiment where he had to ASSUME that the Sun was millions of miles away with the light rays all hitting the Earth at the same angle in order to "prove" a ball Earth.  The Sun has been shown and measured to be much closer and smaller.  It is not 95 million miles away and once you realize that it becomes obvious it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water will always finds it's level (i.e. a cup, bath, pool, pond, lake, ocean etc.)  So how can the Earth be over 70% flat, level water??  You have to have more faith in the mysterious force (that attempts to fix all of the heliocentric holes) "gravity" to believe that water is actually stuck to a ball.  There is no model or experiment that can show this is true, you must have more faith that it is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science should be observable, measurable, and repeatable.  I have found no observable, measurable evidence for curvature or motion of the Earth in 3-4 years of researching.

       Exactly.  Most modern "science" is not repeatable.  For example, take the 1919 experiment that was supposed to prove the General Theory of Relativity (i.e. watching starlight bend around the sun's gravity).  This shit does not happen and this experiment has not been repeated.  Furthermore, for the General Theory of Relativity to be true there should be trans-dimensional weather.  This shit does not happen either, and the LIGO experiment is complete bullshit.  So, as a working field theory, the General Theory of Relativity is a failure.  They try to shore up their funny math by creating black holes and other strange anomalies like anti-mater rather than admit that the current model is a failure.  So many people have stood on the shoulders of idiots that it is difficult to tell where the idiots start and end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone has pointed to a very simple experiment that can be performed using basic materials.  This is one of many experiments that have concluded there is not curvature to earth.  You will need two boats on a flat body of water traveling in opposite directions with a taunt rope between them; if the rope gets wet at a certain distance that indicates curvature.  I believe this experiment has been done and was conclusive, but you can perform it yourself.  None of the experiments that have been performed are conclusive of a spinning, curved sphere in space.

       Absolutely.  If you look into the logistics of the experiment it is a complete joke and would be impossible to differentiate "gravity waves" from other outside variables.  99% of people just see a headline on whatever "science" website and believe it must be true without even questioning the validity of the claim for themselves.

       Exactly.  In science if experiments fail you should throw that idea out.  But when experiments fail for the heliocentric model they just create theoretical magical fix it terms like "Dark Matter" in which they even admit they have no idea what it is.  So they have to manufacture terms to explain why over 85+ % of the theory does not work.

       Always good to hear others that can think for themselves instead of just assuming the status quo must be correct.

       Go ahead and try it... I guarantee the rope will get wet... but not because the earth is a sphere - it would be because there is no rope in existence in which you could have it be miles long, unsupported and perfectly straight... it's own weight will bend it down to the surface, or snap it.

        The fact that I have called you out on your brigading at least a year or two ago should tell you I'm not lying. It is very telling that you still brigade this topic every single day. You would think this "fringe conspiracy" would have just died out by now. I guess you aren't doing a good enough job brigading and debunking. You should call up Mick West and get some pointers from his personal handbook.

       Because I've gone back and forth with you many times in the past.  When I realized a long time ago that you were a brigader that goes into every FE thread to "debunk" and do damage control I told you I wasn't going to to it anymore.  It would be insane to re answer you every single time you copy and past your "debunking" into these threads.

       I used to be a flat earther until I did my own research
      </p>
      <p>
       I was one of those idiots that was gullible enough to buy into the YouTube videos without using my brain. Did you know the so called Antarctica Treaty is a lie? There's no proof of the so called magical military patrol that stops you from going to the south pole, yet every flat earther assumes it's true because a YouTube video told them so. Did you know the "Law of Perspective" is a lie, and the only mention of it you can find is flat earthers talking about their so called "Law"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Law of Perspective" was fabricated by flat Earthers to explain (poorly) why things disappear over the curved horizon.
       <br/>
       And flat earthers assume it's true because...a youtube video told them.
       <br/>
       Flat earthers constantly fabricate and make up their own laws when it's convenient to try and make their flat earth "model" work.

       When there are the same people that do nothing but flood every FE thread with the same copy and paste bs every single day for years, no I'm not going to continue to engage with them.  They have proven not to be organic users and have obvious agendas.  Nobody would spend everyday for years "debunking" a "crazy fringe conspiracy".

       Why is debunk in quotes? That evidence is what made me realize the earth can't be flat.

      <p>
       Can you debunk it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't seen you explain it yet. I don't think I've ever seen anyone explain it, despite you insisting that they post (and are refuted) constantly.
       <br/>
       If it was explained they wouldn't keep posting it...for example, how often do people bring up NASA pictures anymore? I don't see anyone being that up anymore, because they're composites.

       Many of their "genuine questions" have been answered literally years ago.  They link to the same ridicules Mick West (known mega shill) metabunk links.  No answers or evidence will ever suffice and they will continue to obsess over derailing genuine conversation and discussion daily.

       Of course they do.  They don't care about the people that are well researched and know their lame debunking cut and paste questions have been answered many times over.  They just want the people that have never seen them cut and paste the same questions that don't know any better.  Are you pretending you don't know how the "brigading" system works?

       His character is irrelevant. You can see in the images that you can observe the curvature. And those images aren't even taken by Mick West.

       For example, the 2 rotational axis, and 2 pole stars. A flat earth would only have one. It's ONLY possible for what we observe to happen on a globe.

       Isn't that how FE works? FE works on being ignorant of science and the typical soundbite nonsense, like a plane having to "tip it's nose down" to account for curvature. If you don't know how flight works it sounds reasonable.
       <br/>
       Honestly until I did my own research I was really gullible, as was every other flat earther.
       <br/>
       Did you know the "Law of Perspective" doesn't actually exist? Do a Google search for it and all you'll find are other flat earthers referencing it, but it's been fabricated. I, and every other FE'r just accepted the "Law of Perspective" was a thing when I seen it mentioned in a YouTube video without questioning it. Thats a faith based belief system.

       I don't think you realize how small the earth would be if that was really curvature you are seeing in that picture.  The metabunk picture is distorted as there are many other pictures of the bridge that are completely strait for a much longer distance.  That is why you shouldn't just take one picture from a website without finding other sources of the same bridge.

       Also the Toronto one with the CN Tower is taken from 50 miles away, that's definitely enough for a visible curvature.

       The Eric Dubay one is a good example. Did you know the "engineers don't have to account for curvature" is a blatant made up lie? There is an equation that is used to account for the curvature of the earth, and it's used in suspension bridges (as for longer ones both sides will be slightly bowed out)

       Seems to me that he may be projecting. He's also spent a massive amount of time in this "fringe conspiracy" in multiple subreddits whether it'd be r/conspiracy, r/AskReddit, r/explainlikeimfive, r/weed, r/C_S_T, r/showerthoughts, and the list goes on.

       Oh well, if he claims that Eratosthenes can't be used in a way to debunk the flat earth then he hasn't spent a lot of time researching. That, or he doesn't want to acknowledge the argument made.

       It had everything to do with what you’re doing. You’re trolling this thread by offering no specific substantial scientific arguments yet you’re assuring everybody here there are inconsistencies in modern science.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you’re taking the video feed too seriously. Obviously there are different ways of capturing and distributing information. Differences from binoculars to photographs or software, cameras etc. do you think every space organization uses the same method and tech? It would be logistically improbable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you’re a scientist and can bring a direct argument for FE, it’s already been proven wrong by evidence of ENTIRE branches of modern engineering and rocketry for example

       That isn’t science. The correct thing would be to leave it ‘on the shelf’ as a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why every time we have a new paradigm shift in science, all the dopey old guys cling to their old theory. They can’t accept that something else might be true.
Same thing with the Atheists being 100% certain God doesn’t exist. So silly.
There could easily be a God. It’s not impossible.
I think most scientists are actually very closed minded.

       There isn't any proof whatsoever of the so called mythical "Antarctica / UN guard" that magically track everyone going to the north pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the Antarctica Treaty says is no nation can claim Antarctica as their territory. It says nothing about a magic military patrol making it illegal to go there.

       You've been lied to, and I don't mean by MASA or da gubbament, I mean you've been lied to by flat earthers. Did you also know that the so called "Law of Perspective" they constantly being up doesn't even exist? If you search for it, all you'll find are flat Earthers talking about this magical "law" that makes things go over the horizon.
       <br/>
       It was made up to try and explain the flat earth, rather than the other way around. Flat earthers fabricate whatever nonsense they want to try and explain their magic space pizza.

       Correct me if I’m wrong, but you aren’t allowed to go to all parts of Antarctica without permission.
You must be accompanied.
You are allowed to go to certain places, but if you wanted to start at one side, then travel all the way to the other (passing the south pole) you would not be allowed to.

       No problem. I just want to mention though that this isn't CG or digitally altered. It's just a long exposure shot. As you can imagine, the dark side of Earth can get pretty dark. It's beneficial to take images like these to see what's going on on the surface... plus they look cool as shit.

But then he recommends Eric Dubay. So many things incorrect with what that guy says.

       Being an athlete does not make one wise. Just ook at how he talks ffs. He is off the rails and can't formulate a decent argument. Coupled with the fact that flat earth is a joke. It is meant to make people think at best. Unfortunately some get wrapped up in it and can't fathom reality.

       There is centuries of data and math showing the shape of our world. Flat earth has to deny things that are proven facts to defend its stance

       There is also Jeranism. This guy is sub par intelligent but tries so hard. He was on a YouTube debate with reds rhetoric. It is embarrassing for him.

       Every planet and moon we can see (almost) is spherical. Stands to reason, even without having measured our world by hand, that ours is too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no model for gravity in a flat earth that stands up to peer review. There are no orbital predictions that I have seen. There are so many flaws in this garbage it can just be dismissed.

       No you are missing my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not being semantic about the word theory - like how creationists are about the
       <em>
        Theory
       </em>
       of evolution: “it’s only a theory”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m saying that theories are based on certain assumptions, and sometimes those assumptions are shown to be false and we are back to the drawing board.
Newtonian physics vs special relativity for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to question the theory we must first find out which assumptions it makes and question them.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if we found out the actually the speed of light is not a constant, then that would cripple special relativity.

       Absolutely.  If you look into the logistics of the experiment it is a complete joke and would be impossible to differentiate "gravity waves" from other outside variables.  99% of people just see a headline on whatever "science" website and believe it must be true without even questioning the validity of the claim for themselves.

      <p>
       Exactly.  In science if experiments fail you should throw that idea out.  But when experiments fail for the heliocentric model they just create theoretical magical fix it terms like "Dark Matter" in which they even admit they have no idea what it is.  So they have to manufacture terms to explain why over 85+ % of the theory does not work.

      <p>
       Go ahead and try it... I guarantee the rope will get wet... but not because the earth is a sphere - it would be because there is no rope in existence in which you could have it be miles long, unsupported and perfectly straight... it's own weight will bend it down to the surface, or snap it.

       Eddie Bravo is a true master of jiujutsu so I respect his intelligence a lot.
But then he recommends Eric Dubay. So many things incorrect with what that guy says.

       Either way I heard about FE as a joke a while ago. I started looking into it last year when a very smart friend of mine brought it up. It’s a huge topic and very thought provoking.

       I think most people are aware of those things, everyone knows about the pole stars.

       They're told the earth is a ball, they think about it, and they agree, because what we observe matches up with the fact that the earth is a ball.

       I don’t think there is much that we observe that could tell us the shape of the earth.
If you told everyone from birth that it was flat then anyone coming along saying it was a sphere would face the same ignorance as FEs today experience.
I’m not saying it’s flat. Just that people mostly parrot what they are taught without question.
