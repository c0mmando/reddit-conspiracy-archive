       Last week I had another herxheimer reaction. My neck and shoulder muscles locked up, I got a pulsating headache behind my right eye that was so painful I couldn’t think, began to sweat profusely, my energy drained, and was incapacitated for nearly 3 days. For those who don’t know what a herxheimer reaction is, it is a die-off reaction whenever you kill Lyme disease, or another co-infection such as bacteria or yeast. When I get these reactions the only thing I can do is try and boost my bodies ability to detox, sweat it out, and sleep them off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been getting these reactions for nearly 3-years now, and only in the past year have I figured out that I have Lyme disease, and I can’t keep living like this anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the past 27-years I have been suffering from daily chronic pain, brain fog, joint pain, severe  TMJ issues, chronic headaches, fatigue, alternating digestive issues, food intolerances, allergies, IBS, SIBO (small bacterial overgrowth), candida, rashes, depression, anxiety, profuse sweating, muscle weakness, bladder infections, kidney stones, prostate issues, and a host of other health problems. Since I’ve been trying to treat these conditions since I was 4-years old I’ve had life altering surgery where they removed part of my nervous system, tens of thousands of dollars worth of tests, colonoscopies, biosopies, and I’ve been experimented on by at least a dozen doctors with dozens of pharmaceutical drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       About 4-years ago I gave up on Western medicine, got off all the drugs, and started exploring Eastern medicine including herbs and acupuncture. I also cleaned up my diet, and started practicing yoga and mediation. Finally, I started making some progress, but eventually I could no longer afford acupuncture, and had to rely mostly on herbs and my own research. As I mentioned, I started getting herxheimer reactions about 3-years ago when I first started Chinese herbs, not even knowing what I was trying to kill initially, but knowing I had some kind of infection. My blood tests for 4-years consistently showed decreasing neutrophils, and increasing lymphocytes which my western doctors completely ignored despite this being a classic indicator of a compromised immune system.
      </p>
      <p>
       After years of diet modification, and herbal treatments I was finally able to overcome my SIBO, and candida by treating for Lyme disease. I finally realized my immune system was compromised by Lyme disease, and that the SIBO and candida were merely co-infections. Once I targeted for Lyme my digestive system recovered, and my rashes went away. However, my herxheimer reactions got worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       My herx reactions are now fewer and father between but as I said I relapsed just last week. After a year of targeted anti-spirochete herbs I still have Lyme and I fear my girlfriend and I are just passing it back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know what to do anymore, I’ve spent all my money trying to cure myself. I’ve studied the conspiracies and I’m not sure what to make of this situation. All I know is when I take something that kills Lyme I get a herx reaction and if I keep taking it I eventually start to recover slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m thinking about trying to do a GoFundMe to try getting stem cells to repair my damaged immune and nervous system and joints but I’m afraid to tell people what’s going on.

       SS: pretty sure I have Lyme disease. Way too many scammy cures, whack doctors, an unforgiving medical system and not many answers or solutions. Trying to figure out how to over come this disease so I can move on with my life?

       I don't know that you can recover. I was diagnosed about 11 years ago. Since then my life has been an autoimmune hell. Ulcerative colitis being at the top of the list. Seems its recently been linked to Lyme. Doctors never want to acknowledge Lyme or link it to anything in my limited experience. I think all of us begin to doubt our sanity as we reach our breaking point with this disease. Personally, my wife and kids keep me going during those times. We all need something good to die for to make it beautiful to live.

       This is unsolicited, but I have Crohn's disease and
       <a href="https://www.naet.com//">
        this treatment
       </a>
       saved me. I've been off all medication for about 2 years. My case was very severe.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't sell anything on the site, but the site helps you locate a practitioner near you. It's a form of acupuncture. I wouldn't suggest it if I didn't personally try it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, it's harmless, so if it doesn't work, you're only out a copay or two. I can eat ice cream with no side effects after a decade of having to avoid it, or suffer the consequences (typically intestinal bleeds).
      </p>
      <p>
       Feel free to ignore this, but I feel a moral obligation to tell people about this given how much it helped and how long I suffered before it.

       Already doing that, keep going down with herx reactions. My diet, lifestyle, work out routine, supplements, and herbs probably put me in the top 1% in terms of living as healthy as possible but it doesn’t matter. I still have Lyme symptoms.

       thanks for the good info. I'm just starting out in digging into this new disease X. Seems to be affecting a growing number of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever try carefully dosing quinine cinchona alkaloids, as in making homebrew real tonic water?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Huang Lian Su could also have good properties together.

       Lyme disese is Fucking rough. Sometimes I'd almost rather give up. I just opened that damn jar of pickles yesterday are you flipping kidding me! So Fucking weak. Tired. Dead. Gotta get up, go to work. Getting moving and or out of bed can be the hardest part sometimes. Wait, there's more. Brain fog. Because who the hell Wants to think? That's for normal people.. why would I want to be normal? I enjoy doing nothing hiding in the fetal position because your to weak to move. Covered in gallons of viscous sweat. Finally, You start to unknowingly  herx and then you know it'll be okay at some point. .. for. Week. Maybe a year. Fuck off Lyme, a viscous bio weapon from a hidden island in newyork, made by the best govt ever! Except no insurance Fucking covers Shit. Wait. Insurance covers everything else. Why not Lyme? Good way to piss away money, since all non LLD just think I'm lying and think I'm out for the pills.
 Which I guess i am, but not the hydro or oxys. I had good luck flopping antibiotics back and forth.. for a while. No normal doctor will give you two antibiotics... could be a lawsuit

       Epsom salt soaks help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Limiting my b vitamin intake also helps.. don't eat junk food. The complex sugar in you fuels the baddies.. 
check out r/Lyme 
Obligatory good diet + exercise

       Tested heavy metal free chlorella, food grade Diatomacous Earth (DE) and betonite clay help me a lot with herx.  It pulls toxins out.  Also helped me if i have an accidental exposure to corn syrup which flares my IBS bad.. So bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I drink alkaline water and use Real Celtic Sea Salt.  Both help as well.  Real bone broth helps sooth gut linjng.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use a TENS for my nerve damaged muscle cramps and that is amazing.  I also use Kratom for my nerve and spine pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next thing I need to try are enemas but I am not able to do that myself yet physically.  Hopefully soon as am more mobile every day over a year off the opioids they had me on for the terrible pain.  It made or all worse and congested my liver worse.  Liver has to process fructose which I rhink is part of why HFCS makes me so violently sick.  Plus GMOs and Mercury in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also try some mud baths or just mud mask and put it all over where your herx is happening. Let it dry. Wash off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cold showers helped me too though i can't do them on bad pain days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am also using colloidal silver occasionally. And adding copper.  Now interesting fact.  I had goats when I was better and other goat farmers taught me to feed them these copper spirals. They stick in their GI tract and kill parasites.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have symptoms of extremely deficient copper and I am wonderinf id thus Lyme disease is hitting some id us so hard because we don't tape up dietary copper like other people do.  Perhaps our ancedtors had too much in the environment like Vit D and Africans... Dark skin keeps tjem healthy in high ajd hot sun climates but in Northern Hemisphere it leads to chronic Vit D deficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have many prpblems similar to mine. I have also Hashimotos autoimmune thyroiditis, fibromyalgia, CFS, IBS, sciatic nerve damage, non alcoholic fatty liver disease and others. Many of these are also symptoms of chronic copper deficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also take Primal Defense probiotics and eat fermented foods. And liposomal vitamin C and amino acids DLPA with natural B complex which is amazing for my chronic pain.   Kratom sub community helped me with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cant tell anyone to try colloidal silver and copper but I am and I am feeling better.  I take 4 days then off 3 usually.  I slow down if I am getting any herx.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also i got my mercury laced fillings removed but be sure its with a dentist who can protect you from contamination.  There is a great book called
       <em>
        The Root of Disease
       </em>
       talks aboit this and chronic illness because of infections of the rootless teeth.  It was out of print but maybe you can find it to borrow.

       I’ve used many of those to help with my herx reactions as well. They help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry you’re going through this as well. My TENS unit helps a lot. I have a Tesla coil I use sometimes as well for my TMJ. But it doesn’t help as much as the TENS unit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve read about krampton but I mostly use CBD for pain management. Pretty happy with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I just want to stop herxing. I never want to have another herx reaction. Alas I’m not sure how to get there. :-/

       You may not like some of what I have to say, but please consider it, because what is there to lose by trying?
      </p>
      <p>
       First
       <strong>
        I have had Lyme disease
       </strong>
       , second I am passionate about immunology, biology, food/nutrition sciences, and pharmacology, among many other related things.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Lyme disease is a living bacteria. It is permanently killed with approx. 2 months of taking a collection of antibiotics.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If it were still in your blood, you would be able to be tested again for the presence of the bacteria and given another round of antibiotics.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The damage that having Lyme disease does to your body is long term, but this is like having an injury in that you will have leftover damage and some reduced function.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       For Example, your joints may have been damaged, now you have a joint injury and it will cause pain.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The damage done to you from the time you were infected with Lyme does tax your immune system. This can make it less effective long term as it strains your organs.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       For example, unrelated to Lyme disease.. when someone has been in a coma for some reason, their organs can be permanently damaged from the stress of this experience.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ol>
       <li>
        These alternative meds and herbals might be further taxing your organs, like your liver and kidneys and this might be what is making you sick,, the things you are taking are probably making you feel worse, this is NOT a sign they are working to kill Lyme, because as I said, the actual bacteria is no longer in your body, unless you never had full antibiotic treatment.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Now for some things to help!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Eat a variety of foods that are high in antioxidants and flavonals, like blueberries,
         <strong>
          chocolate
         </strong>
         ,
         <strong>
          coffee
         </strong>
         , pomegranate.  (These repair cell damage and protect.
         <strong>
          Some protect brain.
         </strong>
         )
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are foods that are in our diet that we, as animals, are not able to digest properly and cause metabolic disease and digestive issues, as well as diabetes and heart disease.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       AVOID: wheat and simple carbohydrates, even brown rice. Avoid milk, cream. (These make you sick short term and long term.)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Eat lots of the right foods, low carb veggies, colorful veggies, dark green leafy veg, walnuts, olive oil, fermented foods like vinegar, saur kraut , kim chi, greek yogurt, kefir, hard cheeses, avocado, wild caught salmon, hummus, garlic. Barley, quinoa, beans, eggs, peppers.
       </li>

       Of course the person with the highest upvotes is claiming a round of antibiotics is the cure all. They’re basically recommending the CDC protocol, and arguing spirochetes are the same as bacteria. It’s madness. This is why I can’t get proper treatment, there’s so much misinformation out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve researched this extensively and studied the difference between bacteria and spirochetes and you’re correct they can and do borrow into tissues including the brain and hide from antibiotics and the immune system. That’s why this condition is so hard to treat.

       Great stuff. Something you may be unaware of, Borrelia burgdorferi has the ability to hide within and distinguish bacterial components as various body components, it can even hijack monocytes.
      </p>

       Borrelia burgdorferi is by far one of the worst things we as humans will ever have to deal with.

       The key point though, is that even though it has been found in rodents to persist in bone marrow and cysts and biofilms, if it were to the point of causing symptoms in a human, at that point it would be detectable by blood tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this isn't guesswork. If there are Lyme symptoms, there is Lyme presence and it can be tested for and treated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is there any valid study proving that it evades the same way in humans as it does in rodents?

       The immune issues after Lyme disease are caused by the damage it does to the immune response, not by an active infection.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        People trying to continue to treat a bacteria that is not active in them can cause even more damage to organs from quack pills and too many antibiotics.

       Here’s the problem, you’re already wrong with #1. I’ve done extensive research on this, and a spirochete is not bacteria, it doesn’t look like bacteria, it’s smaller than bacteria, and behaves nothing like bacteria. Spirochetes are spirochetes, and not bacteria. They’re a different organism, and it is entirely unknown if antibiotics can completely eliminate them. Spirochetes are a micro-organism, a parasite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Antibiotics are kind of like using an atomic bomb to kill cockroaches. You might kill some in the explosion, but the radiation isn’t going to take out those who weren’t in proximity of the explosion. Anything hiding in the organs or tissues goes into hiding from the immune system and won’t get eliminated by antibiotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Lyme enters the joint and organ tissues it can then form biofilms, go into remission, and hide from the immune system. This is why many people with chronic Lyme who have had months or even years of antibiotic treatments still relapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for everything else, there’s some sound information but it too is outdated. Injuries can heal, and stem cells can repair many of these kinds of injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is possible some of the herbs I am taking are making matters worse, why then have I overcome my digestive issues since taking them? Why can I now take higher doses without getting a herx reaction?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m mostly taking antioxidants, anti-inflammation, mushrooms, and a couple immune adaptogens. I take a lot of liver supporting herbs and flush my kidneys as well to support my organs. Even so, reoccurring herx reactions, swollen lymph nodes, and all the signs of an active infection.

       I know this probably seems like a lot, but you need to understand I had leaky gut and malabsorption issues for nearly 20 years. Had major deficiencies, and digestive problems. So this is the first time in decades I am absorbing supplements and food properly. Most of the items I'm taking are food based, or very specific supplements for various support systems for managing Lyme disease, herx reactions, and supporting t he bodies natural detox systems.

       Virtually the entire US population has both Toxoplasmosis AND Lyme due to CHEMTRAILs. Gov loves the perfect combination of indifference and brain fog for the masses. They spray both because Lyme is relatively easy to rid but adding toxoplasmosis makes it harder to cure either. Remember the scandal over the toxoplasmosis drug. Follow the big pharma money trail. For lyme there's Rocephin, Zithromax, Flagly taken together for 3 months to kill all 3 phases of lyme (cyst, spirochete, L).

       24 hours?...i think you're mistaken. if you seriously want to fix your condition try 2 weeks but even up to or longer than a month. obviously as long as your comfortable. and no cheating otherwise it wont work. the process is called autophagy.

        Eat to Improve Immune Function
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The best way to overcome chronic Lyme disease is by naturally boosting your immune system, lowering inflammation and managing the root causes of your symptoms. Your body can overcome Lyme disease for good only once you control the inflammatory responses it’s triggering.
      </p>
      <p>
       My basic dietary advice for anyone struggling with an inflammatory condition is to try removing grains, fruit and sugar from your diet while consuming anti-inflammatory foods — mostly vegetables, nuts, seeds, coconut, bone broth, organic meat and raw cultured dairy.  If you want to learn more about this approach to controlling leaky gut syndrome and inflammation, you can find out much more detail in this article about healing leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the best foods for naturally raising immunity include:
      </p>
      <p>
       High-antioxidant foods: fresh fruits and vegetables, especially leafy greens and other brightly colored veggies or berries, are the best sources of antioxidants and many other key nutrients. They help control free radical damage and inflammation, lower risk for nutrient deficiencies, and can protect you from Lyme complications.Bone broth: bone broth naturally contains the amino acids called proline and glycine, which can help repair a “leaky gut” and enhance immune function. Your gut/digestive health is highly tied to overall immune functioning; in fact, around 70 percent or more of your immune system lives in your gut! Foods that help replenish your gut with healthy bacteria and also rebuild the lining of the your GI tract control inflammation and allergies along with the many symptoms they can trigger.Probiotic-rich foods: Research published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology shows that probiotics can help reduce infectious disease progression and symptoms. (8) Probiotic foods include kefir, amasai and yogurt (ideally raw goat’s milk yogurt, which is one of the highest sources of probiotics). Fermented vegetables like sauerkraut, kimchi and kvass can be beneficial and should be added to your diet regularly. To truly kill off the bad bacteria we must overcrowd it with “good bacteria” (also known as probiotics). Probiotics help good bacteria to grow and flourish in the GI tract, which has a huge impact on your overall immunity and health.

        Supplements to Help Improve Cellular Function
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The next step in Lyme disease treatment is improving cellular functioning and protection. Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, along with viruses and parasites, can attack healthy cells and weaken your defenses. In order to restore cellular health, consider adding these essential nutrients to your regime:
      </p>
      <p>
       Vitamin D: Vitamin D3 naturally boosts immunity and plays a role in regulating inflammation. I recommend you supplement with around 5,000 IU daily, especially if you’re vitamin D deficient, live in the northern region of the world and don’t get much direct sunlight exposure (the best way for your body to make its own vitamin D).CoQ10: CoQ10 can help protect your brain and nervous system from degradation and inflammation, while also lowering symptoms like joint pain and aches. It’s commonly used by patients with ongoing fatigue and autoimmune disorder symptoms, including those with fibromyalgia. (9) Most physicians recommend taking 200 milligrams twice daily.Medicinal mushrooms: Studies show that medicinal mushrooms (this includes cordycep, reishi and maitake mushrooms) promote an adaptive immune system which helps control autoimmune reactions. (10) These can be found in various supplement forms and have been proven to reduce reactions to inflammation and stress. Medicinal mushrooms boost an intracellular antioxidant called superoxide dismutase (SOD) that protects your cells. They can also increase function of natural killer cells that can kill off bad bacteria.B-Complex: B vitamins support many metabolic and cellular functions, plus they help fight infections and improve neurological health. Vitamin B-6 is especially important for Lyme patients, or just about anyone dealing with the affects of stress or fatigue.Omega-3 fatty acids: These fatty acids are highly anti-inflammatory and support neurological/cognitive functions. In addition to consuming food sources of omega-3s (for example, wild-caught fish and nuts and seeds), I recommend supplementing with 1,000 milligrams of fish oil daily, specifically one that contains astaxanthin which boosts absorption.Magnesium: Magnesium is an electrolyte with hundreds of roles in the body, from supporting nerve signaling to reducing muscle aches. Many people are magnesium deficient, and those with Lyme disease can’t afford to run low since stress and illness only increases the body’s need for more.Turmeric: Turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory that can help reduce joint pain, headaches, and damage to blood vessels or nerves.Probiotics: In addition to consuming probiotic-rich foods, I recommend supplementing with probiotics with at least 8 strains and 50 billion units daily. I believe this is the most important factor in destroying Lyme.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Get Enough Rest &amp; Manage Emotional Stress
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Chronic stress, whether physical or emotional, has been proven time and time again to weaken the immune system and increase someone’s risk for getting sick. Stress can trigger inflammation and cause hormonal imbalances, while also disturbing digestive functions and worsening many Lyme disease symptoms. To prevent a Lyme infection from continuing to worsen and spread, you must address stress if you are truly going to heal.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to combat chronic stress, I recommend you schedule times of rest into your week, along with “fun times” meant to spend with family, friends and also alone. This might seem silly or even too simple to work, but stress is a very serious issue that makes many people sicker than they need to be!Focus on getting plenty of rest. Lyme can contribute to fatigue and require that you get extra sleep, so balance activity with rest and relaxation.I suggest you also practice forgiveness, address past emotional trauma, and work on healing through spirituality and guidance. Many people with Lyme and autoimmune conditions have deep-seeded emotional issues that interfere with healing. A good friend of mine, Dr. Alex Loyd, has a book called The Healing Code you may consider reading.Supplementing with adaptogenic herbs such as ashwagandha can naturally reduce the effects of stress and help balance cortisol levels.Other methods for helping to control your stress response include meditation, joining a support group, reading, journaling, exercising, using essential oils and spending time in nature.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Reduce Mold &amp; Parasite Exposure
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       According to Lyme disease experts and research done by the Department of Microbiology-Immunology at Northwestern University, environmental triggers (in particular viruses, bacteria and other infectious pathogens) are thought to play a major role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Parasites and mold exposure can contribute to lasting Lyme disease symptoms by stressing the immune system. (11)
      </p>
      <p>
       To naturally treat parasitic infections and toxicity I recommend using activated carbon (activated charcoal), which has been proven effective in helping the body expel harmful substances.Bentonite clay can also be beneficial and works in a similar way to bind to things like chemicals and heavy metals. However, make sure to take these two supplements on an empty stomach because they can also bind to essential minerals you need.To specifically treat parasites, I’d suggest consuming a diet low in sugar and high in healthy fats, along with taking and consuming probiotics.Herbs that can help kill parasites include wormwood, black walnut, oregano, garlic and grapefruit seed extracts.

       First and foremost, thank you for replying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your research and solutions mimics my own. You literally described almost every supplement I take, my diet, and methods for reducing stress (yoga and meditation help considerably).
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been taking almost all of these supplements and living this way for about 3 years now, and been really on it the past year since realizing it’s Lyme. It’s how I’ve been able to recover my digestive abilities, and eliminate most of my co-infections. Bone broths and diet have played a critical role, as well as mushrooms,
      </p>
      <p>
       I have won some battles getting rid of my SIBO, healing my leaky gut, and getting rid of my Candida but I am still losing the war. Meanwhile the damage to my joints, particularly my neck, and TMJ is severe and taking forever to heal. The supplement MSM has made a world of difference, as has turmeric and high doses of buffered vitamin C for managing my inflammation responses in addition to the reishi and other mushrooms but again I am not turning the corner fast enough. For every step I take forward I seem to take 3 backwards every time I herx.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, I would love to pick your brain more privately. Will send you a PM. Hope that’s okay.

       there could be some promise with CBD oil for both helping symptoms and helping to heal underlying issues caused by lyme. it seems to be a relatively safe thing to try regardless of the studies done thus far.

       in what context? cbd in isolated form is a crystal. so sure I guess you could smoke it like you would meth or something? I guess you could crush it up and sprinkle on a blunt of something else? Like I said you can vape it easily, but I have not heard of people combusting cbd isolate which is what I would imply when saying smoking something.
      </p>
      <p>
       i need no lecture or research from you to know plenty about cbd.

       now if you have other research that you have come across that says otherwise, please explain.

       ok you clearly have no idea what you are talking about so I won't bother with you. you clearly dont understand what pure cbd is at all or even what the high cbd strains actually are. Harlequin for example has a typical 5:2 CBD to THC. That is most definitely not pure CBD.

       You can totally smoke CBD. It's a cannabinoid produced just like THC, you just need to find a high CBD strain (Susy Q, Charlottes Web, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, you don't consume enough CBD by smoking the weed to gain the full medical effects, hence why it's often extracted and potentiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also recommend looking into Rick Simpson oil (the CBD strains).

       you arent smoking the CBD, you are smoking hemp flower and getting the cbd from it. very different from having slab or powder isolate and dabbing it, mixing with something, etc.

       Use it daily. It’s great for pain management, and does help heal but I’ve given up on the possibility of it curing me. I’ve been using the transdermal patches recently for locked up muscles and they’ve been pretty effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without CBD I don’t think I could manage the pain.

       Actually THCA in an MCT oil as a tincture has anti-microbial properties and doesn’t get you high. It’s what I used initially to treat my Lyme and it was really effective at first. Not so much anymore.

       A good friend of mine focused on flushing the virus and has stabilized energy and mood since.
      </p>
      <p>
       His treatment:
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of sleep, used to rebalance hormones and repair the body from working out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Work outs at least once a day, lifting light weights every three days, and moderate/intense cardio for at least 35 minutes 3-4 times a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drink plenty of water and avoid processed food of any kind. Limit red meat, focus on fish and chicken. Lots of veggies and fruit (fruit in morning). Almond butter in morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read books about love, friendship, inspiration, hope, the future. Nothing dystopian, nothing sad, nothing ‘overly negative’.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make it a point to introduce yourself to at least one new stranger every day, and make it your goal to get them to smile at least once in the interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supplements: find where you can get vitamin b12, vitamin c, d, e from natural sources, only supplement if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Avoid: Smoking, alcohol, and std’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your body is experiencing an environmental triggger of your immune system, so give your immune system so much love and goodness it will eventually overpower and ‘flush’ the virus’ trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this format you will see symptoms reduce 80-100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       No cheating.
      </p>
      <p>
       [No, you don’t need a Doctor, but I advise everyone to get a dr to help them with this format]

       this is good advice, but you def need real antibiotics.  you will need one that can cross the blood brain barrier.

       stemcells are not what you need.  what you need is a real doctor who is going to listen to you.  from there they will order the correct tests to get you a valid diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       once you have a positive diagnosis you need to start building up your gut bacteria.  lots of probiotics, lots of fermented foods, kambucha, etc.

       after a few months of this you will need to start in on some really strong antibiotics.  one will need to be able to cross the blood brain barrier.

       try to keep your food clean, get plenty of rest.

       i've been on hardcore antibiotics for 9 months and still going.
      </p>
      <p>
       it costs me around $1500 a month out of pocket, to pay a doctor.  I then have to buy the medicine on top of that.

       What you are not addressing is the CO-INFECTIONS.  The riddle to solve Lyme is not to kill the Lyme, it will just come back.  You need to get rid of every co-infection, then fight Lyme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without a doctor who can run valid tests to identify the correct co-infections you are fighting an uphill battle.

       I have a list of things that help deal with Herx.  Biggest thing that helps me is rest &amp; hot baths with salts.

       I’ve been on so many rounds of antibiotics in my life already that if this could have been fixed with antibiotics it would have been by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve spent years rebuilding my gut flora, and already fixed my digestive issues. I am not throwing that away again and risking more longterm side effects from the antibiotics. I appreciate your response, but I’ve already tried that path and it did me more harm than good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already know what co-infections I have, and I’ve already taken care of them. The only thing I don’t know for certain is what type of Lyme I’m dealing with, and simply can’t afford all the tests which might tell me. Most of those tests are highly inconsistent, and expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The path most doctors put you on with antibiotics is not a cure all. I’ve talked to many people who have had years of antibiotics and they’re not really better. They don’t have as many Lyme symptoms, but they all suffer from post-antibiotic syndromes. There’s other herbs and anti-microbials that are more targeted and won’t wipe out the entire gut flora like the ones I’m already taking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s the same idea, just a different approach using natural remedies instead of antibiotics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just curious but what antibiotics have you taken and which cross the blood brain barrier?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been on rounds of multiple broad spectrums before.

       Don’t write often but hope u see this from what It looks like diet is important but what did the trick for my stepdad (after about 2 years of this as a truck driver-not the safest carrier to do in pain) he went and saw a natural remedy doctor mostly had him change diet and eat a minimum of 2 garlic cloves EVERY day, pain left and can drive truck comfortably again. No episodes since (week or two after) and eats maybe 2-5 cloves a week. Best of luck to those who have this and don’t like garlic

       How long did he eat the garlic for? I've been able to work garlic back into my diet, but only in small amounts as I get herx reactions when I eat too much.
