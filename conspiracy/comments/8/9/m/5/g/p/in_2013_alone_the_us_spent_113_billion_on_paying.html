<p>This self post calls out the questionable motives of those who post about our financial aid to Israel (ratified under Obama) under false pretenses while those people ignore the real problems of our tax dollars being wasted in a much more extreme manner on much more easily solve-able issues, and the potential for a conspiracy to redirect the masses attention to a convenient and time honored scapegoat while hiding the real problem under ingrained antisemitism and hatred.</p>

<p>Exactly! These companies have been getting away without any criticism in all of this. They are providing the jobs. People wouln&#39;t keep coming into this country illegally if there was not guaranteed jobs when they get here. There should be a crackdown on the companies that provide the jobs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah so do you work in any of those industries? Firstly Meat Cutting is all union and pays like 27 bucks an hour and there are no illegals doing that. </p>

<p>Second Food processing sure there are canning plants with plenty of temps who are working using stolen SSN&#39;s but there would be plenty of people to do those jobs anyway if we stopped them same for chicken processing. </p>

<p>The FDA is corrupt and needs to be removed entirely the only serve to keep drug companies rich and tyson chicken staffed with cheap labor they dont actually care about our safety.</p>

<p>City Janitorial services are all union based. If you find a city union that is hiring illegals please speak up , because that is almost unheard of the one thing unions do is follow the rules so they can&#39;t get busted up. </p>

<p>Hospitality like hotels need to have better enforcement of existing regulations there are plenty of people who would be happy to be housekeeping for hotels for 7-10 dollars an hour. </p>

<p>It is a part time job and not one that people who are intelligent should expect to be able to raise a family on. There are jobs. But they are our jobs. Get it?</p>

<p>Besides, this talking point was thoroughly countered back when Trump used it on the campaign trail.  It totals the net costs while ignoring any economic windfalls gained from illegal immigrants.  From everything I&#39;ve read, the net effect appears to be about 10 to 12 billion negative per year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you have a point that 3.8 billion a year isn&#39;t breaking the bank, and I&#39;m sure congress thinks it&#39;s important or they wouldn&#39;t have expanded that line.  But using that 113 billion figure was misleading when Trump used it and misleading when you used it.</p>

<p>Israel is still outnumbered in the middle east, but they have an image problem due to the west bank and a rapidly approaching choice to make about their country&#39;s identity going forward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>why do you think we are so far in debt, it isnt money we give to Israel. The west bank thing is a scam. Everyone Knows there was never really a palestine and Jordan along with other opec countries is just trying to get land it lost back in the 1960&#39;s war with Israel back by swaying public opinion because the United States has made it Very Clear that if there is another Invasion we will also be involved. So they know they can&#39;t possibly get the land back in an actual war therefore they have turned to propaganda to try and convince enough Americans to abandon our stance like the Soviets were able to do to the public during the Vietnam war. </p>
