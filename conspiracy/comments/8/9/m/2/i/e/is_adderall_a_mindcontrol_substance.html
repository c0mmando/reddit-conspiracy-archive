       One of the things commonly described by people who use Adderall is the experience of “tunnel vision.” It makes you particularly good at performing tasks but seems to inhibit creative and critical thinking. Is it possible ADD was simply made up in order to brainwash the young generation, such as how Huxley described the future of brainwashing enhanced by pharmaceutical methods?

       I don't think it's an MC drug. The issue with Addie is how powerful it is. It's a wonder drug- you can psyche yourself into the most droll, boring tasks, or drink yourself silly and not even feel it. But incessant Addie use can easily lead to Coke...which is way easier to get. And a small amount of people who make it to Coke will eventually hop to Meth.

       I don't think it does. It doesn't really make people more open to suggestion- it makes people with ADD act normal and it makes people without it highly productive if they can channel that productivity. Lots of drugs will do that. The danger is that it can lead to Coke and Meth.

       I suppose that all depends on how you define normal and productive. You can be productive on a meaningless task however that doesn't really mean all that much.

       I've seen friends with ADD who actually get use out of it. From their own self-reported perspective to me, they don't feel its effects the same way those without it do.

       I understand. What I don't you are understanding is that bringing those people back down to 'normal' depends on your opinion of what normal should be. One could say that if they learned to harness their internal energy they could be far greater than just being brought back down to 'normal'. Does that add clarity?

       I'm using the term "normal" as they did. From my friends own mouth- they considered Addie to help them to be perceived as functioning normally, both to themselves and outwardly, when compared to people without ADD and without taking Addie.

       I get what you're saying, and I'm not defending Addie here. I'm just saying I don't think it is necessarily a good MC drug. I think its purpose is to get people onto the slippery slope of an amphetamine high and get them onto Coke and eventually Meth.

       For many, it doesn't necessarily bring them to "normal", but rather functional.  For those I know with ADHD, it can be difficult to function sometimes.  And for that, Adderall is extremely helpful.

       I am ADHD, and I also come from a third world country, so I spent most of my life unmedicated. Needless to say, college was extremely difficult and keeping a job was even harder. Then I moved to the States and sought help. Tried Ritalin, Concerta and a bunch of other pills, then I tried Adderall. Holy. Shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff that was impossible was now like second nature. I have a very high IQ but have always performed poorly on everything due to my incapacity to maintain interest for more than a few minutes. I could suddenly do math and physics without getting distracted by my own breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, I also have a very strong cigarette addiction that started in my mid teens. Now I'm in my late 30's and the idea of getting hooked on Adderall as bad as it is with cigs is so scary that I had to stop. I am actually looking for a career switch because I don't want to depend on a chemical substance in order to be able to function.
      </p>
      <p>
       That shit was too good to be true and I'm not planning to stay and find out what the catch is. I'll be happy to become a woodworker and fuck corporate life.

       Yes, my best friend said the same.  He has an extremely high IQ and is smart/funny as hell.  But once he hit the working world he really struggled.  Then came Adderall and it was like flipping a switch - he could focus, he moved up the ladder, he grew more confident.
      </p>
      <p>
       His insurance doesn't cover it, so he can't always afford it.  Which means he goes off and on it when needed.

       But yeah - for those who truly have ADHD, it can be a miracle drug.

       For awhile now I've been begging my Dr and therapist to put me on Adderall, but for some reason they won't do it. I can't focus on anything so I have a hard time getting anything done, I just want to be normal and I'm losing hope that I'll ever be able to be a functional adult.

       Yep. That's why people move to coke- because they can use it until their scrip gets filled again next month. And some of those who move to Coke will keep chasing the high until even the Coke isn't enough and that's how they move to Meth.

       don't think that's mind control. if that was the case, then everyone who abuses substances would become addicted....addiction is based of suseptability of the individual which isn't fully understood

       I've seen it IRL. No need for TV show fakery. Those people are a pebble stone throw away from losing it all if they do not cease their behavior. You can continue to deny reality though. It's your choice. You're probably one of those 'functioning' addicts. Seek Jesus!

       I took Adderall for a while. I didn't have tunnel vision, but I did sort of space out at night while on it. Like sitting and staring. Also, it made me mean! And I am not a mean person. I'm not even mean online! But it made me agitated and mean. I was picking verbal fights in real life (and that is totally not me)!
      </p>
      <p>
       I finally figured out it was the medication. Looked up side effects, and all that was listed. I stopped taking it.

       It's like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a creative, often intelligent high energy kid - and yes, there are some little shit disturbers - but you have a kid who doesn't sit still well in class, and shut up and listen, and so he's always looking around, and he's fairly smart so he's seen this shit before, and each grade really they are teaching pretty much the same thing as the year before, so he's bored. So he has trouble sitting still, maybe he's a little immature, and the problem is that when he acts out, he distracts the other kids, and the teachers are often not really well equipped to deal with this sort of disruption. And you have both parents working, and they get home late and they aren't always around because they have to pay for the house, and the two cars that let them go to work and so on. At the end of the day, you can pay someone to spend time with this kid maybe teaching him coping skills, or how to get rid of his excess energy, and how to maybe work around or manage his immaturity, but that costs money, see. And really, the teachers, they just want him to sit still and shut up, right? That's all. Not cause any disturbance. And the parents, they don't know what to do about it, because the doctors and the teachers, well, they're the professionals, right? They are the ones who are educated on how to best deal with these sorts of problems, and they are saying: just give him a pill, right? because at the end of the day, it solves their problem; and it's a hell of a lot cheaper than paying someone to sit down, spend time with the kid, and be patient and coach him. In the end, it is the solution that is the cheapest for society, to get that kid to shut up, sit down, and pay attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       The kid gets better grades for a year or two, and everybody is happy. It's a cheap, quick fix. and this has been going on since the 60s, I remember reading about it, I was reading a transcript I can't remember exactly what it was: whether it was a court case, or a transcript of some parent teachers meeting or something, and they were having this debate, and this is what it comes down to. Yes, there are some kids that really need medication, but when you get right down to the nitty gritty, the meat of the matter, at the end of the day maybe what's best for most of these kids who do have some sort of difficulty in class is that somebody sits down with them, who understands these problems, and has the patience and the time to help the kid work it out. That costs money. Nobody wants to spend that money. Just give the kid a pill.
      </p>

       I currently take adderall and i am the biggest "conspericy theorist" i know.(i prefer to call us truth seekers) I am a very open minded person. I also tend to question the narrative of a lot of things being portrayed to us on a deeper level than many i know. I have been taking these meds for almost 7 years and in no way feel like i am being controlled.

       I was crazier on the antidepressants, anxiety, ocd meds than i have ever been just taking adderall. I struggle focusing. I am a full time mom and i home school part time(3 of 5 days a week). So that means i cook, clean, teach, and am in charge of any and all appointments for myself and 2 kids (plus my wonderful husband who works hard so i can be a stay at home mom/teacher). The tasks of everything needing to be done by one person who struggles with not knowing where to 'start' is very overwhelming. Having your brain going in so many different directions all you want to do is shut down and not do any of it, is itself depressing. So If having that 'help' of being able to focus to start or finish a task is mind control then i guess i am a robot. 🤖

       Took it once in my younger days... it literally made me unable to read or hold a thought beyond a couple seconds... never again. Most prescription drugs seem to have the opposite of intended effect on me... valium/opioids and the like turn me into a raging hulk beast. Needless to say I haven't taken that shit in many years.

       Firstly you have to ask, is ADHD even a real disorder? Or just made up in order to sell amphetamines.

       The DSM with every new addition widens the symptoms for someone to be diagnosed with the disorder.

       I'm more of the opinion that it is truly exposure to neurotoxic chemicals (food, water) that causes many of these mental illnesses and that the fact is being buried under pseudoscientific methods in order to profit and control. Like everything else: they fuck us up and sell a "solution."

       I don't have ADHD, but I take Adderall (for epilepsy meds). It's basically meth, for me. I definitely have an ability to focus on tasks better, but also like speed, i still enjoy drawing, music, hiking, etc... just a dopamine boost.
      </p>
      <p>
       My BF has ADHD and refuses to take Adderall. Took it for a year and a half and says it changed him completely, ruined his last relationship, etc. He was always angry, agitated, and spaced out when he was not on it. I have seen him on it once or twice, and he gets very hyperfocused on one thing, and can get angry if disrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       My little sister was also diagnosed with ADHD and given Adderall. It rendered her essentially comatose. I remember her being 9-10 years old, in bed in the dark, vomiting because of the migraines it (or the comedowns gave her).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have many other experiences I could name, but essentially, I tend to notice the negative effects of Adderall more in people with ADHD and low dopamine levels. I don't really understand why it seems to effect them on a wide range of symptoms, but they seem to have less of a amphetamine-like effect as opposed to people w/o ADHD who take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's pharma grade meth, and it makes them crash really hard because it further  depletes their dopamine levels.

       Its about getting people to be efficient workers. Most people tend to be lazy and not focus too well but given some federal that makes people energetic and focused. There isnt anything like add just people who dont naturally have it in them to strive for consistency and focus.

       I've seen it IRL. No need for TV show fakery. Those people are a pebble stone throw away from losing it all if they do not cease their behavior. You can continue to deny reality though. It's your choice. You're probably one of those 'functioning' addicts. Seek Jesus!
