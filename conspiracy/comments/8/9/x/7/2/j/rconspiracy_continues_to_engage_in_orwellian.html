    <div class="md"><p>I was in your last thread. I&#39;m in this one because I am pretty much always just chilling in /new when I&#39;m on Reddit.</p>

<p>You are calling for the removal of mods who actually care and who I had interactions with before they became mods. Mods whose addition to the mod team were an excellent choice. You got in trouble for calling someone a &quot;jew rat&quot;, and the last thread got rule 10&#39;d because it literally violated rule 10...</p>

<p>I disagree with you because like I said, I had interactions with them before they became a mod. I think their addition to the mod team was an excellent thing for this community. You&#39;re pissed that you got in trouble for using a certain term, and instead of calmly appealing to the mods to try and get the ban lifted, you went and made that post.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. I’ve had interactions with the Rothschilds. They are great people and they have made valuable contributions to society so who are you to tell me that they shouldn’t have complete and total control of the money supply of almost all the nations of the world!!!???? </p>

<p>Do you see the flaws in your statement now?</p>

<p>I don’t care if they have made “valuable contributions” to this subreddit, I’m sure they have. However, I’m concerned that it doesn’t raise a red flag for you when you look into their comments and they are removing posts left and right. Constantly. All throughout the day. </p>

<p>I can speak for myself, I was an honest member of this community for I want to say 6 or 7 months. And then right out of the blue my account is banned. Not temporarily, but forever. I did not get a warning strike. Heck I didn’t even get an explanation. Is there nothing wrong with that picture to you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious how you’re posting here if you were perma-banned? Also I have only ever received one rule-strike here and it to was a perma-ban, but all it took to change that was me pm’ing the mods explaining myself and the ban was (eventually) lifted. And I’m not a mod fan-boy there are a few mods that I personally don’t see eye to eye with in regards to their views, but when I approached them politely and respectfully they reciprocated that attitude right back to me...... </p>

<p>Sooooo if you want to get upset, attack the mods and make spiteful post like this, how do you think they will treat you, they have enough shit to deal with day in and day out, and you coming in all guns blazing like this is only guaranteeing they will just ban you again and move on with their lives.... </p>

<p>Also.... come on.....</p>

<p>This is like complaining about a referee because all they do is call fouls.....well duh it’s their job to... what did you expect to see in a mod’s comment history? Most of their job here is too enforce the publicly posted rules........ </p>

<li><p>This is a different account </p></li>
<li><p>Like u/piisfour has said. There is something wrong when criticism of authority results in censorship or banishment. That’s why I called for the repeal of rule number 10. You cannot have a negative opinion of u/ misstype or any moderators for that matter or they will envoke rule number 10. I bet we can find examples of people, even moderators violating rule 10 but their comments stay up. I completely roasted u/bradok with logic, but these people are just too arrogant to admit defeat so they will never admit that they were wrong. I don’t want to have to suck up to people just so I can get my privileges back. I was an honest member of the community for 6-7 months. I was banned because they overstepped their boundaries and they were drunk with power, not because of anything I did.</p></li>
<li><p>You say oh they’re just doing their job. That’s one of the biggest problems I have with people. They are just content with listening to the higher ups and following the rules whether they are wrong or right, fair or unfair. That is why military boys never stand down the orders of these War loving, evil, power grabbers, because they are content with doing their job, and they will even drop depleted uranium onto innocent people in Iraq in order to help the boss achieve his goal. Also I ask for an explanation as to how I violated rule 10 and they fail to provide one for me. In a way they are sort of refusing to read my Miranda rights for me. For lack of a better analogy. </p></li>

Your only argument was that you knew the mods, they were good people, therefore any criticism against them is bad and it must be censored.
