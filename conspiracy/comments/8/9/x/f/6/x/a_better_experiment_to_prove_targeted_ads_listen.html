<p>Works alot better. Scared the shit outta me 3 or 4 years ago when I tried. </p>

<p>For a few nights in a row put on a TV channel or radio channel in Spanish (or any language it her than your own) and let your phone charge next to it all night. Day 3 or 4 you&#39;ll start getting ads in Spanish (or whichever language you chose) </p>

<p>Charging while your sleeping is as inactive as use possible, foriegn language as distant from your searches and content. </p>

<p>When it happens you won&#39;t look at technology the same. </p>

<p>Your welcome.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a good idea.  You could also tale it one step further, but only if you have this type of phone, and remove the battery but still charge the phone.  Could be why so many companies have gotten rid of removable batteries.  If they always have a power source available it may make it easier to listen(even when off).</p>

<p>I will try this next week and weekend.  Ill see what kind of weird shit pops up in my ads(though I do occasionally get YouTube ads in Spanish but don&#39;t watch Spanish shows ever.  Only ocassioanly speak it with co workers at a part time job)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be worth just creating a new google account exclusively for this phone and then carry it around for a few weeks, charged, but switched off.</p>

<p>And charge it overnight, switched off, with another device broadcasting in Spanish.</p>

<p>Or just keep it switched off in a room where a certain language is broadcasted, for a few days, and then check YouTube on that device with that new username logged in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve had the technology to track and listen in on phones that are off since the early 90s.

It was on Netflix but I forget which one </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for reminding me to go back and look at my saved Netflix stuff.  I think I have that documentary saved or one similar to it.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t doubt they have the technology for it.  Its just changed from them having to do constant monitoring to now sending a letter to a few CEOs and getting the info or direct link from them.  The FBIs confidential informant, that&#39;s paid off, has gone from the shady guy who knows everything from 33rd st down, to a man in a $1000 suit who could by any thing they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get Spanish ads all the time, but that&#39;s because they are using my location (gps is always off but they triangulate location with cell towers anyways) and i live in a majority Hispanic border state. I&#39;ve got my phones permissions for location, audio and video turned off for all apps except the camera, which still has location disabled. Yes I know that doesn&#39;t mean they still can&#39;t listen in or hijack my cameras, but its more secure than most other peoples phones that I know who allow all permission requests. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont live in an area with a large or majority Hispanic population.  And the Spanish ads are only here and there.  So its odd why I would get them.  And I get them when listening to YouTube at my day job(no one speaks Spanish and we dont havr any background videos/audio going on)   so not sure why YouTube thinks I would like them.</p>

<p>My Pandora ads are all over the place.  But they are mostly geared for things where I used to live, 6 years ago.   So that&#39;s also odd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that from my spotify sometimes too. Like an average of 1 of 10 ads will be in Spanish like all random though, sometimes 2 Spanish ads in a row. Yeah, I don&#39;t really speak spanish either. I can understand it pretty ok and can speak a little bit, but I don&#39;t speak it in my daily life only on rare occasions, like when I need to call someone who is in close proximity to me a bitch or a MFer, or when the out of state driver is going 45 in the left lane on the freeway and you can&#39;t get over cuz the middle lane is doing 75 to 80, and is packed with cars. Funny thing is that most of the time the out of state driver has Cali plates. Lol</p>

<p>Its odd how the Pandora ads don&#39;t use places near my current location.  Oh well not arguing.   The Spanish ads are annoying though, mainly because I have to open the youtibe window when I&#39;m in the middle of editing stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bought a certain brand of beer yesterday that I haven’t purchased in a very long time nor researched ever. </p>

<p>Today on instagram I got an ad for the new seasonal version of the very beer I bought just yesterday. </p>

<p>I’ve turned the microphone access on IG off, so was it another app that listened in on me? </p>

<p>Did some thing let an advertising algorithm know I actually purchased that beer? I bought the beer at a liquor store so just knowing my location at time of purchase is not enough to have that ad targeted directly to me. </p>

<p>I told my gf about this with a screenshot of the ad as she was with me when I bought the beer and she told me she got an email from caviar today for a restaurant that we passed and were talking about on this very same beer run </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m deadly serious, but why don&#39;t people watching anime all day get ads in Japanese?</p>

<p>I realize they would get anime/learn Japanese related ads, but that has to do with their search history and not the audio that is played near their phone. Audio in Japanese should bring about ads in Japanese (targeted at native speakers). </p>

<p>What about people who watch Bollywood movies? Do they get ads in Hindi? There are plenty of fans who don&#39;t speak Hindi, AFAIK. Thus they would not search for anything in Hindi to make Hindi language ads show (Ads for Bollywood DVDs/streaming in English does not count, as it is logical from search history and not something that comes from the phone mic picking up sound). </p>

<p>I just thought of these as common examples of languages that certain people would play a lot outside of the territories where they are spoken and ads in those languages would appear. But I may add that I myself have watched hours and hours of torrented Japanese TV shows (talk shows etc) in order to learn the language, but it wasn&#39;t until I moved to Japan and got a Japanese IP address that I got Japanese ads on websites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. And what use would it be to anyone showing you ads for Japanese shampoo and other products not sold in any other country, home delivered groceries inside Japan only, and all the other stuff they advertise to people in Japanese?</p>

<p>I get Japanese ads because I live here, and everything that is advertised is unavailable outside Japan. They would waste advertising space if they targeted ads based on audio language and ignored GPS/cell pings. </p>

<p>All the ads I get in my home country and native language are also worthless if you don&#39;t live there. I still get some ads from there even though I&#39;m in Japan. I won&#39;t be able to buy that new soda they sell on the other side of the world just because I use that language, so I think they could do a lot better with the ads!</p>

<p>In my country people are very comfortable with subtitles, so nobody would watch dubbed anime, they all watch it in Japanese with subtitles. Yet they don&#39;t get any Japanese language ads. Neither did I back in my home country, even though I listened to Japanese talk shows for days on end, and so I just wanted to ask about people&#39;s thoughts about why this might be, as I find this fascinating.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe targeted ads technology is well developped; it would figure out based on your profile that you don&#39;t fluently speak, say, japanese, and that you are watching anime on your device based on the streaming site/program used to watch torrented content.

    <div class="md"><p>A system like that needs to be extremely sophisticated in order to explain my lack of Japanese ads, when I literally spent the entire day for long periods exclusively listening to and watching Japanese language TV shows (talk shows and news, no anime) without subtitles. No eye movements to give me away, and I also listened to Japanese radio news that were audio only. I know this seems like an implausible amount of listening to Japanese, but I <em>really</em> wanted to increase my listening comprehension, and the only way to do that is to listen a lot to the language you want to learn. And it just so happens that it turned out to work as a kind of experiment for this theory.</p>

<p>I did get Japanese ads a few weeks after physically moving to Japan, but my online plane ticket purchase, IP address, my GPS stats and my constant googling of Japanese train schedules were of course actual proof of my being there, no need to listen to any microphones to know that. I remember very well getting my first ads in Japanese, and remarking to myself how slow they were in catching up. I was thinking about it then, and concluded that they wanted to wait and make sure I wasn&#39;t a tourist. Those Japanese ads were useless for tourists anyway.</p>

<p>Looking at the ads I get in Japanese while being in Japan, it makes sense that they wouldn&#39;t show them to me no matter how much I listened to Japanese in my home country. All the ads are for products and services that are not offered outside Japan, and would be useless to show a person in Europe, even if they did understand Japanese, and especially back when all my other search history would suggest that I was an eager consumer and prime target for ads inside the country where I was actually located. There is no point in showing ads to people who are unlikely to click them and buy the products that are advertised, that is why targeted ads exist in the first place. It would seem that by showing ads to people in the wrong country, basing ads on the language spoken around the microphone would actually lead to less revenue for all parties who are making money on the ads. I&#39;d say the most reliable way to target ads based on country/language is simply noting what languages people write in on Facebook and Google, and follow where they go by GPS, which they already openly admit to doing, right?</p>

<p>This is why I find it implausible that this would work for every language in every country. It&#39;s a lot more plausible for say, Spanish ads in America, as there are actually Spanish language services, companies and products there, which they can market to local people who understand Spanish. If you listen to Spanish audio in the US and are thus likely understand it, there are actually a lot of ads that might be relevant to you. So, it would seem to be a strategy that is more likely to appear in countries where several languages are spoken by a significant part of the population.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how familiar you are with the tool but that is, ironically, exactly what you&#39;d use Wireshark for, haha. It&#39;s designed around having filters sift through huge streams of data, leaving only the relevant information. These kinds of filters can easily be whipped up by inspecting the normal, innocuous data sent from a &quot;normal&quot; device.</p>

More modern codecs like Codec2 then can do 0.7kbps - hour = ~300 kilobytes. And you can remove silent parts, then encrypt it and mix with some other data. You could even send some other more regular data always padded with some headroom so it doesn&#39;t stick out when the padded area is once in a while filled with packed voice. Very much close to impossible to detect unless you go digging into the binaries / firmware. A needle in a haystack may be easier to find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Suppose you have two brand-new Android phones. After connecting both devices to your home network (which you have under surveillance via Wireshark), you install the official Facebook app onto one of the devices, device A, and log in, after which you tab out of the app. The other phone, device B, is left in its factory state (aside from the network settings you configured to connect it to your home network).

<p>If that scenario were to have occurred, you&#39;d be able to figure out what packets the Facebook app sent from device A simply by filtering out the traffic sent from device B. Haystack or not, narrowing down the data you&#39;d be looking for would not be anywhere near an impossible task.</p>

It wouldn&#39;t make sense that they want you to get spanish advertisments just because you&#39;re sorrounded by spanish-speaking people. They have far more sophisticated methods to give you ads of things they think you&#39;ll need, instead of hoping to reach you with languages they picked up. Don&#39;t forget, your phone is (usually) tied to a phone number, which can be connected to your facebook profile, which can track you through the whole internet (use ublock origin and noscript, people!). They have all data they need from you.</p>

<p>Additionally, I&#39;ll just quote myself:</p>

<p>It&#39;s technically unlikely, too.</p>

<p>If they send all the audio a phone records to their servers, it would be huge amounts of data. Someone would have noticed that by now and we&#39;d have proof of it.</p>

<p>If they do voice recognition/sound analysis on the phone, the phone would use lots of ressources (it&#39;s not easy to do that), and the user would notice. I haven&#39;t heard anything of this, too.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason Siri sends your requests to Apples server to &quot;decode&quot; it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about how much data you can fit in your basic thumb drive. Then consider that the cell phone companies are the ones recording and selling data to the advertisers. Different data comes at different prices, so if you play only Spanish and no English you get all Spanish since, well as far as their concerned you moved to mexico and speak Spanish or a Spanish person stole your phone. It doesn&#39;t matter much, the lead is &quot;speaks Spanish&quot;. If you play Spanish 20 percent and English 80, and got some of both, you can conclude that the ads in Spanish were the low ballers. 
They also probably hold on to the data for enough time to have the AI mine it then scrap it and wait for the next data set. I dunno. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. The practicality of it all makes it not worth it given it&#39;s just easier to track search history, friends, and movements to build a generic profile.</p>

<p>The idea that they would target an individual saying &quot;gum&quot; is kinda ridiculous and definitely Baader-meinhof syndrome is at work.</p>

<p>Also an aside, after testing and researching this a bunch, I was involved in a convo about circumcision . The next day I got random ads for alt news sites talking about circumcision. I immediately thought &quot;holy shit it DOES happen&quot;.</p>

<p>Then I realized my phone wasn&#39;t even with me during the chat. It&#39;s just that the internet serves all sorts of junk all the time. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying advertisers wouldn&#39;t if they could ofc, but there is no evidence they can or do. </p>

We were in the kitchen discussing options for pizza cuz she can&#39;t have gluten and cured pepperoni as found on pizzas across the US. I recommended she try a pineapple and Canadian bacon pizza. We hasn&#39;t discussed pizza options before then as she just got her diagnosis the day before, and we&#39;ve been going to the same pizza joint for 7 years now. She had her phone idle on the counter, and mine was charging in the other room. Well, a couple hours later she began getting bombarded with adds for pizza, more specifically ads for pineapple &amp; Canadian bacon and gluten free pizzas. She didn&#39;t search for pizza shops that offer those pizzas on her device, I did that on mine. Also, She said she never gets ads for pizza, much less the specific pizza we were discussing earlier that day. I think something was listening in for key words on her device for sure. Very suspicious if you ask me.....</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying audio wasn&#39;t involved, <em>but</em>, if you were both on Wi-Fi, and thereby both accessing the internet through the same IP address, the interest recorded from your activity (by at least one ad system) could have simply been generally attributed to the IP, which could explain why she saw it.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I block all third-party trackers in Chrome using Privacy Badger so I rarely see targeted ads and my interests are rarely recorded, so I can&#39;t speak to this from direct experience. I recommend that plugin highly.</p>
