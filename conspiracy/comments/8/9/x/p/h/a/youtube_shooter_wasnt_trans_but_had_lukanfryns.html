        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(Correcting title- LUJAN-Fryns)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read so many posts where it&#39;s assumed or joked that the YouTube shooter was a transsexual Mossad/MK Ultra agent or something -as if being trans was just <em>one more nefarious fold</em> in the conspiracy - why would the agency do that when they could just use a man or a woman the same way?</p>

<p>But one thing is certain, her appearance and behavior are odd or unfamiliar to most. I recognized it immediately from some mentally disabled children I grew up with and I found a possible answer- a syndrome that point-for-point describes her appearance, demeanor and reason for instability: Lujan-Fryns syndrome. Read it for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lujan%E2%80%93Fryns_syndrome">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lujanâ€“Fryns_syndrome</a></p>

<p>Pointed but weak chin, thick neck, abnormally slender body and limbs, large cranium, broad chest, socially shy (living through video but not a functional, independent adult), potential for violent outbursts, schizophrenia, strange nasal voice, eating issues, on and on... In varying degrees of functionality.</p>

<p>It could have gone undiagnosed or could have even been kept hidden by her parents. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t excuse what she did nor do I want to label all L-J cases as potential attackers, but it may help explain this case. 
 It makes more sense than why an agency would play such a long game and choose to have a socially-retarded trans agent make weird shitty videos for years and years, and then be an ineffective shooter when they &#39;needed&#39; her to be.</p>

<p><em>Submission statement: conspiracy may yet be involved but I feel the shooter&#39;s odd appearance and behavior is based in an undiagnosed condition. I want to share information on it to defuse the overwhelming knee jerk reaction of &#39;she&#39;s a dude&#39;! which makes the conspiracy community look transphobic and derails further discussion by oversimplifying the bizarre case.</em></p>

<p>I can see by the downvotes that the science of genetics making someone behave bizarrely isn&#39;t as intriguing as convoluted conspiracies to groom transsexual robot assassins, but I&#39;ll take my lumps.</p>

Psyops intend to generate as much shock and awe, hence the PETA/animalrights, vegan, antigay, yet fake breasts.
strapping on fake breasts is &#39;trans&#39; as in cross-dressing. dunno where sexual was inferred. lots of people are intersexual, asexual etc so it is offensive to ascribe sexuality to a person without knowing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Off base or a theory as plausible as any? But having a trans sleeper agent that lives with his/her parents and makes low budget videos for years until they switch her on to shoot up YouTube so as to enact more gun control is more on base than a schizophrenic and mentally/physically abnormal person who snaps when they feel the one thing they had is taken away?

<p>I love a wild conspiracy myself but I know that not everything is one. I&#39;m suggesting the possibility that maybe, just maybe, she was mildly physically deformed and mentally impaired and schizophrenic and was losing the one thing she thought she had control of. Off base? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You state that &quot;YouTube shooter wasn&#39;t Trans, but had Lukan-Fryns syndrome&quot;. If you had relevant experience in this area you would know that diagnosing these kind of syndromes is notoriously difficult and certainly can&#39;t be done from watching a few bizarre video clips where the &quot;artist&quot; is deliberately making herself look as strange as possible.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that she did appear to be trans in some of the videos (I don&#39;t think was is as I&#39;ve seen a few videos where she definitely seemed female), she also appeared to have been altered with CGI and her videos were extremely strange - no one is denying this surely?</p>

<p>So we had a crazy vegan, karate chopping trans-looking woman, quoting Hitler and going on a shooting rampage in the YouTube Headquarters and the victims were taken to the local Mark Zuckerberg Hospital, this story is nothing but WILD whether you believe the official line or you suspect that she was a false-flag set-up.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s the stuff that makes everyone laugh at r/conspiracy.&quot; The shills would like you to believe that but I don&#39;t think us tinfoil-hatters care anymore as time and time again &quot;crazy&quot; conspiracies are proven to be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, but what you say is well possible without a genetic defect. Listening to the manifesto the person clearly isn&#39;t understanding of the real word and she does show to have some mental impairment (my best guess is arseburgers due to total lack of social understanding; don&#39;t know much about arseburgers, I&#39;m guessing it is not a genetic but probably developmental condition). It could also have been caused by years of B vitamin deficiency (common and almost universal in vegans who don&#39;t use supplements) and the classic omega3 to 6 imbalance.</p>

<p>What I do have experience with was knowing a family that had three children with this syndrome, all in varying degrees of social functionality: from severely disabled to one that was merely a highly functioning autistic prone to emotional schizo outbursts, -but all three had these physical traits;  large eyes and cranium, narrow long weak chins, spindly limbs and small peculiar mouths with nasal voices. </p>

<p>Of course it matters. When a crime is committed the details of the perpetrator should be accurately recorded (and reported) if for no other reason than good statistics gathering.</p>

<p>The transgender fad is relatively new, we know very little about the long-term consequences of current treatment protocols. If this was a man who carried out the shooting - and it almost certainly was - it is important that it be recorded as such. Accurately recording the details of the perpetrator may help to prevent shootings in the future. </p>

<p>Imagine that a while man put on blackface and committed a crime. How should his ethnicity be reported? African American? </p>

<p>Occam&#39;s razor applies. She looks like a man, she has a name that is more commonly male, 98% of mass shooters are men.... she is very probably a man. </p>

<p>Yes - it is possible that she has some rare medical condition that makes a woman look like a man. But this is many times less likely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt this is the case. Lujan Fryns syndrome is associated with mental retardation,  and while Nasim is batshit crazy she appears to have at least average intelligence.</p>

<p>Marfan syndrome is a disorder that causes similar physical features, but does not have neurological or psychiatric symptoms. I could believe that she has that. But to be honest her appearance doesn&#39;t seem that abnormal to me. A lot of Middle Eastern girls have similar features, also most of her pics and videos are heavily Photoshopped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You state that &quot;YouTube shooter wasn&#39;t Trans, but had Lukan-Fryns syndrome&quot;. If you had relevant experience in this area you would know that diagnosing these kind of syndromes is notoriously difficult and certainly can&#39;t be done from watching a few bizarre video clips where the &quot;artist&quot; is deliberately making herself look as strange as possible.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that she did appear to be trans in some of the videos (I don&#39;t think was is as I&#39;ve seen a few videos where she definitely seemed female), she also appeared to have been altered with CGI and her videos were extremely strange - no one is denying this surely?</p>

<p>So we had a crazy vegan, karate chopping trans-looking woman, quoting Hitler and going on a shooting rampage in the YouTube Headquarters and the victims were taken to the local Mark Zuckerberg Hospital, this story is nothing but WILD whether you believe the official line or you suspect that she was a false-flag set-up.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#39;s the stuff that makes everyone laugh at r/conspiracy.&quot; The shills would like you to believe that but I don&#39;t think us tinfoil-hatters care anymore as time and time again &quot;crazy&quot; conspiracies are proven to be true. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, but what you say is well possible without a genetic defect. Listening to the manifesto the person clearly isn&#39;t understanding of the real word and she does show to have some mental impairment (my best guess is arseburgers due to total lack of social understanding; don&#39;t know much about arseburgers, I&#39;m guessing it is not a genetic but probably developmental condition). It could also have been caused by years of B vitamin deficiency (common and almost universal in vegans who don&#39;t use supplements) and the classic omega3 to 6 imbalance.</p>
