        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve found it suspicious that the discovery of giant people or humanoids seem to become wiped out and silent after the 1950s. Elongated skulls, found on humans of all sizes and especially the early dynasty of Egypt, was seemingly quite common. Now yes there’s head binding but that doesn’t come from nowhere. They were imitating something. Aleister Crowley said that today ‘they are called demons and tomorrow something else.’ These are the same things, just different words and origins. Maybe the legends of giants and half human hybrids did have basis in fact. What if the aliens aren’t from outer space? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the Smithsonian was established and in the early 20th century there are claims of extraordinary discoveries in the US.  Several giant skeletons were excavated in the Midwest and the specimens were given to the Smithsonian only never to be seen again. Like giants there is another report of an Egyptian artifacts being found in the grand canyon in 1909 by two Smithsonian scientists but again we never saw anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s crazy you bring this up because I also was going down the rabbit hole of giant skeletons being destroyed by the Smithsonian.  There is also that giant elephant rock that a researcher thinks could have been alive at some point.  Or real giant remains inside of Egyptian statues that may explain how the pyramids were built.  That possibly this race of people were destroyed thousands and thousands of years ago.  Really interesting stuff and makes you wonder why the Smithsonian would try to cover all this up.  I haven’t been religious but this stuff could possibly confirm parts of the Bible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The following is just a potential narrative.  Seems compelling to me.</p>

<p>Why would anyone want to cover up knowledge of advanced ancient species?</p>

<p>Monopolized access to knowledge of their existence would imply monopolized access to knowledge of their technology.  UFOs don&#39;t need to be ETs, after all.  It could just be that creatures of terrestrial origin created the technology and those with access to that technology created a narrative in our lives that excluded consideration of the mere possibility of it.  They could have made a bunch of movies about ETs and focused the media on the space-race and the nuclear arms race so nobody would have eyes on archaeology.  First they got us looking up for rockets so we wouldn&#39;t look down for fossils.  Now they got us looking down at smart phones so we won&#39;t look up and engage with one another to solve our problems (or see chemtrails if that&#39;s a real thing lol)!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are the willing fools of space bullies that want to own our race. Since they are useless eater parasites, they seek to achieve imbalanced value exchange relationships. They deceive and coerce in order to overcome the inconvenience of free will.</p>

<p>They want us to have a groomed version o reality where we will fall into similar thinking, feeling and behavior patterns. Their way of life is pure selfishness and competition. They are evil, but evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. They study manipulation of others like we do science. They are masters of illusions and deceptions.</p>

<p>In order to own our race they keep us from knowing certain things that undermine their illusions and set us free of their contrived mental prison.</p>

<p>They want us to believe we are free with multiple options for self-deception, especially false dichotomies. They want us to be subservient to authority via religion.  If we are too inquisitive and honest that won&#39;t work. So, they corrupt science as well. It&#39;s all about managing what we believe, because that governs how we think, feel and act.</p>

<p>If we believe in the status quo, we evolved on this planet without any outside interference. This supports the belief that we are still alone out here in space. Maybe there is life, but it isn&#39;t here, we are lead to believe.</p>

<p>If we believed in these giants, we want to know more and it&#39;s possible they are connected to a larger narrative that includes external interference. If we start to believe we are not alone, we change in ways they don&#39;t want yet.</p>

<p>We seek to understand ourselves in relation to the reality of many other life forms. We adapt toward the opposite of their way of life. We want peace and cooperation with them generally, as evident by observing the sentiment of most people.</p>

<p>We&#39;d be more ripe for contact that way. We already get it. Many people claim to have had contact and they keep giving us similar messages. We are an occupied planet. It is a spiritual conflict. In order to save ourselves we need to take personal responsibility and care for one another.</p>

<p>The useless eaters from space, that are the pied pipers of human useless eaters, prefer us to be the opposite of what we want and the benevolent ETs want. They don&#39;t want us to reciprocate and cooperate. They want us to lie, cheat and steal, because they do it better and they know the can own us if we subscribe to their way of being. It&#39;s how they get their human minions to work for them, reward and punishment, selfishness and fear. They want this for all of us.</p>

<p>They want us to become one with their hive of useless eaters to help them uselessly eat from others as they are doing now. So, they keep us from the truth to groom us for our enslavement and usury. They are a contagious spiritual disease. </p>

<p>Im buddhist, and some texts like the lotus sutra talk about infinite worlds and many different types of beings including the Naga race of shape-shifting  snake humanoids.</p>

<p>Interestingly, buddhism believes in other gods and in one account the Buddha shows the god of this realm that there are realities/worlds that the god himself does not know about. Its all ties together ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re the third race of humans other than the neanderthal that we possess DNA from. They were also a lot bigger than us. They found a molar of a young girl denisovan and it was large compared to a regular tooth. Also I believe they had an albino gene leading to blonde hair and light eyes in Melanesians.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The size of the teeth suggests that the Denisovans had very large jaws and more likely resembled Neanderthals than humans. The team also found that the Denisovans had nearly as much genetic diversity as modern humans, setting them apart from Neanderthals—and modern Melanesian humans have approximately 5 percent of their genome, strongly hinting that they interbred with humans.</p>

<p>there’s little doubt that “large teeth with massive roots would probably require massive jaws,” says Viola.</p>

<p>The new study revealed that Denisovan and neanderthal were not all that similar after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible speaks of giants. It also speaks of angels that came from haven and mated with humans.  God  commanded that the giants be wiped out. I think they were also killed in the great flood, Noah&#39;s Ark. The Bible also mentions unicorns. Start cross referencing things with the Bible and you&#39;ll be amazed what you find.  The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. The first mention of &quot;sons of God&quot; in the Hebrew Bible occurs at Genesis 6:1-4.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1-2 When the human race began to increase, with more and more daughters being born, the sons of God noticed that the daughters of men were beautiful. They looked them over and picked out wives for themselves.</p>

<p>3 Then God said, “I’m not going to breathe life into men and women endlessly. Eventually they’re going to die; from now on they can expect a life span of 120 years.”</p>

<p>4 This was back in the days (and also later) when there were giants in the land. The giants came from the union of the sons of God and the daughters of men. These were the mighty men of ancient lore, the famous ones.</p>
