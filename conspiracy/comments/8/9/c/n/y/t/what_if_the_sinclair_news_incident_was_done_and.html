        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So let&#39;s say Sinclair tipped someone off or made the video or made it themselves. That is a difficult thing to connect the dots on. The idea behind it is to steer the public to the 1-2 &quot;free from them&quot; local news. They are in the middle of buying additional news outlets so only 1-2 are free in many areas. It benefits certain groups, but I haven&#39;t quite figured out that part of the equasion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CNN is international.  It&#39;s one channel, and <em>most</em> everybody.  These are dozens of regional stations who had to be recorded nearly at the same time (barring time zone differences and the stations&#39; indivual timing of programs/format.</p>

<p>I love the video, so I&#39;m not trying to undermine it, but it seems highly likely that some sort of &quot;insider&quot; was privy to what needed to be recorded, or an organization with more resources was behind it.  Sure, an &quot;individual&quot; <em>could</em> have done it, but it would take a lot of expensive or unlikely circumstances coming together to make it so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you are trying to imply? That a lot of people were recording CNN cutting off people, and then someone collected those clips and edited them and spread them around?</p>

<p>Like I said before, Sinclair has been getting a lot of attention the last few years to be a propaganda outlet, and a lot of people know about their plan to buy at least 40% of local news outlets. So people like myself, who are far less lazier, would have every motive to look for stuff like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to record anything on CNN, you just put it on, hit record, and walk away.  It&#39;s easy.  Recording dozens of <em>locally</em> broadcast news stations, from around the country, at the same time, with professionally done editing afterward, requires a lot more computing power and access to all of these stations that I&#39;m not aware of.  Do you know of <em>anybody</em> not in broadcasting who has this kind of setup?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  But doing so many at the same time from so many different places is what makes me wonder.  It would take a decent amount of hardware for a random observer to just be recording all of these stations constantly.  And then looking through any of it to find similar clips would be extremely time consuming, or done with sophisticated software.  Sure, it&#39;s technically possible, but seems unlikely to me.  If there&#39;s a place where all of these news programs are already saved, not just streamed, it would make the &quot;random observer&quot; scenario more feasible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Deadspin editor Tim Burke made the video. Everyone knew the promos were coming because the memo leaked, and the station list is on Wikipedia, so he just did some journalism, found out when the promos ran, and pulled the recorded video feed from each station.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  That would show that it&#39;s someone already in broadcasting, with the resources and expertise, but it&#39;s also a little weird.</p>

<p>Why would someone who works at deadspin spend all this time and energy gathering and editing these clips, and not release it on deadspin?  Doesn&#39;t seem right...  Releasing it with a sockpuppet YouTube account seems a little crazy, and not very... lucrative.  Is there something you&#39;ve seen that &quot;confirms&quot; this, or is it just hearsay?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done a quick search, and seen this claim a few times, but nothing that really backs it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  It was buried in my google search, but I found it too.  I thought it was the YouTube sockpuppet account that first got it rolling.</p>

<p>But having a media outlet working off a cnn &quot;tip&quot; doesn&#39;t really settle the matter either, unfortunately.  It may be astroturfed, but I&#39;m glad that people have the opportunity to see how much of a sham even our &quot;local&quot; American media is.</p>
