       So let's say Sinclair tipped someone off or made the video or made it themselves. That is a difficult thing to connect the dots on. The idea behind it is to steer the public to the 1-2 "free from them" local news. They are in the middle of buying additional news outlets so only 1-2 are free in many areas. It benefits certain groups, but I haven't quite figured out that part of the equasion.

       People have been paying attention to Sinclair for the past year or two now. It's notorious for forcing their news anchors to read must run scripts or force them to air must air promos. It's not exactly difficult to watch the different local news channels and keep an eye for these things.

       CNN is international.  It's one channel, and
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       everybody.  These are dozens of regional stations who had to be recorded nearly at the same time (barring time zone differences and the stations' indivual timing of programs/format.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love the video, so I'm not trying to undermine it, but it seems highly likely that some sort of "insider" was privy to what needed to be recorded, or an organization with more resources was behind it.  Sure, an "individual"
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have done it, but it would take a lot of expensive or unlikely circumstances coming together to make it so.

       I'm not sure what you are trying to imply? That a lot of people were recording CNN cutting off people, and then someone collected those clips and edited them and spread them around?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before, Sinclair has been getting a lot of attention the last few years to be a propaganda outlet, and a lot of people know about their plan to buy at least 40% of local news outlets. So people like myself, who are far less lazier, would have every motive to look for stuff like this.

       If you want to record anything on CNN, you just put it on, hit record, and walk away.  It's easy.  Recording dozens of
       <em>
        locally
       </em>
       broadcast news stations, from around the country, at the same time, with professionally done editing afterward, requires a lot more computing power and access to all of these stations that I'm not aware of.  Do you know of
       <em>
        anybody
       </em>
       not in broadcasting who has this kind of setup?

       Yeah.  But doing so many at the same time from so many different places is what makes me wonder.  It would take a decent amount of hardware for a random observer to just be recording all of these stations constantly.  And then looking through any of it to find similar clips would be extremely time consuming, or done with sophisticated software.  Sure, it's technically possible, but seems unlikely to me.  If there's a place where all of these news programs are already saved, not just streamed, it would make the "random observer" scenario more feasible.

       Deadspin editor Tim Burke made the video. Everyone knew the promos were coming because the memo leaked, and the station list is on Wikipedia, so he just did some journalism, found out when the promos ran, and pulled the recorded video feed from each station.

       Interesting.  That would show that it's someone already in broadcasting, with the resources and expertise, but it's also a little weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would someone who works at deadspin spend all this time and energy gathering and editing these clips, and not release it on deadspin?  Doesn't seem right...  Releasing it with a sockpuppet YouTube account seems a little crazy, and not very... lucrative.  Is there something you've seen that "confirms" this, or is it just hearsay?

       Thanks.  It was buried in my google search, but I found it too.  I thought it was the YouTube sockpuppet account that first got it rolling.

       But having a media outlet working off a cnn "tip" doesn't really settle the matter either, unfortunately.  It may be astroturfed, but I'm glad that people have the opportunity to see how much of a sham even our "local" American media is.

       Yes. In Sinclair's case, it's stuff that comes from corporate headquarters. In CNN or Fox's stuff, it would be content from the executives in the office across the hallway. Are we against it in all cases? Or just Sinclair's case?

       Yeah, for CNN or FOX, everything is must run there. That's different from acquiring 233 independent local news outlets and forcing to run must run scripts that benefit one political party or against another political party.

       The difference is that most people understand that CNN or Fox is proapganda or at a minimum it's partisan biased news. Local news on the other hand is known or seen as reputable and non-biased or partisan.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is trying to hide partisan propaganda as nonpartisan.

       I'm pretty sure most fans of CNN think it is nonpartisan and just factually based. I think FOX fans believe the same.

       What blew me away was how quick those videos took off.  Image first one in r/videos has 50+k votes in 2 hours.  Even here, there was one linking it that, tat had 16k in 2 hours, on a Saturday no less. I'm all for exposing Sinclair, but those numbers and how fast they shot up make me question whether it was coordinated.

       It probably feels off because you're sympathetic to Sinclair's political stance, so don't get how many people have become concerned with them over the last few years and find this video
       <em>
        suuuuuuuuuuper

       Yep. A bit too fast of 'outrage' at something we all already knew.  The whole thing was done on purpose and one crowd took the bait.  Look how quickly it turned into blame on Trump.
