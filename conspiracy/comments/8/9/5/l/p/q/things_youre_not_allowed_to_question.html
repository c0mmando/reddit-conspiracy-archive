    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not the Natives built the ancient mound structures all over North America - even though they show water-erosion from a cataclysmic flood.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Native-American/Prehistory">Among the more popular misconceptions were those holding that the first residents of the continent had been members of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel or refugees from the lost island of Atlantis, that their descendents had developed the so-called Mound Builder culture, and that Native Americans had later overrun and destroyed the Mound Builder civilization. These <strong>erroneous and overtly racist beliefs</strong> were often used to rationalize the destruction or displacement of indigenous Americans. Such beliefs were not dispelled until the 1890s, when Cyrus Thomas, a pioneering archaeologist employed by the Smithsonian Institution, demonstrated conclusively that the great effigy mounds, burial mounds, and temple mounds of the Northeast and Southeast culture areas had been built by Native Americans.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one kind of cracks me up. The Flat Earth thing comes up a lot here. There is more than one reason things get downvoted to oblivion here, and in this case there&#39;s nothing sinister about people thinking a dumb idea is dumb. I&#39;m not trying to be rude to people who don&#39;t understand that planets are balls, because I understand the feeling of believing something which people consider impossible or unbelievable.  </p>

<p>However, in this particular case, we have a strange confluence of issues. One issue is that average people can and do carry out experiments to examine the shape of the Earth. For example, you can drive around in your car for a day or two and measure the curvature of the Earth using only trigonometry and simple instruments. Basic geometry tells us that this curvature is consistent with a sphere. You can literally take an aerial tour of Antarctica for $1200 (+ the cost of getting to Australia). People have flown around the world and there&#39;s nothing in principle stopping any of you (other than expense and difficulty) from experiencing this for yourself. You don&#39;t have to be an astronaut to see the Earth is a ball, but they obviously have no doubts that the Earth is a ball. People send cameras up in high altitude balloons and on homemade rockets. It&#39;s something which couldn&#39;t be suppressed because there are so many simple ways to see that it&#39;s not flat nor a dome. 100% of the arguments for the theory are simple misunderstandings of basic scientific principles.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, we also have the CIA psyop angle. Flat Earth is a theory which was intentionally propagated by the CIA as a disinformation experiment. They wanted something which shouldn&#39;t be believable because it contradicts such a massive body of evidence. They wanted to see if they could get people to believe it anyway. This serves two purposes. One is experimental. They have a test case to understand how well they can seed bad information into the public. The other is to discredit conspiracy communities and conspiracy theorists in general by associating them with a theory which is devoid of reason. This is the biggest reason why you see pushback here against Flat Earth theories. </p>

My main point was to bring up the known CIA influence in propagating the Flat Earth theory. If you are actually interested in discussing the details below, feel free to continue in PM or anther thread.  </p>

<p>However, nearly everything else you said was completely wrong.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking of the cruises, because you can&#39;t really see penguins from 10,000 feet. However, the flights go into the Antarctic continent following the Transantarctic Mountains. There are also non-stop commericial flights which circumnavigate the globe by going around the coast of Antarctica, taking advantage of the fast winds which encircle the continent.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually it&#39;s called the Antarctic treaty. You need to get permission from the a UN body to go exploring in the Antarctic. so, not sure what the fuck you&#39;re talking about.  </p>

<p>Anyway, you misunderstood me here as well. When I said there&#39;s nothing stopping you (other than expense and difficulty) from flying around the world, I wasn&#39;t talking about Antarctica. People have flown around the Equator, for example, and it&#39;s a circle which requires no left-right turning to follow.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>actually, you do! No one has seen the ball earth but for &quot;ASStroNUTZ&quot;  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is ignoring the simple fact that hundreds of robotic spacecraft from dozens of independent agencies and now private companies around the world have all taken pictures of the Earth (I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t trust NASA, but they aren&#39;t the only game in town). Turns out it&#39;s a blob of matter just like every other blob of matter we see in space.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>exactly! it&#39;s flat as fuck! you can tell even with the use of fish eye.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, wrong again. Yes, you can see the curvature from a high-altitude balloon. Fish-eye lenses actually produce false curvature. However, rectilinear correction and true rectilinear optical devices both consistently show the same curvature. The curvature is not very severe since you are only a few miles up on a gigantic ball, but it&#39;s visible to the naked eye.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>exactly. just using the sensors in your phone you can see for yourself that the earth DOES NOT MOVE and thats why it&#39;s spreading like wild fire.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is asinine and perhaps just trolling. The sensors detect acceleration and they are already calibrated for gravity. You are moving along with the surface of the Earth at a near constant velocity. Have you ever tried jumping on a train? Works fine. Is the train not moving? Really though, think about the way air currents work. Most of the atmosphere rotates roughly with the planet just like us, and the constant friction with the Earth and resultant mixing of boundary layers is partially responsible for generating weather variation. The upper atmosphere is more independent due to lower air pressure and friction and so it can appear to move at a high velocity relative to the lower atmosphere. The jet streams are the way they are <em>because of</em> the rotation of the Earth, via the Coriolis effect.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can buy simple zoom lens and watch the ships &quot;disappear&quot; behind the curve and then watch them pop up like magic using a zoom lens.  </p>

<p>This is just plain wrong again. Really, have you ever watched a sunset? Do you understand that you are literally watching the Sun go <em>over</em> the horizon? It&#39;s not moving way off and disappearing into the distance, you literally watch the horizon obscure the disk of the Sun. From our perspective, the Sun appears to be going behind the Earth. At night, you are in the Earth&#39;s shadow. Watch the next lunar eclipse and you can watch the moon enter the disk-shaped shadow of the Earth. </p>

<p>How about <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/QFA28/10ebc6d2">Santiago to Sydney</a>? Click the &quot;show route&quot; button in the bottom left corner. Notice how they skirt Antarctica just as I claimed? The Flat Earth model doesn&#39;t support flights like this, however you can go book one yourself for under $1,000. You could probably charter a flight directly from Santiago to Perth, if you really wanted to. Hell, you can charter flights right over the South Pole for the right price.  </p>

<p>If so, you would constantly be turning along that circle. To circumnavigate the globe along the Equator, all you do is maintain your heading. No turning at all.  </p>

<p>I know plenty about perspective and &quot;the vanishing point&quot;. It&#39;s extremely likely that I understand projective geometry better than you. What you are describing cannot explain the disk of the sun being cut in half from our perspective. When the Sun sets, eventually there is rock between you and the Sun and consequently it becomes dark. If you go up in a balloon or on a mountain, the Sun actually sets slightly later.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, about the ones that blink. Do satellites have a blinking light? If so why? Planes have light because they are going to land and take off. They need to be visible. Why would a communication satellite have a blinking light?  I&#39;m sure a light that is visible from earth must use a lot of energy! They get that from the solar panels?  Think Mcfly. think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they have lights on them. As they rotate or tumble in orbit, reflective surfaces catch light at regular intervals and so they appear to blink. If they are in the right part of their orbit, they may even be catching intense sunlight since the Sun hasn&#39;t yet set at their altitude even though it has set from your perspective.</p>

<p>Keeping time down to the second or even minute is not necessary to perform similar experiments with sufficient accuracy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That trick would also work if the earth was not 93 million miles away. sorry chap. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re thinking of the cruises, because you can&#39;t really see penguins from 10,000 feet. However, the flights go into the Antarctic continent following the Transantarctic Mountains. There are also non-stop commericial flights which circumnavigate the globe by going around the coast of Antarctica, taking advantage of the fast winds which encircle the continent. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny you mention that. Flight paths tell the truth. find a non stop flight from Santiago to Perth. From Sydney to Capetown. good luck. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyway, you misunderstood me here as well. When I said there&#39;s nothing stopping you (other than expense and difficulty) from flying around the world, I wasn&#39;t talking about Antarctica. People have flown around the Equator, for example, and it&#39;s a circle which requires no left-right turning to follow. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your compass points north and thats the center of the map, then you can just head east,  go in a circle and you&#39;ll end up where you started. tadaaa. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is ignoring the simple fact that hundreds of robotic spacecraft from dozens of independent agencies and now private companies around the world have all taken pictures of the Earth (I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t trust NASA, but they aren&#39;t the only game in town). Turns out it&#39;s a blob of matter just like every other blob of matter we see in space. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats cute. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE PHOTO OF EARTH FROM SPACE, that is not a composite! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorry, wrong again. Yes, you can see the curvature from a high-altitude balloon. Fish-eye lenses actually produce false curvature. However, rectilinear correction and true rectilinear optical devices both consistently show the same curvature. The curvature is not very severe since you are only a few miles up on a gigantic ball, but it&#39;s visible to the naked eye. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>wrong!  <a href="https://youtu.be/iAlS70Onn2I?t=515">https://youtu.be/iAlS70Onn2I?t=515</a>  there is no curve! it&#39;s flat!! just fucking look at it! People tell me they see curve from a plane at 30K feet. This is 117K. no curve! this shows you how brain-washed people are. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is asinine and perhaps just trolling. The sensors detect acceleration and they are already calibrated for gravity. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about acceleration.  You have a gyroscope in your pocket. Gyro doesn&#39;t give a shit about gravity. Rigidity in space. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are moving along with the surface of the Earth at a near constant velocity. Have you ever tried jumping on a train?Works fine. Is the train not moving? Really though, think about the way air currents work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>train is going a stright line at a fixed speed. Have you tried to jump on one of those teapot rides in Disneyland? the ones that spin around themselves while the fly around the center? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the atmosphere rotates roughly with the planet just like us, and the constant friction with the Earth and resultant mixing of boundary layers is partially responsible for generating weather variation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only explanation!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The upper atmosphere is more independent due to lower air pressure and friction and so it can appear to move at a high velocity relative to the lower atmosphere. The jet streams are the way they are because of the rotation of the Earth, via the Coriolis effect. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh the good old coriolis effect. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is just plain wrong again. Really, have you ever watched a sunset? Do you understand that you are literally watching the Sun go over the horizon? It&#39;s not moving way off and disappearing into the distance, you literally watch the horizon obscure the disk of the Sun. From our perspective, the Sun appears to be going behind the Earth. At night, you are in the Earth&#39;s shadow. Watch the next lunar eclipse and you can watch the moon enter the disk-shaped shadow of the Earth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s all perspective and something called the vanishing point.  I&#39;d send you videos explaining it using practical evidence, but you wouln&#39;t watch them so i&#39;ll save my time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Idiots? No, I don&#39;t believe that, at least not in most cases. Badly mislead in part by CIA propaganda? Yes, certainly. Anyway, this probably wasn&#39;t worth my time, but it&#39;s always an entertaining debate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes, the Flat earth society is a BS and propaganda to explain flat earth in a retarded manner to keep people away. </p>
