       No, it's just now "magically" hitting r/all regularly, which it has never, ever done in this manner until very, very recently.

       Shareblue aka Correct the Record aka David Brock's baby has a $40 million budget to literally correct the record online. I don't think there's evidence of them botting on Reddit, but you have to think some of the budget is going here.

       ShareBlue doesn't have bot farms. All it is is just David Brock and a couple young Haitian boys in an old office building previously used by Hillary's campaign with a hundred or so cubicles set up with PC's. David and the boys scramble to a fro as fast as possible while frantically trying to remember which sock-puppet user name belongs to which cubicle and manically hammering on the keyboards to get the propaganda where it needs to be. Those Trump/Stormy Daniels articles don't just fall from the sky you know. Think that 40 million went to good use? It went straight into David Brock's pocket at which point he adopted those two young Haitian boys and made them "interns" and then invested the rest of the money into a giant pile of cocaine which sits on the floor in the middle of their break room. When any of the ShareBlue team starts feeling a little worn down they just head to the break room and dive naked head first into that giant pile of coke and swim around for awhile until they get their energy back up and then it's right back to work. David and the boys feed those hundred or so computers with DNC propaganda 24/7 and only take a little time away for themselves when David has a heart attack, needs a blow job or feels like ordering a pizza.

       It’s politics in general. Politics is a farce. A distraction. A parade of false idols across our tv screen designed to dumb us down and hand over our free will. We don’t need a single one of these politicians. You and I will do far more good for our neighbors than any of these puppets

       I actually thought this was common practice to regularly delete accounts. When I go back to old threads from years ago I see a ton of [deleted] where the username would be. This is site-wide actually, not just one sub.

       Yeah, it sounds silly to say but I actually fell into a mini depression to see this sub go to absolute shit over the presidential bullshit. It was so awesome before, a true golden age of awakening, and I learned a lot. There was always a fun, interesting or downright bizarre thread you could read. And then came the fucking Clinton posts that flooded the sub for months. I would count them. I got 13 threads on the front page of the sub once!
      </p>
      <p>
       What hurt the most is that only very few people seemed to notice and lash out. It seemed that most just went with it. It's like I was going crazy. How were these the same people who would say all world events were orchestrated, that all politicians actually go to the same after-party, that the political parties are just two sides of the same coin, that there was a hidden agenda and it was our task to be wary of it. But now they were believing it all and turning into fan boys. It made me angry and bitter to see it all collapse.

       They're there to detail conversation, and to ensure that certain comments sit at 0 all day, I personally watched a comment of mine get 1 downvote for every upvote for almost 4 hours yesterday. It's so obvious it hurts. They hang around for all sorts of topics- and a lot of them are simply bots that are here and waiting for a command to wake up.

       That's vote fuzzying. Reddit changes the number you see every refresh. The newer the comment and more activity make it more fuzzied. Your commebnt most likely had few or no votes.

       Oh no. I watched the total tick up on my actual Karma count as well, and then tick down. Vote fuzzing doesn't effect the Karma count on my account, just the individual comment.

       It's hard to flush out the ones that are only there for downvoting, those who comment are a bit more obvious. I think everyone should get RES as well and start tagging people up- it helps with keeping track of consistency and it also tracks your upvote/downvote totals for particular users.

       Doesn't mean we should jettison the whole term. It is a powerful word and one I continue to use and encourage others to use to describe these Elites who participate in this stuff. I've never called a Trans person degenerate but just because someone else has doesn't mean the word is unable to be used.

       I disagree. I think it is an excellent term and only a select few people on the internet would consider it a dog whistle. It was used widely in older media from the 60's/70's as well. I will continue to use it because it is a powerful word that encapsulates the reality of our Elites and their fucked up practices. They are true degenerates.

       They're not all shills. There are bots as well.
       <br/>
       In fact it's starting to look like at least one of the shill centers (like
       <a href="http://washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">
        Eglin AFB
       </a>
       ) is running a powerful bot network (assisted by shills) that essentially reconstructs reddit through vote manipulation (especially popular subs &amp; subs that pose a problem for the PTB) .

       ever got posted, somebodies would downvote it and post a bunch of nonsense immediately afterwards just to bury it.

       It's seriously the best. Once I started browsing by /new I could never go back to /hot. Too good of convo and it's honestly just too damn fun lol. One day I was absolutely disgusted by what /hot had to offer, and I said to myself "There's no way r/con is that far gone", so I went over to the /new tab and after just one night of drunken redditing I was hooked. Now I don't even browse /hot, I go to /new as soon as I visit r/con and I just sit there in the que and refresh all night :P

       The one problem with /new is that unless you're browsing the entire day's worth of posts anyway, you're only going to see a few hours worth. Still better than /hot, but less than ideal.

       No, they're demonstrably lies. You don't think CA would micro-politicize any population whose candidate paid them enough? You don't think the right is just as bought and paid for as the left? You don't think this charade yields enough credibility-killing for all parties that actually call themselves political? If you think any geopolitical fodder like these canned talking-points deliver can come anywhere close to "truth" these days, I apologize both to you and for you.

       You stay focused. I have stayed so close to the political vacuum called the "sane middle" my entire time here. It's about the left because you, or somebody you work for, launched an all-out attack, made headway, and then went too far and precipitated this counterattack - exactly what could be expected. Meanwhile almost no important conspiracy progress can be seen in this conspiracy sub. J'accuse!

       Yes they are. The "left" you're trying to refer to doesn't exist anymore. In fact, keep going backwards in time and the oldest "Liberals" you'll find are nearly identical to modern Libertarians.

       back in 2015 I found my way here looking into clinton dirt, and after the San Bernardino shooting I called it a second home.  Used to have fun discussions free and crazy, and get recommendations regularly.  But not anymore.... Quick shutdowns, downvotings, and enough party bias here to cover-up a million hooker murders.

      <p>
       this place isn't anything like it used to be. there's comparatively no content covering actual, verified conspiracies here, and the increased participation in theater of american politics (organic or not) has turned a lot of the discussion into a bunch of defensive "my team vs your team" bullshit

      <p>
       i absorbed a lot of verifiable, documented information on heinous and duplicitous activities carried out by various groups across time because of this subreddit. that knowledge has fundamentally shaped my current worldview, and i doubt i'll ever be able to unthink a lot of the conclusions i've come to as a result of learning about these happenings.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean, i guess it's time to focus on sharing that information in real life. i've spent enough time sharing it here, right?

       The real life sharing is tough.  I find I have to do it with jokes, or start comments with, "conspiracy theorists are saying".  More of a "I read everything true or false" approach.  And hopefully they can decide for themselves like I already have.   Still tough though.

       Depending on the post you get a large amount of the trumpets or libtards, now with Israel, you have pro-israel people defending here (like myself) so it inflates the numbers. I’m a lurker 99% of the time but with the recent violence I’ve been posting. Mostly because the blatantly sensationalized headlines bordering on propaganda.

       New to this town and started seeing this guy and not many people knew we had been talking and one day we were at this bar and this well known woman and her husband (their kids to go school with my little brother) came over and basically propositioned him. The wife wanted to fuck him and the husband was there to say he was okay with it. I didn't know what was going on at first and after he told me when he left I was so grossed out. Apparently since, they've invited him on messenger to go on day outings with their kids to the beach and zoo and such to "get to know the family" so he's more comfortable with them all.

       It's not worldwide in the sense that its popularity isn't as WIDE  as  you think it is. It may be popular in some countries besides the US and countries in Europe but not to the degree  you've assumed it is. Look up the demographics for reason's sake. And I suggest that you to stop playing the 'bots' card.

       When the rest of reddit is shit then people start going to more obscure subs, especially this one. This is a great sub to whine about opressive reddit so the masses who are getting blanket banned are coming here as reddit shoots itself in the head.

       No, they're demonstrably lies. You don't think CA would micro-politicize any population whose candidate paid them enough? You don't think the right is just as bought and paid for as the left? You don't think this charade yields enough credibility-killing for all parties that actually call themselves political? If you think any geopolitical fodder like these canned talking-points deliver can come anywhere close to "truth" these days, I apologize both to you and for you.

       They're there to detail conversation, and to ensure that certain comments sit at 0 all day, I personally watched a comment of mine get 1 downvote for every upvote for almost 4 hours yesterday. It's so obvious it hurts. They hang around for all sorts of topics- and a lot of them are simply bots that are here and waiting for a command to wake up.

       It's seriously the best. Once I started browsing by /new I could never go back to /hot. Too good of convo and it's honestly just too damn fun lol. One day I was absolutely disgusted by what /hot had to offer, and I said to myself "There's no way r/con is that far gone", so I went over to the /new tab and after just one night of drunken redditing I was hooked. Now I don't even browse /hot, I go to /new as soon as I visit r/con and I just sit there in the que and refresh all night :P

       The one problem with /new is that unless you're browsing the entire day's worth of posts anyway, you're only going to see a few hours worth. Still better than /hot, but less than ideal.

       In fact it's starting to look like at least one of the shill centers (like

       Yeah, it sounds silly to say but I actually fell into a mini depression to see this sub go to absolute shit over the presidential bullshit. It was so awesome before, a true golden age of awakening, and I learned a lot. There was always a fun, interesting or downright bizarre thread you could read. And then came the fucking Clinton posts that flooded the sub for months. I would count them. I got 13 threads on the front page of the sub once!

       What hurt the most is that only very few people seemed to notice and lash out. It seemed that most just went with it. It's like I was going crazy. How were these the same people who would say all world events were orchestrated, that all politicians actually go to the same after-party, that the political parties are just two sides of the same coin, that there was a hidden agenda and it was our task to be wary of it. But now they were believing it all and turning into fan boys. It made me angry and bitter to see it all collapse.

       I disagree. I think it is an excellent term and only a select few people on the internet would consider it a dog whistle. It was used widely in older media from the 60's/70's as well. I will continue to use it because it is a powerful word that encapsulates the reality of our Elites and their fucked up practices. They are true degenerates.
