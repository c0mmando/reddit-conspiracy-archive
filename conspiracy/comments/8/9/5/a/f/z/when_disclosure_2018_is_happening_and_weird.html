       Ok, so like many people I've been excited about what has been termed Disclosure 2018. I thought I'd just swing the old Google Earth maps over to what had been considered highly provocative locations, one being the Denver International Airport when I was hella surprised to see the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://earth.google.com/web/@39.82210106,-104.6684159,1653.21762343a,2370.29372642d,35y,-89.68646442h,5.26949136t,0r">
        https://earth.google.com/web/@39.82210106,-104.6684159,1653.21762343a,2370.29372642d,35y,-89.68646442h,5.26949136t,0r
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, that is pattern you are seeing is a face. But the real question is why? People do not randomly park hundreds of cars to make patterns of faces in the parking lot, so what gives??
      </p>
      <p>
       I called the number on the website for this parking lot (
       <a href="https://www.flydenver.com/parking_transit/parking/mt_elbert_shuttle_lot">
        https://www.flydenver.com/parking_transit/parking/mt_elbert_shuttle_lot
       </a>
       ), walked the lady through to clicking the Google Maps link on their page, and she tells me she sees no pattern. I attempted to help her, but it was clear to me, she wasn't interested in seeing what to me was plain and obvious (hundreds of cars arranged in such a way as to make the pattern of a face (this isn't a coincidence at all)). With no other mention of this anywhere else on the internet, I thought I'd present my argument, with evidence to Reddit, so that it can be further examined.

       I went there only because I heard about many conspiracies coming from that place, I just didn't expect to see what I was seeing. In my opinion, I see the pattern of a face, seems like it took a lot of effort and coordination as well, as this isn't just a coincidence, someone wanted this to be visible.

      <p>
       2 if you zoom inthe cards seem to be pretty logically parked around certain features of the parking lot,  which are symmetrical giving a symmetrical pattern too

        Considering that this airport has gone so far as to give tours for the purpose of debunking information, it wouldn't be far fetched for their employees to be playing a prank. I called to see if that was the case. The lady wasn't rude and she didn't hang up because she could see she was speaking with someone intelligent and reasonable, simply asking a basic question.

       Had I presented zero evidence, someone might lean in that direction, but clearly there is a pattern present with symmetry and more. When presenting clear evidence along with my question, its not crazy, seems reasonable to ask and be curious.

       I've parked here a few times and this is what I think is going on. If you zoom in, you'll see 6 gray rectangles evenly spaced out. Each is the roof of a covered bus stop. Buses come through the lot and shuttle customers to the airport. They start at the entrance, which is the bottom of your image. One bus runs up each lane of road, so most customers are going to want to park as close as they can to those first two bus shelters as they'll be picked up soonest. You can see the widest part of the "face" is the row that has the first two shelters. It makes sense that the most cars would park here and there would be slightly fewer cars per row as you get further from the shelters. Then, the spaces near the next two shelters will start to fill up in the same way, which is what's happening in the image. The furthest two bus shelters have no cars parked near them yet, but I bet if you'd have checked a few hours later, you'd have a similar round pattern, but with more cars at the middle and top shelters.

       You're making an assumption that everyone is trying to park in some desirable location. I would argue that many would simply park and go, not understanding the layout or preferred locations, because they don't work there, they are just traveling. I'm open minded to what you are telling me, especially having been there first hand yourself, but nothing you said takes away from what is visible, and for myself,  your explanation was kinda lacking. Too much symmetry, too many organized cars.

       Yes, it's definitely an assumption, but based on my experience parking there, those two shelters fill up quickest being closest to the entrance and also the first to get picked up so you're more likely to get seats on the shuttle and have space to stow your luggage. There are a few straggler cars outside of this pattern that show what you said: that some people don't understand the layout. We are both making assumptions- mine being that people want to park in a desirable location and yours being that employees for some reason went in and parked a bunch of cars in some not quite face shape for unknown reasons.

       This is what I came here to post. The cars are obviously clustered around the bus shelters with most of the cars being very close to the main road/entrance leading to the parking lot so that section fills up first. The second clusters of cars are at the next closest set of bus shelters (less desirable parking but still better than being very far from a bus shelter). As this parking lot fills I would expect the middle to start looking like the bottom and the next set of bus shelters to start looking like the middle. People don't typically make the most efficient choices they follow the path of least resistance as well as copying what others do. Some people will break the mold and park outside the heard.... if you look at the bus stops up at the very top you'll see a few people have chosen to park next to those or maybe they parked there when the lot was more full and haven't left yet.
