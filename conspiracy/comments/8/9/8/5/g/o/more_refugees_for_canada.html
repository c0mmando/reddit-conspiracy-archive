       For what? My own opinion or the fact that historically Canada has always been willing to help refugees. We don't really care what colour your skin is or where your from, just don't be a dick and follow the rules... It does help that we have a very strict vetting process for immigrants and refugees

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Six-in-10 Canadians chose “disagree” when asked the question “Are immigration levels too high?” in the February survey by the Environics Institute for Survey Research – a finding that has remained relatively stable for a decade. Eight-in-10 said immigrants have a positive economic impact. Compared with last year’s survey, more respondents believed that immigrants adopt Canadian values. Most of the national results extended a steady 30-year trend toward greater acceptance of immigrants.

       Mines from this year, neither of those are. We can sit here all day and find articles. Are you saying most Canadians don't support immigrants and taking in refugees? Canada has done stuff like this going back to the underground railroad... And besides all that the OP never even posted an article! Why don't you ask him for a source

       How about assimilating into there culture? What's the point of coming to a new country if all you do is cloister yourself in little communities of your own…continuing to solely speak your native language, eschewing new customs and not assimilating into your new culture?
      </p>

       Might as well have stayed where you were…but they probably don't offer handouts there.

       We dont have problems with assimilation, having strict vetting process helps with this as well as offering the resources to get new Canadians started. Refugees don't have to assimilate since they are only granted temporary stay...

       Hey look, meat-head…I'm fn Canadian too and you don't fn speak for all of us regardless how condescending you act. What's more…you couldn't possibly be aware enough of all immigrant communities around the country to make a blanket statement like "we have no assimilation problem".
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is, since these immigrants are being booted from Israel and shuffled here instead you may have just a tiny bit of bias for the chosen people.

       If you give a shit look up the demographics of Richmond and see for yourself.

       That's why I went and got data to support my claim. It's undeniable that Canada has always supported helping refugees ever since the underground railroad

       Check the article I posted to someone else, I can send it to you again. My only assertion is that Canada as a whole is pro immigration and we have historically helped refugees.. I don't see what's so controversial about that

       I guess it depends what we mean by assimilation problems, language barriers happen but I don't think that's a big problem

       Lol this is the most ignorant shit I've seen all year. Yes it'd the NATIVES that need to assimilate to us, never mind all the decades of preventing them from doing so on top of invading this land from the get go

       What province do you live in? I personally find many immigrants (since you don’t believe Refugess should have to) do have an issue with assimilation.. along with rudeness.. I can’t grasp the rudeness.

       Incoming anecdotal story!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know a guy, an immigrant from Ireland, came to BC at 3 months, never got his immigration. Well he decides to rob a few banks. Was notorious back in the 80s
      </p>
      <p>
       He gets caught and does time. Parole comes up and they notice then that he is a landed immigrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       They ship him to Ireland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short he gets a gig as a bouncer by when shit hits the fan he assualt a guy and last I heard he was doing time there.

       No we really aren’t ok with it. My parents are legal immigrants to Canada and they’re sick of it too. Refugees depend on government handouts in this day and age, pre 80s it depended on hard work and sweat. You’re either not a minority, or a sjw.  Quit reading your local liberal news and open your eyes to what’s really going on.

       "we" as a country, currently and historically have been welcoming of immigrants and refugees. I'm neither a minority nor am I a SJW... How about you quit being misinformed and stop telling people to open their eyes, that's childish

       “We as a country” is a collectivist statement from the beginning. And the Canadian government turned away Jewish immigrants in the 30s and 40s. Quebec laws and culture are often hostile towards immigration (specifically Muslim). “We as a country” is basically a useless phrase in country as geographically spread out and culturally diverse as Canada.
