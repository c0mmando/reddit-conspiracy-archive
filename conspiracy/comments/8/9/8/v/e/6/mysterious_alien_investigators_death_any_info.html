In the trailers it would say stuff about &quot;groundbreaking evidence&quot; or just about have proof aliens are real.I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it but the day before it was supposed to release he mysteriously died and the show was never released. Nobody has talked about it and I can&#39;t really find anything about do you guys have any ideas or remember this at all sorry for the crappy punctuation not too focused on that right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>he was a supposed &quot;super soldier&quot;. from what I recall leading up to his death the people he was living with were real dodgy and forcing him to make the videos. in his last video you could hear the interviewer forcing him to stay awake while the poor guy was probably nodding off from heroin. not sure what the outcome of it all is now but at the time there was a group of people trying to get the police to arrest/interview the interviewer / people he was living with.</p>
