        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">100</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ThrowawayTroog.html">ThrowawayTroog</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After the hit facebook took and how stories about Russia&#39;s interference in Reddit have seen a recent uptick, I cannot help but hypothesize this title.</p>

<p>Are we seeing less leaks?  Yes.  Any leaks coming through now are false and/or compromised.  Are we seeing a narrowing down of thought on the internet into left vs. right political thought?  Yes.  Virtually all news reports feed into this.  Are we seeing an increase of online Russian troll talk?  Yes.  They are being solely blamed for what can only be considered a common goal among many parties.</p>

<p>The reason for the backlash on social media is that information deemed too sensitive and disruptive has been leaked to the public since the turn of the century, and that markets are clawing back for increased digital ownership rights.</p>

<p>&quot;The Russians&quot; in this scenario is all of us on social media.  We are the threat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I cannot see this recent trend being reversed, as it is just a natural, publicly-supported reaction to overzealous social movements started in social media&#39;s infancy, and &quot;the Russian threat&quot; combined with Trump does serve to unify millennials against a more palatable enemy than &quot;the government&quot; or &quot;the establishment.&quot;</p>

<p>All I can do is hypothesize that if this trend continues we&#39;ll see a wave of folks abandoning compromised social media platforms to other ones, and if the internet itself is fully compromised, then it will be abandoned en masse too, and another one will be created, if this has not happened already.  These are events that the markets will have to consider, and will have to take positive instead of negative action to prevent in our democratic system.  I believe they have been taking positive action to certain degrees, but it is still nonetheless a bit of a concern on how current information is being actively and increasingly compromised and/or funneled into left vs. right political thought.</p>

<p>Perhaps this will all be made irrelevant through the adaptation of more advanced information technology in the long run.</p>

<p>The web is world wide, but on it we&#39;re all pretty much assumed to be American citizens. Political parties of the world are very different to the American republican/democrat system, and not everything can be boiled down to republicans vs democrats, each reacting to the other. Not that I&#39;m saying that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing, just I see it everywhere online. Global issues spoken about in the vernacular of American politics. It&#39;s regressive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Words from an <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-12-05/how-stand-kremlin">essay</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden">Joe Biden</a> and <a href="http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/michael-carpenter">Michael Carpenter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the Soviet Union, however, contemporary Russia offers no clear ideological alternative to Western democracy. Russia’s leaders invoke nationalist, populist, and statist slogans or themes, but the Kremlin’s propaganda machine shies away from directly challenging the core precepts of Western democracy: competitive elections, accountability for those in power, constitutionally guaranteed rights, and the rule of law. Instead, the Kremlin carefully cultivates a democratic façade, paying lip service to those principles even as it subverts them. Thus, it grants nominal opposition parties representation in the Russian parliament but thoroughly co-opts and controls them. It allows independent media to operate (although not in broadcast television), but journalists are regularly threatened and sometimes beaten or killed if they report on taboo subjects. <strong>It permits civil society groups to exist but brands them as “foreign agents” and crushes them if they demonstrate political independence.</strong> It oversees a vast repressive apparatus—recently augmented by the creation of a new National Guard force of around 350,000 members—to deter and respond to dissent. In short, Russia’s leaders have built a Potemkin democracy in which democratic form masks authoritarian content. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bold emphasis added.</p>

<p>We fail to stand up to the Kremlin by emulating it. Civil discourse in our society has become a rarity. Shill accusations shut down communication online before meaningful dialogue can begin. I see ourselves becoming more and more like the Russia Joe Biden warns us of, every day. It is painful to witness. We need to restore open dialogue in order to reemerge from the political echo chambers that we have all inadvertently wandered into. I believe that <em>the people</em> of both Russia and the United States face a common enemy, and that enemy is <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2314.html">Truth Decay</a>---and all those who seek to benefit through its continuing acceleration and exploitation.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Deutsch">Karl Deutsch</a>, perhaps prophetically, outlined the hazards of the current ongoing errosion of our information ecosystem in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SbVOmQEACAAJ">The Nerves of Government</a> back in the 1960s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>AUTONOMY AND THE LOCATION OF CONTROL</strong></p>

<p>More complex systems can change their goals, or &quot;reset&quot; their feedbacks, by interaction with information from their past, stored in particular memory devices. There, autonomy in the long run depends on memory. Where all memory is lost, where all past information and preferences have ceased to be effective, we are no longer dealing with a self-determining individual or social group, but with a self-steering automaton. The facilities for memory storage, and particularly the circuits of channels for recall, recombination, new storage, and reapplication of memory data are critical here. There is no will, no conation, without some operating memory. The will of individuals or groups can be paralyzed by destroying their stored past information or by disrupting its flow into the system.</p>

<p>Still more complex networks may include processes of &quot;consciousness,&quot; or internal monitoring of certain states of the net. Where consciousness exists to a sufficient extent, there it becomes a determining element in the over-all behavior of the system. The critical locations for autonomy are then the monitoring channels and the pools of information fed by them, which together carry the function of consciousness. The autonomy of an individual, a corporation, a social group, a party, or a government can be destroyed, without impairing its memory, by depriving it of consciousness, that is, by cutting the flow of information about the state of its different parts, and disrupting those controls over its own parts that depended on such internal information. Where this has occurred, gross automatic feedback controls may still function, as may the recall and feedback of some remembered data from the past, but the over-all effect might at best resemble that of a man &quot;punch-drunk,&quot; or walking in his sleep, or a victim of severe brain injury.</p>

<p>A society or community that is to steer itself must continue to receive a full flow of three kinds of information: first, information about the world outside; second, information from the past, with a wide range of recall and recombination; and third, information about itself and its own parts. Let any one of these three streams be long interrupted, such as by oppression or secrecy, and the society becomes an automaton, a walking corpse. It loses control over its own behavior, not only for some of its parts, but also eventually at its very top.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Order_(book)">World Order</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>, meanwhile, offers similar insight (2014) regarding the delicate interplay between domestic politics and foreign policy in our modern information ecosystem today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Side by side with the limitless possibilities opened up by the new technologies, reflection about international order must include the internal dangers of societies driven by mass consensus, deprived of the context and foresight needed on terms compatible with their historical character. In every other era, this has been considered the essence of leadership; in our own, it risks being reduced to a series of slogans design to capture immediate short-term approbation. Foreign policy is in danger of turning into a subdivision of domestic politics instead of an exercise in shaping the future. If the major countries conduct their policies in this manner internally, their relations on the international stage will suffer concomitant distortions. The search for perspective may well be replaced by a hardening of differences, statesmanship by posturing. As diplomacy is transformed into gestures geared toward passions, the search for equilibrium risks giving way to a testing of limits.</p>

<p>Wisdom and foresight will be needed to avoid these hazards and ensure that the technological preoccupation with the immediate through a better understanding of history and geography. That task is not only---or even primarily---an issue for technology. Society needs to adapt its education policy to ultimate imperatives in the long-term direction of the country and in the cultivation of its values. The inventors of the devices that have so revolutionized the collection and sharing of information can make an equal if not greater contribution by devising means to deepen its conceptual foundation. On the way to the first truly global world order, the great human achievements of technology must be fused with enhanced powers of humane, transcendent, and geopolitical judgment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol3_2/virilio.htm">We need truth</a> in order to orient society---if we are to have any hope of surviving---and yet, real limitations and hazards exist in its exposure. Both truth and falsehood can be destructive. Modern technology has enabled information to be <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download">weaponized</a> in radical new forms, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259">not infrequently by accident</a>, in manners that we still to this day lack cultural foundation to confront. It may be valuable to consider truth an exfoliant capable of washing away falsehoods that occlude perception and impede our ability to self-steer; it is vital. A real risk exists, nonetheless, of bad actors seeking to jam the head of society into truth configured to operate as a belt sander. If destabilizing society sounds like a good idea to you, then consider the fallout of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring#Results">Arab Spring</a>; truth and justice are not what fill power vacuums.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks represents both a public benefit and a public threat. We should seek to maximize the benefit and minimize the threat. We can fight WikiLeaks by improving our whistleblower and transparency systems, while investing in privacy enhancing technologies. If WikiLeaks is the best option would be whistleblowers can identify, then that ultimately represents a failure of our own national security policy, and again leaves us vulnerable to malicious foreign actors.</p>

<p>We need to bring truth home.</p>
