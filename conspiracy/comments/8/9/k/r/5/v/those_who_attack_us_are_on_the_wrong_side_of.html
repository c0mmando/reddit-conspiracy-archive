<p>At the moment it say 9.0k views, but if you take into account all the people who read the title without clicking the link, it could be more than 10k being redpilled about the criminal corruption in America.</p>

<p>Dear users of r/topmindsofreddit: you failed. You will always fail. Every day people are becoming more and more interested in conspiracy theories about the deepstate. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you harass conspiracy users, you can&#39;t stop the tsunami of truth.</p>

<h1>In the future retroactive laws will be passed to make lying to the American people about Government crime and corruption an act of treason with extreme, harsh penalties.</h1>

<p>How angry do you think everyone will be when they find out 911 was a false flag attack? Or the Government was running pedophilia blackmail rings?</p>

<p>Will they want shills to be punished with torture? Death penalty?</p>

<p>Something to think about next time you cash your checks, shills.</p>

<p>And users of r/topmindsofreddit who aren&#39;t shills - have you wondered why there are people encouraging you to waste your time harassing others? Does it make sense to do what you&#39;re doing or have you been hoodwinked by Government workers who have your personality profiled (after A.I. analyzed your complete web history including porn habits)?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making this up. The CIA admit they have a heart attack gun. They admit this because they want to intimidate people.</p>

<p>So why are they throwing a guy in jail for teaching a pug to nazi salute?</p>

<p>The powers that be definitely do care about what we communicate. Why else do you think they&#39;re shilling events like the Boston Marathon?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CHECKLIST</p>

<p>Do any of the respondents display the urge to supply information that could be helpful to your mission?</p>

<p>Do the respondents appear hostile to your attempts to steer the discussion?</p>

<p>Have you made a personal chart taking care to note who appear to be the “leaders” versus who appear to be the “followers”?</p>

<p>Have you attempted to gauge the “temperature” of the forum’s users?</p>

<p>In other words, the prevailing social psychology of the forum’s members?</p>

<p>Have you been more successful with one or the other XStart methods that were demonstrated in N-7015A.DOC?</p>

<p>Have more technical members (Computer Programmers, Administrators, or Moderators) of the forum deduced or accused you of hiding behind a proxy?</p>

<p>Would you gain more trust and/or credibility if you were to use one of the Agency’s allotted “HOME” pools? (most often needed when handling EVTS that are more sensitive to the pop. of a specific locale but also location centered web sites such as FB or Patch)</p>

<p>Has your PREDEV “persona” been successful or do you gauge that the users find you to be too obtrusive? Accusations of being “ever present” are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zen master speaks out of truth and courage. You Jackelrush I can tell from your responses and behavior on here come from a place of insecurity and fear. Zen master is one of the few who has had a leak behind the curtains of society. When one realizes the people who orchestrate the way society and the world works are sick minded, manipulative and predatory, there is a limited amount of options. One can shrink back to their old way of life and try to pretend they didn’t see anything or one can act as a hero and pioneer and do something to change society and/or raise awareness of those living in society. Zen master is doing us a service. The reason you and many others become combative and cast out people who say things like this is because it hits a psychological foundation in your brain. It feels threatening and uncomfortable, as it should in any semi healthy persons psyche. If those who know what’s happening and can do something to shift the tide of society keep shrinking back into their comfort zones and allow fear and the existence of heart attack guns to control them, then we are all permanently fucked, you, me, our kids, or kids kids. Human existence is currently a torturous state. So I encourage you to really think about what you say to people who try to help us out by sharing information like this. I encourage you to start thinking about the future world your future ancestors and friends children will have to live in. It’s time we all swallowed that red pill, raise our consciousness and shift the tides for the sake of the human race.</p>

It would absolutely lead to witch hunts and the harming of innocent people, and would set back any possibility of healing and reconciliation by a generation at least.</p>

<p>No we have scientific lie detector tests (such as FMRI) which would ensure only the guilty are punished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The constitution has been used to reinforce all the crooked doings of the government and CIA. The constitution is outdated and being harnessed for abuse. It was written by a bunch of psychopaths 250 years ago.... It is inevitable the constitution will be dismissed eventually. Retroactive is what will move us forward. The constitution is on a sandy foundation and that it is being used for the wrong reasons. In time we will see it collapse and a new way for us to move forward replace it. It does not matter what the judges think, it does not matter what the president thinks, it does not matter. It’s fate is sealed, it will be done with. Men who hold on to institutions for comfort and because “this is just how things are done around here” will suffer. Those who embrace change for a more humane world and welcome the discomfort of social and spiritual evolution will push us forward and be the new faces of society. </p>

<p>Dear users of r/topmindsofreddit: you failed. You will always fail. Every day people are becoming more and more interested in conspiracy theories about the deepstate. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you harass conspiracy users, you can&#39;t stop the tsunami of truth.</p>

<p>Then I was like, &quot;Ugh, <em>not this again</em>&quot; - downvote.</p>
