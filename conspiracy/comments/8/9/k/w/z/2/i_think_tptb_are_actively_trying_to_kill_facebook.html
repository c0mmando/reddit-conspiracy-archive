       I have no proof, but I'm of the firm belief that everything in the news cycle is there for a reason.  I mean, come on we all know that Facebook harvests our data.  Hell, the government has lost far more data to theft.

       That guy is a total cunt. He thinks he is so fucking smart. I'd love to smack the smirk off his face when he talks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy is a billionaire... all money made from Social Media/Facebook and he helped create the beast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then... as some sort of way to help make himself feel better he does interviews telling the world how fucking stupid they are for falling for the trap that he helped build.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when he gets bored he tweets about how he has custom made pillows with his initials embroidered in them for him at hotels.

       There are very few people that would turn down becoming a billionaire for working in the social media industry. It would take incredible perception and moral compass and even then I am not convinced you could stop yourself from justifying you were doing something that isn't totally evil given the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of times the best thing and the most we can expect from people that do something wrong is to speak out against it and try to prevent it from happening again. I wish our political elite would have some kind of sincere remorse about Iraq, 9/11, wall street bailouts and all the rest. But instead they double down.  I know if GW Bush spoke out about how he misled and lied our way into a war that nobody wanted it would go a long way to letting us move on and preventing it from happening again.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should encourage people to speak out about things that they have done wrong. Their word carries weight. Its not an easy thing to do. The establishment tends to reward people that put their head down and tow the party line. They also tend to blacklist people that speak against the machine.

       they want censorship... How are they going to get it? Well, people are eating tide pods and snorting condoms and it is generally dangerous for people to see the viral videos depicting said behaviours. They are going to make us want censorship, to protect us and our children from being exposed and influenced from eating tide pods and snorting condoms. They don't want us to get our news from any other source than what they shove down our throats. Facebook is dangerous to the establishment, so they have to make it an enemy that we need protection from.

       Yes but they never consider that the moon's gravity is only supposed to be 16% of that of the Earth... so mondo-big steps going mondo-high up over the surface and a lot of difficulty trying to control your own body with only a fraction of it's normal weight and responding just that much faster, none of which happened, however.

       In fairness though they dont need to push their own agenda, FB is full of fuckin abuse vids, gore vids and fuckin child porn. They've also been selling personal data (sure who hasn't but still)

       I think Zuckerberg maybe tried to play double agent by favouring both Clinton and Trump. They probably found about it while digging for dirt on Trump and then used their media to punish him. Last I heard he lost 10 billion.

       <li>
        Zuckerberg fucked up and did something TPTB didn't like and now they are taking him down.

        Power play, they are going to blanket the news with FaceBook hate, then when it comes time to take them down they will instead decree they are too big to fall, social media is an essential part of life now, blah, blah, blah, end of story FaceBook becomes a part of the government. This is probably the least likely and wouldn't go down exactly like this, it would be much more shrouded in fancy words.

       I don't know enough about it to comment with authority, but regarding number one. If I have my timelines and second hand data right, Facebook was selling personal info to several places for a long time including the DNC. But the DNC lost in 2016 in a lot of ways because of bad polling. Facebook only gets turned upside down when it comes out they also cooperated with Cambridge Analytica right? Kind of a double whammy against the DNC if I've got my facts straight. I could definitely be wrong but it's interesting none the less.

       They have used the tool for what they needed, now they have a better alternative (whatever that is) or it just doesn't matter at all anymore - none of this is organic.

       It's good if FB dies properly. It's bad if what they were already doing with it, wasn't enough for intelligence agencies. Zuckerburg is scum, but if he actually had some super low moral standards, and they were put to the test, then that's concerning. If the whole platform is replaced with something else, don't ever sign up for it.
