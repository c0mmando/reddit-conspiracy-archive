<p>There are about 150 people that run the world. Anyone who wants to go into politics -- they&#39;re all fucking puppets.
There are 150, and they&#39;re all men, that rule the world. Period. Full stop. They control most of the important assets. They control the money flows.
And these are not the tech entrepreneurs -- they are going to get rolled over in the next 5-10 years; by the people that are underneath pulling the strings.</p>

<p>The guy is a billionaire... all money made from Social Media/Facebook and he helped create the beast.</p>

<p>Then... as some sort of way to help make himself feel better he does interviews telling the world how fucking stupid they are for falling for the trap that he helped build. </p>

<p>Then when he gets bored he tweets about how he has custom made pillows with his initials embroidered in them for him at hotels. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are very few people that would turn down becoming a billionaire for working in the social media industry. It would take incredible perception and moral compass and even then I am not convinced you could stop yourself from justifying you were doing something that isn&#39;t totally evil given the money.</p>

<p>A lot of times the best thing and the most we can expect from people that do something wrong is to speak out against it and try to prevent it from happening again. I wish our political elite would have some kind of sincere remorse about Iraq, 9/11, wall street bailouts and all the rest. But instead they double down.  I know if GW Bush spoke out about how he misled and lied our way into a war that nobody wanted it would go a long way to letting us move on and preventing it from happening again.</p>

<p>We should encourage people to speak out about things that they have done wrong. Their word carries weight. Its not an easy thing to do. The establishment tends to reward people that put their head down and tow the party line. They also tend to blacklist people that speak against the machine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they want censorship... How are they going to get it? Well, people are eating tide pods and snorting condoms and it is generally dangerous for people to see the viral videos depicting said behaviours. They are going to make us want censorship, to protect us and our children from being exposed and influenced from eating tide pods and snorting condoms. They don&#39;t want us to get our news from any other source than what they shove down our throats. Facebook is dangerous to the establishment, so they have to make it an enemy that we need protection from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they are for sure up to something. The news doesn&#39;t take sides with the people ever. My current three theories in no particular order are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Zuckerberg fucked up and did something TPTB didn&#39;t like and now they are taking him down.</li>
<li>It&#39;s a massive distraction from something else, if so it&#39;s working, even <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is stepping in line with this one.</li>
<li>Power play, they are going to blanket the news with FaceBook hate, then when it comes time to take them down they will instead decree they are too big to fall, social media is an essential part of life now, blah, blah, blah, end of story FaceBook becomes a part of the government. This is probably the least likely and wouldn&#39;t go down exactly like this, it would be much more shrouded in fancy words.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know enough about it to comment with authority, but regarding number one. If I have my timelines and second hand data right, Facebook was selling personal info to several places for a long time including the DNC. But the DNC lost in 2016 in a lot of ways because of bad polling. Facebook only gets turned upside down when it comes out they also cooperated with Cambridge Analytica right? Kind of a double whammy against the DNC if I&#39;ve got my facts straight. I could definitely be wrong but it&#39;s interesting none the less.</p>
