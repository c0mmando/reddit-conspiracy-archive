        Ismail Aghdam said in the interview that prior to the shooting the family had reported his daughter missing in Southern California and informed police she might be going to YouTube because she "hated" the company. He said hours before his daughter caused an afternoon of terror in San Bruno, the family received a phone call from police saying she had been located asleep in her car and everything was "under control."

       I'm posting this for the sake of discussion, it's an open theory meaning there's no conclusion being drawn or an absolute certainty factor. In the sake of avoiding shills and sliders, if you don't agree, or find this theory ridiculous, that's alright, thank you for reading,  just move on. This thread is for people that want to explore the possibility. Thanks.

       I could see this being a event to help push the censorship narrative. 
      Bystander named Rodriguez according to USA Today says “I’ll make sure I get my nose out of my smartphone more. The world is pretty chaotic right now you have to do what you can to stay safe.” 
No obvious agenda there./s/

       "For people saying she looked fake in some of her pics and vids, looks like she had a sex doll of herself. I clicked on the link in the attached Google search result below to view the vid and saw her with her doll for a second before my awesome vivo phone won a prize and got flooded with pop-ups. Fair warning has been given. Here is the search result:

       Yes, already well considered. Matter a fact being predisposed to madness may very we'll be a prerequisite for being abducted into a behavioural modification program like mk ultra or monarch or whatever they call it these days not to mention the fact that those programs used mental illness as a template to study in their subjects and recreate in their assets. Not a single one of the victims of mk ultra will appear to have been totally sane individuals.

       Does anyone remember the name of that film that played in theaters sometime in the 1990s or very early 2000s that was a fictional take on escapees from a government or private mind control facility / hospital?  I remember it was a pretty entertaining film, well made, must have had a budget of millions from one of the major studios.

       I saw 2 other Iranian profiles that looked VERY odd, odder than Nasim, I wish I'd saved them I'd never thought a crazy Instagram/youtube profile would come in handy one day lol thankfully my friend knows one of them I'll post it when I find it. The other one is a young Persian girl that does very weird stuff I remember she ranted a lot about haters was an attention whore, never shaves her hair and showed her dick on an Insagram vid last I remember she had 2 Instagram profiles and a YouTube account.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one I can find If I remember correctly is a very strange gay guy with a very weird website lot of text about how he's a prince and he loves the shah way too much, again he acts very weird on video and they both live abroad.

       Wanted to add this. Not from the shooters personal archive, but maybe an glimose of how Iran may use behavioural programming. The YouTube shooter claimed to have served in the Iranian military and this article documents Iran's female Ninja squad or some shit like that. Funny to note the headband that says "Ninja Ranger" in English. Wtf?:

       Thank you for taking the time to make this post; I much appreciate it and plan to share with family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was livestreaming this event on YouTube as it unfolded and one thing that stuck out to me (I said this on another thread): We did not know a gender and I remember the anchor suddenly saying, "It's a woman with a white shirt and head scarf." It seemed like such an oddly specific description when we hadn't even know the gender even a moment before. The head scarf thing is also specific and I remember watching the live comments with people immediately making a Muslim/Arabic connotation. I believe your first link with Iran is how the storyline will proceed now. The fact that she has dark features plays well here too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to see some translations of those lyrics. The site has been scrubbed - anyone got an Archive?
