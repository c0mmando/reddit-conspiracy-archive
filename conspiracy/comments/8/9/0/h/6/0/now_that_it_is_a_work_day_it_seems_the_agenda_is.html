       The partisan propaganda is the false idea that the video was "Trumpian".
      </p>
      <p>
       The video was about fake news and trusting MSN. So is that Trump ideology?  When they first came out with this fake news term did Trump and his supporters not flip it around and start calling all MSN fake news?
      </p>
      <p>
       So for this to be pro-Potus or Trumpian, the sinclair video would have been calling CNN and MSN fake news. But it was not. It was the exact opposite of Trumpian.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what did Trump say about it?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He points out the irony of the MSN criticizing it. He also likes to word things in just a way that they can be taken out of context. He was saying sinclair is far superior than the MOST dishonest.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are far superior than the MOST dishonest, does that make you good?    Do real people only see things in black and white binary? Well I guess the partisan people do.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO all MSN is bad and some are way worse than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       now the line is that Trump Jr. made a deal with Sinclair so Trump controls them. This is false. They fail to mention that this deal was during the election for coverage and according to very bias Politico..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But Sinclair and other networks said such a deal is nothing nefarious or new - just an arrangement for extended sit-down interviews with both candidates, one many campaigns have done in previous years to get around the national media and directly to viewers in key states.

       Agree. All news on both sides are pretty much propaganda. That being said, I think it opened everyone's eyes to not really to trust the media and to go out and do the research yourself.

       "Sinclair is far superior to CNN."
      </p>
      <p>
       What's Trump's message here? That we should trust them more than CNN? Or should we not trust them at all, since they're both MSM, and Sinclair happens to rank higher than CNN but still doesn't meet the threshold for trustworthiness? Or was he not really saying much at all?

       All sorts of political entities use television news to push an agenda. Nobody disputes that. The reason the Sinclair story got so much attention is because they're the only organization trying to launder propaganda scripts through local anchors, who have historically been more fair and apolitical. When you watch CNN, you know that you're getting a CNN-approved message. When you watch Fox, you know that you're getting a Fox-approved message. It's always been that way. But now, when you watch local news, you're getting a Sinclair-approved message. And since Sinclair isn't exactly upfront about that fact, it came as a surprise to a lot of people.

       I have not seen anyone trying to dismiss that it is even an issue. But when the partisans try to say only one side does this you better bet mthat falsehood will be countered. You can use the thought terminating cliche "whataboutism" if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that all corporate media is just establishment propaganda.

         He points out the irony of the MSN criticizing it. He also likes to word things in just a way that they can be taken out of context. He was saying sinclair is far superior than the MOST dishonest.

       Yes, your purpose on this sub is to deceive and defend the establishment. And that is what you did to me using a dissimilar comparison.

       I didn’t realize that proving your logic is not consistent is deceiving and defending the establishment.

       I will not remove it. I am not ashamed. I was drinking my coffee before work and having several conversation with several people at once. I did not realize you were working on deceiving me with a false equivalency in an attempt to discredit my previous comment..

       Why would you remove it? Do you remove comments that make you look bad? And you shouldn't be ashamed when you are proven wrong or if your logic is proven inconsistent. It's human to be a hypocrite sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I didn't "trick you". I just proved the hypocrisasy of what you said.

       both sides do it. both sides (of the same coin) are corrupt.  Youre a fool if you think anyone in government has any interest in the greater good, what is good for you or the country.  The government is full of criminals that have no interest in anything other than power and wealth for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you vote for them, youre a fool and you are making the problem worse.  When you give your vote, you are positively reinforcing their criminal behavior.

       With that kind of blanket perspective if a good politician did come around wanting to fix things you would just automatically be against him without a second thought.
