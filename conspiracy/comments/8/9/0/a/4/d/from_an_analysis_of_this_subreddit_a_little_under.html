        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to talk about &quot;skeptics.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty common now to see people in this sub with highly upvoted comments pushing mainstream narratives. They call themselves &quot;skeptics,&quot; but that&#39;s not really what they are. There is a &quot;distinct subgroup who appeared to be posting primarily in order to debunk conspiracy beliefs.&quot; This sub is full of them. There is nothing wrong with skepticism, but the brand of &quot;skepticism&quot; we see in this sub is often over-the-top conspiracy denialism to the point of absurdity, and pushing of mainstream narratives by people whose sole purpose here is to deny, deny, deny. </p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-29/online-conspiracy-theorists-are-more-diverse-28and-ordinary29/9600834">this study of comparisons between subgroups of users in this sub.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a recent paper we used online comments to examine individuals who are interested in these types of ideas. We examined a complete set of comments over eight years from the conspiracy forum of reddit.com. (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>)</p>

<p>We were able to identify 12 distinct subgroups of individuals who used language in different ways and who varied widely in their interests and their posting habits. What they talked about strongly suggested that they held different beliefs and attitudes about a range of conspiracies.</p>

<p><strong>There was even a distinct subgroup who appeared to be posting primarily in order to debunk conspiracy beliefs (sceptics).</strong> This suggests that individuals involved with conspiracy theories may have quite different motivations, beliefs and attitudes. It may not be useful to consider them as a homogeneous group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the chart, this group appears to be a little less than 10 percent of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users, which is <em>way</em> more than I originally thought were here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Like you said, they are only skeptical of theories that are not pushed by those in the MSM and in positions of authority.</p>

<p>Take the Skripal poisoning, for example. The so-called &quot;skeptics&quot; here know for a fact that the culprit must be Russia, and anyone who questions that is crazy. But how do they know? Because some people in the media and in positions of authority told them so. And if you ask for proof, they will say something along the lines of &quot;Well they aren&#39;t going to share that evidence with some neckbeard on Reddit.&quot;</p>

<p>Its all pretty ridiculous, honestly. These &quot;skeptics&quot; may tell themselves that they are &quot;keeping us grounded.&quot; But the reality is that they are generally naive and have poor critical thinking skills, their arguments are generally irrational, and they have nothing to contribute to this forum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what is the purpose of your post?  </p>

<p>I consider all of these and more to have been or are conspiracies against us, the people of this nation.  </p>

<p>The assassinations:  JFK/MLK/RFK/MalcomX,Medgar Evers,  etc</p>

<p>The &quot;Oil Embargos,&quot; the really disasterous one of 1972 and the Punish Jimmy Carter one of 1979. </p>

<p>The holding of the U.S. Hostages in Iran.</p>

<p>The Reagan assassination attempt.</p>

<p>Iran/Contra/Drugs to Urban areas,  as we used violence to destroy any emerging democracy in Central America, we sped up locking up our African Americans. </p>

<p>The first Iraq War, </p>

<p>The Clinton Presidency</p>

<p>The 2000 Stolen election, the 2005 stolen election. </p>

<p>9/11 and the 2nd Iraq War. </p>

<p>But most of all the very strictly control dialog and narrative and the really huge lies like:  The MSM is liberal,   That PBS and NPR are liberal (they haven&#39;t been ever, but are now instead of standard establishment conservative are entirely tea party informed, they just use a different language.) </p>

<p>I will not bother debunking but will ignore, Flat earthers, chem trails, shape shifting alien lizards, Satanic Illuminati hysteria. 
etx.  </p>

<p>Are you suggesting that I should not be allowed in this sub? </p>

<p>As for debunking, you rant about the &quot;fake news,&quot; and combat it by believing all of it, by reacting to it as  you are directed to,  </p>

<p>A bunch of outrage from the alleged opposition.  </p>

<p>Example:<br/>
MSM, Trump, all talking heads,  blaming Democratic for killing DACA.  </p>

<p>Who killed DACA,  Trump,  He gave the Republican Congress 6 months to &quot;fix,&quot; it.  Har har har.  Really you think it is the Democratic&#39;s fault that the Republican Congress and their trained to hate al immigrants voters were going to &quot;fix,&quot; DACA? </p>

<p>Trump killed DACA with his own E.O.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>fyi, Someone posted this same article a few days ago.  Glad to see it being discussed further.  Lately there&#39;s been several posts regarding studies about the r\conspiracy userbase. I understand the vanity aspect of being recognized and distinguished by academic institutions and all, but I do have a few questions...</p>

<p>Q: ....What&#39;s up with all this? why is money and serious effort being invested into analyzing a group of conspiracy theorists, and for so long?  What is it about this group in particular that it&#39;s believed to offer answers? What&#39;s the problem that sparked this serious interest and for whom are the answers supposed the help?</p>

<p>A: ...(quotes from OP&#39;s linked article.)</p>

<p>&quot;conspiracy theorising may be best understood as a symptom of a breakdown of trust in institutions like government and the media.&quot;</p>

<p>and </p>

<p>&quot;[...] it has long been known that online conspiracy theorising can have a variety of negative social effects, from political disengagement to actual violence. These are effects we should aim to mitigate.&quot;</p>

<p>Couldnt the motives be stated clearer?  So the directive behind this study is to &quot;mitigate&quot;(for whom?) the &quot;negative social effects&quot; of conspiracy theorizing.   They don&#39;t outright say that the symptom of &quot;distrust&quot; should be &quot;mitigated&quot; as well.  Let&#39;s not mince words any longer, if this study provides intel about people who distrust govt &amp; MSM, then it should be abundantly obvious that the intel resulting from the study is customized for use by whomever that trust was broken for, that be govt &amp; MSM.  That&#39;s who it&#39;s for.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, the study&#39;s whole sub-group classification schema is set up upon a rubric designed for judging each groups degree of institutional trust - and, viola, the intel shows that... </p>

<p>&quot;The vast majority of [....] conspiracy theories are not an all-encompassing obsession that overrides other interests[.] [....] Even the most obsessed posters also spend a lot of time discussing Star Wars and trading cute cat photos on other parts of the site.&quot;</p>

<p>The concern this study ameliorates is that all this distrust in govt &amp; MSM might possibly preclude a degree of non-participation that cannot be overridden.  It demonstrates the opposite, so keep calm carry on because, despite a few bad apples, the vast majority have yet to display any significant behavior capable of sinking the ship. </p>

<p>cheers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi.</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably one of the users your talking about, and I&#39;d like to tell you why.  First, I don&#39;t identify as a skeptic, I identify with the ability to change my mind.  I was raised by scientists, and when I was in my teens and twenties I went through a whole lot of experimentation with drugs and different kinds of thinking.  I became what I thought of as very &quot;spiritual&quot; in my outlook, and it was all a seemingly logical progression.  A few years ago I decided that I needed to take a hard look at what the &quot;other side&quot; was saying (you know, the mainstream materialists) because I kept feeling like I wasn&#39;t being totally honest with myself.  Also, I knew that if I wanted to spread the good word I needed to be prepared to argue with the &quot;deniers.&quot;  That is when I became truly acquainted with critical thinking.  Of course I thought I already knew how to think about things and that my reasoning had been sound, but I discovered that it was not so.</p>

<p>Thus began a long journey of introspection.  I do still hold out hope that some of what I believed may turn out true, but I have to acknowledge that much of what I thought looks pretty unlikely.  I used to believe in telepathy, for example, having actually experienced it a number of times (usually on acid but a couple times without), but then I dove deep into the research (which there exist reams of) and it turns out that telepathy is increasingly unlikely.  How do I reconcile this with my experience?  Well, I also had to admit that the human mind is fallible, that it can and does trick us on a regular basis.  Again, there are reams of research into the ways that human perception can falter and mislead us.  There is a part of the brain that makes you feel like you are in your body, for example, and when we turn it off (which we can do in a lab) we generate out-of-body experiences.  Another part of the brain is responsible for making us feel like we are in the present moment even though it takes a quarter of a second or so for all of our sensory information to get compiled into a picture of the world.  How does it do this?  By estimating how the world should appear in the next moments, and then telling you that is the reality you inhabit.  All of this lead to the reluctant realization that much of the time and study I spent dedicated to harnessing my spiritual energies was for naught.</p>

<p>Still, I wasn&#39;t a vocal proponent of reason or rationality; let bygones be bygones, I thought.  That started to change after the election of Donald Trump.  He harnessed to power of all those wrong ways of thinking that I had learned about and worked to free myself from in order to con the American people into electing him.  (I was never a Hillary supporter, it&#39;s only in retrospect that I believe she could have done a <em>much</em> better job.)  So now, having witnessed the craziest year in American politics since, well, ever(?), I have decided that &#39;tis the season to spread some reason.  As it happens, the conspiracy subs are a rife with incorrect reasoning.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to say here that I fully acknowledge that conspiracies can and do occur.  What I am trying to do is apply the tool of critical thinking in order to filter the nonsense from the possible actual conspiracies.  The world needs more reason, logic, and rationality; they are the best tools in the fight against ignorance, tribalism, and racism.  I hope that the people of this sub understand the value in this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is hogwash. There are a subgroup of people here that are desperately pro-whatever-agenda and they are grasping at straws to try to find anything they can to discredit their enemies.</p>

<p>They post idiotic &quot;theories&quot; that get laughed at by the &quot;skeptics&quot; that you refer to - which you respond to by attacking <em>them</em> and calling them shills or whatever the fuck this post is trying to say.</p>

<p>When someone makes a stupid post and I see it, I&#39;m going to call it like it is. Even if the conclusion is something I agree with, if the reasoning or evidence offered to support it is bullshit, I&#39;m going to be even MORE likely to chime in because it pisses me off to have VALID arguments undermined by complete stupidity. </p>

<p>When I point out the lunacy, I get accused of being a member of their opposition. Bitch even if I&#39;m on the &quot;same side&quot; as you I don&#39;t want a bunch of idiots on &quot;my side&quot; making me look bad. Every &quot;side&quot; should call bullshit on its own folks. </p>
