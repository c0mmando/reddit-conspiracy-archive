        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Seriously I&#39;m looking through old YouTube and Reddit comments related to the things I went on about in the title and it baffles me how some people are in complete denial. I used to be like those people however it was more like I just didn&#39;t care and believed whatever I was told. I wasn&#39;t calling conspiracies stupid or lies just I didn&#39;t care but them it&#39;s completely different. There&#39;s loads that think the world trade center 7 building collapsed with fire and believe that a plane crashed into the pentagon even though there was so many holes in that story. For example the pentagon being one of the most secured and surveillance place in the world somehow most of the cameras were turned off. You can throw everything you can at them and somehow they have an explanation why it&#39;s all fantasy as if they barely listened. They&#39;ll say something like &quot;why would the government do something so evil and secret?&quot; then you bring up operation northwoods and one literally said &quot;it never happened so there you go&quot;. Don&#39;t get me started on the middle east either. </p>

<p>I will be honest and say I seen some of the old reddit threads on this subreddit which had people similar to those and end up getting upvoted to the top. I know most of you probably aren&#39;t like this anyways but I do find it interesting. I&#39;m not sure I am going to get downvoted or not but I just wanted to start a discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These sorts of people are terrified people. They cannot emotionally handle anything except optimism and positive thinking. They are trusting and naive. They are also apathetic and lazy. If they admitted the system and our leaders were corrupt, they might feel like they have to do something to change it. They prefer to live with blinders on. Also, some part of them knows the issues are so big, the corruption so deep and systemic, they are relatively powerless to change it. This subconscious knowledge/fear is just too much for them to handle. </p>

<p>My attitude is that it&#39;s better when you engage the conspiracy theory on 9/11. For one thing, it gives you agency. As in, you are now an agent of truth. You want to undo the damage. You&#39;re willing to say it out loud in front of the NSA (yes you deep-bot) and everybody. That&#39;s a whole lot more positive in my book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue here is because people seldom make their own tiny world in a bubble. Most of them, don’t have time to find out the truth or don’t care. They get their political news from TV, by talking to like minded people, newspapers and so on. </p>

<p>When someone has made their world, they tend to be inside it and not rattle too much. Completely unaware that they’re being indoctrinated.</p>

<p>Now what happens when you say 9/11 was inside job and you start telling them truth? Their tiny world/bubble shatters. You can’t break their reality and not expect them to flip out. Like what Yuri Bezmenov said, they will only learn about truth when a military boot kicks their bottom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re going to get many different answers, but here&#39;s mine: There&#39;s a Cult of Happiness. The vast majority of people (understandably) just want to live in a safe Happy little world where everyone loves another and consumes Happy little products. I think just about all of us want that actually. </p>

<p>But these people insist that the world they yearn for is the world we live in, or at least pretend it is. Perhaps it&#39;s from programming and conditioning. But some of these deniers also know deep down on the subconscious level that they&#39;re living a lie and are living under cruel and corrupt leaderships. And that&#39;s why when you call them out on it--by suggesting alternative theories, providing evidence that raises questions, etc.--they get reactionary by outright ignoring the evidence (or cherry picking weak arguments), and emotionally lashing out (&quot;How dare you disrespect our flag/troops!&quot; &quot;LUL and the frogs are gay right?&quot; etc.)</p>

<p>We will always be downvoted, so to speak, And The Cult of Happiness will always be upvoted. Because we humans are a social animal (one that relies on herd mentality and the diction of majority of public opinion), the hard truths will always be suppressed and ignored in favor of convenience and short term Happiness. As long as we get that frisson fix from the Coke commercials, have food in our bellies, have car notes to pay, have someone to look down on and someone to work to become, we&#39;re good. Who gives a shit if someone wants to kill their countrymen to start wars for imperialism? &quot;Hey, I&#39;m still here alive, and Happy! The show goes on.&quot; </p>

<p>As long as the news is selling the Happy lies and not showing the cold hard truths that affect everyone (instead of the usual pitting classes/races against each other), these people can continue to live in their Happy little world. </p>

<p>In other words, ignorance is bliss. We are unchained in Plato&#39;s cave, but our friends think we&#39;re the monsters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. </p>

<p>Speaking of <em>Sunny</em>, no shit, there&#39;s actually a lot of insight and themes of social commentary in many of their episodes for us skeptical/conspiracy-minded people. I actually have a pet theory one episode is about 9/11 being an inside job (<em>&quot;The Gang Solves The Gas Crisis&quot;</em>). I would&#39;ve posted about it on r/FanTheories already but I assume it&#39;ll just get downvoted based on title alone. See if you can find the clues I see :)</p>

<p>I have seen many people refer to Plato&#39;s Cave, but how many have walked into the light themselves?</p>

<p>For one example, did anybody die or get hurt on 9/11? The shadows on the wall say, &#39;yes&#39;.</p>

<p>I say, &#39;no&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most of it is: 1) sheer ignorance having not paid attention to the topic before, 2) People work more than ever to just do what they can for their families, so they don&#39;t consider the middle east (or 9/11) in their daily lives at all, it&#39;s a problem that they <em>think</em> doesn&#39;t directly affect them so it&#39;s not a over arching concern in daily life, 3) I also think there are a lot of people who simply cannot conceive of the idea that the government would and DID do that to its own citizens.  To admit that is too spooky, and opens up many more questions about how the world works.</p>

<p>How&#39;s that relevant? I couldn&#39;t care if the person is trans or not but whatever happened is not right. Do you honestly think the fact he&#39;s/she&#39;s a trans we should just forget what happened?

<p>I will be honest and say I seen some of the old reddit threads on this subreddit which had people similar to those and end up getting upvoted to the top. I know most of you probably aren&#39;t like this anyways but I do find it interesting. </p>

<p>I  have <em>always</em> suspected that there is an effort afoot on reddit to upvote particular comments and arguments after a submission fades from attention. (face it, after a week, 99% of the comment sections for a given submission are dead and no one is paying attention to them anymore.) As if to make it appear, for example, that commentary supporting the official narrative &quot;won&quot; the argument and was the most upvoted and supported by people in this subreddit. </p>

<p>I do not recall this subreddit ever discussing this...Then again, I have taken more than one hiatus from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, so I may have just missed the discussion.</p>

Truth brings freedom but also brings burden and certainly isn&#39;t the most profitable, hence half truths and out right deception is the flavor of the day to any so called reporter that actually wants to make money. We see at the highest level and I&#39;ve personally looked the other way in my own life just to keep the business going before. Everyone has their principles and everyone has certain principles they&#39;ll put aside when food and shelter are on the line.

    <div class="md"><p>It all started after the UFO phenomenon and convincing everyone through mob mentality and ridicule that if you saw them you were a crazy conspiracy person.
Then they create project blue book to pretend they were actually investigating them thus “proving” that people who claimed to see them were nuts.
Then years of “crazy” tabloids being the only media outlet for “conspiracy theorists”....
It was all leading up to the most obvious blatent public act of self inflicted terror on 9/11 (and several since) and they knew at that point it didnt matter how sloppy they were bc of half a century of conditioning the public to believe whatever our mainstream media and “honestly” elected officials tell us....
But in the last couple years it seems a LOT more people do not care about being labeled a conspiracy nut which is the only optimism i see in this lied to nation. Pass around the red pills people!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people don&#39;t have a good &quot;feel&quot; for what&#39;s possible and how things work in general. These are the type of people who see in a movie, e.g., a car explode from being shot with a gun or driving off a cliff, or someone being thrown through the air when shot with a shotgun, and think that&#39;s exactly what would happen in real life.</p>

<p>I was at work on 9/11/01 and a co-worker told me what had happened. I said, &quot;What?? How does a plane bring down a skyscraper??&quot; So I was highly skeptical of it even before reading any conspiracy theories about it.</p>

<p>Of course, building 7 wasn&#39;t even hit by a plane, but the plane hits were irrelevant anyway, because a plane can&#39;t do any significant damage to the structure of a massive steel-framed skyscraper. The real [alleged] cause of all three of those buildings coming down was simply fire, which is utterly absurd. Apologists like to point out that the fire was such and such temperature and steel loses half (or whatever) of its strength at that temperature, and that argument is also absurd. It is like saying, &quot;A candle flame is up to 2,552 °F, and water boils at 212 °F, so I can boil a big pot of water with a candle flame.&quot;  Of course, the water will never boil, nor even raise in temperature by all that much, because while you have plenty of temperature in the candle flame, you&#39;re sorely lacking in e.g., BTUs, i.e., quantity of heat.</p>

<p>In order for those buildings to fall straight down like they did from a fire, you&#39;d have to position a skyscraper-sized blowtorch above the building and blast it, completely engulfing it in a column of fire of biblical proportions, so that all of the steel support columns get heated evenly and fail all at once. Even if a building fire had the BTUs to bring down a massive steel-framed building (it doesn&#39;t, which is why it has never happened before or since), the random nature of a building fire means that the structural failures would happen at random points, so it would be a slow process of sections leaning, tilting, collapsing, in random locations, and you&#39;d still be left with much of the building still standing after the fire had exhausted its fuel.    </p>
