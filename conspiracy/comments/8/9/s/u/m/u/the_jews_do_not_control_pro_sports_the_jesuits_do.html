    <div class="md"><p>David Kertzer&#39;s book &quot;The Popes Against the Jews&quot; page 267 &quot;In France the main champion of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and the best known exponent of Catholic anti-Semitisim in the 1920&#39;s, was Father Ernest Jouin, a man who had come to devote his life to alerting his fellow Catholics to the Jewish Threat. In publishing the forgery in France in 1920, he was able to sign his foreward, aimed at establishing the work&#39;s authenticity, &quot;E.Jouin, Prelate of His Holiness&quot;, for Pope Benedict XV had honored Jouin with the recognition of his work on behalf the Church. Jouin&#39;s prominence in the French Catholic campaign against the Jews dated back to 1912, when he began the Revue Internationale des Societes Secretes (International Review of Secret Societies). The following year he founded the French-Catholic League, of which he remained president the rest of his life. Both the Journal and league were motivated by his desire to serve the Church. He sought only he said, to follow the Pope&#39;s injunction that the clergy battle the forces that were conspiring to destroy Christianity. His special obsession was the Jewish-Masonic conspiracy, and, in a speech to the Congress of the Anti-Judeomasonic League in 1929, he proudly took credit for hving been the one to coin the term &quot;Judeomasonic&quot; nine years earlier. He proclaimed &quot;Israel is King, the Mason is his helper, the Bolshevik his executioner. The Jew believes in the world domination of his race&quot;. Jouin&#39;s harping on the supposed Jewish Masonic conspiracy was in harmony with the devolpments of the German anti-Semitic movement.&quot;</p>

<p>David Kertzer The Popes Against the Jews page 273: &quot; Indeed, the seeds of Catholic anti-Semitism in Austria that had been planted with the Vatican&#39;s help in the last two decades of the nineteenth century continued to bear fruit in years following the First World War. A widely distributed lecture by a well known Jesuit curator, Victor Kolb, reflects the tenor of Austrian Catholic attitude toward the Jews as the war began. At a meeting of the Catholic organization Piusverin(Puis Association), an organization devoted to promoting the Catholic press in Austria, Father Kolb warned of the dangers facing the country. &quot;Wherever you look, you always see Judaism&#39;s work, a conscious work, backed by unlimited means, always aimed at supremacy in every form&quot;. It was well to remember the motto of the Pius Association, he thundered &quot;protection of the German people, internally and externally, From Jewish penetration from the destructive work of the Jews&quot;. Kolb&#39;s speech was immediately translated into Italian and printed at the request of Father Wladimir Ledochowshi( the future black pope!!!), the Polish priest soon to become head of the Jesuit order worldwide. He had copies of the speech distributed throughout the Vatican.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Weishaupt is a key player...</p>

<p>“The Jesuit General has been the most powerful man in the world since Pius VII restored the Order or “Company” in 1814. Because of the Order’s suppression by the Pope in 1773, the Jesuits began the Bavarian Illuminati with one of their soldiers, Adam Weishaupt. The Illuminati absorbed the Jewish House of Rothschild creating a colossus of wealth around the world, subject to the Jesuit General. With this financial arm in place the Jesuits then made war on the Vatican including the Pope, the Roman Catholic Monarchs of Europe and the Order of the Dominicans. This Inquisition and Crusade was called “the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars”. For twenty-five years, the Jesuit General’s Masonic agents, particularly in the person of Napoleon Bonaparte, conducted war. Bonaparte also punished the Knights of Malta, driving them from their island home to Russia.”</p>

<p>Eric Jon Phelps: “Vatican Assassins”, 2nd Ed., p. 582</p>

<p>Rulers of Evil Pg. 193/194 :  &quot;Adam Weishaupt, dismissed from the Jesuit college at Ingolstadt, attracted
the fiercer elements of European Rosicrucian Freemasonry into
a new secret cult in Bavaria. His “Illuminati, ” whose cove r was
eventually blown in order to convinc e public opinion that evil
secret societies were being diligently unmasked when in fact they
were not – was another instance of “blown cover as cover.” Countless
other members of the greatest clandestine intelligence agency
the world has ever known, now secularized with the jeering
approval of its enemies, crossed the Atlanti c to help guide Americans
through the pains of becoming the first nation expressly
designed to be a Febronian, Bellarminian democrati c republican
Church-State . Wha t an amazing production, all the more impressive
for the complete invisibility of its means!
We’v e seen how the Brief of Disestablishment was served upon
Lorenzo Ricc i in mid-August, and how the Genera l was removed
to the English Colleg e a few blocks away, where he remained for
five weeks , until late September . Interestingly, the Dean of the
English Colleg e at that time was a thirty-two-year-old Jesuit professor
of controversial theology named John Mattingly. Mattingly
was an American , said to be the lone America n Jesuit in Rome .
He was a native of Maryland, a graduate of St. Omer’s, and a dear
friend of John Carroll, who (as we know) had departed Rome five
months before Ricci’s arrest. Withi n fifteen years, Carroll would
invite Mattingly to become the first president of Georgetown University,
an offer Mattingly would decline.
Wha t might Lorenzo Ricc i be likely to discuss for five weeks
(a) under a British roof, (b) in the custody of a young America n
Jesuit, (c) at a time when America n merchant s were incensed at
being cheated out of their tea profits by a new law (d) sponsored
by British Freemasons , (e) whos e Grand Master happened to be
Ricci’s secret servant? Might the Genera l hav e been conferring with members of the
British East India Company , one of the English College’ s major
patrons? Might their discussions hav e involved to which Americ
an ports their tea might be most advantageously shipped, and
when? Apparentl y so, for while Ricc i was residing at the English
College , Parliament authorized the East India Compan y to ship
half a million pounds of tea to Boston, Ne w York, Philadelphia,
and Charleston, consigned to a group of specially-chosen merchants.</p>

<p>Might Ricc i have been formulating with Carroll’s friend Mattingly
plans for a demonstration intended to climax the agitations
that had been fomented in the colonies since the beginning of his
generalate, in 1758? Might he hav e suggested a spectacular event
to occur in, say, Boston Harbor, symbolizing the colonists’ frustrations
with England? An d might not Parliament respond to this
event with vengeful measures designed to push the colonists over
the brink of rebellion? Aren’t five weeks sufficient time to script
such a “Boston Tea Party,” along with the harsh legal measures
with whic h it might be punished? As well as how the colonists’
violent reaction to the punishment might be coordinated? Outcome
suggests that Ricc i did more in his five weeks at the English
College than languish in custody.
We hav e seen ho w the Genera l was taken from the English
Colleg e to Castel Sant’Angelo , with its secret tunnel to the papal
apartments in the Vatican. For many months after his “imprisonment,
” Lorenzo Ricc i was “questioned by the Inquisition,” according
to traditional Churc h history. But the Inquisition had been
administered by Jesuits since 1542. No t surprisingly, the inquisitors
pried absolutely no useful information out of Lorenzo Ricci..&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HP Blavatsky Roots of Ritualism pg 10 : &quot;Can we say as much of the
immaculate daughters of the god of the Roman Catholic Church —
Anna and Mary? Yet, even to breathe that the Gospel narratives are
allegories too, as they would be most sacrilegious were they accepted
in their dead letter, constitutes in a Christian born the acme of
blasphemy!
Verily, they may whitewash and mask as much as they like the
god of Abraham and Isaac, they shall never be able to disprove the
assertion of Marcion, whodeniedthat theGod of Hate could be the
same as the “Father of Jesus.” Heresy or not, but the “Father in
Heaven” of the Churches remained since then a hybrid creatute; a
mixture between the Jove of the Pagan mobs and the “jealous God”
of Moses, exoterically the SUN, whose abode is in Heaven, or the sky,
esoterically. Does he not give birth to LIGHT “that shineth in Darkness,”
to the Day, the bright Dyaus, the Son, and is he not the MOST HIGH—
Deus Caelum? And is it not again Terra, the “Earth,”the ever
immaculate as the ever prolific Virgin who, fecundated by the ardent
embraces of her “Lord”—the fructifying rays of the Sun, becomes,
in this terrestrial sphere, the mother of all that lives and breathes on
her vast bosom? Hence, the sacredness of her products in Ritualism—
the bread and the wine. Hence also, the ancient messis, the great
sacrifice to the goddess of harvest {Ceres Eleusina, the Earth again):
messis, for the Initiates, missa for the profane,1 now transformed into the Christian mass or liturgy. The ancient oblation of the fruits of the
Earth to the Sun, the Deus Aitissimus, “the Most High,” the symbol
of the G A. O T. U. of the Masons to this day, became the foundation
of the most important ritual among the ceremonies of the new religion.
The worship offered to Osiris-Isis (the Sun and the Earth),2 to Bel
and the cruciform Astarte of the Babylonians; to Odin or Thor and
Friga, of the Scandinavians; to Belen and the Virgo Paritura of the
Celts; to Apollo and the Magna Mater of theGreeks;all these couples
having the same meaning, passed bodily to, and were transformed by,
the Christians into the LordGod or theHolyGhost descending upon
the Virgin Mary.
Deus Sol or Solus, the Father, was made interchangeable with
the Son: the “Father” in his noon glory, he became the “Son” at Sunrise,
when he was said to “be born.” This idea received its full
apotheosis annually on December the 25th, during the Vernal Solstice,
when the Sun—hence the solar gods of all the nations—was said to
be born. Natalis solis invicte. And the “precursor” of the resurrecting
Sun grows, and waxes strong, until the vernal equinox, when the god
Sol begins its annual course, under the sign of the Ram or the Lamb,
the first lunar week of the month. The 1st of March was feasted
throughout all pagan Greece, as its neomenia was Sacred to Diana.
Christian nations celebrate their Easter, for the same reason, on the
first Sunday that follows the full moon, at theVernalEquinox. With the
festivals of the Pagans, the canonicals of their priests and Hierophants
were copied by Christendom. Will this be denied? In his “Life of
Constantine” Eusebius confesses— thus saying, perhaps, theonly truth
he ever uttered in his life—that “in order to render Christianity more
attractive to the Gentiles, the priests (of Christ) adopted the
exterior vestments and ornaments used in the pagan cult.” He
might have added “their rituals” and dogmas also.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no!!! &quot;...Jesus Christ, i.e., the Man-God of the Christians copied from the Avatâras of every country, from the Hindu Krishna as well as the Egyptian Horus, was never a historical person. He is a deified personification of the glorified type of the great Hierophants of the Temples, and his story, as told in the New Testament, is an allegory, assuredly containing profound esoteric truths, but still an allegory.  Every act of the Jesus of the New Testament, every word attributed to him, every event related of him during the three years of the mission he is said to have accomplished, rests on the programme of the Cycle of Initiation, a cycle founded on the Precession of the Equinoxes and the Signs of the Zodiac....&quot;- HP Blavatsky</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HP Blavatsky ISIS Unveiled pg 146-147 :&quot;The narrative of the Apostle Paul, in his second Epistle to the Corinthians (xii. 3, 4), has struck several scholars, well versed in the descriptions of the mystical rites of the initiation given by some classics, as alluding most undoubtedly to the final Epopteia.* &quot;I knew a certain man — whether in body or outside of body, Iknow not: God knoweth — who was rapt into Paradise, and heard things ineffable [[arheta remata]], which it is not lawful for a man to repeat.&quot; These words have rarely, so far as we know, been regarded by commentators as an allusion to the beatific visions of an &quot;initiated&quot;seer. But the phraseology is unequivocal. These things &quot;which it is not lawful to repeat,&quot; are hinted at in the same words, and the reason for it assigned, is the same as that which we find repeatedly expressed by Plato, Proclus, Iamblichus, Herodotus, and other classics. &quot;We speak WISDOM only among them who are PERFECT,&quot; says Paul; the plain and undeniable translation of the sentence being: &quot;We speak of the profounder (or final) esoteric doctrines of the Mysteries (which were denominated wisdom) only among them who are initiated.&quot;** So in relation to the &quot;man who was rapt into Paradise&quot; — and who was evidently Paul himself*** — the Christian word Paradise having replaced that of Elysium. To complete the proof, we might recall the words of Plato, given elsewhere, which show that before an initiate could see the gods in their purest light, he had to become liberated from his body; i.e., to separate his astral soul from it.**** Apuleius also describes his initiation into the Mysteries in the same way: &quot;I approached the confines of death; and, having trodden on the threshold of Proserpina, returned, having been carried through all the elements. In the depths of midnight I saw the sun glittering with a splendid light, together with the infernal and supernal gods, and to these divinities approaching, I paid the tribute of devout adoration.&quot;****<em>Thus, in common with Pythagoras and other hierophant reformers, Jesus divided his teachings into exoteric and esoteric. Following faithfully the Pythagoreo-Essenean ways, he never sat at a meal without saying &quot;grace.&quot; &quot;The priest prays before his meal,&quot; says Josephus, describing the Essenes. Jesus also divided his followers into &quot;neophytes,&quot; &quot;brethren,&quot; and the &quot;perfect,&quot; if we may judge by the difference he made between them. But his career at least as a public Rabbi, was of a too short duration to allow him to establish a regular school of his own; and with the exception, perhaps, of John, it does not seem that he had initiated any other apostle. The Gnostic amulets and talismans are mostly the emblems of the apocalyptic allegories. The &quot;seven vowels&quot; are closely related to the &quot;seven seals&quot;; and the mystic title Abraxas, partakes as much of the composition of Shem Hamphirosh, &quot;the holy word&quot; or ineffable name, as the name called: The word of God, that &quot;no man knew but he himself,&quot;</em>as John expresses it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 5, page 18</p>

<p>Ignatius Loyola’s Basque ancestors have been DNA tested and he, being a Basque, was R1b not J1 or J2, further confirming he was a European gentile, not a Semite.</p>

<p>Important is that the most vital figures to the establishment of the Jesuit Order, besides Loyola, who has been shown to have been a gentile, were not Jewish. Francis Borgia (who would become the third Superior general of the Jesuits) was the chief advisor to Loyola and it was Borgia who funded the printing and distribution of the Jesuit Spiritual Exercises, basically the meditative ritual book that is a hand-guide and way of life for every Jesuit. Borgia also funded the Jesuit colleges. Borgia was even responsible for getting the Exercises approved by the Pope:</p>

<p>On these Exercises were founded the great doctrine of the Company of Jesus; but the work no sooner began to get known than a tremendous storm was raised against it in the very midst of the Catholic church; and the Sorbonne condemned it, in 1535, as suspicious and contrary to Catholic doctrine. A like fortune befel it in Portugal, where the prelates declared it was fit for nothing but to turn the world mad. Within ten years, however, the Exercises, - thanks to Francis di Borgia, who had made strong representations in their favor - received the formal sanction of Paul III. (the author of the famous bull that revived the inquisition in Italy)</p>

<p>HP Blavatsky Theosophy or Jesuitism &quot;“What was the origin of that order? It may be stated in a few words. In the year 1534, on August 16th, an ex-officer and “Knight of the Virgin,” from the Biscayan Provinces, and the proprietor of the magnificent castle of Casa Solar – Ignatius Loyola, became the hero of the following incident. In the subterranean chapel of the Church of Montmartre, surrounded by a few priests and students of theology, he received their pledges to devote their whole lives to the spreading of Roman Catholicism by every and all means, whether good or foul; and he was thus enabled to establish a new Order. Loyola proposed to his six chief companions that their Order should be a militant one, in order to fight for the interests of the Holy seat of Roman Catholicism. Two means were adopted to make the object answer; the education of youth, and proselytism (apostolat). This was during the reign of Pope Paul III, who gave his full sympathy to the new scheme. Hence in 1540 was published the famous papal bull – Regimini militantis Ecclesiae (the regiment of the warring, or militant Church) – after which the Order began increasingly rapidly in numbers and power.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jewish Encyclopedia (Vol. 2, p. 497) admits that: “It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time (1905) the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure.”</p>

<p>“The Treaty of Paris of 1763 designated King George III “Arch-Treasurer and Prince Elector of the Holy Roman Empire.” And “according to the Encyclopedia Judaica [sic] the Rothschilds bear the title “Guardians of the Vatican Treasury.” The Vatican Treasury, of course, holds the imperial wealth of Rome. Imperial wealth grows in proportion to its victories in war — as the Jesuit empowerment Regimini militantis ecclesiae implies, the Church-at-War is more necessary than the Church-at-Peace.</p>

<p>According to H. Russell Robinson’s illustrated Armour of Imperial Rome, Caesarean soldiers protect themselves in battle with shields painted red. Since the soldiery is the State’s most valuable resource (the Council of Trent admitted this in preferring the Jesuits to all other religious orders), it is easy to understand why the red shield was identified with the very life of the Church. Hence, the appropriateness of the name Rothschild, German for “red shield.”</p>

<p>The appointment of Rothschild gave the black papacy absolute financial privacy and secrecy. Who would ever search a family of orthodox Jews for the key to the wealth of the Roman Catholic Church? I believe this appointment explains why the House of Rothschild is famous for helping nations go to war. It is fascinating that, as Meyer Rothschild’s sons grew into the family business, the firm took on the title Meyer Amschel Rothschild und Sohne, which gives us the notariqon MARS. Isn’t Mars the Roman God of War, whose heavenly manifestation is “the red planet”? There is powerful cabalah here, and there’s hardly an acre of inhabitable earth that hasn’t been affected by it in some way.”- Tupper Saussy: “Rulers of Evil”, p. 160-161</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cum nimis absurdum was a papal bull issued by Pope Paul IV dated 14 July 1555. It takes its name from its first words:[1] &quot;Since it is absurd and utterly inconvenient that the Jews, who through their own fault were condemned by God to eternal slavery...&quot;</p>

<p>The bull revoked all the rights of the Jewish community and placed religious and economic restrictions on Jews in the Papal States, renewed anti-Jewish legislation and subjected Jews to various degradations and restrictions on their personal freedom.</p>

<p>The bull established the Roman Ghetto and required the Jews of Rome, which had existed as a community since before Christian times and numbered about 2,000 at the time, to live in it. The Ghetto was a walled quarter with three gates that were locked at night. Under the bull, Jewish males were required to wear a pointed yellow hat, and Jewish females a yellow kerchief. Jews were required to attend compulsory Catholic sermons on the Jewish shabbat.</p>

<p>The bull also subjected Jews to various other restrictions such as a prohibition on property ownership and practising medicine among Christians. Jews were allowed to practice only unskilled jobs, as rag men, secondhand dealers or fish mongers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like the Jesuit La Civita Catholica magazine! let me guess youre being all paranoid about the protocols of zion ahahaha</p>

<p>&quot;A 1920 article in journal described Jews as &quot;the filthy element&quot; who &quot;were avid for money&quot; and who wanted to &quot;proclaim the communist republic tomorrow.&quot;[46]</p>

<p>As Hitler escalated the his anti-Jewish policies during the 1930s, the journal, according to Zuccotti (2000), not only failed to downplay its particular brand of anti-Judaism but repeated it more often.[47] In 1934, Enrico Rosa wrote two reviews of &quot;the notorious German anti-Semitic manual&quot; (Handbuch der Judenfrage).[47] According to Zuccotti (2000), Rosa found the authors guilty only of exaggeration and that the authors were applauded for equating Jews with Freemasons, describing Jews as the &quot;relentless irreconcilable enemies of Christ and of Christianity, particularly of integral and pure Christianity, the Catholicism of the Roman Church&quot;.[47] In 1936, the journal reported that &quot;if not all, still not a few Jews constitute a grave and permanent danger to society&quot; because of their economic and political influence.[47][48] The reviewer opined that the book&#39;s three options for dealing with &quot;the Jewish problem&quot;, i.e. assimilation, Zionism and ghettoization, were not feasible, thus suggesting that God must have reasons for placing Jews in Christian societies.[47]</p>

<p>In 1936 an article quoted a fellow Jesuit to prove that Jews were &quot;uniquely endowed with the qualities of parasites.[49] A series of articles in 1937 expanded on the theme of Jews who were &quot;a foreign body that irritates and provokes the reaction of the organism it has contaminated.&quot;[46] In 1937, &quot;La Civiltà Cattolica&quot; reviewed a book by Hilaire Belloc summarising Belloc&#39;s view that the &quot;Jewish problem&quot; could only be solved by &quot;elimination or segregation&quot; (elimination did not include destruction).[47] The reviewer rejected Belloc&#39;s option of expulsion (it being contrary to Christian charity) and also elimination by &quot;a friendly and gentle manner, through absorption&quot; since in his opinion it had &quot;been shown to be historically unachievable.&quot;[50] Zuccotti notes the reviewer didn&#39;t dispute Belloc&#39;s proposal for &quot;friendly segregation&quot; based on Jews having a separate nationality but places it in the context of rights denied to the Jews when Mussolini imposed anti-Jewish laws in 1938.[51][52] Zuccotti (2000) describes the language used in dealing with the &quot;Jewish problem&quot; as &quot;ominous in retrospect&quot;.[53] During the first half of 1937, the journal continued to run denunciations against the Jews but in the aftermath of the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge Father Mario Barbera (who had authored some of these strident attacks) for a brief period during the summer of 1937 changed course and, whilst repeating familiar accusations, called on Catholics to remove from their hearts any form of anti-Semitism and anything that might offend or humiliate Jews.[54] He would return to the older style of warnings a few months later.[55] The journal in 1938 wrote that Hungary could be saved from the Jews, who were &quot;disastrous for the religious, moral, and social life of the Hungarian people&quot;, only if the government &quot;forbids [Jewish] foreigners to enter the country&quot;.[56] In September 1938, three weeks after the Italian government marked all foreign Jews for expulsion and Jews were being harried and terrorised, the journal published and article asserting that &quot;anti-Christian sectarians&quot; who had granted Jews equality had brought together freemasonry and Judaism &quot;in persecuting the Catholic Church and elevating the Jewish race over Christians as much in hidden power as in manifest opulence.&quot;[57] In 1941 and 1942 the journal accused the Jews of being &quot;Christ Killers&quot; and being involved with ritual murder.[58] Michael Phayer notes that the journal continued to publish &quot;slander about the Jews even while they were being murdered en masse by German mobile killing squads.[59]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>HP Blavatsky Roots of Ritualism pg 10 : &quot;Can we say as much of the
immaculate daughters of the god of the Roman Catholic Church —
Anna and Mary? Yet, even to breathe that the Gospel narratives are
allegories too, as they would be most sacrilegious were they accepted
in their dead letter, constitutes in a Christian born the acme of
blasphemy!
Verily, they may whitewash and mask as much as they like the
god of Abraham and Isaac, they shall never be able to disprove the
assertion of Marcion, whodeniedthat theGod of Hate could be the
same as the “Father of Jesus.” Heresy or not, but the “Father in
Heaven” of the Churches remained since then a hybrid creatute; a
mixture between the Jove of the Pagan mobs and the “jealous God”
of Moses, exoterically the SUN, whose abode is in Heaven, or the sky,
esoterically. Does he not give birth to LIGHT “that shineth in Darkness,”
to the Day, the bright Dyaus, the Son, and is he not the MOST HIGH—
Deus Caelum? And is it not again Terra, the “Earth,”the ever
immaculate as the ever prolific Virgin who, fecundated by the ardent
embraces of her “Lord”—the fructifying rays of the Sun, becomes,
in this terrestrial sphere, the mother of all that lives and breathes on
her vast bosom? Hence, the sacredness of her products in Ritualism—
the bread and the wine. Hence also, the ancient messis, the great
sacrifice to the goddess of harvest {Ceres Eleusina, the Earth again):
messis, for the Initiates, missa for the profane,1 now transformed into the Christian mass or liturgy. The ancient oblation of the fruits of the
Earth to the Sun, the Deus Aitissimus, “the Most High,” the symbol
of the G A. O T. U. of the Masons to this day, became the foundation
of the most important ritual among the ceremonies of the new religion.
The worship offered to Osiris-Isis (the Sun and the Earth),2 to Bel
and the cruciform Astarte of the Babylonians; to Odin or Thor and
Friga, of the Scandinavians; to Belen and the Virgo Paritura of the
Celts; to Apollo and the Magna Mater of theGreeks;all these couples
having the same meaning, passed bodily to, and were transformed by,
the Christians into the LordGod or theHolyGhost descending upon
the Virgin Mary.
Deus Sol or Solus, the Father, was made interchangeable with
the Son: the “Father” in his noon glory, he became the “Son” at Sunrise,
when he was said to “be born.” This idea received its full
apotheosis annually on December the 25th, during the Vernal Solstice,
when the Sun—hence the solar gods of all the nations—was said to
be born. Natalis solis invicte. And the “precursor” of the resurrecting
Sun grows, and waxes strong, until the vernal equinox, when the god
Sol begins its annual course, under the sign of the Ram or the Lamb,
the first lunar week of the month. The 1st of March was feasted
throughout all pagan Greece, as its neomenia was Sacred to Diana.
Christian nations celebrate their Easter, for the same reason, on the
first Sunday that follows the full moon, at theVernalEquinox. With the
festivals of the Pagans, the canonicals of their priests and Hierophants
were copied by Christendom. Will this be denied? In his “Life of
Constantine” Eusebius confesses— thus saying, perhaps, theonly truth
he ever uttered in his life—that “in order to render Christianity more
attractive to the Gentiles, the priests (of Christ) adopted the
exterior vestments and ornaments used in the pagan cult.” He
might have added “their rituals” and dogmas also.&quot;</p>

<p>Ignatius Loyola’s Basque ancestors have been DNA tested and he, being a Basque, was R1b not J1 or J2, further confirming he was a European gentile, not a Semite.</p>

<p>Important is that the most vital figures to the establishment of the Jesuit Order, besides Loyola, who has been shown to have been a gentile, were not Jewish. Francis Borgia (who would become the third Superior general of the Jesuits) was the chief advisor to Loyola and it was Borgia who funded the printing and distribution of the Jesuit Spiritual Exercises, basically the meditative ritual book that is a hand-guide and way of life for every Jesuit. Borgia also funded the Jesuit colleges. Borgia was even responsible for getting the Exercises approved by the Pope:</p>

<p>On these Exercises were founded the great doctrine of the Company of Jesus; but the work no sooner began to get known than a tremendous storm was raised against it in the very midst of the Catholic church; and the Sorbonne condemned it, in 1535, as suspicious and contrary to Catholic doctrine. A like fortune befel it in Portugal, where the prelates declared it was fit for nothing but to turn the world mad. Within ten years, however, the Exercises, - thanks to Francis di Borgia, who had made strong representations in their favor - received the formal sanction of Paul III. (the author of the famous bull that revived the inquisition in Italy)</p>

<p>HP Blavatsky Theosophy or Jesuitism &quot;“What was the origin of that order? It may be stated in a few words. In the year 1534, on August 16th, an ex-officer and “Knight of the Virgin,” from the Biscayan Provinces, and the proprietor of the magnificent castle of Casa Solar – Ignatius Loyola, became the hero of the following incident. In the subterranean chapel of the Church of Montmartre, surrounded by a few priests and students of theology, he received their pledges to devote their whole lives to the spreading of Roman Catholicism by every and all means, whether good or foul; and he was thus enabled to establish a new Order. Loyola proposed to his six chief companions that their Order should be a militant one, in order to fight for the interests of the Holy seat of Roman Catholicism. Two means were adopted to make the object answer; the education of youth, and proselytism (apostolat). This was during the reign of Pope Paul III, who gave his full sympathy to the new scheme. Hence in 1540 was published the famous papal bull – Regimini militantis Ecclesiae (the regiment of the warring, or militant Church) – after which the Order began increasingly rapidly in numbers and power.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jewish Encyclopedia (Vol. 2, p. 497) admits that: “It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time (1905) the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure.”</p>

<p>“The Treaty of Paris of 1763 designated King George III “Arch-Treasurer and Prince Elector of the Holy Roman Empire.” And “according to the Encyclopedia Judaica [sic] the Rothschilds bear the title “Guardians of the Vatican Treasury.” The Vatican Treasury, of course, holds the imperial wealth of Rome. Imperial wealth grows in proportion to its victories in war — as the Jesuit empowerment Regimini militantis ecclesiae implies, the Church-at-War is more necessary than the Church-at-Peace.</p>

<p>According to H. Russell Robinson’s illustrated Armour of Imperial Rome, Caesarean soldiers protect themselves in battle with shields painted red. Since the soldiery is the State’s most valuable resource (the Council of Trent admitted this in preferring the Jesuits to all other religious orders), it is easy to understand why the red shield was identified with the very life of the Church. Hence, the appropriateness of the name Rothschild, German for “red shield.”</p>

<p>The appointment of Rothschild gave the black papacy absolute financial privacy and secrecy. Who would ever search a family of orthodox Jews for the key to the wealth of the Roman Catholic Church? I believe this appointment explains why the House of Rothschild is famous for helping nations go to war. It is fascinating that, as Meyer Rothschild’s sons grew into the family business, the firm took on the title Meyer Amschel Rothschild und Sohne, which gives us the notariqon MARS. Isn’t Mars the Roman God of War, whose heavenly manifestation is “the red planet”? There is powerful cabalah here, and there’s hardly an acre of inhabitable earth that hasn’t been affected by it in some way.”- Tupper Saussy: “Rulers of Evil”, p. 160-161</p>
