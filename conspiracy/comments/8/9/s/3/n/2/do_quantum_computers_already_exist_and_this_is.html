The interesting thing is, a while back there was a strange one day drop in Bitcoin suggesting someone got control of the network briefly which could only be possible with a huge number of conventional processors working in parallel.
What if quantum computers with thousands of qubits already exist, but their existence is classified in order to protect investments in vulnerable methods of encryption and Big Finance in general? last I heard the cost to replace current systems was astronomical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Articles about the D-Wave quantum computers are bizarre.<br/>
Every one I&#39;ve seen so far (even the one from years ago) gives the impression that nobody&#39;s really sure what the D-Wave are capable of. Critics keep saying that although it <em>technically</em> may be a quantum computer, that doesn&#39;t mean it performs much better than a conventional supercomputer. They never talk specifics, as if none of them have seen one of the computers perform.<br/>
Just weird.</p>

<p>Bingo, because they don&#39;t, it&#39;s just &quot;another type&quot; of computer</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of hype around quantum computers being able to &quot;crack current algorithms!&quot; but I think that&#39;s just PR</p>

<p>You can make new encryption with the same tech, and those encryption won&#39;t be able to be cracked by the same tech, so we&#39;re back to square one lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the whole high and low of it...</p>

<p>In a normal computer, each bit is either on or off.</p>

<p>In a quantum computer, each bit is either on, off, or &quot;unknown.&quot;</p>

<p>What can you do with this?  Nobody is really sure.  Having a third bit state sounds like a HUGE benefit (if you&#39;re a computer person), but having the state of it be &quot;unknown&quot; really limits the application.  There&#39;s a few things you can do, but mostly what you can do with quantum computers is add another zero to your venture capital investments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course the science behind it could have been faked on purpose (I&#39;m not saying so either way), but from what I learned about quantum computing-- the &quot;unknown&quot; state is actually a superposition of BOTH 0 and 1. If you &#39;look&#39; at the qubit, then it becomes a 0 or a 1.  As long as you don&#39;t check the state of the qubit, you can perform a large amount of parallel processing. From what I remember learning, this allowed you to come up with MANY potential &#39;answers&#39; to a problem and then when you view/measure the qubit you could somehow determine which one is correct.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while but I found it really interesting. I&#39;ll have to go look for it again.</p>

<p>Miners don&#39;t set the price of cryptocurrencies. Traders do. I also don&#39;t know how you think you could take over a network of over half a billion miners. Furthermore, you clearly know nothing about quantum computers if you think they&#39;re anywhere near being ready to mine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;A pre-defined schedule limits the total number of bitcoins so that they gradually approach a total of 21 million (ignoring those that have been lost through deleted or misplaced wallet files). The limit of 21 million bitcoins is &quot;hard-wired&quot; in to the protocol, and there will never be more bitcoins than this:&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right. I&#39;m actually a fucking dickhead so don&#39;t take anything I say seriously. At least, don&#39;t take my juvenile attempts to embarrass you seriously. </p>

<p>You&#39;re also right regarding how I should have answered you. So I&#39;ll do that here. I just want to get it across that I&#39;m no longer going to try and make a joke of this. </p>

<p>So you&#39;re talking about two different things. The AMOUNT of Bitcoin  could be called it&#39;s &quot;Circulating Supply&quot; (for this argument) while the VALUE of Bitcoin is how much one Bitcoin costs in USD/EUR/GBP etc.</p>

<p>So (at the moment) every ten minutes new Bitcoins are minted and added to the supply. That is, every ten minutes the AMOUNT of Bitcoin increases.</p>

<p>Now on to the VALUE. Let&#39;s say Bitcoin is only traded at one exchange. Let&#39;s say I go on to that exchange to purchase some Bitcoin. So THE LAST PRICE PAID for ANY AMOUNT OF BITCOIN is going to be the VALUE of Bitcoin across the world. Let&#39;s pretend the last price paid was 10,000$. So now I go on to the exchange to make my purchase. I check the order book (understanding the anatomy and function of an orderbook will help you better understand how the price is defined) and I see that someone is selling A PORTION of Bitcoin for the price of 9,000$. So I purchase 0.000001 BTC @ 9,000$/BTC. Now the VALUE of Bitcoin is 9,000$. Have I explained this well enough? I don&#39;t think I have but hopefully you can understand what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>One more time: the AMOUNT of Bitcoin is defined by how many whole Bitcoins are in circulation. The VALUE of Bitcoin is defined by what&#39;s last been paid for it. So in truth, the traders absolutely set the price of Bitcoin. </p>

<p>Talking of price manipulation or suppression though, I think one should read this: <a href="https://www.bronnen.net/user.php?/arch/res/1942.html">https://www.bronnen.net/user.php?/arch/res/1942.html</a></p>

<p>Interesting note: the article I&#39;ve left you HAS been deleted from the website it originally appeared. The content in the article IS very valuable, not just for cryptocurrency traders, but for everyone to gather some insight as to how markets which define the price of our existence are manipulated and suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope you&#39;ve explained it pretty well. And I thank you for not being a dick lol</p>

<p>I was under the impression that Bitcoin was based off of it&#39;s self like the us dollar..</p>

<p>I personally haven&#39;t researched much into it and what I did was a couple years ago so I wasn&#39;t even sure if what I was referring was still valid.</p>

<p>And since it is backed by other currency why do people feel it&#39;s safe from manipulation? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of Bitcoin as a competitor to fiat currencies, but as a family member. In truth, the primary function/market of Bitcoin has nothing to do with the state-issued currencies around the world. When you see things like &quot;Bitcoin falls to 6000$&quot; that&#39;s just commentary on the secondary function/market of Bitcoin, the secondary market being one of speculation. </p>

<p>Theoretically in the future Bitcoin could be worth 0$, yet two satoshis (0.00000002 BTC) could cover a trip to the shop for you to get some groceries. Know what I mean? The whole BTC:USD/GBP/EUR narrative is a secondary market. I suppose Bitcoin is a challenge, an alternative, to state-issued currencies. </p>

<p>(What gives a currency or token it&#39;s value? The number written on it? Not so much. It&#39;s more to do with the belief those participating in the trade have in the number that&#39;s represented on the currency or token. No fiat currency is &quot;backed up&quot; by anything by our belief and complicity in using it. Similarly, Bitcoin is not &quot;backed up&quot; by anything. {You could make an argument for the Bitcoin protocol and it&#39;s participators &quot;backing up&quot; Bitcoin})</p>

<p>So to answer your last question, I don&#39;t think anyone who actually trades cryptocurrencies seriously considers Bitcoin to be free from manipulation. If you read the article I left for you in the previous post you can get some insight into how the price IS manipulated.</p>

They will always have and be utilizing tech several decades ahead of the masses knowing about or using them. Just the way it goes (for most world powers honestly)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. You choose a public receiving address with loads of bitcoins and force hack the private spending key with the quantum computer. Not possible to do it right now with normal mainframes. You transfer some or all to an address you own and exchange it for IOTAs because apparently IOTA addresses are quantum computer hack safe. Peace of cake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll just throw this in:</p>

<p>Several redditors were almost troll-level debunking this conjecture that technology might outrace itself in regards cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Several other redditors calmly tried to point out that such an outcome is at least possible if not inevitable.</p>

<p>Who trolls for this kind of thing and then shits on people speaking their mind? And why would they think conspiracy theorists would just like say - &quot;Ya - you sound like you know more than I do, so... you win&quot; It&#39;s always a little bizarre when you get in to this layer.</p>
