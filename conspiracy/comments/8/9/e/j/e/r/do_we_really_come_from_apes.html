<p>Why reply to his post if you aren&#39;t going to read it? He already answered these questions:</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t just swim and then one day pop onto land. Rather, some species lived mostly in water and would visit the land occasionally (like some fishes still do today, like mudskippers) to mate or hunt.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s all it shows, and since evolution is a constant process, <em>all</em> fossils are technically transitional. This idea that only some are is an invention of people who <em>don&#39;t</em> actually understand evolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The video show sea creatures with no arms or legs, and the bam we are not fish, but walk on all 4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are still gaps, and assumptions being made. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will always be &quot;gaps&quot;. They get smaller and smaller every year that goes on, until people like you will be demanding one, long, uninterrupted chain of every single generation. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s something that&#39;s not an assumption: We have fossil proof of hundreds of thousands of species that did not exist...then did exist...then ceased to exist and were replaced by extremely similar species that were slightly better adapted to the environment. </p>

<p>Unless you think God or aliens are picking up and putting down a bunch of species over the course of millions of years to <em>create the illusion of evolution</em>, then there&#39;s nothing to talk about. Evolution is obvious by the mere fact that the fossil record shows that each species has a point of entrance and point of exit; as opposed to <em>all</em> the species existing at the beginning and slowly going extinct one after another.</p>

<p>read what I wrote above again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t explain why they can&#39;t add up, you just cited the beginning and end of an iteration and expressed incredulity that the spots in between could be filled in. Nobody is saying a creature is born with a fully functioning sonar detect out of nowhere. Rather, I could imagine a small mutation making a nose capable of feeling slight changes in air pressure, which might help it predict weather. Over time it might be sensitive enough to function sort of like an ear and &quot;hear&quot; things, at first very faintly and eventually more precisely. At some point <em>that</em> organ might mutate to hear higher and higher frequency vibrations, eventually beyond the audible range. If that creature happens to live in caves, this could lead to sonar like bats have. </p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s saying a nose turns into a sonar detector overnight, nobody, so you&#39;re refuting a strawman.</p>

<p>you&#39;re simply extrapolating. That is not proof. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any organ can become any other organ if it mutates enough and the mutations cause advantages. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>proof?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the advantages don&#39;t go in a straight line either, sometimes an organ will evolve for one use and then coincidentally also be sort-of useful for another thing, and that will re-set their evolutionary course in another direction. Ears likely came from gills, for instance. Since gills were made up of very tiny, sensitive membranes, it&#39;s not hard to imagine how they might be able to sense pressure waves in the water, which on land translates into ear-like capabilities that can be built on in successive generations.</p>

<p>again. You&#39;re just making shit up. You can also imagine a tiny elf that comes every 40, 000 year and gives creatures new features.  You&#39;d have to wait another 32,000 years to see it for yourself. it works very slow you see?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah sure, but w/o proper context the nuance you are introducing here makes it sound like Gould went back on himself and changed into a darwinist which isn&#39;t what happened.  Don&#39;t make the same mistake as the creationists... when having doubts about faith-based darwinism it is tempting to adopt a frame of the issue as a dichotomy that makes one side right just because the other side is wrong. Gould got misunderstood by people who&#39;s comprehension was limited due to the lure of this darwinian frame.  Gould didn&#39;t change his stance on darwinism, he changed his presentation to address this false frame because so many people were missing the point and tripping on the doormat as a way to avoid responding to Gould&#39;s primary argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fathom its outline with some understanding, enough to know that anybody who imagines that they truly fathom the depth of their existence is a deluded and ignorant fool. Although you base your question on an unknowable premise, indeed, you are correct: the statistical likelihood of my existence is precisely 100%. However, this has nothing to do with the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, or the multiverse theory, or any other cosmological speculation. It has to do with the simple, self-evident fact of my existence. </p>

<p>I would quibble also with your phrasing and fundamental assumption. &quot;God&quot; is a sophomoric idea that is the love of many a foolish ape. If we are to base our conclusions on what is knowable, on rational discourse and evidence, rather than mystical speculation, worthless anecdotes, and the guidance of generation after generation of self-deluded apes hacking their brains and bodies, rather than using the transpersonal cognitive and physical tools of Science, we are led to an inescapable conclusion, one that I&#39;ve never understood why people can&#39;t see. The only thing there really is nature. Anything that exists is, a priori, <strong>natural</strong>, and nothing has ever been demonstrated to exist that is not of-nature, and thus natural. Even an infinite universe producing infinite sub-universes, time-space bubbles of unfathomable duration, cannot be said to be anything other than nature. We&#39;re all just cogs in something turning. </p>

I&#39;ve been studying this for well over two decades; nothing in actual quantum physics should lead a truly informed person to the conclusion that the physical universe is controlled by consciousness, or that individuals are infinite, or that there is such a thing as &quot;pure energy.&quot; These are all the hallmarks of popular quantum mysticism, which has no connection whatsoever to the science of quantum physics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve fundamentally misunderstood all of modern physics if you think it takes consciousness to make atoms &quot;choose a location.&quot; That&#39;s the New Age/mystical/Deepak Chopra version of things.</p>

<p>My beliefs have nothing to do with Objective Reality. No ones beliefs do. Reality is as it is whether or not anything is there to observe it. Were it otherwise, the Universe simply couldn&#39;t exist in any meaningful sense, as there was nothing to perceive it in any way at .0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 of a second after the Big Bang.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course we are ape and come from apes. But the reason why we have physiognomical difference with our cousins might just be that we went through a semi aquatic stage in our development. I really like this Ted talk (link below). It certainly explain a lot.
Also the things that most people don&#39;t consider is the sea level as it changes drastically over the millennia. A lot of our ancestors bones might just lay 450 feet below the current sea level if we did go through a semi aquatic phase.

    <div class="md"><p>It should be more accurate called the &quot;aquatic ape hypothesis, and there&#39;s extremely little evidence in support of this hypothesis. Modern theories concerning humanity&#39;s origins in Africa are not based on an assumption for which people hoped to find evidence. Evidence instead led evolutionary biologists to conclude that humans must have come from Africa. The fossil record is pretty strong, but incomplete, but is greatly bolstered by the far stronger and more reliable DNA evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Darwin should not be your point of departure. He simply formulated the earliest theory of evolution by natural selection, with documentary evidence. The theory of evolution is so far beyond Darwin now. </p>

<p>Simply put, if we call the animals on Earth today to which humans are most closely related &quot;apes,&quot; then no, humans did not &quot;come from apes.&quot; Humans and apes have common ancestors. However, if we are to speculate as to what our common ancestor was, i.e. the most recent common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, then the creature that once existed is something that would almost assuredly be the sort of fellow you&#39;d look at and think, &quot;well that&#39;s pretty ape-like,&quot; so in another sense, yes, we came from apes. </p>

<p>The key point is that the &quot;ape&quot; from which we descended is no longer around, is cannot be confused with the apes that live in our contemporary world. </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t explain why they can&#39;t add up, you just cited the beginning and end of an iteration and expressed incredulity that the spots in between could be filled in. Nobody is saying a creature is born with a fully functioning sonar detect out of nowhere. Rather, I could imagine a small mutation making a nose capable of feeling slight changes in air pressure, which might help it predict weather. Over time it might be sensitive enough to function sort of like an ear and &quot;hear&quot; things, at first very faintly and eventually more precisely. At some point <em>that</em> organ might mutate to hear higher and higher frequency vibrations, eventually beyond the audible range. If that creature happens to live in caves, this could lead to sonar like bats have. </p>

<p>Nobody&#39;s saying a nose turns into a sonar detector overnight, nobody, so you&#39;re refuting a strawman.</p>
