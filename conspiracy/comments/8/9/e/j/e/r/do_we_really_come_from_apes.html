       I remember seen an article on the internet that said something along the lines of "we may look like apes with less hair but we don't come from apes". The widely accepted theory is that we come from apes, but I never felt like this was true, I don't belong to any religion, so my unbelief is not based on a religion belief or anything.

       Can anyone with more knowledge, tell me what Charles Darwin got right or wrong about or evolution?

       From my limited understanding, Darwin started the idea of evolution, but most modern scientific understanding of evolution has little in similarities to Darwin's original beliefs.

       In 1999, a study emphasized that while molecular genetic data seem to support the origin of dogs from wolves, dogs may have descended from a now extinct species of canid whose closest living relative was the wolf. The dog's lineage may have been contributed to from a ghost population.

        We find that none of the wolf lineages from the hypothesized domestication centers is supported as the source lineage for dogs, and that dogs and wolves diverged 11,000–16,000 years ago in a process involving extensive admixture and that was followed by a bottleneck in wolves.

       The theory is apes and humans came from a common ancestor. This is the missing link everyone talks about, we have no fossil record of this creature. I find evolution from a single cell to a human hard to believe. I know one thing God created us. Evolution can still work with God in the picture.

       Yeah we are talking about very small changes over a long long time. I would think we would find tons of transitional fossils through out the time line. Like when we came from the ocean, imagine it, we were fish like creatures  then, and one day we started trying to go on land. Where are the fossils of those creatures starting to grow legs overtime? I can only imagine the process going from water to land had to take millions if not billions of years, we should see in the fossil record some transitional fossils.

       All living things were in the ocean at one point according to evolution. I am having a hard time seeing that transition from water to land. One day an animal started to come to the surface, naturally it does not live on the land so it dies. These creatue/creatures kept doing this over and over until lungs evolved. Why would they do this? What would motivate the creatures to come to land, they cant survive on land, why would they continue to try?

       My understanding of evolution is at one point ALL living creatures lived in the ocean, they lived, ate, and died in the ocean, during that time there was not a creature that sometimes went to land. If this wrong, tell me how? So if my understanding is correct, at some point a creature that always lived in the water, decided to try and start going on land, and that very first attempt to do so would have killed it, because it can't live on land.

       Well if they stayed on the land long enough it would. I'm trying  to get people to think about this harder. I don't understand the creatures motivation to go land, another poster pointed out that no predators were on the land, so that's possibly why they wanted to go to land, however, if they got on the land and stayed they eventually die. So millions of generations of this creature kept going to land to die, then evolution kicked in and these creatures started to evolve lungs to breath.

       Multiple fish try to do it, the vast majority die. One in a million has a mutation which allows it to survive for a few seconds, which is just long enough to evade a predator and then slip back into the water. That fish has babies which can all do the same thing. Repeat.

       So we have always been human, and we just changed appearance? There has to be a missing link somewhere on the line cause supposedly we were living in the ocean at one point. Didn't walk up right and have arms at that point. So we're are all these fossils were fish started to grow arms slowly?

       Process took billions of years. It's a very slow process. What the video does not show is transitional fossils. The video show sea creatures with no arms or legs, and the bam we are not fish, but walk on all 4. This is my problem, and dr. Carson problem, there should be a ton of transitional fossils, There are still gaps, and assumptions being made.

       That's all it shows, and since evolution is a constant process,
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       fossils are technically transitional. This idea that only some are is an invention of people who
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       actually understand evolution.

      <p>
       There will always be "gaps". They get smaller and smaller every year that goes on, until people like you will be demanding one, long, uninterrupted chain of every single generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's something that's not an assumption: We have fossil proof of hundreds of thousands of species that did not exist...then did exist...then ceased to exist and were replaced by extremely similar species that were slightly better adapted to the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you think God or aliens are picking up and putting down a bunch of species over the course of millions of years to
       <em>
        create the illusion of evolution
       </em>
       , then there's nothing to talk about. Evolution is obvious by the mere fact that the fossil record shows that each species has a point of entrance and point of exit; as opposed to
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       the species existing at the beginning and slowly going extinct one after another.

       Human's didn't "come" from "apes".
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans and apes have a common ancestor. Just like poodles and wolves had a common ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
       A long time ago, they branched off. Their evolutionary lines
       <em>
        forked
       </em>
       . One line continued on to eventually become poodles. Another line continued on to become modern day wolves. They evolved different traits at different rates but had a common ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans and apes shared a common ancestor, but forked off a long time ago, and evolved different traits at different rates. (Ours happened to be intelligence).

       You watch too much X-MEN. I get it dude, I've taken the same courses in school and uni as you. I've watch the same Nova, BBC, nature and discovery (back when it was an actually a good science channel) shows as you.  I used to buy into it as well. But I simply don't anymore. No matter how many time you change the shape and size a species nose (micro) that does NOT mean that there is a chance you're going to have a child that is born with  a sonar detector on its face! no matter how many years. Humans have bread dogs crazy! The evolution of dogs are a great example! no matter how many times you change a dog, you'll always end up with a dog, and at no point, any of these dogs will end up with a 5mw laser gun on their head!

       fox move from warm to cold snowy area. Some fox have lighter fur. They survive. Their kids will have lighter hair. they survive. The ones in bright orange get eaten up by the eagles. More whites  ones breed. Now you have white fox! congrats. at no point, any of them, grew a fucking twisted unicorn horn. YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT HAPPENS. NOT ME.

       You didn't explain why they can't add up, you just cited the beginning and end of an iteration and expressed incredulity that the spots in between could be filled in. Nobody is saying a creature is born with a fully functioning sonar detect out of nowhere. Rather, I could imagine a small mutation making a nose capable of feeling slight changes in air pressure, which might help it predict weather. Over time it might be sensitive enough to function sort of like an ear and "hear" things, at first very faintly and eventually more precisely. At some point
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       organ might mutate to hear higher and higher frequency vibrations, eventually beyond the audible range. If that creature happens to live in caves, this could lead to sonar like bats have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody's saying a nose turns into a sonar detector overnight, nobody, so you're refuting a strawman.

       proof?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sometimes the advantages don't go in a straight line either, sometimes an organ will evolve for one use and then coincidentally also be sort-of useful for another thing, and that will re-set their evolutionary course in another direction. Ears likely came from gills, for instance. Since gills were made up of very tiny, sensitive membranes, it's not hard to imagine how they might be able to sense pressure waves in the water, which on land translates into ear-like capabilities that can be built on in successive generations.

       again. You're just making shit up. You can also imagine a tiny elf that comes every 40, 000 year and gives creatures new features.  You'd have to wait another 32,000 years to see it for yourself. it works very slow you see?

       I thought science was all about evidence and not "well, it -could- happen". Scientologist claim Xeeno or something sent alien soles into volcanoes on earth. That could happen i guess. I mean your story is as fantastic as that. If there are billions of galaxies and billions of billions of planets and billions of years i guess you can have advance aliens who came here with some other alien soles. could happen. now prove it didn't happen.

       Along with many other researchers in the field,

        Gould's works were sometimes deliberately taken out of context by creationists as "proof" that scientists no longer understood how organisms evolved.

       [82] Gould himself corrected some of these misinterpretations and distortions of his writings in later works.[83]

       yeah sure, but w/o proper context the nuance you are introducing here makes it sound like Gould went back on himself and changed into a darwinist which isn't what happened.  Don't make the same mistake as the creationists... when having doubts about faith-based darwinism it is tempting to adopt a frame of the issue as a dichotomy that makes one side right just because the other side is wrong. Gould got misunderstood by people who's comprehension was limited due to the lure of this darwinian frame.  Gould didn't change his stance on darwinism, he changed his presentation to address this false frame because so many people were missing the point and tripping on the doormat as a way to avoid responding to Gould's primary argument.

       I have investigating such claims for thirty years. It is all based on stupid assertions of conspiracies and unfounded or extremely infeasible interpretations of ideas recorded by profoundly ignorant ancient scribes, and woven into fantastical narratives that represent the death of rationality and critical thought. Law enforcement agencies and espionage agencies do not possess crucial information about humanity's origins. It's a fantasy world. I used to believe as you do, but my eyes have been opened. Reality is much more interesting, and far more exotic and strange than any tales involving ancient aliens and modern conspiracies.

       I fathom its outline with some understanding, enough to know that anybody who imagines that they truly fathom the depth of their existence is a deluded and ignorant fool. Although you base your question on an unknowable premise, indeed, you are correct: the statistical likelihood of my existence is precisely 100%. However, this has nothing to do with the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, or the multiverse theory, or any other cosmological speculation. It has to do with the simple, self-evident fact of my existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would quibble also with your phrasing and fundamental assumption. "God" is a sophomoric idea that is the love of many a foolish ape. If we are to base our conclusions on what is knowable, on rational discourse and evidence, rather than mystical speculation, worthless anecdotes, and the guidance of generation after generation of self-deluded apes hacking their brains and bodies, rather than using the transpersonal cognitive and physical tools of Science, we are led to an inescapable conclusion, one that I've never understood why people can't see. The only thing there really is nature. Anything that exists is, a priori,
       <strong>
        natural
       </strong>
       , and nothing has ever been demonstrated to exist that is not of-nature, and thus natural. Even an infinite universe producing infinite sub-universes, time-space bubbles of unfathomable duration, cannot be said to be anything other than nature. We're all just cogs in something turning.

       You are an infinite being.  This physical universe is controlled mentally.  This is why at the tiniest level, atoms and smaller, it's all energy.  And that energy is controlled by your being.  Study quantum physics.

       I see that you have a deep, Deepak Chopra-level of minunderstanding of quantum physics. I've been studying this for well over two decades; nothing in actual quantum physics should lead a truly informed person to the conclusion that the physical universe is controlled by consciousness, or that individuals are infinite, or that there is such a thing as "pure energy." These are all the hallmarks of popular quantum mysticism, which has no connection whatsoever to the science of quantum physics.

       You've fundamentally misunderstood all of modern physics if you think it takes consciousness to make atoms "choose a location." That's the New Age/mystical/Deepak Chopra version of things.

       My beliefs have nothing to do with Objective Reality. No ones beliefs do. Reality is as it is whether or not anything is there to observe it. Were it otherwise, the Universe simply couldn't exist in any meaningful sense, as there was nothing to perceive it in any way at .0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 of a second after the Big Bang.

       Of course we are ape and come from apes. But the reason why we have physiognomical difference with our cousins might just be that we went through a semi aquatic stage in our development. I really like this Ted talk (link below). It certainly explain a lot.
Also the things that most people don't consider is the sea level as it changes drastically over the millennia. A lot of our ancestors bones might just lay 450 feet below the current sea level if we did go through a semi aquatic phase.
The Ted talk in question:

       I think the semi aquatic stage makes sense. I'd have to find a source but I believe it has been theorized that our anscestors went through a bottle neck period where our population mostly existed on the bottom coast of Africa, leading to a seafood filled diet. It would make sense that the ones with less hair would have an easier time surviving to avoid drag resistance and avoiding staying wet and cold

       Apparently there was more than one bottleneck. But the most severe was approx 80k years ago. Went from millions to less than 5k in population. That was deducted from DNA analysis from worldwide population. In the early 2000's. The thing that amazed me is that Neanderthal left Africa 480k years ago. More than 200k years separation before we meet them again.

       what about the idea that we actually, at one point, evolved to be better suited for living in the water? And then we migrated up onto land. Pretty much completely dismissed by now but interesting to think that there could be many different parts to the puzzle that we are ignorantly ignoring.

       It should be more accurate called the "aquatic ape hypothesis, and there's extremely little evidence in support of this hypothesis. Modern theories concerning humanity's origins in Africa are not based on an assumption for which people hoped to find evidence. Evidence instead led evolutionary biologists to conclude that humans must have come from Africa. The fossil record is pretty strong, but incomplete, but is greatly bolstered by the far stronger and more reliable DNA evidence.

       Darwin should not be your point of departure. He simply formulated the earliest theory of evolution by natural selection, with documentary evidence. The theory of evolution is so far beyond Darwin now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put, if we call the animals on Earth today to which humans are most closely related "apes," then no, humans did not "come from apes." Humans and apes have common ancestors. However, if we are to speculate as to what our common ancestor was, i.e. the most recent common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans, then the creature that once existed is something that would almost assuredly be the sort of fellow you'd look at and think, "well that's pretty ape-like," so in another sense, yes, we came from apes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key point is that the "ape" from which we descended is no longer around, is cannot be confused with the apes that live in our contemporary world.

       You didn't explain why they can't add up, you just cited the beginning and end of an iteration and expressed incredulity that the spots in between could be filled in. Nobody is saying a creature is born with a fully functioning sonar detect out of nowhere. Rather, I could imagine a small mutation making a nose capable of feeling slight changes in air pressure, which might help it predict weather. Over time it might be sensitive enough to function sort of like an ear and "hear" things, at first very faintly and eventually more precisely. At some point
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       organ might mutate to hear higher and higher frequency vibrations, eventually beyond the audible range. If that creature happens to live in caves, this could lead to sonar like bats have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody's saying a nose turns into a sonar detector overnight, nobody, so you're refuting a strawman.
