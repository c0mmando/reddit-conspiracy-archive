If there is ever an alien attack, it should be assumed that it's the government attacking us, and staging the entire ordeal as being extraterrestrial in origin.

       much of the science behind aerodynamics  and flight in general  is based on  the force of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we need so much fuel to fly is to overcome gravity.  If we didn't need to over come gravity we would be able to use much less fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, and this probably even more important, are G-forces.  The G in that stands for gravity (in case you didnt know).  Planes can rip apart if G forces become to great - pilots can pass out as well.  Obviously not good.  This limits what we can design in terms of shape, size, speed, crew, and probably more.  Being able to create something that can counter act gravity means G forces are no longer a limitation.  We can build crafts that can go faster for longer with little to no stress on the pilot or craft.

      <p>
       No idea how something like anti gravity would work, but you wont need lift if you aren't dealing with gravity and like I was saying above that means you less limits on what you can do.

       g-force is a unit of acceleration, where 1 g-force is defined as the acceleration due to gravity on Earth. You experience g-forces from acceleration, not from gravity. When you hope in a centrifuge like the ones used to train pilots or astronauts you experience a lot of g-forces because your acceleration is very large, not because gravity is stronger. If you went to a zero gravity environment and accelerated extremely fast, you would still tear your machine apart and pass out because gravity has nothing to do with g-forces except defining the unit.

       ok cool, so that makes sense.  Scratch what I said about the g-forces then.  I'm now wondering if an anti-gravity device could still be able to be used in a way to counter those g-forces if used in the proper way?  For example if you're in that centrifuge but have an anti gravity device pushing on you in the opposite direction could that negate the g-force?

       No, it really doesn't make sense. The damaging effects of g-forces come from electromagnetic interactions, not gravitational ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in a centrifuge and pass out, it's because of electromagnetic interactions. The centrifuge is held together by electromagnetic bonds between and within molecules. When you sit in the centrifuge, you don't fall through it because the electromagnetic forces repulse you. As the centrifuge starts moving, the electromagnetic repulsions force you to move along with the centrifuge... and so on. Having an "anti-gravity in the opposite direction" doesn't really make sense and doesn't really solve the problem.

       If they can solve for intergalactic travel, I’m goin to guess they’ve figured that out too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s no upper limit to the technology they may posses, and no lower limit to our potential to misunderstand the laws of the universe.  We may understand far less than we realize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like our ancestors, we think we’ve got this all figured out, and just like our ancestors, we’re probably getting a lot of important things wrong.  It’s a perfect example of the Dunning Kruger effect - the knowledge needed to assess the level our out understanding is the same knowledge we’d lack to properly do so.

       I have a possible idea about this.
We know that gravity affects time, specifically that the higher the gravitational pull, the more time slows down.
So it makes sense that anti-gravity would do the opposite, and cause time to speed up within the anti-gravity field.
Therefore a smaller acceleration within the field could appear as a much larger acceleration to an observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the pilot/crew would then not be accelerating so quickly (at least from their perspective), they would be put under less g-forces, even though to an observer it would appear that the craft is accelerating at impossible rates.

       Actually this whole thing is nonsense. The number one factor in airplanes is aerodynamic drag, theres not a lot of engineering thats goes into planes to account for gravity.

       The “reason we need so much fuel to fly” is aerodynamic drag, not gravity.

He states in the text is says “By means of the power latent in the mercury which sets the driving whirlwind in motion, a man sitting inside may travel a great distance in the sky…”

       I was highly disappointed when I learned Edgar Fouche was a fake. TR-3B's are the coolest hidden technology ive heard about. I heard you can get from the US to Australia in 14 minutes (if I remember correctly). Pretty neat to think about. And how did we get to this point? Its my belief we reverse-engineered an extraterrestrial UFO. I also feel like religion has been created to explain what we dont understand, like aliens :)

       theres not a single scientific experiment in the history of man that has resulted in altering gravity at all.

       Scientists cant even display the existence of either the graviton or gravity waves.

       real antigravity would have far reaching benefits across the world and would likely revolutionize all industries.

       If we are talking about the plausibility of anti=gravity at the present moment, we are presumably talking about evidence for that. If your point was "the government keeps some things secret", that's believed by everyone.

       given what has been demonstrated in the public domain this isnt possible. Plus if you understand anything about physics, you would realize that the second link in your commment is completely rediculous. Its like somethign out of a bad science fiction movie.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Townsend Brown discovered that it is possible to create an artificial gravity field by charging an electrical capacitor to a high-voltage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brown's experiments had launched a new field of investigation which came to be known as electrogravitics, the technology of controlling gravity through the use of high-voltage electric charge.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       they lay out specifically how to replicate the antigravity here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He specially built a capacitor which utilized a heavy, high charge-accumulating (high K-factor) dielectric material between its plates and found that when charges with between 70,000 to 300,000 volts, it would move in the direction of its positive pole. When oriented with its positive side up, it would proceed to lose about 1 percent of it's weight.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       yet if i, or literally any other human being on earth tried this, it would fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       do people seriously believe this stuff? If this was true there would be antigravity technology all over the place. theres so many more places antigrav can be used than just flying planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly flying planes using antigravity is like the most boring thing you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       unless brown had access to some magic material like element zero from mass effect this website is a complete joke. And i feel bad for anyone dumb enough to fall for it.

       why specifically would this research happen only at a military compound and not in a university research lab like most experiments?
      </p>
      <p>
       Given what we know already about it, (highly pressured mercury accelerated by nuclear energy) why hasn't literally any other university published literally anything on it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or for that matter, why hasn't literally any company produced anything like this? Like i had mentioned before, technology like this could literally change the world forever, and would single handedly make them one of the biggest corporations in the world with the patent to this technology.

       That's pretty much what he is saying. As to researchers not approaching anything near that technology, the idea is that the government stops/silences/recruits anyone that is beginning research into the subject. The documentary Unacknowledged on Netflix goes a lot more in depth into this theory and even provides some pretty damning evidence and testimonials, I'd highly recommend it.

       what?
      </p>
      <p>
       i never once came to that conclusion. I'm simply asserting that a technology this valuable would have been discovered by at least one other research firm. Especially when they just so plainly state how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is no one else researching this? Like i said this technology would revolutionize the world, so why hasnt any one else tried to replicate it?
      </p>

       Why arent there published papers at the very least show the initial workings of altering gravity feilds. Im not even talking about exerting enough control over gravitational feilds to maintain flight. Just literally any paper that claims gravity can be altered at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       why doesnt any of this research exist?

       I've talked before on Reddit (buried in my comments) about when me and a group of friends saw a TR-3B near Rogersville, Missouri. It was the craziest thing in my life. It hovered just a few hundred feet in the air, turned over to it's side and zipped away in the blink of an eye. Unworldly... For years I would draw pictures of it trying to describe it to others and one day I saw its image come on an Ancient Aliens episode. I about shit myself, I didn't realize other people had heard or seen of these.

       There will be minor conflicts certainly.  We are very violent but this is being diminished by reducing testosterone in men.

       By providing technology to reduce the need for muscle mass in work, and by adding certain chemicals to both water and the food supply (this is why there are fast food restaurants everywhere), testosterone is reduced and war eventually becomes unthinkable.

       I've been thinking about this. We see all this manipulation, but what if the NWO (or the ones going for a one world government) are actually with good intentions? Of course such thing would require death, wars and shit like that but it's all for the greater good.

       The NWO is simply doing what they are told.  Our Friends want us to survive, prosper, and eventually become a peaceful society as part of a broader civilization.  The Friends now control all WMDs so wars will occur only at what we consider the periphery of the First World (Iraq, Syria, Africa).

       I find it interesting that you chose to cite
       <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-testosterone-alone-doesnt-cause-violence/">
        this
       </a>
       and only this.  First of all, the "muscle mass" idea doesn't seem to be a point of data but a point of speculation on the part of the researchers who are attempting to justify their result with a possible cause.  The only justification seems to be an internalized social bias that seems to think testosterone is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But secondly, the more pertinent claim I was making came from these articles:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.medicaldaily.com/estrogen-female-sex-hormone-may-influence-aggression-both-men-and-women-318954">
        https://www.medicaldaily.com/estrogen-female-sex-hormone-may-influence-aggression-both-men-and-women-318954
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2009/10/4306/estrogen-link-male-aggression-sheds-new-light-sex-specific-behaviors">
        https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2009/10/4306/estrogen-link-male-aggression-sheds-new-light-sex-specific-behaviors
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The aggression appears to involve testosterone
       <em>
        undergoing estrogen aromatization
       </em>
       which means that the testosterone isn't the only implicated hormone involved.  Moreover, that implies the necessary effect could also be caused by estrogen in the right circumstances.  The fact also remains that testosterone and estrogen are at work in both men and women in different proportions.  Disrupting the hormones to reduce testosterone not only weakens men but makes them much more susceptible to developmental disorders.  So, merely implicating testosterone alone is not only inaccurate but it has a distinctly anti-male tone to it.  Especially when coupled with the implication that
       <em>
        chemical castration
       </em>
       is something that should be normalized or treated as good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens or no aliens, it's a suggestion I find to be morally wrong because it's harming a distinct set of humans for what some of them might allegedly do under the influence of a necessary and normal part of their biology.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh, gee.  You went for the Trump is evil schick.  The thing is, despite your personal distaste for Trump, the US has not entered any new wars.  Moreover, since he's been in office and

       appears to be coming to a negotiation table.

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Shall we to blame her "testosterone poisoning" and "hypercaloric" meat headedness for being a
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       war criminal?  I think not!  Rather, there's more to this than just "testosterone=violence" and shame on you for dragging politics into this discussion with no good reason other than passive-aggressively trying to cast Trump as a violent meathead.  Shame!
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's throw in some more research on the topic, though.  How about the study indicating that
       <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21722877-european-history-answer-queens-especially-married-ones-who-gets-more-wars-kings">
        European queens
       </a>
       were significantly more implicated in wars than men?  Makes sense, they probably felt they had to justify their position.  Even so, there goes 1 myth about gender bellicosity.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how about the fact that "
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence">
        more than 40% of domestic violence victims are male
       </a>
       ?"  Yet, more "testosterone poisoning" for the womenfolk, I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I've been saving a ream of these articles demonstrating that women aren't perfect angels as far as violence is concerned.  I might just cite a few to show you what "low testosterone" can do for causing violence:

       But to return to the topic at hand: I think a much more pertinent issue that
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       correlate with criminality is: Low Intelligence, a history of being a victim of abuse and an excess of unjust incarcerations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first thing to note is that the
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bell+curve+intelligence+gender&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=iu&amp;amp;ictx=1&amp;amp;fir=ltM9ZBJPMAqI8M%253A%252CTtsf7_270hB_nM%252C_&amp;amp;usg=__Bg2EOWckoMGyBWDlISOBej_nHeU%3D&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH2sCpkKLaAhUKna0KHe6gCG8Q9QEIMDAA#imgrc=_">
        bell curve
       </a>
       of intelligence for men and women is such that the tail ends for men on both sides is wider.  On average, this means you're more likely to find men with higher or lower than average intelligence whereas women are statistically more normal.  Because of the larger variability on the tail end, it's much more likely you find extremely low intelligence males that are unable to adapt to bad social circumstances and are more likely to commit violence because of these circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       More intelligent prisoners tended to be less likely to be violent overall:

        https://sacsconsult.com.au/whats-link-intelligence-violent-behaviour/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Abuse tends to depress intelligence:

      </p>
      <p>
       All in all, I think that if this really is what the aliens think then they've been dun lied to by an anti-male establishment that seems hell bent on making innocent men the scapegoats for all its evils.

       IQ scores ARE rising on average for a select group as university brings together people with higher IQs.  This has been a phenomenon since WW II.   Call them the top quintile.  The bottom 80% are mostly drones, though they are useful for menial labors.  The top quintile is preserved while the bottom is gradually reduced.  They will be peacefully reduced in size (population size in first world is dropping) by reducing testosterone.  Eventually populations in low IQ regions, generally around the Equator, will have to be reduced as well but that’s for later in this century.

       Hmm.  Interesting.  I'll admit now that you've introduced some of these other thoughts it seems a lot more explanatory of the reality I'm observing.  However, I'm still not sure I'm coming to the same conclusion about the "friendliness" of these aliens if this is true and I'll explain as we go.

       This might corroborate the current

       But I'd particularly like to focus on this statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       Well, this is the thing that doesn't sit right with the Flynn Effect.  You see a massive campaign of reproduction strategies that involve mixing lower IQs and higher IQs in the West and yet allegedly the IQ scores are going up.  Hybrid vigor, allegedly.  But that doesn't make sense since the genes are usually traceable and a Punnet Square in this situation would involve a reduction in available intelligence genes.  Furthermore, culture and the like are getting less complex for the majority of people as is evident from art and music.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, even worse, the major exception to the net loss in population growth is sub-saharan Africa which contradicts the idea that higher IQ is the real target.  In Africa, the IQ scores are, on average, 2 standard deviations below the mean and there is a clear genetic reason.  These genetic results are highly reproducible using multiple testing methods many of which do not involve anything like language that could cause bias because these tests rely only on raw nerve transmission speed.  I assume this is why the political left hates books like the Bell Curve since it and similar studies counteract the narrative that all races are equal in distribution of intelligence but I am starting to think it is not merely fear of racism that's driving this activity.  Such knowledge also would reveal a program that they don't want the world to be aware of.  Even if they are "friendly" these aliens seem to have little respect for informed consent which makes them highly suspicious from the standpoint of a rational democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, these additional variables suggest that IQ isn't the target but rather something else.  Allow me to propose a counter hypothesis to the idea the Aliens are our "friends."  I'm thinking something similar to the
       <a href="http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Aschen">
        Aschen
       </a>
       "sterilize and conquer" policy but less universal to all humanity because there's still something that the aliens want from the remaining humans.  Zecharias Sitchin actually provides a reasonable model of what they're probably going for.  Hell, it might even be the same Annunaki aliens from before that allegedly engineered the earliest humans as sterile slaves.  Sterilization is only directed at certain groups of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consequently, the aliens intended to use the local population as a slave class to produce resources they want like gold.  Now they want to recreate the situation they had in the past.  They probably had to do this because of the oblique orbit of their star system and they're just now returning after 10,000 years or so.  Anyway, the aliens needed the high IQ people to think that they are promoting "world peace" despite the alarmingly low birth rates in western civilization.  But the real intention was to destroy western civilization from within and remove anyone with an IQ large enough to compete with their dominance.  Democracy, as demonstrated by the American republic, tend to introduce the conditions for the abolition of slavery.  This is precisely what they don't want.  It struck me as odd that the political left seemed to be acting like we're still in the 1960s with Jim Crow laws with claims that African Americans are still oppressed.  The inordinate progressive focus on racism seems designed to induce people looking at it to become more racist as a response to the insanity.  I think this cognitive dissonance can be explained by this newer hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also explains the massive cultural propaganda campaigns against Caucasians and Asians in their own countries which have led to the growth of anti-male sentiments which are causing the reactions from the Men's Rights Activists and MGTOW to adapt against the extremism.  Local people in these regions are supposed to be "multicultural" and never pine for a place where there's homogeny with similar individuals.  Yet, ironically, communism seems to be the promoted ideals from the media here which is counterindicated by a lack of homogeny.  The only way that ideology actually works is when people aren't intelligent enough to think about the implications.  I think this issue is because the populations that have sufficient IQs to pose a threat to such a campaign because it will be obvious that this is what is going on if someone stops to think for a minute.  That is corroborated by the inverse effect that seems to be happening in South Africa.  The minority of Caucasians are being forcibly ejected from their land as Apartheid is reinstated in the opposite direction.  I couldn't really explain that paradox but now I've got a good handle on why it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       That also explains the reason the West was flooded with Islamists with the intent of depressing local IQ scores and slaughtering those who didn't comply.  The Flynn Effect seems to be more of a smokescreen to cover up the effects of the sterilization policy and discussion of IQ scores was suppressed from common discourse to cover up the scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taken together, your hypothesis and my counterhypothesis, this is probably the issue that led to the current schism in the New World Order we're observing.  The Rothschild+Saudi+Clinton/Bush/Soros "global international corporate" group was backing the alien's policy.  So
       <em>
        these
       </em>
       are the friendlies that the Podesta emails referred to.  I was wondering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the new group of "global nationalists/patriots" saw it as a threat to the historic culture and viability of of western democratic societies and rebelled with the intent of stopping the plan.  The first to rebel was Putin.  Then Trump and Brexit.  That idea would go a long way to explaining why the old guard hates Donald Trump with such a passion.  He's mucking up the agenda of getting rid of western civilization entirely by doing exactly what would sideline the policy: reviving the traditional role of males as providers and defenders of society from outside threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll level with you.  The idea aliens were involved is certainly an idea I myself have kicked around.  There's just too much that's defying normal human behavior here for it to be simple human insanity driving it.  But I'll be more direct: Why do you think these aliens are 'friendly' rather than opportunists trying to manipulate humans to being serfs?

       This is true. But there is academia and they are continuously making discoveries. So academics have a decent idea of what is possible. Everything from the nuclear bomb to stealth technology was understood by contemporary academia as possible before the government started work on it and certainly before it came out. I think its unlikely this kind of tech has been discovered without anyone in academia thinking its possible.

       There are a lot of powerful research technologies that come out in even Master's level papers and of course doctorate papers.  Then it disappears never to be heard of again.  Its hard to know what doesn't pan out but certainly some of it is just taken over by the military / deep state and the researchers are given huge budgets and told that they can do all kinds of cool stuff but it needs to happen within the castle walls.  Its instant patronage for possibly life but they basically own you since they won't allow you to just go and work for another person.  Its the ultimate non-compete agreement.

       it is exactly the best brains that are yanked out of the public sector and assigned to the black budget projects. they also just steal any useful research wherewer they can find them, often leaving nothing behind or destroying everything, or denying further funding, so only they can have the know-how.   when this goes on for generations eventually the vast majority of the academics will be behind of the 'black' state of the art science made possible by the sharpest intellects and matching budgets.  think breakaway civ almost. the few academics that can grasp whats going on would be too few and too weak to resist government opression or just plain murdered by the deep state.

       Talking about how public projects get yanked into secrecy, in WA we have a company called Stellar Photonics who work with energy weapons and plasma bursts, maybe 10 years ago they had a new laser rifle that could shoot up to a mile and switch between lethal and non-lethal. Seemed very legit and they got pentagon funding, now there is no news or other trail that i can find lol.

       iirc they could not find a material that could handle the range of temps and the expansion and contraction that comes with that.  they would calculate the fuel loss into its range as it taxied out, and of course would not fill it up until the last possible moment

       The prototype for the SR-71 first flew in 1957, so it's actually tech from the 1950's.
      </p>
      <p>
       And TR-3B's and similar are going to seem like alien tech when finally revealed officially.     What we need to know more of is just how good is the holographic tech or similar to be able to stage fully realistic "alien" attacks?  Because the one thing about the gov't staging a false flag alien attack is that most likely they will destroy and entire city or two to make it the losses big enough to be thought of as realistic advance aliens.   Millions will have to die immediately to scare the population so bad so fast that they can easily be able to fool everyone and have them so scared they don't question what is actually going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scary stuff ahead.  And I fully believe this is coming because the elites know just how bad the environment is about to degrade to that will cause  worldwide mass starvation and how bad the world will be hostile to large scale human existence.   They will use this operation to keep the masses from full on revolution against they gov't's   to keep safe while they can start rounding enough people up to keep things from going out of control that would put the elites in serious danger.

       Would also like to mention that FOO FIGHTERS  was WW2 slang for UFOs and most mainstream bands and movies and tv shows are influenced by the "Elites" and they put truth into this seemingly fictional media as a big middle finger to the sheep

       I really don't buy the whole common theory that missiles were always going to be faster than fast planes and so it was a waste of time and better to do stealth instead. They were rocking out fast as hell 50 years ago and now we don't even bother to go that fast anymore?  Since when do Americans not like going faster?  Anyways.

       Really though I don't put much into the alien invasion false flag thing.  As Report from Iron Mountain lays out local war is such an easy go to.  I've seen first hand local people get crazy as fuck in the US after 9/11 and in Ukraine after people started provacating by sniping people on both sides.  Its not even a tiny doubt in my mind that a government can get people all riled up and willing to do anything by just going big and the bigger the better.  Its not difficult for them and aliens and shit just muddles the issues IMO.  Maybe a population wises up after being done over but then those people die off and a future generation is just as easily done to.  Its endless and the power elites practice it like a policeman practices doing an arm bar.  They pass the knowledge down while we are doing the equivalent of trying to come up with how it works each time through reverse engineering.  I'm smart enough to do advanced math but imagine stumbling around without access to even Greek thinkers a thousand years ago.  Its like doing fifth grade math because even that is difficult without the centuries of proofs.  Basic is how we are and we don't have the full strategy guide and many people don't even know that it exists.

       I had a spectacular sighting in Nevada, right next to a military base, where a large ship was circling around a microwave tower for hours, and then smaller ships that glowed a flourescent green shot off from it into space, really fast.  It is either US Air Force flying those things, or they at the very least said it was ok to be in their airspace.

       I would imagine that any civilization capable of actually reaching us in order to fight or exterminate us would be able to handily do so without us even realizing what was going on. Especially if they're after earth's resources and they don't want us turning it into a radioactive wasteland.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they've got the technology to physically get here from minimally tens of light years away, I'm sure they could manage to exterminate us discretely -- or quickly enough that we wouldn't be able to mount a meaningful defence.
      </p>

       So yeah, a large-scale attack/invasion like we've seen in the movies would most likely be bogus.

       I totally agree. They could probably park in orbit ignoring anything we can throw. Capture a few humans, make a bioweapon and release it. Than just go for a tour of the solar system examining planets for resources while we all die.

       I read a good book about this scenario, I'll have to remember what it was called. Earth and humans get taken out with a bioweapon and when there's only a few survivors then the aliens show up to clean things up. It was actually a pretty good read especially since it was a free book on Kindle.

       That is what happened to the Native Americans.  Technologically superior but out numbered Europeans gave Native Americans Smallpox infected blankets, then waited for the disease to rampage through the Native Americans.  Then clean up what was left.

       Studies suggest that even before they were given blankets, small pox and other diseases from spanish conquitadors had spread through north, central, and south American decimating populations.

       By the time Louis and Clark went west in the early 1800s, much of the West was pretty empty and they noted abandoned villages and settlements.

       That was because disease had wiped out, by some estimates more than half, even up to 90% of indigenous peoples before they even made contact with the Europeans.

       That requires an awful lot of assumptions, the main one being that there exists any form of individuality among this hypothetical alien species.  It could simply be a hive-like species that travels in a straight line from it's point of origin overthrowing and colonizing every habitable body it comes across.

       I dont buy the hivemind theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even here on earth, our most hive minded animal species (insects) all retain some individual autonomy. While they are are strong ecological actors as species, they often flourish
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       well, and the individual is of little importance to the competition of the greater hive. Without that competition on an individual level, evolution is very likely slowed to a crawl...meaning a hive minded species isnt all that likely to reach beyond its own ecological limits.

       I don't in any way buy into the theory that transcending conflict is a prerequisite for an civilization to achieve interstellar travel.  Conflict could be a requirement in fact.  The idea that we can place requirements on interstellar species is in my eyes completely ridiculous, as we have yet to encounter a single such species.  It is simple hubris to claim we know what makes such a thing possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we ourselves are not yet an interstellar species because our own conflicts have not escalated to the point that they create a homogeneous culture.  Perhaps the only way of achieving something on the scale of interstellar flight is to entirely wipe out all opposing cultures to ensure the maximum of cultural trust and create a world wide consensus of goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess one could argue that doing so would be "transcending conflict" but I doubt it is what many people using the term would mean.

       I think the act of wiping out the other cultures would not ultimately produce unity, because although the other groups were eliminated, the mentality that led to splitting into factions and then fighting is not.  So it will just happen again when factions within the victor culture split apart and start fighting.  As to the need to remove conflict: conflict is at best a win-lose approach to solving problems.  Look at us: we are not likely to achieve space flight before we become extinct, since we divert so much of our attention to fighting.  Perhaps we are an outlier and other species are different, but it does not seem likely.  It is not hubris and projection, it is logic.  If we spend our efforts killing each other, and our technological development is focused on weapons, then we don't progress very far along dimensions which require synergy, nd we have insane results like nuclear and biological weapons which are very likely to ultimately end us.

      <p>
       This is in fact the exact opposite of logic.  You are making conclusions based on the smallest possible sample size.  You don't know what you know, much less what you don't know.  The
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       logical response would be to state "We cannot know" and leave it at that.  Any other supposition or conclusion is by definition hubris.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nuclear propulsion, a result of our "efforts killing each other" is probably our current best guess for a propulsion system that could propel us to another star.  Again, with what evidence we have about our own species it would seem that the thing that drives most of our progress towards becoming an interstellar species is a direct result of conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your notion that a species must be... commendable in any way to achieve interstellar travel is itself a flawed conclusion.

       I get it's pretty much a joke at this point in the thread, but I can think of at least a few reasons why that theory is extremely unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Taste replication would be extremely simple to advanced civilizations capable of reaching us. Literally just synthesizing molecules, which even us "dirty apes" are capable of.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Given that they would have to be beyond conflict in order to even make it here, they would surely have well established ethics, so especially because of reason 1, killing something because it tastes good is not only unethical, but also not even necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) We probably don't even taste good, but you'd have to ask spez xD

       Or they need more cannon fodder of basic intelligent species for the intergalactic war raging in the milkway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, our planet has nothing worth taking that a planet fairing species wouldnt already have. Way more rare minerals and metals in the asteroid belt, and Titan has liquid methane oceans for any petroleum type plastic product they would need, water exists in crazy amounts everywhere almost in space, etc.

       You should watch suppressed human history. It explains the emerald tablets and how these “aliens” are actually part of the lost civilizations that evolved to a higher conscience. It’s pretty convincing when it shows the pyramids on mars formed to the fibonacci spiral just like the pyramids on earth

       Another theory is that we will be close enough to the ideal life form for the planet so if they want a labor force to do local stuff then better to just take control of us.  They could do that easily.  One example is Euroeans taking people over by giving them a bit of booze and glass beads and then getting resources back from them.  Lets say that they wanted some trace minerals or something then they could do the right thing by letting us live instead of feeling bad about murdering a whole planet.  Then what?  They would have to put in robots or design a whole new species, etc.  Probably best to just have the bees make honey and its probably amusing as well and kind of endearing.

       I can't imagine what material resources we have that they would have to travel across the galaxy to get.  The only thing we have that I can imagine them wanting is DNA from earth life.  Destroying the planet, or even us would result in destroying that resource.

       First part i agree. We would notice neither Jack, or shit. Also our nuclear weapons would be somewhat useless in a direct engagement. So no matter what, we have no worthwhile defenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second part i strongly disagree. If you want resources...then you get everything you every gonna need in Space via asteroids. Easily accessible, low gravitation (easy extraction) and virtually everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also while life may be ubiquitous in our galaxy (and beyond) intelligent industrial life may not be. So i think that we hold considerably more value (culturally and Scientifically) alive and left alone rather then dead. There are other considerations but i think i made my point :)

       Correct. That's not to say various species of EBE piloted UAP haven't been studying our planet and civilization for some time now, and that we haven't in turn been observed and studied these craft ourselves.

       Rather, as soon as our technology catches up and the timing is right, within a few decades perhaps, an 'attack' by EBE forces could very well be staged and used to unite all nations of the Earth under a single banner, the final nail in the coffin of the OWO while ushering a new era of planet-wide destruction (de-population), followed by an era of unprecedented peace (and control) in the final stage of the NWO, what some here have come to know "Project Blue Beam". Of course, this entirely speculative, and should be regarded as such.

       As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is "How fast would that SR-71 fly?" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual “high” speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let’s just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn’t previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, “what was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?” This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing

       I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet’s hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of “breathtaking” very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since “the pass.” Finally, Walter looked at me and said, “One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?” Trying to find my voice, I stammered, “One hundred fifty-two.” We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, “Don’t ever do that to me again!” And I never did. A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer’s club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, “It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.” Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It’s ironic that people are interested in how slow the world’s fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it’s always a good idea to keep that cross-check up…and keep your Mach up, too.

       There were a lot of things we couldn’t do in an SR-71, but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment. It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn’t match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: November Charlie 175, I’m showing you at ninety knots on the ground. Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the “ HoustonCentervoice.”

       I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country’s space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houstoncontrollers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that… and that they basically did. And it didn’t matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios. Just moments after the Cessna’s inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his groundspeed. Twin Beach, I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed. Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check Before Center could reply, I’m thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol’ Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He’s the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground. And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done – in mere seconds we’ll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check? There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground. I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: Ah, Center, much thanks, We’re showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money. For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the HoustonCentervoice, when L.A.came back with: Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one. It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day’s work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.

       My favorite part about it is how on whatever flying subreddit it was, users have flairs based on mod-confirmed information of what they've flown...and this guy pops up with a fucking SR-71 Blackbird tag.

       Yeah, I wasn't going to mention it, but a BIG problem for SR71 crews, was that the damn thing leaked fuel at subsonic speeds.   Anyone who actually flew the Blackbird would know that.

       Any alien race can destroy us with a Tug boat.  They just drag a bunch of rocks toward earth and let gravity take care of the Rest.

       Aliens I never worry about.  Either they want us to join the interstellar Ranks and be part of the Galactic Community, they see us as a threat to be destroyed, or not worth the effort and they ignore us.

       Kinetic energy is linear in mass so the velocity squared makes all the difference! Throw a rock fast enough that the energy imparted on the rock by the air resistance approaches the relatvistic energy of it's mass and you got yourself a party!

       I have two theories on why there is no open contact with aliens:
There is an intergalactic government that deems contact with earth as illegal, making any aliens that come here criminals.
Or... We live in a computer simulation.

       Or our governments are in contact, and are not sharing the information. Or, contact happened thousands of years ago, when “we” built the pyramids, puma punku, and so on.  They just haven’t come again lately.

       While I think that various earth governments may be in contact with ETs, and definitely think that ETs had a hand in building certain structures on earth. I'm talking about openly acknowledged contact. Why would aliens agree to not being openly acknowledged? And if there's one species, there's thousands (or millions), why would they ALL agree to this? In my opinion there's some kind of "Prime Directive", and the ones that DO come here, do so furtively, breaking this directive.

       It’s impossible to know, but I could see there being some sort of widely accepted protocol, which on occasion is unknown or ignored by some visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know, there are broadcasts emitted deep  into space asking visitors not to come here, because we’re not ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we’re protected.  Maybe some powerful species safeguards us and controls visitor exposure to us.

       The likelyhood that aliens have visited earth is infinitesimal,  and if they did ever visit,  humans would have no way of knowing unless the aliens wanted us to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       For an Alien to travel to earth would almost certainly require travelling at the speed of light,  and travelling at the speed of light requires technology that is likely many centuries away still.
      </p>
      <p>
       For any alien with the capability of travelling at such speeds,  humanity would likely appear like a colony of termites in comparison.

       I don't agree. When the US sailed their gunboats to Japan to demand trade access, they enjoyed a very significant technology advantage. They didn't view the Japanese as chimps though.

       The original UFO scare was created to deflect attention away from some of the advanced aircraft projects the U.S. working on in the '50s.  If there are more UFO sightings now it is because more advanced technology is being tested.

       Ok that is a solid point. But when looking at current power leaders that is still not gonna happen. Xi, Putin and Trump or his successor are never gonna be one big family. It is starting to look like the start of the Cold War part 2.
And we in Europe are in the middle of all this silly power trip of them. As in a bordering country of Russia I sometimes wonder where this all will end up.

       I just don't see the benefit of hiding aliens from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if aliens arrived and the govt wanted to keep it a secret, would aliens allow it to be kept hush?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the benefit of hiding extraterrestrial life? It would seem far more beneficial to admit we have a technology. Like nuclear weapons, just having them makes you feared. Same with aliens. Don't need to hide it to yield power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't see the benefit of hiding it the way people think it's being hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus look at how crummy the govt is. Like Stephen hawking said, if the govt is hiding aliens from us, they're doing a better job at it than anything else they do

       Interesting fact: The technology required to make the SR-71 possible wasn't "invented" till the mid eighties. They had to scramble when building it because they couldn't field the A-12 due to an agreement they signed with the Sovs. The SR-71 had far superior camera and computer tech, which will probably never be fully revealed.

       Prior to WWII, it was very common for high IQ people to live right next to everyone else: brilliant women were housewives or at best nurses or high school teachers.  Geniuses kept right on farming the family farm or being a mechanic in town.  Now these people attend university where they meet (and have children with) other brilliant people.  They and their offspring cluster in university towns or places like Bethesda, Austin, or San Jose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it is this top quintile that pretty much runs everything (they pay over 80% of all Federal Income Tax, for ex), it is these people that interest our Friends the most.  They are taught globalism, inclusiveness, diversity, at university.  They are taught that masculinity is somehow a dirty word, that guns are instruments of the Devil, and that the hive mind is superior to personal judgment.  They are taught that loving your country is cultural nazism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually therefore, we WILL have a peaceful technological society.  It will have been done by our Friends by domesticating the top 20%.  For anyone who doesn’t want to live in such a world, there are plentiful opioids provided, heroin, alcohol.  There are violent sports and video games as an outlet.  Because sex might lead to jealousy and consequent violence, sex becomes plentiful and meaningless.  Most people will just play as work vanishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be a select few who get to live like the characters on Star Trek, exploring the galaxy.  That’s for the few freaks who will love danger and adventure, instead of the limitless drugs and sex.  I’m guessing those few will be the future.

       Well, I fully concede that this is a
       <em>
        rational approach
       </em>
       from the standpoint of an ETI, but the justification for "benevolence" I feel is insufficient.  I guess the real problem is defining benevolence because the meaning is rather relative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll break down my concerns a bit.  How can you assume that they
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       want to domesticate us?  Even if that were true, are you certain such domestication is for good reasons?  You can't assume that just because someone hasn't killed you
       <em>
        yet
       </em>
       or enslaved you
       <em>
        yet
       </em>
       that they never will.  And anyone can envision a myriad of ways that domestication can result in some bad outcomes.  I've already suggested the Aschen example before.  But, perhaps they want
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Serve_Man_(The_Twilight_Zone">
        To Serve Man
       </a>
       ) [i.e. "it's a cookbook"].
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is, given the data provided, I know they're deceitful and at least somewhat at odds with our natural interests.  They're already
       <em>
        mucking with human reproduction
       </em>
       and reducing our viability.  And what says they'll stop when they reach some "sustainable" goal that the pollyanna progressives are assuming?  That seems to be blind faith in mysterious 'alien gods' but the thing is that we know for a fact that they're deceitful.  How?  They are obviously okay with keeping the public in the dark about this.  They're okay with experimenting on the public and reducing reproductive viability without providing informed consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The optimist might assume it's to cull human ambition, but it certainly puts a dark note on the alleged benevolence.  Hell, many people even question if "God is evil" because he calls some human activities "sinful" and the universe permits suffering.  Of course, I'd concede that it's totally ignorant of the universal benefit of reality existing that God causes.  But I digress.  If such a thing as God is questionable like this, why should I blindly trust an alien race whose motives I can barely guess?  I'd like to think that some rational cynicism is due.  There's some self-interest motive that's not merely "sin" no matter how we want to slice it, even if it can be sinful if implemented improperly...
      </p>
      <p>
       But, what's more, it seems to me like Trump and Putin are acting as something of a rebellion against the brainwashing of the top 20%.  Is your implication here that these are merely contained short lived rebellions doomed to fail?  Or is the implication that this is also part of the ruse?  A "game" being played at the high level to delude the 80%?  It's pretty clear that if that is what you're saying and it's accurate this is probably a hopeless scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I guess what really
       <em>
        pisses
       </em>
       me off, generally speaking, is the denigration of humanity itself.  They may not be killing or enslaving humans as far as we know.  But there's some definite harmful side-effects.  Some that grate on the moral conscience, especially.  We have an education system treats boys like 'defective girls' and aims to criminalize normal human desires for families.  The historical sexual contract where a man acts as provider and a woman is expected to remain loyal lies in tatters.  The economies are being systematically dismantled under the guise of globalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm saying that I get where Putin, Trump and Alex Jones are going with their responses to all this.  There's a certain sense of freedom being lost and violation of dignity involved with this whole "alien zoo" thing.  That's all I probably need to say though.  Either way, what's been created for humanity by this scenario seems to be a Morton's fork.  A "Hotel California..."  "You can check out any time you like but you can never leave...  They stabbed it with their steely knives they just can't kill the beast...."

       Young children sometimes stomp on ant hills for fun.  As adults, we don’t.  It’s a stupid childish thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any being that has advanced very far would gain no joy from killing just for the hell of it.  I doubt that the Friends came all this way just to stomp on us.  I also can’t believe that we are a food source.  They can probably create any nourishment they need from inanimate matter.  I suppose anything’s possible but I think killing/enslaving/eating us seems unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe they get enjoyment from civilizing us.  They stop wars and give us incremental gains in technology to make our lives better.  Food, water, shelter are much easier to find than even 100 years ago.  One day in the not too distant future, everyone will be given a basic income similar to Social Security (prob during the next recession).
      </p>
      <p>
       For most humans, this process will long term be troubling.  We thrive on challenges.  One reason war is very popular (over 14,000 in recorded history) is that we love war.

       ok cool, so that makes sense.  Scratch what I said about the g-forces then.  I'm now wondering if an anti-gravity device could still be able to be used in a way to counter those g-forces if used in the proper way?  For example if you're in that centrifuge but have an anti gravity device pushing on you in the opposite direction could that negate the g-force?

       That's pretty much what he is saying. As to researchers not approaching anything near that technology, the idea is that the government stops/silences/recruits anyone that is beginning research into the subject. The documentary Unacknowledged on Netflix goes a lot more in depth into this theory and even provides some pretty damning evidence and testimonials, I'd highly recommend it.

       No, it really doesn't make sense. The damaging effects of g-forces come from electromagnetic interactions, not gravitational ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in a centrifuge and pass out, it's because of electromagnetic interactions. The centrifuge is held together by electromagnetic bonds between and within molecules. When you sit in the centrifuge, you don't fall through it because the electromagnetic forces repulse you. As the centrifuge starts moving, the electromagnetic repulsions force you to move along with the centrifuge... and so on. Having an "anti-gravity in the opposite direction" doesn't really make sense and doesn't really solve the problem.

       Your folly is in thinking "I literally know everytning there is to know" - which is laughably ridiculous on its face.

       what?
      </p>
      <p>
       i never once came to that conclusion. I'm simply asserting that a technology this valuable would have been discovered by at least one other research firm. Especially when they just so plainly state how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is no one else researching this? Like i said this technology would revolutionize the world, so why hasnt any one else tried to replicate it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why arent there published papers at the very least show the initial workings of altering gravity feilds. Im not even talking about exerting enough control over gravitational feilds to maintain flight. Just literally any paper that claims gravity can be altered at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       why doesnt any of this research exist?

       I don't in any way buy into the theory that transcending conflict is a prerequisite for an civilization to achieve interstellar travel.  Conflict could be a requirement in fact.  The idea that we can place requirements on interstellar species is in my eyes completely ridiculous, as we have yet to encounter a single such species.  It is simple hubris to claim we know what makes such a thing possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we ourselves are not yet an interstellar species because our own conflicts have not escalated to the point that they create a homogeneous culture.  Perhaps the only way of achieving something on the scale of interstellar flight is to entirely wipe out all opposing cultures to ensure the maximum of cultural trust and create a world wide consensus of goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess one could argue that doing so would be "transcending conflict" but I doubt it is what many people using the term would mean.

       I have a possible idea about this.
We know that gravity affects time, specifically that the higher the gravitational pull, the more time slows down.
So it makes sense that anti-gravity would do the opposite, and cause time to speed up within the anti-gravity field.
Therefore a smaller acceleration within the field could appear as a much larger acceleration to an observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the pilot/crew would then not be accelerating so quickly (at least from their perspective), they would be put under less g-forces, even though to an observer it would appear that the craft is accelerating at impossible rates.
