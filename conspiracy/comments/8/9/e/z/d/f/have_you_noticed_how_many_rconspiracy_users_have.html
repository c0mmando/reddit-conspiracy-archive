Let&#39;s tear apart Cambridge Analytica AND Shareblue. There&#39;s no whataboutism when you look at the entire picture with equal criticism. Ideology shouldn&#39;t come into play. Left and right don&#39;t matter when a lie is a lie, or corrupt practices are corrupt practices. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no need to bury one lead in exchange for another. We have a unique opportunity to put aside political differences and take on the practice of twisting public opinion as a whole.

<p>This is just about the most hilarious thing you could have possibly posted in response to my comment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which party tends to win when voter turnout is higher than the number of registered voters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why don&#39;t you tell me? Because after a brief search, the only thing I can come up with is that you are misinterpreting the claim by Judicial Watch that 11 counties in CA have more total registered voters than adults over the age of 18, a claim they appear to have reached by combining the number of active and inactive voters in those counties. Or the issue in Detroit where poll workers&#39; tallies exceeded the number of voters recorded by voting machines. </p>

<p>But neither of those match your specific insinuation, which is that one party tends to win elections when <em>voter turn out</em> is higher than <em>registered voters</em>. So, please, by all mean, provide a source for your insinuation. </p>

<p>Anyhow, as an avid patriot, constitutionalist, pro free speech and gun supporting libertarian, yes I see the threat being bigger from all the progressive left SJW&#39;s, antifa commies, virtue signal safe spacing snowflakes, and the P.C. police. You can check out the people getting fined and imprisoned for tweets in Germany and U.K. as we speak, and those same folks want to do that here.</p>

<p>Also, nice ad hominem which back fired miserably. I can do the same mister NYC webdev, those 2 things alone let me know that most likely you are sjw super hipster with one of those fixed gear bikes because its cool, but you did post about Ron Paul in r/libertarian (maybe that was just virtue signaling though?

<p>And it was all downhill from there when you descended into P.C. police snoflakeism sjwism, scanning peoples comments so you can put them in hive mind prison. I bet you love the fact that U.K. and Germany fine and jail people for tweets.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden, a drumpf supporting school shooter comes in and mows down everyone in the gun free zone and that&#39;s how America took all the guns, we finally all collectively reach god teir level intelligence, crimes drops to zero, we start wearing rainbow flag universal mandatory uniforms in support of everyone, and we start the process of denuclearization so we dont seem like bad guys to russia and china.</p>

<p>yeah, the progressive left east up CNN like frosted flakes for breakfast. At least the alt-nazi&#39;s know cnn is fake and they create their own fake cnn-less nazi bubble</p>

<p>All propaganda is bad, but the progressive left is spper dangerous because they work in reddit, google, twitter, youtube, academia, media, news, etc its all controlled by sjw&#39;s, most likely what caused the current shooting going on at youtube headquarters in commiefornia.</p>

<p>they are anti-free speech and anti-gun and believe the propaganda</p>

<p>The media&#39;s primary, and arguably only function from an ethical sense is to shine a light on what&#39;s going in the world in a truthful manner, and to serve the public by exposing the crimes and failures of powerful people. When the media allows the powerful to control the narrative and censor their work willingly, they are committing the highest possible ethical crime a journalist can commit. They had 100s of Glenn thrushs and worse. </p>

<p>Thrush even admits in the emails that he&#39;s a &quot;hack&quot;. </p>

<p>This is all a matter of public record. We don&#39;t appreciate shills or spooks who can&#39;t even accept well sourced and acknowledged facts on this subreddit, so either read the emails and discuss content, or find someone else to muddy the water with. </p>

<p>By that logic, black lives matter is merely whataboutism attempting to deflect attention from the militarization of the police.

<p>But it doesn&#39;t matter,  Sinclair&#39;s monopolization of local news is a (very clever) right wing response to the  nationwide reach of the left-leaning cable news channels. It&#39;s how the right exerts control on &quot;middle-America,&quot; and parallels the role of CNN and MSNBC in the cities. That said you are obviously  being manipulated, no matter what channel you&#39;re watching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cable news isn’t as simple as right v left, as much as we’d like to compartmentalize it that way. All of it primary caters to the older demographics.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/heres-the-median-age-of-the-typical-cable-news-viewer/355379">http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/heres-the-median-age-of-the-typical-cable-news-viewer/355379</a></p>

<p>Local news is no different. They’re catering to an older generation. The baby boomers are being manipulated and monetized through traditional forms of media.</p>

<p>Younger generations get their information online, so that’s where they’re likely to be manipulated and monetized.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/millennials-news/">https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/millennials-news/</a></p>

<p>This rings true to me, an older, city dwelling millennial who doesn’t watch the news. I read the news and am active in my community so I’m able to understand local news by talking with people and asking experts questions. There’s literally no reason for me to turn on the local news. I can pull up traffic alerts on my phone and there’s no in depth story they could do that would override having actual conversations with people in that field. </p>

<p>I actually have a more negative view of cable news. To me it’s like McDonalds, a cheap and shitty product that gets churned out for the masses. Why would I listen to a talking head tell me why I should parrot their opinions on things like immigration policy? I would rather talk to an immigrant, an immigration lawyer, and an economist who studies the effects of immigration. I would rather get to the source and talk to someone who has some authority on the subject, not someone who’s good at keeping an audience entertained.</p>

<p>I guess my point is right v left be damned. the best way to form an opinion is to go out, ask questions, and be open to learning something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama literally did not use CA in any way. That&#39;s just blatantly false. Maybe what you meant to say is that the Obama Campaign used Facebook to get information in a similar way as CA did. That would at least be in the right direction. However, what each did were different (Obama&#39;s was far less sophisticated) and how the data was obtained was very different (Obama&#39;s was done with informed consent).<br/>
I know what both the NYT and CTR are.<br/>
The NYT doesn&#39;t have anywhere near the reach of Sinclair and hasn&#39;t done anything remotely similar. Also, the fact that the NYT has a liberal bias is well-known. Sinclair, meanwhile, has remained out of the spotlight, has quietly bought up stations without announcements, and has aimed this as non-partisan while making it very partisan.<br/>
I have seen no accounts putting CTR as nearly influential or sophisticated as what CA did. Which goes back to the options I posited. Maybe they&#39;re not trying, maybe they don&#39;t have the capability, or maybe we have no idea what they&#39;re actually capable of and they&#39;re far better at keeping secrets than CA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A large portion of anti-MSM sentiment isn&#39;t sincere, it&#39;s politically motivated, and this Sinclair stuff exposes that. The politically-motivated version is that the MSM is all liberally biased, which relies on two rather incoherent assumptions to hold true:</p>

<li><p>Ignore Fox, which has more viewers (thus, is more mainstream) than CNN, MSNBC, and CBS combined.</p></li>
<li><p>That local news, despite being watched by tens of millions of Americans and being owned by national corporations, isn&#39;t &quot;mainstream&quot;</p></li>

<p>This has been one of the top discussions for a few days now. I mean, it&#39;s a good thing people are learning about this, but now we have people pretending that the other side is &quot;winning&quot; because some users are trying to point out left wing propaganda without getting much attention. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, all posts about the latest story on the Russian spy poisoning and how UK can&#39;t prove the nerve agent was made in Russia are downvoted. They likely won&#39;t even hit the front page of the sub. </p>

<p>Trump is probably corrupt.</p>

<p>But the obvious layered narrative is as follows</p>

<p>Layer 1: Hillary is good, First woman President YAY!, Trump is big racist meanie</p>

<p>Layer 2: Trump actually holds realistic Hard-Truth views, illegal immigration is a problem, the US does need a President who isnt scared to be tough (see NK denuclearization), The dems want to destroy the 2nd amendment, Their is a &quot;deepstate&quot; that needs draining Ect ect ect.</p>

<p>Layer 3: It didnt matter whether Trump or Clinton won, the goal was to divide the citizens against each other and get them sucked in and distracted by the political theatre. Hillary to rile up the normies and Trump to Rile up the republicans and Conspiracy Theorists</p>

<p>SEE: Trump is old friends with Clintons, Trump was friends with Epstein and laughed about Epsteins enjoyment of &quot;young&quot; girls (owner of Lolita Express Orgy plane, and Lolita Island which has an occult temple on it) their are other connections as well</p>

<p>POINT BEING</p>

<p>how about i just criticize things that are happening, and expect trump supporters to be smart enough to realize that just because they voted for him doesnt mean they have to love and find a way to explain how the things he does are actually amazing? if they can think critically they will be fine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of Trumps actions are not bad, back to the layered conspiracy the MSM garbagemen shovel BS opinion pieces intentionally twisting the truth or leaving out relevant details and attempting to assassinate Trumps character rather than attack his policys and stances. AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS KNOW THIS</p>

<p>Again most people will not agree with Criticisms of Trump that dont actually give hard facts / evidence of wrongdoing when his approval is higher than Obamas was at the same time in his 1st term, he has caused NK to agree to denuclearize, and he is fighting illegal immigration.</p>

<p>The way to convert people is to concede that Clinton was bad and had baggage and policies that may not have had the Citizens best interests at heart.</p>

<p>And then come back and bring up Trumps connections to the Clintons and his connections with Epstein, those are inarguable points and much more likely to convert people than the bullshit most leftists are spewing </p>

<p>Hmm, that&#39;s quite the assessment.  You are right, its not a new practice but that shouldn&#39;t distract from the problem.  Simply because the news and media are controlled and all reading from the same script shouldn&#39;t make you apathetic on the matter. </p>

<p>Sure you did and you know it. The implication is just the same. We should just rename it to the &#39;quit calling each other names and being assholes&#39; rule to convey the idea better.</p>

<p>No. Most reports are ignored. When it&#39;s a legit violation it gets pulled. Had someone reported the other, it would have been pulled too.</p>

<p>The media&#39;s primary, and arguably only function from an ethical sense is to shine a light on what&#39;s going in the world in a truthful manner, and to serve the public by exposing the crimes and failures of powerful people. When the media allows the powerful to control the narrative and censor their work willingly, they are committing the highest possible ethical crime a journalist can commit. They had 100s of Glenn thrushs and worse. </p>

<p>Thrush even admits in the emails that he&#39;s a &quot;hack&quot;. </p>
