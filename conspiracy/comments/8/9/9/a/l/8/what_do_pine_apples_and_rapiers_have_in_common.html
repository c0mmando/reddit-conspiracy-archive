<p>The National Archaeological Museum of Naples exhibits a fresco from the Pompeii excavations. It is an exact copy of the famous picture of Rafael &quot;Three Graces&quot; of the year 1504, the smallest details of the composition match. Either Leonardo da Vinci invented and gave Rafael a time machine, or the owner of the villa in Pompeii knew about the picture of Raphael and ordered medieval interior designers to make a copy of the famous at that time picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Artists of the Renaissance copied classical styles, they wanted to bring back the style and some artistic elements from the Classical era, so it&#39;s possible Raphael copied a well known old composition. Everything else about Pompeii I don&#39;t trust. The ridiculous &quot;people&quot; that laid there in odd positions as ash slowly covered them, and anything else including frescoes, was likely faked much much later, all as part of a very old tourist trap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing to remember... these people were not slowly buried in ash that fell like snow... they were caught in a pyroclastic flow which buried in essentially an avalanche of red hot ash and rock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flows usually consist of two parts: the basal flow hugs the ground and contains larger, coarse boulders and rock fragments, while an extremely hot ash plume lofts above it because of the turbulence between the flow and the overlying air, admixing and heating cold atmospheric air causing expansion and convection.[5]</p>

<p>The kinetic energy of the moving cloud will flatten trees and buildings in its path. The hot gases and high speed make them particularly lethal, as they will incinerate living organisms instantaneously:</p>

<p>The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Italy, for example, were engulfed by pyroclastic surges on August 24, 79 AD with many lives lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow</a></p>

<p>They are in odd positions because they were buried in seconds under tons of burning hot ash. What you are seeing is the agony of their death.</p>

It looks to me, fake AF plaster, to lure tourists. It may in fact being the longest running tourist trap in history, so I guess that&#39;s noteworthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was one of a man masturbating supposedly, while hot lava was supposedly flowing over him. Some people were sitting straight up, some leaning up on their elbows, just allowing lava to build up as they sat. Many don&#39;t even have human proportions, and don&#39;t even look like an artist made them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible human remains were found, but most of it I&#39;m sure is fake. It was a big deal when it was rediscovered in the 18th century, and they probably just couldn&#39;t help themselves making plaster phonies. More &quot;bodies&quot; surely showed up as the years went by and the place became a <em>hot spot</em> for tourism and academics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m an armchair ethnobotanist in that I&#39;ve done brief writeups on the origins of 100+ fruits in a particular country. Pineapple was one that made very little sense based on our current understanding of seafaring and exploration. It was introduced to countries long before Columbus, Vasco de Gama, etc, came on to the scene. The only conclusion that I could draw (as well as many others I read) was that the traditional Euro-centric views of trade were wrong and that there were civilizations trading by water long before then. A few other fruits support this notion as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t look like a pineapple. I would&#39;ve guessed it&#39;s a loaf of bread. And the sword just looks like a skinny unrealistically-drawn sword. It&#39;s too long, even for a rapier, and the hilt looks like it&#39;d snap in half the first time you swung it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the sword isn&#39;t anything special.  IF that is a rapier, it looks an awful lot like a fairly standard long sword.  Maybe skinnier than normal pending the actual time of the painting.  But like a long, thin blade with a delicate cross-guard coulda/woulda been seen at court.  I see no elaborate filigree to suggest it was a sword in the style from, say, the pirate-and-swashbuckler era (the shield could be argued as a buckler and I&#39;d have to go back and see when the buckler was invented).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing to remember... these people were not slowly buried in ash that fell like snow... they were caught in a pyroclastic flow which buried in essentially an avalanche of red hot ash and rock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flows usually consist of two parts: the basal flow hugs the ground and contains larger, coarse boulders and rock fragments, while an extremely hot ash plume lofts above it because of the turbulence between the flow and the overlying air, admixing and heating cold atmospheric air causing expansion and convection.[5]</p>

<p>The kinetic energy of the moving cloud will flatten trees and buildings in its path. The hot gases and high speed make them particularly lethal, as they will incinerate living organisms instantaneously:</p>

<p>The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Italy, for example, were engulfed by pyroclastic surges on August 24, 79 AD with many lives lost.</p>

<p>They are in odd positions because they were buried in seconds under tons of burning hot ash. What you are seeing is the agony of their death.</p>
