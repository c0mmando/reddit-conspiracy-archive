    <div class="md"><p>There was a point in my life where my personal stress was pretty intense - I arrived at my job and didn&#39;t remember the journey. Nothing. Not a stoplight, dog, trash can...it was terrifying to not recall a twenty minute journey behind the wheel of my car!</p>

<p>I grabbed my first cup of coffee and jotted down the first things that were eating at me, with resolve to tackle them. If you can do so - it might be a good time to see an Internist get a Chem Panel done. Until then sunlight and getting your bare feet moving over some green grass or a sandy beach - I cannot recommend enough. It helps our brain stomach and our head bucket to communicate better, somehow. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re drinking soda pop and eating processed foods - start weaning yourself but do see a doctor if you can, especially if this persists. I do not know your age, sex or life conditions thru this one way screen - just know that you&#39;re thought of and listened to!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be nice to not be so aware of how futile everything is. I need to know what my purpose is. There <em>must</em> be a purpose. I don&#39;t believe that reality is an accident. I think that defies logic. But if I can&#39;t know it, then living here is just too pointless. When it&#39;s all boiled down, it&#39;s just suffering. Out of nowhere you become conscious one day, and you&#39;re imprisoned in a physical body with all it&#39;s desires, aches and pains until you die. So, in a sense, I think I&#39;d rather not know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that we live in a world that is horrendous and perhaps our overall situation is worsening (in some respects), but it can also be a beautiful and interesting world. Maybe you could try to appreciate the things in life that don&#39;t cause too much suffering and focus on those. By the way, the sheeple are not to be envied. They are afraid, pathetic, and weak and have almost no chance of overcoming their bondage. At least you are questioning your fate and fortune and unless you are 100 years old, I&#39;d say you have a great deal more you can contribute to your fellow travellers - through your intellectual discussions, if nothing else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into Buddhism and check out some clips/interviews on Youtube of those monk dudes or whatever they are. They are really good at putting things into perspective and giving you inspiration to seek out your own answers. Also, listen to some Mantras. It&#39;s not supernatural, it&#39;s just calming and zen. Things like Nirvana are just old words for being &quot;woke&quot; or &quot;redpilled&quot;.</p>

<p>Basically, you have just had your &quot;Third Eye&quot; open up. It means coming to the realization you just lamented - but now the next step is achieving Nirvana and coming to peace at what you learned. Learning how to stop worrying about being &quot;Awake&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha yes this is awesome! Early stage of awareness is what you have. You are seeing the connections that life has. The connections that unites all living things and has been going on as long as life has been moving. It is all a struggle. That is a principle from some eastern religion (don&#39;t ask me which one). But now you can see how the feelings you have modulate from situation to situation and from there you may find your purpose or your reason to wake up and explore your world and day to see what happens. Nobody really &quot;knows&quot; what is going to happen day to day or even what is going on right now, may have an idea or a belief but you only know what is inside your realm of mental and physical existence. Don&#39;t rush to leave it cuz it is hard and difficult cuz it is not always this way. Keep a journal and free write your thoughts. Over time you will see you mental progress and if you talk about the world maybe more things will connect and make more sense. Enjoy this life, incase this is all their is. If not you got some good stories for the next phase! Much love! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes when we can&#39;t find the value in ourselves, we find the value in others first.  Family is what helped me move through the despair some years back.</p>

<p>It may be generic.  I know words don&#39;t mean a whole lot, when people are trying to talk you out of the dark, but I hope you can find a pursuit that&#39;s worthwhile enough to keep you going.</p>

<p>And who knows.  Maybe, if you&#39;re persistent enough, you&#39;ll find a way to beat the loop, and carry these lessons into the next life, instead of starting the hopeless cycle all over again.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest, I’m not sure; I haven’t tried. I don’t do much for the movement but talk about it a lot to a lot of people and a little volunteer work but the thought of going back to partying every night and living hedonistically, while it has/had its charms, doesn’t even tempt me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like me leading up to my reconnection with Christ.  I always ask myself, what is good?  What is evil?  Suicide is a destructive act.  Creation is a constructive act.  Asking God, listening to Him, and having patience will lead you to the truth.  I hope that you can be patient.  If you live for others, your heart will not be empty.  Your heart will not remain filled by finite things like money.  Remember that Jesus bared a much greater burden.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop trying to change the world. Just work on your minuscule part of it. Whatever &quot;good&quot; you believe in, find a way to actively support it, no matter how small. </p>

<p>Imagine the Hoover Dam with one man trying to take the whole thing down with a pick axe. Kind of depressing. But what if he&#39;s not aware of the 1,000 other men/women who are also working relentlessly with their pick axes? </p>

<p>Work on your piece. Take pride in any dent you make in it. And keep hammering. You never know how far the ripple effect of your actions will go.</p>

<p>If that didn&#39;t help at all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/">read this</a>. It&#39;s been gilded 86 times and counting. Not precisely 1:1 with what you&#39;re experiencing, but definitely in the same room.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you&#39;re Christian (and even if you&#39;re not), check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Thomas#Date_of_composition">The Gospel of Thomas</a>. It&#39;s a lost Gospel of only direct quotes from Jesus, no editorializing. The interesting thing about it, though, is that it&#39;s taken from ancient scrolls discovered in Nag Hammadi, Egypt and many scholars think they date to within 100 years of Jesus&#39;s actual life. So they&#39;re damn close to the source time-wise. They read a little differently than what you usually hear from Jesus in the traditional bible, and to me at least, make a lot more sense sometimes. <a href="http://gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html">Here&#39;s a good place to read them</a>, with a few options on translations, to help you decipher them.</p>

<p>Hang in there. Spring is nearly here. And change is in the air.</p>

Make sure it’s not another person exclusively either because people may come and go out of your life.  Medicine works for some people.  It’s worth looking into as well.  I know some in this community may think that’s insane to recommend big pharma but I’ve seen it work for people close to me.  Being happy in life matters more than anything so don’t give up and keep fighting the good fight.  You’re not alone.</p>

<p>People think we need to enhance our physical bodies with technology, but I would personally say this is an incredibly limiting perspective and doesn&#39;t do justice to the magnificent being each and every one of us already are. </p>

<p>I truly hope people can come to these inner realizations before it&#39;s too late and before the obsessive transhumanism that only takes into account a limited,  purely materialistic viewpoint on life, is seen as the best way forward....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean is at some point, human development will find a way to make certain people live forever unless they are killed. But even then, what is keeping someone from just being plopped into a new body?  I love the show altered carbon. The main characters have made hundreds of clones to drop their consciousness into if their main body either died or was hurt too bad. The best thing?  The older characters had to live forever and that in itself can be the biggest burden someone can hold. Nothing stops ever, you will always remember those deep dark moments and remember the good ones forever.  I’m not sure the common person can be sane for 50-100,000 years. Neil DeGrasse Tyson asked someone if they would like to travel to our closest galaxy that could hold life and the trip would take ~50,000 years at today’s tech and he said yes. Could you imagine sitting on a plane or space shuttle for 50,000 years??  You only live, typically, for 75. That would be an incredible amount of time. Almost all of human existence as we know it you would be on a trip to another place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don’t choose where we are born, or what troubling history our country has instigated or done in the past... Assuming you’re an American.  International people from around the globe most likely stereotype us for being XYZ and so on.   Yet, in my opinion, as a patriot who loves themselves, first and foremost, and the positive things about their country i.e. freedom of speech, liberty, etc.  Can understand there is a large discrepancy in our amendments or bill of rights or “the Golden rule”.... So as a conscious and aware citizen of your country, who understands the rabbit whole etc, you can apply yourself to helping out the community, being kind, sparing change, talk to someone you think needs talking to, join a movement, start a non profit.  </p>

<p>That’s what I mean when I say a ‘real patriot’ although.... the men and women that serve our military make the ultimate sacrifice.   And we can’t be naive to that.   Hope I made myself a bit more clearer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this. </p>

<p>Taking action on what you&#39;ve seen behind the curtain, doing something dor the collective - whatever you feel is intuitively right for you, the way you can contribute, is very liberating. Simply knowing and not doing anything, is a plunge into insanity.</p>

<p>First I would always recommend for people to take care of themselves - exercise, eat well, drink enough fluids....take care of your mind as well: meditate, introspect, write a journal, spend time in nature.... consider a spiritual practice of your choosing as well if you are drawn to it.</p>

<p>Then - take action. Move forward and help the world, add massive value, do your part and contribute in any way you feel is right for you. </p>

<p>Be the change you want to see in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple solution here that makes the world a better place and is so easy its pathetic its not followed: Do something nice for somebody every day. It doesn&#39;t matter who, just someone besides yourself. Even making a phone call to a friend or relative just to say &quot;Hi&quot; means the world to people. Open a door or hold an elevator, you don&#39;t need to wait for a chance to pull someone from a burning building. It will make you fell better in return.

<p>Sam: I know. It&#39;s all wrong. By rights we shouldn&#39;t even be here. But we are. It&#39;s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn&#39;t want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it&#39;s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn&#39;t. They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.</p>

<p>Frodo: What are we holding onto, Sam?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not envious of the sheeple.<br/>
They typically live a life of insanity.<br/>
But I am envious people who are financially well-off and can actually afford to live their life instead of selling it to someone else at rock-bottom prices; people who can afford the many things that can minimized pain &amp; suffering in a person&#39;s life.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m struggling to reconcile staying in this reality with all the suffering. I just can&#39;t function.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a sane response to an insane world. Your state of mind isn&#39;t the problem, the world is the problem, and there&#39;s nothing insane about giving consideration to leaving this hell hole early rather than waiting around for the worst of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t blame you. I&#39;ve been there. It&#39;s what sent me back to church, though I know finding a good church ain&#39;t easy either. </p>

<p>All I can say is: Your awareness is a blessing. It hurts now, but as you write, there is more to our lives than just this material experience. </p>

<p>Hopefully you have times in your life you can look back on that were more innocent and carefree. Those days may be done for a while. You have to step up and grab the rope of hope for others. </p>

<p>Nothing is totally written and done. Everything is constantly in flux. You can cling to your consciousness and I suggest prayer as well. </p>

<p>Good luck. You are ahead of the game simply by having the courage to confront these doubts and concerns publicly. You are brave and a seeker, and hope you are blessed for your efforts. </p>

<p>Thank you for this post!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the I Ching</p>

<p>Ko / Revolution</p>

<p>Fire ignites within the Lake, defying conditions that would deny it birth or survival:
The Superior Person reads the Signs of the Times and makes the Season apparent to all.</p>

<p>The support you need will come only after the deed is done.
Renewed forces, however, will provide fresh energy for exceptional progress.
Persevere.
All differences vanish.</p>

<p>SITUATION ANALYSIS:
A revolutionary Change must be made forcibly.
There is no negotiating with the Established Order.
Perfect timing is essential.
Let the abuse of power become apparent and oppressive to those around you before making your move.
Lay the groundwork, sow the seeds for Revolution without tipping your hand prematurely.
You will need a strong foundation, because you will have to bring about this necessary change alone.
You cannot count on popular support, so you must wait until there is massive dissent.
Then the avenue for your assault will be cleared. </p>

<p>Hexagram Forty-Nine/Line Three:</p>

<p>Premature action would prove disastrous.
Let the talk of revolution ferment among the people.</p>

<p>When the rumors have reached your ear three times, that is your signal to strike. </p>

<p>Ts&#39;ui / Gathering</p>

<p>The Lake rises by welcoming and receiving Earth&#39;s waters:
The King approaches his temple.
It is wise to seek audience with him there.</p>

<p>Success follows this course.
Making an offering will seal your good fortune.
A goal will be realized now.</p>

<p>SITUATION ANALYSIS:
This is an important Convergence, and you must be part of it.
Look for the Center of this convergence.
Like waters running to the sea, like an astronomical convergence of planets revolving around the sun, you should let the gravity of this Center draw you near.
Others are also drawn to this Center, and among them you will find shared bonds and kindred spirits.
This tribal convergence will give you a clarity of purpose.
You will no longer be alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world, nature and humans are truly beautiful. Even if you can&#39;t always see it, I promise you they are. Take a break off the social media (reddit included) don&#39;t pay attention to the news and get outside for some very valuable &quot;you time&quot;. Things will only get better if you want them to.</p>

<p>Highly recommending reading (I listened to it) Jordan Peterson&#39;s 12 Rules for Life. This world and this life matter and it&#39;s never to late to change it, it picked me up out of a dark period. It articulates everything your soul already knows and helps you put it into practice. Very very good book. Hope you feel better soon, stay strong</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, hoping to make them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target&#39;s belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read two things:
Viktor Frankl - Man&#39;s search for meaning
Ayn Rand - Atlas Shrugged</p>

<p>Those two books will change your outlook on life and what purpose/meaning you can find</p>

<p>After that, you&#39;ll have to come to terms with the fact that you might never find people that you can relate to.  This is ok. I&#39;ve had to learn that my wife will never think about things as deeply as I do. She will never relate to what we go through when we are the types of people who learn constantly, who never stop learning, who always search for more, who are never ever satisfied we have &quot;the answer&quot;... but through that process we end up knowing much much more than the average person</p>

<p>Those books I mentioned will help with this process, but eventually you will get to a place where you don&#39;t need people to relate to you. You become comfortable knowing that you are right, and that you don&#39;t need validation. </p>
