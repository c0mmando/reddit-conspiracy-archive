       We are going to get a spiffy new 5G wireless network all over the country,  and we're  pushing for it in our allies' backyards too.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the pushers aren't telling you is that we HAVE to have a 5G network.   Our new data-driven weapons require it.   We're  going to be flooded with 5G, regardless of any harm  it can do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        5G will form both a "defensive perimeter" protecting US information against cyber attacks or involvement by malicious state actors
        <strong>
         while also enabling the use of data-intensive physical weaponry
        </strong>
        , the alleged government memo says.
       </p>
       <p>
        "The vaunted F-35 is incapable of being used to its full potential, because the data rates on our current networks preclude the full use of its data collection. Soon it will be joined by other advanced aircraft that are similarly data monsters," the alleged memo states, referring to America's latest problematic fighter jet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The alleged memo also refers to the B-21 Raider stealth bomber; the P-8 Poseidon military aircraft, which Boeing said is used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; the Aegis Combat System, which intercepts medium-range ballistic missiles; and the F-35 stealth fighter, which Lockheed Martin says uses sensor technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Building a secure, resilient, layered, and global 5G network will transform how the Joint Force operates and allow for the full use of data-intensive weapons systems like Aegis, P-8, F-35, and B-21 ... in the Air Force alone, efforts to get the F-22 and F-35 to communicate require purpose-built gateways," the alleged memo explains.

       Everything on his site impresses. I've, personally, never smelled bullshit in the information he offers. That is up for the individual to decide for themselves, though.

       Brain waves naturally operate at around about 6.8-12Hz. During meditation we can fine tune this to resonate with the natural harmonic resonant frequency of the ionospheric cavity which is 7.5Hz.
       <br/>
       Here's a copy+paste of a short post I did on "the Schumann resonance".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in simple terms, it goes a little something like this:
       <br/>
       The Earth's ionosphere starts about 80kms from earth. It's comprised of charged particles (ions) and is known to reflect radio waves (the ionosphere is a crucial component to radio communication on earth). The difference in electric potential between the ionosphere and Earth creates an effective capacitor between the two, and since the ionosphere is pretty uniform around Earth the potential difference is evenly distributed along the distance between the Earth and the ionosphere, and comes to about 200 volts per metrer. This, in turn, means that the resonant frequency of earth, out at least the ionosphere cavity (the part in which we humans live) is about 7.5 cycles per second (Hertz).
       <br/>
       The human body has an electronic signal too. The sound of our heartbeat racing down the aorta, from the heart, and echoing back on itself once it hits the bifurcation in the lower abdomen creates an interference pattern. When one holds their breath, relaxes, or enters a meditative state they can "fine tune" this signal to a natural resonant frequency within the body. The signals, moving in synchrony with one another, travel up and down the body at the speed of sound (within the body) at around 7.5Hz. And of course, since we have charged particles within our bodies, we produce an electronic signal due to all this movement, which is transmitted into our environment.
       <br/>
       Since the ionosphere cavity and our bodies both resonate at around 7.5Hz, this suggests a tuned resonant system between the two, and oscillators within a resonant system can transfer energy to one another. In deep meditation the human and the ionosphere can transfer energy between each other, and this occurs at a wavelength of around 40,000km (about the perimeter of the planet), which travels around the world at about one seventh of a second through the electrostatic field. The more tuned oscillators there are within a tuned resonant system, the stronger the signal, and the more efficient the energy transfer. Also, the more tuned oscillators there are within a tuned resonant system, oscillators vibrating out of phase can more easily get locked into phase through a phenomena called rhythm entrainment. So therefore, when multiple people are mediating, they are transferring energy between each other and the ionosphere, and when more meditators join in its easier for them to then fall into sync with everyone else and easier to transfer energy.
       <br/>
       The Schumann resonance is the measuring of the fluctuations in the ionospheric signal, which is linked to fluctuations in mass consciousness, since fluctuations in the Schumann resonance can be measured when multiple people meditate in synchrony around the planet. The theory is that when there are irregular fluctuations in the ionospheric signal, there are mass shifts in conscious awareness occurring. A notable example would be the massive fluctuations that occurred on 9/11, which coincided with a mass shift in public consciousness. It can't exactly tell us
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       is happening, but it can tell us at least that
       <em>
        something is.
       </em>
       <br/>
       It's further been suggested, therefore, that ionospheric resonance is the most efficient method of psychic information/energy transfer.

       Thanks for reading! I really appreciate that. The topic of consciousness is fascinating for me, and coming from a non-religious family and with my dad being an engineer I always wanted to understand it from a scientific perspective. So I love writing about it and providing good sources for other people who are interested to look at.

       It does.   Of course,  industry "studies" won't come to this conclusion.   Kind of like how smoking didn't cause health problems,  according to the cigarette industry,  and lead in our gasoline was just fine,  according to the petroleum industry.

       I'll ask again, by what mechanism do cell phones damage cancer. Because from what I learned in my RF class, the average cell phone is way too weak to affect human cells. Furthermore, cell phones do not emit the kind of RF that damages human cells like microwaves do for example.

       I don't know the specifics, dude, I haven't read much into the theory personally, but you asked for the mechanism and I think I provided that. Might want to ask someone else who knows more than me on the topic, or do more research into it yourself, for specifics.

       I know specifically that cell phones generators tons of heat especially when making a call and placing the device o your ear.  Studies have shown that this raised temperature allows for proteins to pass the blood brain barrier and cause many ailments including tumors in the brain or ear.  My mother used cell phone in same position for years and now has cancer in her jaw right where the phone used to be placed.

       Saying they don't have enough energy to damage DNA directly isn't saying that they can't, or even don't, indirectly. Also, gotta factor use over an extended time period into the equation.

       Yeah but that was the electron beam hitting the screen and the shadow mask producing x rays.  It was never RF.  Radar operators got a lot of cancer, that could have been x-rays from the vacuum tubess or the crazy levels of RF heating tissue, not sure.

       Well no, as well don't know for sure why it's truly being pushed. Total surveillance is the minimum. Mood altering and or mind control is a possibility. Or worst case it might be possible to interrupt a humans physiological utilizing certain frequencies. So no can I say 100 percent how it will work or what the desired end result is no. But the options of harm are pretty bad as we don't really understand what Tesla knew.

       Most of the planet doesn't even have 3g.. I'm not sure how having all of the United States 5g capable is going to help out our stealth bombers operate during times of war in places like the Pacific Ocean or remote places off the coast of Yemen or something. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I know that Verizon bought the rights to setup my whole city with 5g but that was for rights to everyone's data.

       Well what we call 4g is not actually 4g.  Real 4g should be what like 100x faster than 3g. That was just a marketing thing for phones. 5g is something different entirely.

       That's only because you haven't figured out that the war is against the american people, and the new advanced weapons systems aren't fifty year old tech like stealth bombers, or 30 year old tech like drones.

       This guy has an interesting theory.   You know,  aluminum and barium salts sprayed into a "channel" in the air can transmit electromagnetic waves....

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You can find many articles that claim the US military must have 5G for their most advanced planes—and for their developing AI-controlled weapons. How does that work? Where will all the transmitter/cells be placed on the ground and in the air?? Something is missing here. Is there another version of 5G we’re not being told about? Is geoengineering of the atmosphere the means for tuning up space so 5G signals can be passed along without cells/transmitters?

       I’ve come to the same conclusion as you - it’s inevitable, for the purposes you state, and “decentralization” of the internet of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a giant experiment - like those workers who died of mouth cancer by licking paintbrushes used to paint luminous numbers on clock faces when that was invented.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick for getting through it will be to insulate our bodies adequately and reinforce our immune systems - those who can, anyway.  Many won’t know or be able to. We will all need to maintain vigilance on our home turfs. (For example, our community has successfully resisted smart meters for some time and I don’t have one).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether it’s an issue or not with Pollyannas is a lost argument. Either you know it’s got a potential effect that you can mitigate, or you don’t. We are always being culled. Always. I like to think of it as a strengthening challenge, a call to personal improvement.  It’s easier and less threatening that way, and the outcome is the same.

       You can't be certain but there was nothing indicating they had been like swatted or whatever. And it was a day after installing some new dishes outside on a pole. Just an assumption but you can find stories online where people are saying animals are dying around 5g zones.

       Yep. The fact that most of the country is still 3g is a disgrace. OP's statement honestly sounds like what a telecom would say to try and convince people in this sub to not force them to upgrade their shitty infrastructure.

       Your point? In this case, that's actually to the advantage of the common folk as telecoms have been refusing to do the upgrade themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military wanting something doesn't make it automatically a bad thing. If this lets us shift some of our overinflated military budget into some much needed infrastructure upgrades, then this is actually a good thing. It's just annoying that it needed the military to force the issue instead of happening sooner.

       5G will be an excuse to flood the 5ghz spectrum so that everyone adopts a single ISP based network.  Much easier to directly track people per device if we are all on the same network with unique IPv6 addresses.

       People hiding behind personal 5Ghz hotspots using NAT they want this degraded.  Hoping everyone will just use upgraded cellular connections moving forward.

       There isn't much evidence to suggest that non-ionizing radiation from radio waves is harmful. The WHO lists the cancer risk from using your cellphone directly against your ear as a 2B risk, which is in the same classification as hot coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just living in a big city alone (Like NYC) would increase your cancer risk several times more than this 5g technology, and the UV rays from sunlight are thousands of times more harmful than 5g could ever be.

       I never wanted to get to that point. The alternative is to allow EMFs and radiation to disrupt your body until you're not a functional person anymore. Given the choices, bring on the tin foil, I'll just conceal it for now because I don't like being the center of attention everywhere I go.

       They are advertised as such. A test would be to enclose a phone in a shielding pouch and see if it can receive incoming messages. I actually just tested this, and the phone call went through. So..I would say that they dampen wifi signals at best.

       If you look up wifi blocking (many of the results are geared towards avoiding blocking wifi for better signal) you'll find concrete, metal, and mirrors cited as capable of blocking wifi signals. Faraday fabrics are suppose to be made of metal mesh or plates. I'm investing in some faraday fabric for a home project. I can't say that a thin fabric will be effective, but with enough material, you could at least protect the place in which you sleep. As far as clothing, it's a far stretch (no pun intended) but maybe a little dampening around the skull would still be worth it. The danger, however, would be that EMF waves would actually bounce off the interior of the shielding material making the matter worse. The only way to really protect yourself if we find ourselves surrounded by 5g is to enclose ourselves in metal shielding, so it is a little unrealistic, though I'm not an authority on the matter; just a science student trying to protect myself.

       5g is pointless for the people. Of course the military gets what it wants, gotta keep growing the evil empire.

       They want to nationalize 5g because it will be used for radar imaging everywhere. This is also why they want it in rural areas with no customer base. This coupled with Google's Project Soli radar chip technology in (almost?)every phone and home appliances and their eyes will be everywhere.

       That happens with most larger systems. There is a military use for them as well. Examples: GPS, The Interstate Highway system, and oh yeah, The Internet.

       I never wanted to get to that point. The alternative is to allow EMFs and radiation to disrupt your body until you're not a functional person anymore. Given the choices, bring on the tin foil, I'll just conceal it for now because I don't like being the center of attention everywhere I go.
