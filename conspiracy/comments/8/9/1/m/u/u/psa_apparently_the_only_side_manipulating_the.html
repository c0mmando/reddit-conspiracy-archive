<p>What the hell is going on today? Not only did this story make the rounds weeks ago, but it is being pushed so hard here today that it couldn’t be any more obviously inorganic. </p>

<p>And to be clear, I’m not saying Sinclair <em>doesn’t</em> do the things people are claiming they do, I’m simply making fun of the people that say “the left wing media would NEVER engage in such deplorable behavior!!” </p>

<p>Any conspiracy theories on why they’re pushing this nonsense so hard today? Since ya know... this is after all a conspiracy theory sub...</p>

<p>Edit: Glad to see so many people show up to defend the MSM narrative*, rather than talk about a conspiracy theory. </p>

<p>Edit 2: *</p>

<p>Edit 3: For further proof of what I&#39;m talking about, go sort the posts in r/conspiracy right now by controversial. Notice anything?</p>

<p>I can into this thread hoping to discuss exactly this because that appeared to be the purpose of the thread, I&#39;m kind of disappointed to see it getting shutdown because it appears to be getting misinterpreted as one side. Anytime someone adds to a discussion about what we&#39;ve seen with Sinclair by referencing other known apparatus it gets shutdown as some apparent defense of the pro-Trump media or whataboutism which is dishonest. </p>

<p>And the reason why people are worried about Sinclair is that they are about to own 40% of local news organizations, and are worried that these local news organizations are going to lose their independence and be forced to run must run scripts and promos for partisan propaganda purposes. </p>

<p>On the left <em>of you,</em>  perhaps. When it comes to classic leftist issues like unions, nationalizing industry and the peace movement, American Reddit is firmly in the center right category.  When it comes to classic &quot;personal liberty&quot; issues like drug legalization, and gender and reproductive rights, Reddit is firmly libertarian.  </p>

<p>On the gun control issue, Reddit is generally pro-gun-control - but it&#39;s very important to remember that gun control is <em>not</em> a left/right issue.  Many important leftists are and were extremely opposed to any form of gun control, as a way for the government to consolidate power.  Many authoritarian rightists have used gun control as a way to disempower the opposition.</p>

THAT&#39;S the conspiracy I&#39;m talking about here.</p>

<p>The script thing has been a thing of BOTH SIDES forever, yet I&#39;ve never once seen reddit freak out about it. I&#39;ve only seen Conan make jokes about it.</p>

<p>So did you complain about Correct The Record not posting disclaimers underneath every post they put on social media? This is exactly what I&#39;m talking about.

    <div class="md"><p>It seems you&#39;re seeing the partisan angle first (because Sinclair is conservative-owned) and deciding mass interest is only because of ideology, and not the practices themselves. Thus you see a topic&#39;s popularity as partisan-based instead of being a democratic process, you see fraudulence and manufactured things going on. </p>

<p>I think CTR sucks. Are they comparable to the company that currently owns 40% of &quot;local&quot; news stations nationwide? Sure, they should also be required to run disclaimers and reveal themselves, like PAC&#39;s and companies like C.A. should. </p>

<p>What do you call Hollywood?? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hollywood is generally a pro-establishment, pro-war, pro-big-business, celebrity brown-nosing way of putting a kinder face on neoliberal capitalism.</p>

<p>You call me when Hollywood stops making pro-war films and stops glorifying royalty and powerful people.  You call me when Hollywood stops accepting money and material support from the military and the CIA (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Paid_the_Piper%3F">this book</a>).</p>

<p>Individual actors of course do have their own opinions, but there are tons of far right wing actors, and most of the &quot;leftist&quot; actors have opinions that in America before 1980, or in the rest of the first world, would be center right.</p>

<p>I think what Americans don&#39;t understand is that America before 1980 had a serious left wing which was badly injured by Reagan/Bush and then finally killed by Clinton.  If you read about FDR and what he accomplished, it&#39;s almost impossible to understand what he&#39;s saying within the context of today&#39;s political climate.  I mean, read <a href="http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/od2ndst.html">this one speech</a> - can you imagine an Obama or Clinton making that speech?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.</p>

<p>Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me--and I welcome their hatred.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider that America had an out-and-out socialist candidate in the teens and twenties - Eugene Debs.  The government imprisoned him, literally to prevent him speaking out against WW1, and he still got 3.4% of the vote in 1920 <em>campaigning from in jail</em> - including really strong support from his stronghold, Kansas.</p>

<p>I&#39;m considerably older than most redditors, and I saw this change happen.  What shocked me was not the change - it&#39;s that people seem to have forgotten entirely that it happened, and now believe that the Democrats are left-wing, when even Obama astutely noted that his politics in 2009 would have made him a Reagan Republican in 1981.</p>

The real left actually are pro-gun ownership, for instance. The milk-toast corporate center-right neoliberals who push mainstream media talking points are NOT real leftists. These marches against the 2nd Amendment are corporate pushed marches that push the mainstream media narrative and are propaganda in order to brainwash the youth—the future—in order to give up their rights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that 95% of the conspiracy’s in this sub are political in one way or another.   So when new evidence of a conspiracy comes to light, it is promoted by many for partisan reasons and attacked by many for partisan reasons.  </p>

<p><strong>This thread doesn’t help</strong>.     </p>

<p>The actual conspiracy, a pro-conservative media conglomerate is giving their local news stations literal scripts to push an agenda.  The conglomerate is targeting local news stations because they are able to claim they aren’t “main stream media” because it’s just the local down-to-Earth anchors (not those hot shot cable news millionaires out of New York and Washington) all while acting as a mouth piece for a MSM multi-billion dollar media empire.   </p>

<p>Comments that claim, “yeah, well CNN does it too” or “all MSM is garbage” or “that’s why you don’t watch TV” are meant to minimize the evidence.  The fact is that millions of people get their news from local stations.  It doesn’t matter if CNN does it too (which they do) or if you don’t watch TV anymore.  This is a legitimate problem!  It’s not partisanship that says it’s a problem, it’s common sense.  </p>

<p>This thread seems like a dig at the people who are promoting this, please take a moment and consider if local news should or should not be scripted?  If it should not, then criticize Sinclair.  It’s that easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These threads always pop up whenever one &#39;side&#39; is taking a beating, and yes they are annoying because they are so obviously partisan. Another story will pop up sooner or later on why the other side is bad and then we&#39;ll discuss that too. </p>

<p>Independent thinkers are capable of discussing both without letting their partisan blinders get in the way and getting angry that their side is taking a beating. If you even have a side you probably shouldn&#39;t be here in a sub that is ostensibly about uncovering corruption and lies by those in power. Or at least be capable of being objective when looking at the evidence, which is very rare on here due to the rampant tribalism.</p>

I would like to think that a large part of the American population knows the news is lies, Sinclair is just keeping with that pattern.</p>

<p>Hell, CNN does the exact same thing Sinclair was forcing - the EXACT same thing, the false equivocation and dithering over &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; - so that the definitions of both can be become subjective for each viewer.  That&#39;s bullshit.  Right and Left reflect a genuine conflict between political systems, modified by the factions that emerged since the conflict begun; they aren&#39;t just arbitrary labels you can define by feels.  Yet, here we have CNN justifying the feefees of Trump supporters (aka fucking morons), enabling them by calling their retarded ideology &quot;telling it like it is&quot;, and so on.

    <div class="md"><p>Propaganda for the Democratic Party isn&#39;t even to the left. If those propaganda outlets were, they would have cheated to help Bernie Sanders instead of conspiring to fuck him over. </p>

<p>So all the media outlets doing Dem propaganda are &quot;right-wing&quot; too lol</p>

<p>But ultimately this is a false dilemma. They&#39;re all authoritarian corporate entities and the agenda of a large media corporation will ALWAYS reflect this. This is what we should fight against, not petty partisan labels. </p>

<p>“the left wing media would NEVER engage in such deplorable behavior!!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the United States, there really isn&#39;t any &quot;left wing media&quot; at all. As I keep pointing out here, in the run up to the Iraq War, outside the United States the majority of newspapers ran editorials against it.  In the US, only one major metropolitan daily did, the SF Gate.  </p>

<p>To represent, say, the pro-war, pro-business, pro-surveillance, pro-Wall Street New York Times as somehow &quot;left&quot; is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Once you stop reading American media and start reading global media, you&#39;ll suddenly understand how narrow the political spectrum represented in the US media really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mainstream media shunned Bernie during the primaries and even ran hit pieces on him. They didn&#39;t give him coverage.</p>

<p>Neoliberal corporatists aren&#39;t leftwing and don&#39;t represent the leftwing, at all. The Democrat party is a Wall Street corporate party masquerading as a progressive, leftwing party and it isn&#39;t, at all. Since Hillary&#39;s loss they&#39;ve been riding Bernie&#39;s coattails and selectively using his popularity to attempt to revive the Demcratic party. </p>
