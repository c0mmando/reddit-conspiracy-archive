    <div class="md"><p>In a basic summary (I will provide more specifics later on), the company&#39;s overall goals that the public believes to be true is not actually the case. It is more of a company that promises to soon accomplish things that they know they won&#39;t be able to accomplish. They use &quot;genius&quot; examples such as the one you just mentioned when in reality it is actually irrelevant and more of a reason to make people think they&#39;re doing something epic (when they&#39;re not). Yes their sky light show in LA looked cool but that&#39;s about the peak of their abilities. Their rockets aren&#39;t leaving our atmosphere, and neither has NASA&#39;s, despite what they tell the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If their rockets aren&#39;t leaving our atmosphere, where are they going?</p>

<p>Think about the hundreds, if not thousands of companies worldwide who have paid millions of dollars to send satellites into space. Telecom companies, satellite tv providers, XM radio, tons of companies big and small from many different countries. These companies wouldn&#39;t pay all that money if the whole thing was fake. If satellites weren&#39;t real, they wouldn&#39;t even bother. The services their sats provide wouldn&#39;t exist either. There are too many companies from disparate industries and parts of the world for it to all be some Illuminati conspiracy. Just because a ton of the images from space NASA gives us are photoshopped, faked, and/or composites or artistic renderings, doesn&#39;t mean that space doesn&#39;t exist... who knows why so many space walks and images of earth from space are faked... maybe there are alien spacecraft all over the place, too numerous for them to photoshop out, so they just fake it... or maybe there&#39;s a ton of secret man-made activity going on, like secret space stations and fleets of spacecraft that we&#39;re not supposed to know about... I admit that all of NASA&#39;s fakery is alarming, but there are plenty of more-likely explanations than &quot;space/satellites don&#39;t exist&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, are you saying those first-stage rocket landings are fake as well?</p>

<p>What about him shooting his car into space? Was that also fake? People say that the tires should exploded, plastic should&#39;ve melted, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say satellites don&#39;t exist. They are real, but they don&#39;t leave the atmosphere. When people say they&#39;ve seen the ISS from earth, they&#39;re actually looking at a satellite. I don&#39;t believe in the Illuminati stuff because it perpetuates the idea that there are people in supreme power when they&#39;re not (I&#39;ve met a lot of billionaires/millionaires and they&#39;re insecure as fuck, they only have the illusion of power). Rockets do work in the sense that you can send them up in the sky and they land somewhere on earth, but they don&#39;t leave the atmosphere is all I mean. Regarding the car thing in space, that was totally fabricated. The only possible thing that could be true of this story is they shot a car up from earth, but it definitely didn&#39;t leave the atmosphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to understand what you mean... Are you saying that the atmosphere goes on forever, as in; instead of outer space (cold, black, airless void) starting at a certain point, instead the atmosphere just keeps going on forever? Or are you simply saying that our rockets can&#39;t reach that high? The highest free-fall skydive was from 130,000 feet or so,
About 25 miles up I think... why can&#39;t rockets go any higher? Do they hit some sort of physical &quot;ceiling&quot;?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t the ISS just one really big satellite? A satellite is anything that orbits earth, so the Moon is considered a satellite as well... is the Moon in our atmosphere also, rather than in outer space?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The atmosphere has a peak height (I don&#39;t know the exact number, maybe 70,000 feet). Anything that tries to fly above will just begin to tilt sideways, and for a rocket, it will just begin to fall down (but it lands safely with a parachute so that no one accidentally gets hurt).
2) The free-fall skydive was not legit at all - I don&#39;t really have any proof other than that it&#39;s an attempt to keep up the whole lie of outer space (there is no outer space). The &quot;planets&quot; are just stars.
3) The videos inside the ISS are on a zero gravity plane. When you see interviews with Mark Kelly, they are on a zero gravity plane that has a green screen behind it. If you watch enough of the videos, you will see that sometimes they cut off the camera because the zero gravity only lasts about 60 (not exact but around there) seconds before it goes back to looking normal.
4) The moon is the moon, but it&#39;s no different than the stars in the sense that it&#39;s just a light. 
5) &quot;Space may be the final frontier but it made in a Hollywood basement&quot; - Californication, Red Hot Chilli Peppers (not saying that proves anything but interesting lyric regardless).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem that seems to be getting overlooked by many folks in this thread, is that the cpu&#39;s are also made in China,  and in the x millions of bytes of code that control this self driving vehicle, it would be fairly easy to put in a backdoor. </p>

<p>So if we go into full scale war,  China can drive you off a cliff or into oncoming traffic at 120mph</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a basic summary (I will provide more specifics later on), the company&#39;s overall goals that the public believes to be true is not actually the case. It is more of a company that promises to soon accomplish things that they know they won&#39;t be able to accomplish. They use &quot;genius&quot; examples such as the one you just mentioned when in reality it is actually irrelevant and more of a reason to make people think they&#39;re doing something epic (when they&#39;re not). Yes their sky light show in LA looked cool but that&#39;s about the peak of their abilities. Their rockets aren&#39;t leaving our atmosphere, and neither has NASA&#39;s, despite what they tell the public.</p>
