<p>I’m not too great at articulating my points sometimes, so forgive me if this sounds dumb lmao.</p>

<p>Why do we all need to work pointless jobs 40-80 hours a week just to survive? Like why is that the way it is and why does nearly everyone seem to be okay with it?</p>

<p>Like why do we need man-made money to fix our roads, or build a house, or grow food? Did we not do these things before we all decided we were going to dedicate 50% of our life to working jobs that make us miserable?</p>

<p>Why can’t we live in a system where people can do what makes them happy? Why is everything always about money and making more of it?</p>

<p>Whenever I try bringing this up, people just either get irritable or accuse me of being a “commie” or a moron. I think they’ve been conditioned to think this way but idk.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>technology has made it possible to do this now, without money.  all you&#39;d need is the idea of a &quot;group contract&quot;, where some collective end goal is defined and each individual contribution/reward to that end goal is also defined.  voila, no more money.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money exists because long ago a guy had a cow but he wanted a goat. His neighbor had a pig and wanted a cow. The guy with the goat wanted the pig. Since they could not figure this mess out the guy with the extra cow took a few bushels of grain instead of a goat. But then the guy with the goat decided he too would take some grain for his goat. This work for a long time until there was a grain shortage. So instead of commodities they started using things like teeth and then eventually silver and gold. When the world economy expanded faster than the gold supply expanded Fiat money was created.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sound question. If you really want to give up all this great modern-day slavery, think about moving to a place that doesn&#39;t typically have outside access to the rest of the world. Isolated places exist in Mexico and below, Africa, and Asia. These places and people are beholden to a simple life. They eat off the land, and prefer emotional bonds over material things. The system you speak of exists, but not in really in &quot;First World&quot; countries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Money is a social construct, and over the years many different things have served as &quot;money&quot;. When Civilization, and the process leading up to it, first began, it was based on the exchange of property, gifts, and social capital. The original idea behind money as we understand it was to find something, such as precious metals, that a majority of people valued. Then use that as a common bartering tool instead of the specific good or service.</p>

<p>The rest of the system, its attendant benefits and drawbacks, grew from there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be serious, we were doomed the moment we valued things.  That being said, a monarch like system was bound to happen- where those that are held the most responsible attain the most from society.  That was all fine and all until eventually those attained valuables were passed on down from generation to generation, tipping the scale to the point of toppling over, which we see now.  The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  Funny thing is the quality of life is getting better, increasing the population- perhaps to pump out more &quot;slaves&quot;.  So don&#39;t believe what you hear when people tell you to quit your job and chase your dreams because if everyone were to do that, then who would be around to make phones, automobiles etc etc.  It&#39;s all a trap. </p>
