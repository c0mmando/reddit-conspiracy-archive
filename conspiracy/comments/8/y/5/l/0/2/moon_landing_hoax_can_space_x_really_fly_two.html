    <div class="md"><p>The question is whether or not you believe the official narrative about why we haven’t sent humans back to the moon.  </p>

<p>Maybe the expense/risk vs reward isn’t worth it anymore.   Similarly, NASA doesn’t appear to have the federal funding to back their exploratory lunar missions anymore.  </p>

<p>Personally, I don’t buy that narrative but I can’t back that by anything but circumstantial evidence or hearsay.  So, anything we say here is speculation.  </p>

<p>I hope Musk can do it.  Personalities aside, just to have some deep pockets funding space exploration is a step in the right direction IMO.</p>

<p>What do you suppose the ISS, or what most of us believe is the ISS, is when we see it with the naked eye (or via telescope) up in the sky?  What about all the satellites that orbit the earth?  Are they actually inside the atmosphere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you put a closed, pressurized system inside a vacuum chamber, but don’t turn it on, the pressure inside the can is high but the can is able to hold the soda inside. By turning on the vacuum chamber you dramatically reduce the pressure around the can. The can is not strong enough to continue holding the soda inside and the can explodes outward to fill in the space with less pressure. You’re telling me the only thing that prevents the earth from exploding into the vacuum of space is the atmosphere? It’s not even a solid structure. How could it prevent an equalization of pressure on a scale that massive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To make a different, but supporting logical argument...how long did it take to go from the first airplane flight to the first moon landing? How many years has it been between the first moon landing and now? Does the rate of technical progression stay constant or does it increase (moore’s Law)? If we are honest with ourselves, I would think the answer should be decrease. We went from airplanes to moon landing in 50 years and it’s been an addition 50 years since the first moon landing. How is it that we haven’t reached any additional milestones in the same amount of time that it took us to go from no flight to a trip to the moon? That’s not how technology works, which leads me to logically conclude that there is some reason the tech hasn’t progressed, but it’s a reason they cannot be truthful about, so they decided to deceive everyone about why we haven’t progressed in that area. Of course not everyone knows this; most people at NASA just do what they’re told and they have no reason to suspect it’s fraudulent. When you consider this logical argument, and combine it with research about the impossibility of the ISS existing in space, then it is clear in my mind that we cannot conclude anything for certain about what is beyond the area known as low earth orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Moore&#39;s law isn&#39;t about technical progression, it&#39;s specifically about the number of transistors in an integrated circuit. It&#39;s also not a law, it&#39;s just an observation of the past that a single guy made once.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve reached a lot of significant milestones since the 60s. The internet now exists. Our information and data processing capabilities are far better than they were back then.</p>

<p>If you mean manned space milestones; we have the ISS, which would be completely unthinkable in the 60s. We haven&#39;t gone to additional planetary bodies for a multitude of reasons though.</p>

<p>The biggest ones are that 
1. We no longer have a cold war pushing us. The Apollo program was basically a giant pissing contest with the Soviet Union. It was a game of chicken designed to try to bankrupt the other country, with a nice side effect of ballistic missile advancements. After we won, there was no huge political motivation to continue
2. The next &quot;milestone&quot; for manned excursions on a planetary body would be Mars. Mars is far, far harder than the moon for a lot of reasons, the biggest of which is how far away it is. The distance of the moon compared to mars, even at its closest is like comparing a trip to your neighbors house across the street to a 10 mile run. Sometimes it&#39;s 5 miles, and sometimes it&#39;s 20 miles though. Also, during that run, you&#39;re pelted by deadly cosmic radiation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s way, way harder, and there&#39;s almost no economic or political incentive to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright but I was using it to illustrate the general pace of technological advancement, which is exponential rather than linear.</p>

<p>I find it hilarious that you genuinely believe that the idea of a space station was “completely unthinkable in the 60s.” On that note, the space station is a fraud, so it doesn’t count as a milestone. </p>

<p>Lastly, there’s always a political and economic incentive. Just because history says the Cold War ended doesn’t mean the human drive for competition has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually never said the idea of a space station was unthinkable in the 60s, not exactly sure where you read that. A 150 billion dollar space station bigger than a football field, built by 15 countries cooperating together was unthinkable.</p>

<p>There&#39;s obviously incentive. It&#39;s just not as strong as it was during the cold war. There&#39;s no country with a space program as developed as the USA&#39;s, and there won&#39;t be for a while. Ballistic missile technology is also mature. There&#39;s not a whole lot of valuable data that the military can use from more rocket launches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s funny because I’m reading the phrase that I quoted and it’s still in your previous comment. Anyway, the space station is a technical impossibility. Don’t ask an engineer or physicist. Ask a machinist. They will tell you it is impossible to keep the entire station perfectly sealed without constantly machining new seals and replacing the old ones. If nobody is doing that, and they haven’t experienced a failure, then that should tell you it’s a fraud.</p>

Yes... all astronauts spend their entire careers studying the minutia of space travel. 99.999% of machinists don&#39;t. I&#39;ve never met a machinist that&#39;s sent anything to space.</p>

<p>Besides that, machinists are experts at machining parts, not engineering things in space. The skills aren&#39;t even close to relevant</p>

<p>Too bad NASA took down the live feed from the ISS or else when you look at it through a telescope, you’d be able to check the live feed and see that it’s nowhere near your backyard. That’s actually proof it doesn’t exist as claimed.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to understand &quot;the minutia of space travel&quot; in order to determine how often a vacuum-sealed metal structure might leak.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not making a claim that it exists. I&#39;m telling you that seeing something fly by through a telescope does not conclusive proof make. How do you not see that? If it were live, wouldn&#39;t you be able to see the area of the world you live in when it passes overhead? Its all deception just like on TV. A scene starts by showing you the facade of a building that actually exists, and then it cuts to a set where the characters are acting in a controlled environment. Am I saying the original building in the stock footage doesn&#39;t exist? No! I&#39;m saying just because they show you footage of something happening in what looks to be the interior of the building doesn&#39;t mean that those people are actually there doing that. That&#39;s basic television production.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was painful to watch. I&#39;m not surprised that a random astronaut doesn&#39;t know how a specific mechanism on the biggest space station ever built works. There&#39;s a much better chance of an astronaut knowing that than a random machinist though. Machinists don&#39;t design mechanisms. They machine parts. Virtually none of those parts go to space. Machining parts doesn&#39;t qualify you to know how things work in space construction.</p>

<p>Literally seeing something with my own eyes is just about the best tangible proof there is. You can go out with a telescope and look at the thing yourself on any given night. If that doesn&#39;t convince you, there&#39;s really no possible way to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright let me take a new direction. On the space station, is there any possibility of an air leak? What is the probability that a risky event like that would occur? We know accidents happen right? Parts fail. So what is the likelihood that a failure like that would happen?</p>
