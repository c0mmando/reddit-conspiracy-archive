<p>Check out The Creature from Jeckyll Island for the details of our latest currency based enslavement. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>^ Great book.</p>

<p>It should be noted that <strong>Eustace Mullins</strong> was the first author to expose the Federal Reserve scheme to the public in his 1954 book <a href="https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-Yc5BED-gpTNRjLh6/The-Federal-Reserve-Conspiracy-Eustace-Mullins_djvu.txt"><strong>Secrets of the Federal Reserve</strong></a> (PDF WARNING). </p>

<p>Mullins investigated the matter at the insistence of his friend and mentor, the brilliant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Pound">Ezra Pound</a>. Mullins also authored Pound&#39;s official biography, <em>&quot;This Difficult Individual&quot;</em>.</p>

<p><em>(naturally, both pound and Mullins are HATED by the &quot;usual suspects&quot;)</em></p>

<p>Finally, here is a contemporary political cartoon depicting <a href="http://prudentpress.com/wp-content/uploads/jacksonmonster.jpg">Andrew Jackson destroying an early attempt at creating a Central Bank in the US</a></p>

<p>I found it quite appropriate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a model borrowed from the Bank of England which was chartered in 1694. The deal was that all government revenues would be deposited with the bank, allowing the bank to use the deposits as a reserve basis to create paper currency. This currency was then lent to the King in exchange for bonds. The bonds were then used as additional reserves upon which even more currency could be created. It partnered government and banking assuring the government would be able borrow almost infinitely while allowing the central bank to enjoy a monopoly creating the national currency. </p>

<p>Using this relationship the British Empire took over the world and by the time Alexander Hamilton came along he was most interested in creating a similar institution here. The 1st Bank of the U.S. was not very popular and it&#39;s charter expired in 1811. The bankers IMMEDIATELY began legislative efforts to create a new bank and succeeded in 1816 with the 2nd BUS. Fast forward to 1832 and the bank is in a pitched battle with Andrew Jackson, who despised the bank. The bank president, Nicholas Biddle, arrogantly floated the renewal charter four years early convinced it would pass and, low and behold, Jackson vetoed it. The 2nd BUS was killed and Jackson fulfilled his campaign promise to destroy the bank. With the fall of the 2nd Bank, however, the bank and it&#39;s branches totally decimated the economy calling in loans and contracting the money supply. The Depression of 1837 was subsequently blamed on Jackson though it was Biddle that did it, quite intentionally. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until 1913 that the bankers made a move again to create a new bank and now we have the Federal Reserve System. </p>

<p>I hope that answers your question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The government pays interest to the Federal Reserve Banks because the Federal Reserve banks buy Treasury bonds. Like every owner of Treasury bonds, the Fed gets interest. The Federal Reserve also gives almost all of its profits to the government.</p>

<p>The federal government borrows money by auctioning off Treasury bonds, which anybody can buy. They are widely held and are considered one of the safest investments in the whole world. The interest rate for Treasury bonds currently ranges from 1.88% to 2.97%, depending on the term of the bond. Considering that inflation is about 1.9%, this is a very low rate.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve buys a portion of the Treasury bonds. Currently the Federal Reserve owns about $2.4 trillion in Treasury securities. The other $18.8 trillion is owned by other institutions, people, and government agencies. In 2016, the Federal Reserve received about $64 billion in interest from the Treasury bonds it owned. But the Federal Reserve paid $91 billion <strong>to</strong> the federal government.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve buys bonds in order to create new money. It can buy other types of assets, too. After the financial meltdown in 2008, the Federal Reserve bought huge quantities of mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<p>The quantity of Treasury bonds is explicitly limited by Congress. When the Federal Reserve buys Treasury bonds, this is debt that already exists and it does not increase just because the Fed buys it.</p>

<p>I can answer other questions if you have them, but I am hopefully going to sleep soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Starting in 2016, Congress made it mandatory for the Federal Reserve to hand over all its profits (after the dividend paid to member banks). In the Fed&#39;s annual report, these are called &quot;statutory transfers&quot;. In the years before that (from 1947 to 2015) it was at the discretion of the Board of Governors of how much to pay to the government and how much to hold in reserve. By far most of the profit still went to the government, but not quite all.</p>

<p>During that period, the payments were called &quot;Interest on Federal Reserve notes&quot;, because technically, Federal Reserve notes are debt that that Fed banks owe to the holders of the notes, and the statute authorized the Board of Governors to assess each Federal Reserve Bank for interest on any outstanding notes. In reality that was a fiction since there was no calculation based on outstanding notes. Instead the Board just told the banks to hand over all their profits.</p>

<p>From 1914 to 1933, there was a 90% &quot;franchise tax&quot;. Between 1933 and World War II, the profits were paid to the FDIC to build up their insurance fund. During World War II, the Fed just bought war bonds, I think. </p>

<li><p>If the federal government can print bonds and sell them to the FED which uses them to create money, why can&#39;t the government just create the money directly? </p></li>
<li><p>Even after the $91 billion interest rebate from the FED the line item in the budget for &quot;NET INTEREST&quot; is still in the $400 billion range. Again, why take on such huge debt when the government can simply create money? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>(Of note, in 2016 the FED realized a profit of $92 billion, 6% ($5.5 billion) of which was simply handed over to the private banks just because they were allowed to buy shares in the 12 privately owned FED banks.) </p>

The concept is that in order for people to perceive that the bonds are valuable, a third party has to buy them.

    <div class="md"><p>After a huge public relations campaign, engineered by the foreign central banks, the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was slipped through Congress during the Christmas recess, with many members of the Congress absent. President Woodrow Wilson, pressured by his political and financial backers, signed it on December 23, 1913.</p>

<p>Basically, because the Jewish/UK International Bankers wanted to enslave the US. This is the reason. So that they can make money off of us slaves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally every sentence you wrote is wrong.</p>

<p>Congress had been considering creating a new banking system since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907">Panic of 1907</a>. Crashes and recessions happened much more frequently back then. They created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Monetary_Commission">National Monetary Commission</a>, chaired by Senator Nelson Aldrich, to study the issue.</p>

<p>After two years of study —which produced <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/topics/?tid=13">numerous volumes of research</a>— Aldrich asked for several bankers to assist him in drafting legislation to create a central banking system. They met in secret at a resort on Jekyll Island, Georgia. They wrote a bill which would have created a National Reserve System. This was known as the Aldrich Plan. However, the bill never came up for a vote in Congress.</p>

<p>Two years later, in 1912, Woodrow Wilson ran on a platform which included reform of the banking and monetary system.
Wilson&#39;s speeches were collected in a book published in 1913 called <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7WpIAAAAYAAJ"><em>The New Freedom</em></a>. When he won and Democrats won control of both houses of Congress, a new bill was drafted.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve system was designed to not only provide for a stable banking and money system, but also to help reduce the power of the big New York banks. That&#39;s why there are 12 Federal Reserve districts.</p>

<p>The House Banking Committee held extensives hearings about proposed reforms starting in January, even before Wilson was sworn in as President in March. They held hearings on January 7-9, 14-16, 21-22, 28-29 and February 5, 17, and 28. That testimony is collected in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZREjAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover">this volume</a> of more than 700 pages.</p>

<p>In June, President Wilson addressed a joint session of Congress, urging passage of a money reform bill: <em>New York Times</em>: <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06EFDF153FE633A25757C2A9609C946296D6CF">&quot;MONEY REFORM NOW, IS WILSON&#39;S DEMAND&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>The Senate Banking Committee held hearings on September 2-6, 8, 16-20, 22-26, 29-30 and October 4, 6-7, 8-11, 13-17, 20-25, 27. The testimony is collected in three volumes (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=URA9AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PR1">Vol. 1</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fRE9AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA961">Vol. 2</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EDsuAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PR1">Vol. 3</a>), totalling more than 3000 pages.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives initially passed the bill on <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B03EFD8113BE633A2575AC1A96F9C946296D6CF">September 18.</a> The Senate passed a different version of the bill on <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E1D6103FE633A25753C2A9649D946296D6CF">December 19,</a> by a vote of 54 to 34.</p>

<p>A conference committee met to work out a compromise bill. The bill passed the House by an overwhelming majority of 298 to 60 on December 22, 1913. While it&#39;s true that some senators left town before the final vote, the bill passed the Senate the next day by a vote of 43 to 25. We know for a fact that the bill would have passed by an absolute majority if everybody voted. Not only did senators leave a record of how they would have voted, back then the parties had a system of vote pairing so that the vote would not be affected if members were not able to vote.</p>

<p>So, to summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>The issue of a new banking system was considered for more than five years from the creation of the National Monetary Commission to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act.</li>
<li>The creation of the new banking system was a prominent part of Woodrow Wilson&#39;s campaign for the presidency. The people voted for Wilson and the Democratic Party.</li>
<li>The issue was prominently debated during the entire year of 1913. Woodrow Wilson gave a speech to Congress calling for its passage.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve Act was overwhelming popular with Democratic congressmen and the public.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;I believe the banking institutions are mode dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation the banks and corporations that grow up around(the banks) will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&#39;</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>That&#39;s the only bit of wisdom and philosophy any of us need. Jefferson was absolutely correct. The United States was based and created based on historical truth and philosophy.</p>

<p>Everything else is deliberate complexity for a problem that&#39;s ultimately very simple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that the alternative, an asset backed currency, still allows private entities to control the money supply. If we return to the gold standard, anyone who digs up gold is increasing the amount of available currency, which causes everyone else&#39;s money to depreciate proportionally. The only way to prevent a gold based currency from experiencing speculation driven inflation is to fix the price of gold by statute. Though of course once you have artificially controlled the value of an asset backed currency it becomes functionally indistinguishable from a properly managed fiat system. Even if you substitute gold for a more modern construct, such as fixing the value of a currency to an index of some basket of commodities, you still would have to control the price of those commodities to prevent speculation.</p>

<p>To answer the question as to why the Fed pays member banks interests on deposits is rather straightforward; interest rates are the primary intervention tool utilized by the Fed. If the Fed did not pay interest, then member banks would keep most if not all of the minimum reserve requirement in their vaults rather than on deposit. Setting interest rates is the preferred method of Fed intervention, and incidentally the most effective and least disruptive. The Fed increases the interest rate it pays to increase deposits in order to combat inflation. Conversely, the Fed lowers the interest rate it pays to decrease deposits in order to stimulate the economy or combat deflation. </p>

<p>It should also be noted that the interest paid is dwarfed by the opportunity cost of having to deposit that money. So I don&#39;t know that you can have a conspiracy in which the conspirators are deliberately making less money than otherwise possible. </p>

<p>That quote is a mixture of three different quotes. Two are garbled versions of Jefferson&#39;s real words, but the middle part, &quot;If the American people ever allow ... on the continent their fathers conquered&quot; is a complete fake, from a century after Jefferson died.</p>

<p>If Jefferson were alive today, maybe he would change his mind since our modern economy has produced such widespread prosperity that he would have had difficult imagining. And it&#39;s not based on actual slave labor, unlike Jefferson&#39;s wealth.</p>

Ok so some of the baskets may have been Jewish but I can pretty much gaurantee the politicians that voted it into law weren&#39;t and the President wasn&#39;t and a large portion of the people profiting from it even today arent. Yeah, we got rooked. Our money is worthless but that&#39;s because a bunch of greedy assholes figured out a way to rip off the nation and they weren&#39;t all Jewish so for fucks sake give it a rest.

<p>People always talk about being gold-backed, but forget to mention how it would work in practice.  Let&#39;s say each dollar owned in the world is backed by some amount of gold (it still today, because you can buy gold bars with it), all of a sudden, gold prices will will skyrocket even more because there is a finite amount in the world.  Aside from jewelry, gold has other uses in manufacturing which would have major downstream impacts no one wants to consider.</p>

Wikipedia says it “Jewish people are an ethnoreligious group and a nation, originating from the Israelites and Hebrews of the Ancient Near East. Jewish ethnicity, nationhood, and religion are strongly interrelated, as Judaism is the traditional faith of the Jewish people, while its observance varies from strict observance to complete nonobservance.
So... it’s both. The more you know! BTW I’m not Jewish so if that’s incorrect hopefully someone who is will correct me. </p>

<p>Why does the United States pay compounding interest to the Federal Reserve Member Banks to issue its own currency?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not OUR currency - it is owned by the FED (federal reserve note) - we pay them for the privilege of using Their currency instead of government issued currency.</p>

<p>Notice it&#39;s a fed reserve &quot;Note&quot; - A note payable is a written promissory note. Under this agreement, a borrower obtains a specific amount of money from a lender and promises to pay it back with interest over a predetermined time period.</p>

<p>In the mid &#39;90s I wrote to Henry Gonzales who was the chair of the house banking comity and asked why congress did not follow the law directing it to control the money supply and printing ... I got a form letter and put on a list in response. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally every sentence you wrote is wrong.</p>

<p>Congress had been considering creating a new banking system since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1907">Panic of 1907</a>. Crashes and recessions happened much more frequently back then. They created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Monetary_Commission">National Monetary Commission</a>, chaired by Senator Nelson Aldrich, to study the issue.</p>

<p>After two years of study —which produced <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/topics/?tid=13">numerous volumes of research</a>— Aldrich asked for several bankers to assist him in drafting legislation to create a central banking system. They met in secret at a resort on Jekyll Island, Georgia. They wrote a bill which would have created a National Reserve System. This was known as the Aldrich Plan. However, the bill never came up for a vote in Congress.</p>

<p>Two years later, in 1912, Woodrow Wilson ran on a platform which included reform of the banking and monetary system.
Wilson&#39;s speeches were collected in a book published in 1913 called <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7WpIAAAAYAAJ"><em>The New Freedom</em></a>. When he won and Democrats won control of both houses of Congress, a new bill was drafted.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve system was designed to not only provide for a stable banking and money system, but also to help reduce the power of the big New York banks. That&#39;s why there are 12 Federal Reserve districts.</p>

<p>The House Banking Committee held extensives hearings about proposed reforms starting in January, even before Wilson was sworn in as President in March. They held hearings on January 7-9, 14-16, 21-22, 28-29 and February 5, 17, and 28. That testimony is collected in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZREjAQAAMAAJ&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover">this volume</a> of more than 700 pages.</p>

<p>In June, President Wilson addressed a joint session of Congress, urging passage of a money reform bill: <em>New York Times</em>: <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B06EFDF153FE633A25757C2A9609C946296D6CF">&quot;MONEY REFORM NOW, IS WILSON&#39;S DEMAND&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>The Senate Banking Committee held hearings on September 2-6, 8, 16-20, 22-26, 29-30 and October 4, 6-7, 8-11, 13-17, 20-25, 27. The testimony is collected in three volumes (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=URA9AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PR1">Vol. 1</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fRE9AAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA961">Vol. 2</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EDsuAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PR1">Vol. 3</a>), totalling more than 3000 pages.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives initially passed the bill on <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B03EFD8113BE633A2575AC1A96F9C946296D6CF">September 18.</a> The Senate passed a different version of the bill on <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E1D6103FE633A25753C2A9649D946296D6CF">December 19,</a> by a vote of 54 to 34.</p>

<p>A conference committee met to work out a compromise bill. The bill passed the House by an overwhelming majority of 298 to 60 on December 22, 1913. While it&#39;s true that some senators left town before the final vote, the bill passed the Senate the next day by a vote of 43 to 25. We know for a fact that the bill would have passed by an absolute majority if everybody voted. Not only did senators leave a record of how they would have voted, back then the parties had a system of vote pairing so that the vote would not be affected if members were not able to vote.</p>

<p>So, to summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>The issue of a new banking system was considered for more than five years from the creation of the National Monetary Commission to the passage of the Federal Reserve Act.</li>
<li>The creation of the new banking system was a prominent part of Woodrow Wilson&#39;s campaign for the presidency. The people voted for Wilson and the Democratic Party.</li>
<li>The issue was prominently debated during the entire year of 1913. Woodrow Wilson gave a speech to Congress calling for its passage.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve Act was overwhelming popular with Democratic congressmen and the public.</li>
</ul>

<p>^ Great book.</p>

<p>It should be noted that <strong>Eustace Mullins</strong> was the first author to expose the Federal Reserve scheme to the public in his 1954 book <a href="https://archive.org/stream/pdfy-Yc5BED-gpTNRjLh6/The-Federal-Reserve-Conspiracy-Eustace-Mullins_djvu.txt"><strong>Secrets of the Federal Reserve</strong></a> (PDF WARNING). </p>

<p>Mullins investigated the matter at the insistence of his friend and mentor, the brilliant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Pound">Ezra Pound</a>. Mullins also authored Pound&#39;s official biography, <em>&quot;This Difficult Individual&quot;</em>.</p>

<p><em>(naturally, both pound and Mullins are HATED by the &quot;usual suspects&quot;)</em></p>

<p>Finally, here is a contemporary political cartoon depicting <a href="http://prudentpress.com/wp-content/uploads/jacksonmonster.jpg">Andrew Jackson destroying an early attempt at creating a Central Bank in the US</a></p>

<p>I found it quite appropriate.</p>
