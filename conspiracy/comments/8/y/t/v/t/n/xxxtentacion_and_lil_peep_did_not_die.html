       Both deaths were staged to milk more money out of sad fans. It's a very funny coincidence how XXX started a "charity" right before he died, then on social media they heavily promoted the idea of donating to their charity. Beyond that they gave a mailing address for people to send their items after he deid, if he's dead, what is the point? I understand you could say maybe people want to give items to pay homage to him and his family, but no, it's bullshit so they can get more crap to sell (yes they are that low). Not to mention they had fake face tats to make them unidentifiable now that they've "retired" from their music careers. As you may have noticed, both artists had a very "sad" underlying tone with their music. This is to grab the hearts of those who are down and manipulate them to giving their money because they think they relate to the artists. Within the next few years they will be coming out to say what actually happened.

       I live in LA and I know how this business works. People don't even realize that the names and ages of a lot of celebrities are not even real (I'm sure some of you already know that here though). Not to mention there are so many lies regarding stories for publicity - all of this, I've seen first hand.

       I feel that the world does have people who are very negative, but this also means that these deaths didn't actually occur, which you could look at that to be a positive thing (even though it's fucked up they did it regardless).

       They are both dead, and you think they have fake face tats? It’s an interesting theory but I think thier spirits are still here on this planet. They both were into the occult heavily

       I don't believe in occult stuff, I consider it a way to scare people by confusion. I recommend you listen to some of their lyrics or interviews and both somewhat suggest that they will die soon. They're were told to do this by the label promoting their music (even though they weren't "signed" when they started, they still had a label promoting them that just wasn't publicly identified to make it seem like they came out of nowhere).

       and see how they are thriving. The occult is far more real than you think. I know it’s hard to accept the fact that these artists are dead, I was devastated when peep died because we all saw it coming.

       There is a peak height of fame with certain artists before they begin to lose popularity. It's easier to have them "disappear" at their peak rather then when they aren't that famous anymore.

       this is a good argument. I get that maybe an arrangement was made to get them out the spotlight but still make bank, I just still think however they're actually dead. and in the grand realm of conspiracies, this one is pretty low impact, considering they can't make music in that moniker anymore and further the media's agenda

       The only reason I might buy into this (to be clear, I think XXXTentacion is very very dead because he's a dumbass who flaunts a LV bag full of cash at people who know who he is, and doesn't travel with security at all) is because both of these people had videos of their dead bodies on popular video sites. Anyone doubting the death is just met with "but did you see the video though he dead"

       As someone who has seen dozens of Liveleak videos among other things, I can tell you that these videos are not authentic. Not to mention, I could take an image of your face and put it on someone else and frame you for whatever the original video showed (obviously I wouldn't do that, I'm just describing the current state of technology). The Capo (rapper) death video was also fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of video editing and fakery and because they're rappers or that 
"he's a dumbass who flaunts a LV bag full of cash at people who know who he is, and doesn't travel with security at all" makes it seem to people that it makes sense why they would be killed, but you have to realize that is part of their story to have the murder make sense.

       Your proof is that it's possible, that isn't proof. Go and edit one of those videos, see how easy it is to make a believable reproduction then reevaluate that, but don't confuse the absence of evidence as evidence.

       XXXTentacion made a deal with powers higher than him. Just watch (or don't, honestly) his posthumously released music video. There's a ton of occult symbolism, and he even names is inner Daemon. The video is about him making a deal with entities greater than he so that his family will be comfortable for the rest of their lives.
      </p>

       He's most definitely dead- he played the game. And he knew exactly what he was sacrificing to do so.

       Wouldn't be so sure of that. There is Occult symbolism throughout Hollywood...even in its very name.

      <p>
       People thinking they believe in the Occult doesn't make them seem more powerful. To most people it seems strange or unbelievable. But once you start to look, you see that the Occult is a key motivational factor. You gotta dig deeper my friend. The Occult connections are tied to the abuse, especially of children.

       I didn't take anything out of context friend/ I said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Well a lot of very powerful people do
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In response to you saying:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I don't believe in occult stuff
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To which you then replied:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        No they don't, I've met them
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Implying that you've met powerful people that don't believe in the Occult and thus what I said is untrue. You should clarify your statements.

       I respectfully believe you should reconsider this position. Many powerful people certainly do believe in the occult.
