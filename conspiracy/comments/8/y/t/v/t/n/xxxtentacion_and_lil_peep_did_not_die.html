        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Both deaths were staged to milk more money out of sad fans. It&#39;s a very funny coincidence how XXX started a &quot;charity&quot; right before he died, then on social media they heavily promoted the idea of donating to their charity. Beyond that they gave a mailing address for people to send their items after he deid, if he&#39;s dead, what is the point? I understand you could say maybe people want to give items to pay homage to him and his family, but no, it&#39;s bullshit so they can get more crap to sell (yes they are that low). Not to mention they had fake face tats to make them unidentifiable now that they&#39;ve &quot;retired&quot; from their music careers. As you may have noticed, both artists had a very &quot;sad&quot; underlying tone with their music. This is to grab the hearts of those who are down and manipulate them to giving their money because they think they relate to the artists. Within the next few years they will be coming out to say what actually happened.</p>

<p>I live in LA and I know how this business works. People don&#39;t even realize that the names and ages of a lot of celebrities are not even real (I&#39;m sure some of you already know that here though). Not to mention there are so many lies regarding stories for publicity - all of this, I&#39;ve seen first hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>XXXTentacion made a deal with powers higher than him. Just watch (or don&#39;t, honestly) his posthumously released music video. There&#39;s a ton of occult symbolism, and he even names is inner Daemon. The video is about him making a deal with entities greater than he so that his family will be comfortable for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>He&#39;s most definitely dead- he played the game. And he knew exactly what he was sacrificing to do so.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be so sure of that. There is Occult symbolism throughout Hollywood...even in its very name. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which are rumors that they spread so people think they have more power than they actually have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People thinking they believe in the Occult doesn&#39;t make them seem more powerful. To most people it seems strange or unbelievable. But once you start to look, you see that the Occult is a key motivational factor. You gotta dig deeper my friend. The Occult connections are tied to the abuse, especially of children. </p>

<p>In response to you saying:</p>

<p>To which you then replied:</p>

<p>Implying that you&#39;ve met powerful people that don&#39;t believe in the Occult and thus what I said is untrue. You should clarify your statements. </p>
