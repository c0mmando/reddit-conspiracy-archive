      <p>
       Here's an attempt an explaining the simplicity of what seems to be going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       In ancient egypt the initiated had to mimic the path of the sun. Drag a cross up a hill, being crucified for 3 days, and those who survived, were given the name jesus. Which is the soul, which is all living.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here my additional take, the soul is the sun, the nus the noose, the liquid crystal brain designed to be the receiving dish of the thought patterns which then explode in-front of us as electrons covering everything. Jesus Christ, Hey Zeus and the liquid crystal, christ all, from which all emmates. All is little wordgames and stories of every detail attached, from shapes to colours. It's all a programming language affecting what really runs this, yet is in a form an hypnotic trance, which really is just believing this to be real, and thus giving in to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I propose that consciousness is dimensionless, so in the one moment it was lured into a trap of light and matter, it keeps feeding the illusion with consciousness to al that is born, as this moves, or changes in all the appearance of time and space.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has always been the same, names and meanings just change slightly, as well as how it looks, and how prominent in society whatever means of control are at any given moment in time, which is space which does not exist, as spooky action at a distance hints. Consciousness has always been the same, just believing different stories in this one now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently part of the new age movement teach people to dis-identify with their feelings and thoughts, and that there is something that is aware of what is going on in here, and you want to identify with that. This sounds oddly similar to what I am going to describe below. In the same way, Jim Carrey hints that nothing is real, and that this world doesn't belong to us, which in a sense is true, even our minds do not belong to us. Carrey also said “I am everything and this thing” The key difference in the information presented at the blog, is that our awareness is none of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth of the matter is that this dimensionless consciousness is copied out into all of us, and slowly becomes entranced into believing this, as it unfolds around us in one now. It is within this manifested mind that a change occurs, and the trance is undone, if thoughts and emotions are observed for what they are. The trance is simply believing this to be real, and at the blog, I do my best to show how it can't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       All occurs now, and always occurred now. There is vibration/energy and there is one dimensionless consciousness which perceives all in a trance, on a universal as well as individual basis. Observe to deprogram.
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult elite of the world use majick, or kabbalah, to control reality. In kabbalah we have the tree of life, turn that 90 degrees, and we get IX XI (9 11). 9 11’s arranged as 111111111 times 111111111 gives all numbers (12345678987654321). On 911 there’s 111 day left of the year. 9 11’s could also be written a 3 111’s. 111 divided by 3 is 37. 12345678987654321 divided by 37 is 333666999666333 (look into 369 vortex math)
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult group has a secret number which is 322, as mentioned by both Bush junior and John Kerry in interviews. They love to mirror things, and 322-223 is 99 which is 11 times 9.
      </p>
      <p>
       The secret of the kabballah is how to manipulate reality via rituals, symbolism and group focus. The elite force these numbers upon us, to include us in their rituals, otherwise they won’t work. For the most part they hide this as well as they can. For example, the post Brexit market panic occurred 7 years 7 months 7 weeks and 7 days after the Dow Jones index dropped 777 points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some images I produced with certain themes also produces these numbers, one is called “A Money Bloke” – Here are a few numbers associated with that image – It was uploaded 333 days before China lost 6&amp;#37; on their markets, sparking the 2 day 888 dow jones drop over the day with 133 days left of the year, and the 233rd day of the year. This image was also put online 777 days before Egypt devalued their currency by half.
      </p>
      <p>
       All is just beliefs - understanding that is the highest state of being in this illusion. Realise the ego/eye isn't what perceives, the ego is the perceived, it's up to the individual whether or not to keep believing in something which really isn't there, yet can be changed and altered countless ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Observe the order of nature, and understand the emotional connections to ideas, that all are based on intellectual and emotional approaches to whatever. Approaches, knowledge and emotions that changed throughout pretty much all civilised time. What we are subjected to, is a sophisticated version of the events that happened to the The Wild and Free Pigs of the Okefenokee Swamp in the story of the same name, only here the pigs are one consciousness, and everything else is the 3d illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is real but consciousness - all perceived is energy, frequency and vibration, a story overlaid with a seemingly new story in every moment. On top of that, all we identify with, including our perceived identities, is shaped by our surroundings, and eventually our inner world. So with that in mind, here are a few facts -
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts and emotions; both are electrochemical reactions, atoms interacting with atoms. There is consciousness, and there is vibration. From John 1:1 (ion 11) “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” Words have sounds, sounds vibrate, vibration is energy, energy glows, glowing is light, light is a wave, a wave is caused by vibration. Here from Genesis 1:3 “And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The ancient Egyptians considered Thoth to be creator of all knowledge, creativity and magic, as the most relevant abilities for this explanation, as well as the maintainer of the universe. Atum was considered the finisher of the world, and the one who would return to watery chaos at the end of the creative cycle. Thoths “grandparent” is Nu, the deification of the watery abyss that existed before all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the kabbalah we have Ein Sof, which is considered to be god before any of this. This place have had many gods, and in general Thor, Zeus, Jupitor as well as many many of the other “gods” are considered to be the same. In ancient buddhism we have Brahma, which basically means “ultimate reality” and we have his consort Saraswati – which means “essence of self” or “one with plenty of water”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Appreciate that there is no time, all is occurring now, and always occurred now. Thoughts and emotions appear over the construct of time and space.

       I've never heard of the crucification part but I have heard that Egyptian priests would do a mock death and resurrection ritual as part of initiation. There's also the theory that the pyramids at Giza were used for this ritual and not as tombs.

       Those that have since the beginning. We don't know their names, but we know they exist. The hidden hand. They've had a major impact in all major religions. You can see their influence through the symbology, the truth mixed in with the lies. The tools shrouded in smoke.

       The universe is constructed idea by all the beings who live in it. Here and now. Core human beliefs (conditioning) filtering and limiting the possibilities and probabilities for each individual. There is something that is within everything, but it's not so much a light as a sublime, unique interconnectedness that isn't a thing, a no-thingness. It's Reality with a capital "R." Unchanging and ever-changing.

       So the unpleasant truth is that there is no time? I think its fairly obvious time exists and is more than man made. Please source where Egyptian initiates were called Jesus because I've studied ancient religion and have never heard this.

       If nothing is real but consciousness then where did everything come from and for what reason?  You're throwing around statements like they're facts and using no coherent structure to make your point. Maybe you should research the age of Aquarius before you think you have all the answers.

       Have you ever thought of researching the verses in the Book of Revelation as allegories of star and constellation movements in the sky for the "end of the Age" (Pisces) and the transition into zodiacal age of Aquarius? A serious question, but I think that endeavour can be incredibly fruitful.

       I've heard many theories on revelations but none have convinced me much because it's so vague and broad it's almost impossible to give anything but a guess as to the meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate hearing your reading catalog but I don't see the point. You can research every theory until you the end of time but at the end of the day you have to make decisions on what you believe in at some point.

       The potentially for some unpleasant truth is that none of this is really real.
It's a holographic illusion occurring in one now.
All is vibration/energy.
Time is a measurer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This holographic field does nothing but move around, which gives the illusion of space and time. Spooky action at a distance demonstrates how time and space do not actually exist.

      <p>
       The ego/eye is an eternal aspect of awareness/consciousness - It vibrates, giving off a glow, to create a contrast to an awareness of nothing. At some point the vibration changed, and stole the attention of part of awareness, so that the ego could be as a god, create a world, and seemingly control all.

       I see this guy, in his garage apartment off his mom's house. He uses this schtick along with a heavily stickered guitar to get laid. Sometimes he gets rebuffed with a scornful "get a JOB!" When his incantations fail he may have to try to get a job because if mom cuts him off he won't be able to pull this shit pushing a shopping cart. The tattoos and piercings are going to make employment a hard prospect. Later sitting in an ill lit flophouse he gets a bellyache reports to emergency where an attendant says "...no main the pain is from universal consciousness" while our little philosopher pukes out Kibbles and Bits.

       Pain is just another sensation, some enjoy what others don't, some dislike what others enjoy. All are different - and no matter the amount of tattoos, jobs or fantasies about how others are and live, all there is is now, and thoughts and emotions as well as light appear over space and time, of which there is none. All is an illusion, and if you are focused on inner chatter, you potentially miss what is going on around you, and as you listen to what isn't, you are guided around by it.

       I never claimed to seeing auras or anything more than anybody else.
You are the one claiming things based on nothing. I offer to aid you in understanding this, if you have an honest interest. If this is too much for you, or you are biased against it, there is little I can do for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for insight, observing thought patterns and emotions made me realise the source of, or inanity of, the various - which eventually led me to full personal insight, along with inner peace - as in no fear, no hate, no judgement, etc. Only addressing each moment as I prefer in that moment.

       Not bad, though much of this is not new. The basic tenets presented on the nature of reality are the foundations of buddhism and taoism  and surprisingly (for some) quantum physics.

       It's only when people start to nitpick that branches split off into different belief systems. Although my own fascination period with Kaballah came and went over a decade ago there is a movie called "Pi: Faith in Chaos" about this subject that was very well done, and I think you would enjoy it if this is your interest right now.

       Thanks for your comment, and yes, one of the big tools of confusion, and a crippling aspects of widening our horizons, is that of personal (nitpicking) opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, this knowledge have been hinted at in various forms pretty much always. For example U.G. krishnamurti and Alan Watts have said similar things.

        https://illuminatimatrix.wordpress.com

       , the blog I read, is truly unique, and the numeric connections presented with my images are unique.
      </p>
      <p>
       What this is really all about, it that there are no rules, there is no good or bad, there is an illusory individual that was orchestrated not by the will of consciousness, but by the ego, the eye, the energy, which does not exist, and by observing this supposed inner being, as with by observing an enemy or any other aspect of this, you get to know it very well, and slowly the power of being is returned to that place of inner silence and outer awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum mechanics and the parts of science that deal with the nature of reality, explain the same, that none of this is, and that time and space are non existent. Also science has no real idea about what consciousness really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an analogous explanation of the concept copied from my blog -
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <em>
        All we perceive is created by our subconscious beliefs; that attracts, or intermingles and projects, the elements for the next moment – based on those core beleifs in unison with the various triggering by various elements in here. Observing eventually makes all incidental and of no importance.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If you are an atheist, electrical universe believer, simulations theory advocate, science or agnostic persona, then you can compare this concept to your cosciousness locked in a computer simulation, where an ai is the god that feeds you everything you need to be fed in order for you to experience exactly what the ai wants you to experience. So even your very thoughts and sense of self, as all would be controlled/instilled.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        If you are religious in the overall understanding of the word, or spiritual, then you can compare what percieves, aka consciousness/awareness, to god, and all we percieve as satan, no matter if it is pretty, ugly, enjoyable, painful, tasty or horrific.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        There is no good, bad or evil, ultimately there is the intent of something extremely beautiful that was tricked into creating a prison for itself, as it never experiened the concept of light or manipulation before. Only so that the ego could be as a god."
