       It's already been shown, months ago, that the DNC computers (and various voting machines) had been accessed by other domestic computers. There's no evidence included in the indictment other than what Meuller says they found, and there's nothing showing that they "hacked" or "manipulated" our elections in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone here think that "The Russians" would even be capable of this without the NSA/CIA knowing at the time? They have more covert cyber capability than our own agencies?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also been shown that our own three-letter agencies and those of another shitty little Mid-East country can easily mimic an originating hack or email or whatever as being from another country, as if that would even be necessary in this "because we say so" indictment. A nice bonus is that now the Russians can be blamed for Seth Rich. Yeah, they really wanted him gone, with all his efforts on voting accessibility, LO fuckin L.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that comes out of the MSM that makes Russia an enemy can be called into question, because Putin/Russia have never come out to call the U.S. an "enemy" – other than to mention how fucked-up our foreign policy is. It's that simple.The fact that Wolf Blitzer got John Podesta on the phone to comment is fucking in-your-face absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also nice cover for Imran Awan, DWS, the Clintons and everyone else who have guilt written all over them and have been screaming "RUSSIA" for months.

       "...sold Amerca to the Russians...." who in their right mind would think the Russians would even want anything to do with our fucked-up shit? China owns a large part of the Western U.S., so why aren't they in the news?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think an "administration" is to blame, you need to know that the U.S. was sold to the people who control our money supply in 1917.

       What Russian has ever said that? Russia has effectively isolated itself from the West's central banking system. They have nothing to gain by the demise of the U.S. "economy," if that's what it is.

       I'll ask again: What Russian ever said they want to destroy America and/or its economy? Is that just something the talking heads on cable news networks say that they said? Honest question because I don't watch them unless someone posts a clip on this sub.

       Because open trade and mutually beneficial foreign policies would be in their best interests. The only reason they might want the U.S. to fail is that we keep putting missile launchers close to their borders and meddling in the Ukraine and various "-stans" to isolate them.

       They sold the very basis of American identity: security, friendship and allies.  Russia has successfully put an agent of Russia at the top of the American food chain who has in 18 months- destroyed the idea of America as a friend to many nations. As a force for good and as an Allie to countries that it has been an ally to for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The breaking up of nato, the un humans rights and security councils are all things that Russia has wanted for years and America is giving it to them.

       North Korea has been elevated onto the world stage for what? The withdrawal of American troops and more nuclear bombs.

       No, you know what Russia did? They got the democrats to sell off American friendship and identity with itself. They handed Russia what they wanted on a gilded platter. American culture is in a soft civil war as the democrat media machine spends day in day out justifying their historic loss to Donald J. Trump. Russia is more than happy to be their scapegoat. How fucking sad.

       America is the #1 imperial power and is quite hated almost everywhere. You know, because of all of the regime change operations and millions of people dying and losing their homes because of us. No biggie though let's just blame Russia.

       Putin's (valid) point was that the Deep State will march on regardless. Let's assume that big meanie Drumpf is a Russian Manchurian Candidate. So far, he has done nothing but push the policies of his Neo-Con, Zionist, and Military Industrial Complex-infested administration.... just like the ones before him. Wow!

       Before you inevitably say something about "muh sanctions," they are extremely unpopular in Europe because it would make them rely on the much more expensive American gas.

       It's actually anti american to be getting full on behind simple allegations.  If simply being accused of something equates guilt in your mind, you're not very american.  That's more of a nazi type ideal.

       ... so am I a goldfish destroying this country? And why? Because I believe we should investigate the abundantly obvious collusion between our current president and Russia? Or because I believe people should be able to lead lives of their own choosing? Look, I'm not used to Reddit fights and don't really want to engage on this level, but I'm genuinely concerned for our country. I don't think it's a matter of left or right, though I absolutely think the right has enabled the current clusterfuck. We should all be concerned.

       For this to be a conspiracy sub it just blows my mind that there are so many damn people in here that trust the MSM lmao. Like they are totally in agreement that the MSM hides other conspiracies but when it comes to this administration they think they are spreading truth?

       Not just trust, but go out of their way to support their narratives.  Some accounts right here in this very thread do that exclusively.  They could not be more obvious if they tried.

       Lmao true, and the downvotes are hilarious, I use to actually like this sub, now I just visit to see how dumb people really are. “911 was an inside job and the media is corrupt!” Now it’s “Russia colluded and the media is on our side!” But when the actual truth does come out it’ll be the same idiots claiming they knew it all along lmao.

       ...and the brainwhashing is so vigorously upvoted here. My post was a late-night shower thought with tired resignation and too over it to research anything. I didn't expect it to be at the top of "Controversial" all day, but the comments and voting patterns let me know that I drew some attention and hit some nerves. But yes, sad at the perspective of some of the honest commenters here.

       Excellent.

      <p>
       I think, however, that there were those within the U.S. who met the same criteria who could have "influenced" or "hacked" our elections with much more means/motive/opportunitiy than Russia.

       Alex Jones had to take down a video where he talked about agents within the FBI preventing the DNC from hacking the voting machines for the general election as was done for the primary to ensure her win over Bernie.

       The claim was actually DHS Cybersecurity. The alleged hacking consisted of injecting custom code to change vote-weighting parameters in favor of Clinton (yes, Diebold machines really have vote-weighting parameters. Why?!?). Even better, these intrusions were masked as Russian-based cyber attacks in case they got caught. Now we see Plan B is well underway.

       There's other sources who have outlined how the DNC was hurting for money and hillary essentially bought them out in exchange for full control.  Bernie never stood a chance.

       If you remember there was even a lawsuit because of the fact that bernie supporters were duped into giving money to hillary/dnc that would never aid bernie.

       Some legit shadiness?  More like the Democratic party doesn't believe in a democratic process.  That's not shadiness, because as they successfully argued in court, they are perfectly free to rig their primary if they so desire.  As a private organization that's true, but it was news to much of the Democratic constituency, news which will never be forgotten.

       The fine point of this whole thing is Democrats (DNC) proved they don't believe in democracy.  That's a fact.  They argued this position in court loud and proud.  From a branding perspective this is a huge black eye.  As such they've had to employ an army of shills to go out on the internet, in forums just like this one, and pretend to be disinterested third parties.

       That's not a point because Russians didn't hack the DNC.  Seth Rich was the

       , and he was killed for it.  If you're here to peddle that deep state garbage that Russian intelligence decided they wanted to work with Trump rather than Clinton, especially after Hilldawg was so accommodating on that Uranium One deal, I'm not in the market for it.

       You mean that deep state authored, ridiculous conspiracy theory?  Yeah like I said I don't buy it.  Hilldawg played nice with the 
Russians on Uranium One.  As such it seems logical they would have been happy to have her in the White House.  They already had a documented quid pro quo relationship.

       No, I am suggesting the entire Russia hacked the DNC is a deep state conspiracy theory.  Presidential candidates/teams colluding with foreign powers?  That stopped getting my attention after Bill Clinton colluded with the Chinese, then ceded positive control of the Panama Canal to China.

       Okay, so you think that Trump and Russia were colluding but that's not a big deal and the DNC hack and subsequent propoganda campaign wasn't part of their arrangement? In that case what did Russia do for the Trump campaign?

       Pretty sure I am on record as saying what the DNC did was legal.  That does nothing to diminish the significance of the disclosure, nor did it do anything to assuage the anger Bernie Sanders supporters felt when they found out.

       Nothing was hacked.  The DNC refusal to turn their servers over to the FBI pretty much seals that one.  Seth Rich worked for the DNC and provided the info to Wikileaks, probably because Rich was a Bernie Sanders supporter.

       Interesting you should mention this standard. Literally the only Trump directed change to the RNC platform was a softening of the stance on US assistance to Ukraine. You're aware of Crimea's strategic importance re:  Russia and NATO as one of Russia's few potential warm water ports. Manafort is of course in serious legal trouble over his decade of work on behalf of pro-Russian elements in Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I ask again, what do you think happened between Russia and Trump?

       Noting even remotely compared to the strategics loss of the Panama Canal.  Do you even realize if China wanted they could block us from using it?  Did you know it would then take us 21 days to get our east coast ships to the west coast?  Am I supposed to liken that to reducing the amount of proxy conflicts we get into?

       Such a dishonest response that it's not worth continuing. You refuse to directly answer a simple question and choose only to deflect instead. On the extremely off chance that you're actually operating in good faith and are simply ignorant rather than dishonest, here's a good primer on the strategic importance of Crimea:

        After the chants started at the President-elect's post-election "thank you" rally in Michigan, he responded, "That plays great before the election -- now we don't care, right?"

       You think that Trump would announce to the world his plans to arrest Hillary? You think that those Mueller indictments don't have her name on them anywhere? And her pals Podesta and Alefantis? I don't know what else to say to you if you can't see that you're being played.

       Key word accusing.  All this russia bullshit is just ridiculous though.  Millions of people actually believe trump is a russian agent, they're that low iq.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the alleged hackers will ever see a day in court to defend themselves.  Mueller could come out tomorrow and tell everybody that he has found absolutely nothing to in any way incriminate trump in ANY crime and it would not matter.

       Why didn't Russia want Hillary to win?  She played ball with them on Uranium One.  There was a quid pro quo and Hilldawg upheld her end of the bargain for zee Russians, so why wouldn't they want her?  She proved to be a battle tested ally.

       I don't think they cared either way.  They knew she would play ball with them because she had a history of playing ball with them.  Besides, the deep state conspiracy theory forces me to believe Russia suddenly grew alarmed at the the prospect of a Hilldawg victory, went on a blind fishing expedition with their top Intel Officer hackers, and just happened to unearth documented proof of the DNC's disdain for the democratic process.

       You really should dig into the facts of Uranium One. They operate primarily in Canada, Kazakhstan, and other countries. A small portion of their business is in the US.  Also, Russia has been producing shit-tons of nuclear weapons since the 1950s, never needing this one specific company to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment implies that Russia is without nuclear capability if they could not acquire Uranium One, which is false. It implies Uranium One was significantly tied to uranium sourced from the US, which is false.  It implies that Hillary Clinton personally "handed over" control of Uranium One to Russia, which is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the FBI and
       <em>
        Republican-lead
       </em>
       congressional investigations have found no fault in Hillary Clinton for anything tied to Uranium One.  I will tell you why: the whole thing was a
       <em>
        narrative
       </em>
       . The truth or falsity of the allegations wasn't the point. The point was to push a narrative of scandal, to harm Clinton politically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Uranium One was inconsequential to Russia's interest in backing a 2016 candidate. They had something much more important: a candidate who would praise and never criticize Putin, who would accept Russia's annexation of Crimea, who would disrupt the NATO alliance, and who would work back channels for possibly darker things, the details of which are not yet fully known.

       Right, so not only does the Deep State conspiracy consist of numerous career professionals across many agencies of government, it
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       includes the Democrats (obviously),
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       it includes the Republicans as well. And, for some reason, they all wanted Russia to have more uranium to turn into nuclear weapons, because reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Uranium One was only involved at a small scale in the US. It's primary operations are located elsewhere, and all relevant officials of the other countries also approved the sale. I suppose that means the Deep State extends to the governments of Canada and South Africa as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       Weren't you the one who originally cited Occam's Razor?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the simpler explanation: the Uranium One "controversy" originated from hyper-partisan site Brietbart as a hit piece against Hillary Clinton and spread from there around the right-wing mediasphere. Boom, solved.

       Maybe because this is just lies and a a bunch of BS. Mueller knows that he will never have to prove a single one of these allegations in court because those accused will never be brought to trial. He can literally say and allege anything he wants and never has to actually prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time he indicted Russian companies, one of them actually did respond and Mueller shit a brick. He has delayed that trial repeatedly claiming that he isn't ready to go to trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was so sure about his indictment, then why wasn't he ready to try it when the accused showed up for court?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any person that sees this blatant BS should be upset. The question really is: why are democrats so gullible? Why do supposed Conspiracy Theorists so quick to defend the FBI, etc?

       Because they are fruitless indictments that will never see a court room, and the fact that they were announced right before the meeting between Trump and Putin is pretty transparent.  The subsequent calls to cancel the summit from the left are just confirmation of that fact.

       Well, I'm only privy to public knowledge, can't really speak to the efficacy of the investigation as a whole. But it strikes be as silly to criticize a country for attempting to investigate and hopefully prevent foreign nations from influencing elections. In fact that seems like a much better use of taxpayer money than, say, sending the president on constant golfing trips

       You can educate everyone about spearphising until you're blue in the face, but it only takes one old fart somewhere who still doesn't fully understand the internet to click a link in one email that looks like it's from Google and your system is compromised. Have you ever worked in IT security? It's inherently a game where you're at least one turn behind your attackers. You can't see the future, and therefore you can only protect against known past attack vectors, and make some creative guesses about possible future ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Writing software that is going to run on target computers (security or not)? Better hope that your software employees are all loyal, and don't sell exploits on the black market for hundreds of thousands of dollars (they do - look up Zero Day Exploits). Using third-party software? Better hope that none of their employees have sold exploits (they have).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you pay any attention to security news, new bugs are found and published on a nearly daily basis. Frequently white hat hackers find them and alert the companies, only to be ignored, and then publicise them ninety days later to pressure the companies into fixing them. And those are just the tip of the iceberg. Honestly that news feed is almost as much of an anxiety recipe as conspiracy news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Security is only as strong as it's weakest link, and the larger (and let's be real, older) the population of your organization is, the more exponentially weaker it is. Then factor into an election where "hacking" could mean any number of things and many organizations are targets, with multiple superpower state actors prodding your defenses nonstop and you have a recipe for disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, right now, thousands of bots/scripts randomly scan the internet checking for servers that have unpatched software from a list of
       <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov">
        publicly known vulnerabilities
       </a>
       . My company doesn't even work in security and we get multiple bots prodding us daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is one misconfigured file, one out of date dependcy, one marginally incompetent CTO. Equifax was hacked because of one single server in Argentina that still had the default admin password.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could also sweep ip addresses in the area of a desired target. I genuinely believe it is by the grace of God that wannacry has been the worst global cyber attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that Obama could somehow create an iron lockdown of security is ridiculous.

         Guccifer 2.0 is obvious bullshit. Oops, they just accidentally saved the files with a Cyrillic keyboard and forgot to mask their IP. How fortunate that the Russian agents knew nothing about OpSec!

       Bottom line: the DNC leaks were obtained by an internal source and Guccifer 2.0 was part of a larger operation to deflect from the damning content. Yeah the Russians probably sniffed around, but so did the Chinese and Mossad and MI6.

       You know you're in an intellectually sound position when you dismiss all dissidence as brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You (the most supreme top mind of our time) have discerned the penultimate political position, and from atop your throne (neck bent under  the weight of your massive brain) you identify every other American as part of the "hive mind" (as disagreeing with you is the surest sign of being incapable of independent thought).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course you can't entertain a discussion with such inferior beings, all that is necessary is an ad hominem and assumptions about what sources they get their news from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Verily, it is you, and only you, who could possibly exercise critical thinking skills, and this completely insular way of thinking about all political matters could
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       be the result of someone manipulating you.

       There are a lot of reasons why the left lost, a few of which were more determining factors than Russian interference, for example, probably the biggest factor is the Democratic Party's betrayal of their values and their base for over two decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, Russian interference was a factor, and it was criminal.

       The problem with this "scandal" is that there's no way to determine the magnitude of effect Russian meddling may have had on the election.  And whatever the meddling is or was is pretty amorphous and hard to nail down.  You can't re-run the campaign as a simulation to decide whether, minus Russian meddling, did the outcome change?

       Which means we're mostly stuck with an endless debate hinging on a set of unknowable truths driven largely by loyalists invested in competing versions of truth.

       That's true, but we could at least, minimally, pass legislation to help make it harder for such a thing to happen again.  We aren't even doing that.  We can investigate what happened, and if any crimes were committed, hold those accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not going to somehow re-do the election.  There's zero clause in our Constitution to do that.  If the worst is true, and Trump is personally involved in crimes, he's impeached and Mike Pence becomes President.  The Presidency doesn't fall to Hillary Clinton no matter how much liberals might bitch that it should be so.
      </p>
      <p>
       And whatever the meddling is was pretty well laid out by the indictment released yesterday.  It included not only their social media campaigns, but also the illegal hack of the DNC and John Podesta, as well as hosting and providing financial assistance to rallies, and all of the crimes associated with those activities, such as identity theft of U.S. persons, bank fraud, and campaign law violations.

       These Indictments are joke just like the Russian troll indictments. It has already been proven that the DNC leaks came from someone with local machine access(Seth Rich).

       And like usual we have NO EVIDENCE, just a bunch of BS from known liars. They are throwing out these phony indictments to make Mueller look like he is doing something and to continue to Prop up the "Muh Russia" narrative.

       The biased source? One is an actual lawsuit filed by George Webb in November of 2017. That's 9 months ago. In the lawsuit, it alleges that Awan registered the domain actblues.com (one letter different than actblue.com) in order to redirect political donations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In July 2018, Meuller makes the exact same claim but says Russians did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A link to Meuller's indictment has already been provided. I provided a link to George Webb's actual lawsuit. Anyone is free to read both and compare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, TruePundit is biased. But they are also correct. They didn't falsify either of these original sources, just reported on the clear comparison between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I accepted their premise, I went and looked at the original Meuller document and the orginal GW lawsuit. Yep. What Truepundit claims is accurate and unmodified.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then, your goal was simply to attack the source and claim it doesn't show anything to discourage people from actually looking into it. No doubt that will work on at least some people, so goal accomplished, right?

       No. I am linking to actual documents that show that Meuller took the exact accusations that Webb made in November of 2017 and put them in his indictment document in July 2018 while claiming that Russia did it.

       George Webb lawsuit AGAIN, filed November of 2017

       Relevant paragraph is 44
      </p>
      <p>
       That was based off domain registrations tracing back to the Awan brothers. Since then, Microsoft has bought the domains view a lawsuit (you can check the Whois for actblues.com and see that it is now owned by Microsoft) to cover up this fact. Here is also an article about that:
       <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/microsoft-pushes-to-take-over-russian-spies-network">

      </p>
      <p>
       When George Webb filed his lawsuit in November of 2017, it was obvious who had registered actblues.com. The lawsuit had nothing to do with Russians. George Webb would have had no way of knowing that Meuller was going to make this claim in July of 2018.

       The Russian bogeyman is pure fantasy. Russia is no longer a threat to the USA economically or militarily.  The world has changed. Alphabet agencies and big corporations don't like this because they need a bogeyman to justify the continuation of the hugely expensive $ trillion sized black hole budget.

       This post shows a pretty basic misunderstanding of what it means to "hack" something, or more specifically, what it means to accuse a foreign national of hacking something in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd recommend reading
       <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/a-leak-or-a-hack-a-forum-on-the-vips-memo/">
        this article from The Nation
       </a>
       about the idea that "it has already been shown" that the DNC computers were accessed "domestically." It isn't written by a reporter, it is direct writing from three groups of people: a group of former intelligence workers that supports that conclusion, a group of former intelligence workers that disputes that conclusion, and a third party security researcher attempting to parse and confirm the claims from both sides. It is a very well done article and I recommend you read it and come to your own conclusions on who to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also note that, if you read the actual indictment of the hackers, it is stated that the Russians transferred the stolen materials from the DNC and DCCC to a server hosted in Illinois (which they purchased with anonymous, fake accounts paid for via Bitcoin).

       Indictment is a smokescreen so people like us stop looking for the real answers. It was already proven earlier than the download speeds of the stolen files could not have been remote and had to be internal. This site has been overrun by shills. Question their narrative and you're labeled a "Trumpist" now, as if I can't hate Trump too. We need a new site.

       My problem with all of this is that there's no more value indicting a group of Russians than indicting a random selection of names from a 1937 phonebook.  None of them will ever see a day in any court, there will be no trial and no jury verdict.
      </p>
      <p>
       At best these names will end up on some shitlist the State Department maintains, preventing them from vacationing in Miami or visiting Disneyworld, but that's about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary loyalists will use these indictments to further their own biases and whatever you call the opposite side will use their irrelevance for furthering their own biases.

       I'm still waiting for a single verified voter to identify a blog, website or social-media app that caused them to change their mind and vote for Trump,
       <em>
        when they formerly planned to vote for someone else

       I mean MAYBE... maybe this is true, I find it absolutely unlikely for two reasons. Reason number one is the timing, these people will throw their own kid under the bus if it made Trump somehow look bad. Secondly, isn’t this again about the DNC and Hillary’s unsecured email server? So she’s not reliable for using an unsecured server, because that’s irrelevant and she just made a silly mistake and didn’t know any better, yeah okay, but hacking her unsecured server is not okay, but her having it is? There’s a reason there is encrypted emails for people in her position... that’s like a Hockey or Football player deciding he doesn’t need to wear a cup protecting his testicles, and then the opposite team injured his testies, and it’s totally not the fault of the player for not wearing mandatory regulation protective equipment; it’s the fault of the other player for playing their advantage? Ridiculous. Yea 12 Russian agents put Trump in the White House, it certainly wasn’t the Arenas full of people he was drawing in every state.

        The problem with this "scandal" is that there's no way to determine the magnitude of effect Russian meddling may have had on the election. And whatever the meddling is or was is pretty amorphous and hard to nail down. You can't re-run the campaign as a simulation to decide whether, minus Russian meddling, did the outcome change?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's true, but we could at least, minimally, pass legislation to help make it harder for such a thing to happen again.  We aren't even doing that.  We can investigate what happened, and if any crimes were committed, hold those accountable.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not going to somehow re-do the election.  There's zero clause in our Constitution to do that.  If the worst is true, and Trump is personally involved in crimes, he's impeached and Mike Pence becomes President.  The Presidency doesn't fall to Hillary Clinton no matter how much liberals might bitch that it should be so.
      </p>
      <p>
       And whatever the meddling is was pretty well laid out by the indictment released yesterday.  It included not only their social media campaigns, but also the illegal hack of the DNC and John Podesta, as well as hosting and providing financial assistance to rallies, and all of the crimes associated with those activities, such as identity theft of U.S. persons, bank fraud, and campaign law violations.

       Your conditional statement is predicated upon the notion Russia suddenly felt the need to sabotage Team Hilldawg, in spite of her documented willingness to play ball with Russia (Uranium One).  That's the far fetched part.
