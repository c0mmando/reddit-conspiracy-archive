       He proposes also you will read, that gravity will return everything back to the center, he also takes the cause of the Big Bang to be a "divine force".
       <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32037/32037-h/32037-h.htm">
        Here is a link to the entire text
       </a>
       , but I've pulled in the key part below:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Let me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable that matter could have been diffused through space, so as to fulfil the conditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        For convenience of illustration, let us imagine, in the first place, a hollow sphere of glass, or of anything else, occupying the space throughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused, by means of irradiation, from the absolute, irrelative, unconditional particle, placed in the centre of the sphere.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, a certain exertion of the diffusive power (presumed to be the Divine Volition)—in other words, a certain force—whose measure is the quantity of matter—that[55] is to say, the number of atoms—emitted; emits, by irradiation, this certain number of atoms; forcing them in all directions outwardly from the centre—their proximity to each other diminishing as they proceed—until, finally, they are distributed, loosely, over the interior surface of the sphere.
       </p>
       <p>
        When these atoms have attained this position, or while proceeding to attain it, a second and inferior exercise of the same force—or a second and inferior force of the same character—emits, in the same manner—that is to say, by irradiation as before—a second stratum of atoms which proceeds to deposit itself upon the first; the number of atoms, in this case as in the former, being of course the measure of the force which emitted them; in other words the force being precisely adapted to the purpose it effects—the force and the number of atoms sent out by the force, being directly proportional.
       </p>
       <p>
        When this second stratum has reached its destined position—or while approaching it—a third still inferior exertion of the force, or a third inferior force of a similar character—the number of atoms emitted being in all cases the measure of the force—proceeds to deposit a third stratum upon the second:—and so on, until these concentric strata, growing gradually less and less, come down at length to the central point; and the diffusive matter, simultaneously with the diffusive force, is exhausted.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have now the sphere filled, through means of irradiation, with atoms equably diffused. The two necessary conditions—those of irradiation and of equable diffusion—are satisfied; and by the sole process in which the possibility[56] of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable. For this reason, I confidently expect to find, lurking in the present condition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere, the secret of which I am in search—the all-important principle of the modus operandi of the Newtonian law. Let us examine, then, the actual condition of the atoms.
       </p>
       <p>
        They lie in a series of concentric strata. They are equably diffused throughout the sphere. They have been irradiated into these states.
       </p>
       <p>
        The atoms being equably distributed, the greater the superficial extent of any of these concentric strata, or spheres, the more atoms will lie upon it. In other words, the number of atoms lying upon the surface of any one of the concentric spheres, is directly proportional with the extent of that surface.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, in any series of concentric spheres, the surfaces are directly proportional with the squares of the distances from the centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Therefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratum’s distance from the centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which emitted that stratum—that is to say, is directly proportional with the force.
       </p>
       <p>
        Therefore the force which irradiated any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that stratum’s distance from the centre:—or, generally, the force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the squares of the distances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, Rëaction, as far as we know anything of it, is Action conversed. The general principle of Gravity being, in the first place, understood as the rëaction of an act—as the expression of a desire on the part of Matter, while existing in a state of diffusion, to return into the Unity whence it was diffused; and, in the second place, the mind being called upon to determine the character of the desire—the manner in which it would, naturally, be manifested; in other words, being called upon to conceive a probable law, or modus operandi, for the return; could not well help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be precisely the converse of the law of departure. That such would be the case, any one, at least, would be abundantly justified in taking for granted, until such time as some person should suggest something like a plausible reason why it should not be the case—until such period as a law of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as preferable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Matter, then, irradiated into space with a force varying as the squares of the distances, might, à priori, be supposed to return towards its centre of irradiation with a force varying inversely as the squares of the distances: and I have already shown[3] that any principle which will explain why the atoms should tend, according to any law, to the general centre, must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining, at the same time, why, according to the same law, they should tend each to each. For, in fact, the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such, but because of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends [58]most directly to its real and essential centre, Unity—the absolute and final Union of all.

       SS: I don't know if this necessarily conspiracy, but it goes to show that some ideas that might seem bizzarre (as this essay was received at the time) and contrary to all understanding, may just be so ahead of their time that the are beyond their moment. I find that really cool, and pretty amazing that Poe clearly nailed it.

       I personally love posts like these. Totally apolitical, on a subject we're all (hopefully 🤞) familiar with, and incorporates one of the eeriest people from history. I have no ability to comment as to the validity of the claims, but nonetheless thoroughly enjoyed the read.

       He seems to be describing a looping system. If you give all the of the black holes in the universe an infinite amount of time they will swallow all matter and eventually converge into one black hole. When black holes have nothing to consume they implode which releases everything they have swallowed evenly distributed. It also births several new black holes which start the process of convergence over again.

       This is very cool but it's also wrong. He imagines a sphere and the universe expands from a single point in the center. But that's not correct according to the big bang theory. There is no "center" of the universe. The expansion occured and is occurring at all points in space.

       The universe doesn't exist. Matter doesn't magically appear from no where, thus we don't exist. If we want food, we get ingredients and put it all together to make a meal. If there are no ingredients there is no meal. We either don't exist or a supernatural unimaginable force acted upon a material or created it for it to even exist. No living thing is alive that hasn't been reproduced, go back as far as your mind can handle and maybe you'll realize that either matter was never initially created intentionally by a force so we don't exist, or that matter has always existed, wasn't ever created, and we don't exist. And by matter I'm talking about any material that would have a potential to even eventually evolve and form any sort of life, planets, space, time, and turtles.

       Which is fine but how do you explain the very observable phenomena of expansion? Its called the big bang and you can believe whatever you want that kick started it.

       Just like many other cults you paid money to be indoctrinated and "gain levels" in the cult.  I know that leavening a cult is a very difficult thing to do.  You worry what others in your cult will think of you.  Many of us have escaped the cult of scientism though so there is hope for you yet.

       If you understood it, then surely you must realize that quantized photons can't possibly produce Doppler Redshift based on recessional motion of an emitting body. The best analogy for Spectroscopic Redshift is the difference in the spectrum between a neutral atom and a charged ion. Recessional motion has nothing to do with it. When you take a spectrum, you are taking a 'picture' not a 'movie"

       Because red shifted photons can be measured individually and the Doppler effect is measured as a series of wavefronts over a change in time from t-initial to t-final.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an invalid analogy that only someone completely ignorant of light's "digital" nature could ever fall for. Light is emitted in a digital fashion at the vibrational frequency of the emitter. Each photon packet is quantized with its own unique spectral signature. Red shift is not measured as a function of delta-time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attempted analogy with the Doppler effect fails even the most basic dimensional analysis.

       The universe is not expanding. In the 1800s and early 1900s there were two explanations for the Spectroscopic Red Shift of Atomic Spectra. When Lemaitre proposed an analogy to the Doppler Effect he was rightfully laughed at. Big Bang Creationism is built upon a false axiom. Quasars like TON 202 are stars in our own Galaxy and are certainly not billions of light years away dashing around at 1100c. Spectroscopic Redshift can be proven in laboratory experiments to be a consequence of high density electron plasma.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no evidence of expansion, there is no evidence of Big Bang Creationism. The real science supports the Electrostatic Plasma Universe model without challenge or contest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doppler Redshift Theory is a garbage axiom upon which Big Bang Creationism is constructed and is easily debunked.

       Big Bang Creationism is easy to debunk. All evidence, meticulously gathered, shows that we live in an electrostatic plasma universe and most likely infinite and eternal.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no evidence for expansion. The analogy of Spectrographic Red Shift with Doppler Expansion is 100% fake science conjured up by a manipulative Catholic priest with no basis in experiment or reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creationism has always been the commonly accepted view, it has never had evidence to support it and neither does the current faith of Big Bang Creationism.

       Just because we don't have the instruments to see beyond a certain point back in time doesn't mean that time did not exist.
