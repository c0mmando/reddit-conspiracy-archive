<p>This thread is no different than FP garbage, and full of nothing but pro-big government socialists who have zero concept of economics and know nothing about what it takes to start/run/own your own business.</p>

<p>I expect this shit in r/politics or <a href="/r/LateStageCapitalism">/r/LateStageCapitalism</a>... not here. I guess all the anti-Trump conspiracies have brought in all the socialists from the rest of reddit? It&#39;s absolutely hilarious hearing people argue for UBI, but somehow HATE the current government.</p>

<p>Not to mention, the ONLY regular users here that I recognize are only found when you sort the comments by Controversial. Something typically reserved for default subs.</p>

<p>Fact is, all of the things people bitch about over in <a href="/r/LateStageCapitalism">/r/LateStageCapitalism</a> are literally direct results of government regulation and intervention in the free market. It&#39;s absolutely maddening to watch. But then if you recommend ACTUAL solutions that could work to fix the problems, they just cry and scream about &quot;conservative capitalists just trying to increase their profits through less regulation!!!!&quot; or &quot;the free market is what caused this in the first place!!!&quot;. Pretty much any solution besides more big government is shouted down.</p>

<p>Absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<p>Bingo. Socialist are the result of talking point, virtue signaling, and hearing one side of a story or debate. The truth isn&#39;t pushed. Socialism is pushed from a one-sided perspective. It&#39;s one the reasons republicans get shunned unfairly on social media. Another attempt to hide the truth.</p>

<p>The truth is not somewhere in the middle. The truth is socialism is and always will be an epic failure. They push this &quot;republicans are against progress&quot; narrative. This too is complete bullshit. We&#39;re against progressing <strong>backwards</strong> to a failed system that is and always will be destined to fail. </p>

<p>Hell, just look at modern day socialist countries, such as Scandinavian countries. Highest cost of living in the world! B-but they have such a high min wage, and all this free stuff. A pair of levis is $120, a gallon of gas is $7, a value meal at McD is $12. Rent is off the fucking charts. All that money and they can&#39;t afford anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be that people thought it was refreshing to have a post made to discuss instead of 100% stating something is a fact. But the post can really get you thinking on our current system of slavery. You get so much flak if you try to live frugally off the land instead of going and &#39;earning your living&#39; at a job. Homelessness and starting self-sufficient communities is illegal. So I don&#39;t really understand how a post that questions if our society is being forced on us and asking for discussion on it is cancerous. Its way less cancerous than &quot;Omg this foot in this guys mouth is 100% a childs foot&quot; or &quot;Trump is god saving our country&quot; </p>

<p>There are plenty of posts that do that here all the time. That&#39;s the second time I&#39;ve heard this narrative being pushed, and it&#39;s just simply not true. But that&#39;s not surprising coming from someone that <a href="https://snoopsnoo.com/u/AngelicMayhem">NEVER posts here.</a></p>

<p>The rest of your comment is completely unrelated to that post, and equally inaccurate as the first line. Thank you for further proving that the post in question is attracting people that DON&#39;T COME HERE, to spread their poorly thought out economic beliefs.</p>

<p>This is far more than just &quot;people want to live frugelly off the land&quot;. This is about STEALING people&#39;s money in order to make everyone happy, which is flat-out <strong>wrong</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never post anywhere though? I keep to comments and I read through posts on conspiracy every day. Its full of cancerous I&#39;m right you&#39;re wrong posts and comments. People don&#39;t want discussion just like you don&#39;t want discussion but just want to be validated. And I think the point of the quote is that money shouldn&#39;t have value and society evolve past that to promote further learning and consciousness for everyone. Its obviously depicting a fairy tail world as something like that will never be possible due to greed. Someone will always want to control everyone and everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That site includes comments, not just posts. Also, you&#39;re flat out wrong by completely generalizing an entire sub based on your opinion of this sub. I for one regularly make posts specifically to try and create discussion, as do many other users here.</p>

<p>I totally agree, which is why the best option for everyone is limiting government as much as humanly possible. Something that cannot be true when advocating things like UBI, like they are in that sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Literally every top comment is just a giant socialism circlejerk. Not surprising that you consider that &quot;interesting discussion&quot; and you &quot;enjoyed a lot of the points made&quot;, because they are all more or less the same opinion, only with slight variations of just HOW to go about socialism.</p>

<p>Anyone pointing out the massive flaws and immorality of socialism can be found in the negatives at the very bottom of the thread.</p>

<p>Not to mention, A. It&#39;s not a conspiracy and B. Very few things make it past 2000 votes here... the fact that a socialism post did is absolutely absurd.</p>

But trying to implement socialism before that scenario is a reality will only result in poor quality of life for the many and an incredible decrease in quality of goods and services, and inevitably mass casualties and fascism (considering it’s never ended any other way thus far, because of human nature/greed).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that a &quot;culture of Socialism&quot; must be established first. Without this the post-scarcity system will never sustain itself. What I mean by a culture of Socialism is one in which we can all agree on basic things- such as a desire to provide things like Healthcare to all citizens, or College/Trade educations. As a People we must see each other as our greater family, and realize that we must all work together to see the world change in this way.</p>

<p>Without this, once the automation comes it will be maintained within the hands of the Elite&#39;s and only further the divide between ruler and ruled. Now don&#39;t get me wrong- I understand how difficult and even divisive just my two stated goals above are to many people. But I believe in fighting peacefully, within the framework of the Republican Commonwealth we call the United States, to persuade the People that this is the proper course of action. And I expect, respect, and hope for, opposition in doing so. So that these policies might be better forged and the People given a True choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, I’m 100% in favor of helping my neighbors that are less fortunate than me with their healthcare costs or schooling, but through charity, not government taking my money and distributing it how THEY deem fit. I could not possibly be more against that idea. </p>

<p>Also, I don’t believe that education and healthcare are a right. A right is to have <em>access</em> to something, not demanding free goods and services. For example, I’m a strong supporter of our Second Amendment <em>right</em> to bear arms... that does mean I think Remington or Glock should be required to provide everyone with a free firearm. I support the right for anyone to <em>access</em> firearms. Financial shortcomings are not an unconstitutional barrier to that access, even though some people believe that to be the case.</p>

<p>Should we have programs to assist those of us in need that exhibit the desire and drive to have those things? Absolutely. Should we deem it a “right” and provide it to everyone no questions asked? Absolutely not. Imagine how strained the systems would be here, or how abused they’d be if free to all? All the good doctors would leave/people would stop putting in the massive amount of work to become a doctor, no one would spend the millions of dollars to innovate and create new treatments or drugs, etc.. The list of problems goes on and on, most of which can only be mitigated by a post-scarcity society.</p>

<p>All this not even taking into account the shitty state our healthcare system is in. That needs to be fixed first, mainly by getting government the hell out of the free market.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>See, we have to work simultaneously to change the government to one that represents our own interests while maintaining the capability to defend and enforce our interests via arms. We have to believe in a better government of the People, and then <em>fight</em> for it. No simple task.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t believe that education and healthcare are a right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I think that with enough work and effort, we can change this in anticipation of the post scarcity situation where this should indeed be a Right, due to the overabundance of resources and goods to make it possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine how strained the systems would be here, or how abused they’d be if free to all? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ties into imagining a different future, one radically different from the world we currently inhabit. It&#39;s about preparing for the Realities that that new world will bring with it- and seeing a different way of doing things and taking care of each other.</p>

<p>I know we are pretty opposite on these things here, but I still think that through these opposites we can forge a better future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I disagree with there is your statement about changing the definition of a right in <em>anticipation</em> of a post-scarcity society. In a post-scarcity society, I’d be 100% in support of providing those things to everyone. I’m not even sure anyone would! The only reason I don’t currently believe they are rights is because resources are indeed scarce, and valuable. And the most effective system to efficiently manage those scarce resources without violence is a free market economy. </p>

<p>The danger is anticipating that day when we no longer have scarcity WAY too early, and creating an overbearing government that is in charge for taking care of its people. The moral hazard there is far too significant for me to ever put my trust in any government to take care of me, whether it be education, health services, or even my safety from others (aka no guns, since those would be the first to go).</p>

<p>And yes, I agree. Somewhere in the middle of our two perspectives is the answer. The only way we’ll ever find it is through conversations like this! (Which is the opposite of what i saw happening in that other post, hence the reason for me making this one)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with your reasoning, which is precisely why I’m such a fan of as small a government as humanly possible. If you don’t give the government power to determine massive contracts, or enact regulations on private corporations, or any other type of power on a grand scale, then it takes away the power for corruption to be so effective because bribing politicians would be less effective, right?</p>

<p>My view is to try and limit the human element as much as we can. It’s commonly known that the smaller the level of government, the more effective/efficient it is (local, district, city, state, then federal). I’d be ok with the federal government being in control of the military and that’s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And what is the source of this risked money?</p>

<p>The top 1% has made tremendous success since 1981, but the working middle class and working class once the ones in the U.S. were richest on the globe, but are now near the bottom of the modern industrial nations. 
The working and middle class has declined in wealth and political power as the wealthy gained more wealth.  </p>

<p>And you fail to note the game for the last 50  years has been to privatize the tax monies,  that didn&#39;t take any investment or risk. </p>

<p>My savings from working 80+ hours a week for years while providing my labor to thousands of consenting parties that wanted my services on weekends. Are you kidding me right now? You think everyone who started businesses were just handed money to do so? The great thing about the free market is the incredible mobility allowed in the system, despite what Democrats and socialists might have you believe. I wasn’t in the 1% for most of my life.</p>

<p>I won’t even continue this conversation until you realize how absurd that question is, and how much it demonstrates how narrow minded you are on this topic. </p>

<p>And for the record, it’s not capitalism that is shrinking the middle class, it’s the big government created oligarchy, and the increased welfare state quasi-socialist federal programs that has.</p>

<p>There are certainly some issues that need to be dealt with at the very top, but that’s the fault of free market capitalism, it’s from government corruption/intervention. And you think the answer is even MORE governmental power? Yea... great idea! <strong>/s</strong></p>

<p>One day the human population will achieve equilibrium, but because we grew populations too use in labour and those jobs are being taken by even better technology we will have a vast population that can&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Every drop of water and every ounce of wood will soon be accounted for soon. Doing work without finding employment means you are stealing wood and water for your own side project.  There just won&#39;t be the jobs to buy the food we can easily grow.</p>

<p>Dear sweet Jesus Christ. Where in any of those quotes make you think I am supporting communism. I pretty much reject all &#39;isms&#39;. Haven&#39;t seen one that works well yet. </p>

<p>&#39;Government is actually the worst failure of civilized man. There has never been a really good one, and even those that are most tolerable are arbitrary, cruel, grasping and unintelligent.&#39;  ~ H. L. Mencken</p>

<p>I guess you&#39;re not paying attention.</p>

<p>What you have is capitalism for the 99% and socialism for the 1%.</p>

<p>You have to be smart enough to see that.</p>

<p>Remember the housing bubble that messed up the economy?</p>

<p>Anyone with an IQ more than a rock saw the the rich got bailed out, while everyone else lost their homes.</p>

<p>Think about it. Why didn&#39;t the bailout go to the home owners. The home owners would have got their homes and the banks would of got their money. Instead the banks got their money and the homeowners lost their homes. Does that really make sense to you. It is obvious socialism for the rich.</p>

<p>If you are unwilling to see and admit to that, you pretty much suck Satan&#39;s peter, and I don&#39;t mean the apostle.</p>

<p>It is a government of the people by the people for the people no longer; it is a government of corporations by corporations for corporations. ~ Rutherford B. Hayes</p>

<p>Bingo. Socialist are the result of talking point, virtue signaling, and hearing one side of a story or debate. The truth isn&#39;t pushed. Socialism is pushed from a one-sided perspective. It&#39;s one the reasons republicans get shunned unfairly on social media. Another attempt to hide the truth.</p>

<p>The truth is not somewhere in the middle. The truth is socialism is and always will be an epic failure. They push this &quot;republicans are against progress&quot; narrative. This too is complete bullshit. We&#39;re against progressing <strong>backwards</strong> to a failed system that is and always will be destined to fail. </p>

<p>Hell, just look at modern day socialist countries, such as Scandinavian countries. Highest cost of living in the world! B-but they have such a high min wage, and all this free stuff. A pair of levis is $120, a gallon of gas is $7, a value meal at McD is $12. Rent is off the fucking charts. All that money and they can&#39;t afford anything.</p>
