    <div class="md"><p>No, but they train small children from a young age via school lunch and stealing time from American parents by making them have to work two jobs to equate to the style of living their parents afforded with one job.</p>

<p>Ppl come into my work every day and die from uninformed/ignorant health choices that are taught to them/ good choices that are withheld. If American schools taught kids: how to make a budget, how to eat within that budget, how to eat nutritiously within that budget, and how to actually cook said nutritious food within that budget, we’d be fine. Instead they learn chemistry/ physics that they’ll never use again. This is literally killing ppl left and right.  No one cares.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most western countries are pretty similar in regards to the product that&#39;s available on the shelves mate. Just that some will have a larger range available due to the size of the market.</p>

<p>As an unaware kid I thought it was cool that there was toys included in the USA, where as we didn&#39;t get them as such. As an adult I now see it for what it is, nothing but capitalists doing what they do best. Marketing dept know full well the very  Hell that it can be doing the groceries with children in tow can be. So the pricks market them to children with cartoon characters, toys and cross promoting popular children culture. </p>

<p>Fill the box with the cheapest shit possibles ie. Sugar and get up to 500% more profit than the retail price per kilo of a plain bag of sugar. And then poor mum has to either face a fight and grumpy kid or just understandably wilt into the kids demand just to make the hellish experience a tad less painful.</p>

<p>Plenty of healthier type of options available though. Weetbix are a bit of a staple here plus there&#39;s various other Muesli with dry fruit varieties. Im not sure if they&#39;ve expanded to overseas markets but if they have, the brand &#39;Carmen&#39;s&#39; is a healthy option definitely worth checking out.</p>

<p>Toast with spreads. Fruit and yogurt are also common healthier options.</p>

<p>Educated only from TV and movies so probably totally wrong but I  and i think most Aussies  were/are amazed at the shit Americans eat for breakfast. Piles of pancakes soaked in sugar, pop tarts and then bowls of sugar with milk topped off with more sugar! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Iran many eat bread with different stuff: (sprinkled with black seeds) feta cheese, butter, fresh herbs, homemade jams, cream, honey, peanut butter. Eggs cooked with turmeric/onions/tomato, eggs with honey, dates, herbs. Bread/cheese with grapes, cantaloupe, watermelon and different melons or with walnuts and dates or with cucumbers and tomatoes (sprinkled with salt for flavor). There&#39;s always tea, lot of tea. The bread in Iran is really good, popular ones are called sangak, barbari, lavash and taftoon. Pita is closest I can think of in comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are 4 tea cups in the pic and that&#39;s more than enough breakfast for 4 people. For example one person could spread some cheese on bread and eat it with one cut up tomato and cucumber and wash it down with some tea, this is a popular breakfast and enough for 1 person. </p>

<p>Of course that picture is for many people and the good thing about having more than 1 person for Iranian breakfast is each person takes small bite size pieces of bread with cheese/butter/cream and they can add the other stuff on top or one can eat a little bit egg and other stuff too. If there&#39;s any leftover jam/butter/cheese/honey/herbs/whatever, it&#39;s put in the fridge for next breakfasts and Iran doesn&#39;t really have an obesity problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In most Latin American countries breakfast is barely a thing. It&#39;s like grabbing something simple like black coffee and a butter pastry, or some fresh fruit. The heavier meal comes a bit later closer to lunchtime when eggs and beans and cheeses start being served, there are something like 4-5 meals in a day in Latin countries.</p>

<p>In the USA breakfast is mainly sugary or fried. Fried eggs, with fried bacon and fried sausage with a side of pancakes and syrup washed down with sugary OJ or sugary coffee. That&#39;s the heavy caloric intake needed to make it until lunchtime where you&#39;ll again be having fried sugar stuff.</p>

<p>Sugars are energy dense and basically empty of nutrients, which is why you feel like shit after eating your typical American Breakfast, and you might benefit from changing your diet to resemble something like what the rest of the world eats, but it&#39;ll cost you. And that&#39;s likely the culprit behind this conspiracy. I don&#39;t think corporations have an agenda to make us eat shit that doesn&#39;t feed our minds, I think they&#39;re just taking advantage of the fact that the average American struggles to put good food on the table, so they put less-expensive, but calorie-dense foods out for the ignorant masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When they adopted the &quot;new&quot; recommend food pyramid back in 1977 they advised something like 8-11 servings of grains per day.</p>

<p>They also advised fat made you fat so it was relegated only once or twice per week. We were told &quot;You can eat as much starch/sugar as you want &amp; not get fat !!!!&quot; See Susan Powter fad (Late 80&#39;s/Early 90&#39;s).</p>

<p>No wonder obesity took off &amp; climbed steadily for multiple decades.</p>

<p>One thing about sugar.....if you eat it for breakfast you usually can&#39;t stay awake without another hit because of the blood sugar rises &amp; crashes. Imagine multiple generations of US kids showing up to learn something in school, but the majority of them are nodding off from sugar crashes later in the morning.</p>

<p>Good way to intentionally dumb down the population quickly &amp; in a stealth fashion.</p>

<p>In France we eat bread &amp; butter/jam/honey for breakfast (&quot;tartines&quot;). The Italians prepare great food in general, only I guess they never got up early enough to devise proper breakfasts, as they love this ueber-weet discusting pastries in the morning; their gastronomical heritage starts at noon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So don&#39;t buy pre processed breakfast foods.  They&#39;re more expensive than buying &quot;raw&quot; anyway.</p>

<p>During the week, time can be tight.  I usually eat a very light breakfast.  Maybe some yogurt and granola, a bagel w/ cream cheese, or even &lt;GASP&gt; a donut or pastry.  Fruit is certainly a good choice</p>

<p>On the weekends, when you have time, get yourself some eggs, bacon, and bread.  You can now have a nice egg sandwich, or make some french toast.  Oatmeal is cheap, easy to make, and you can add fruit or cinnamon or apples or maple syrup to enhance it.</p>

<p>Nothing unhealthy about any of that, and it&#39;s less expensive than dining out or buying prepared foods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intermittent fasting is so important. Overeating in the morning dogs your bran and makes you slower, plus it starts your metabolism so you have to keep eating. 
Drink 2 glasses of room temperature water, maybe with a bit of lemon. Then have a coffee, especially a bulletproof coffee with good fats like grass fed butter or coconut oil. If I do have to eat, usually I’ll have some sort of poached eggs with an avocado and some sardines. It’s definitely not traditional for my culture, but I’ve studied this topic a lot, and have tried many different things, fasting for 16 hours leaves me with more energy, I enjoy my food more; I lose weight, detoxify my body, learn control over food (or control over my sugar addiction). One of the best documentaries I’ve seen on the topic is called The Magic Pill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the time i do not eat breakfast due to my sleep schedule. I am a music artist and sometimes wont be in bed until 4am so i usally wake up at lunch and eat a salad or something. I mostly cut out breakfast foods for  while because eggs dont agree with my stomach and start my day off worse, and i got sick of having carb based foods everymorning. </p>

<p>However, when i do have to wake up at a normal time during the week my body feels so lost eating breakfast foods and not a full meal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I mean by intermittent fasting is that you don’t eat anything excluding water and coffee, nothing with sugar, no carbs, little to no fat. I do this for 18 hours of the day, that leaves me with 6 hours in which I have either one small snack and a big meal, oftentimes I just have one big meal. This is how I found my body has the most energy etc, this doesn’t work for everyone, some people will pass out of they do this, for me it works great! In fact this is how many pro athletes eat.</p>
