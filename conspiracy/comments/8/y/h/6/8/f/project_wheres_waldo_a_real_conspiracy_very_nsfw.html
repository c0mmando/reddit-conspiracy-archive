        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>America has a absolutely gruesome past that most have sweep under the rug and it has become something you do not speak of or mention in any way.</p>

<p>Raise your hand IF you are for justice?  For equality?  For every man has the God given right to pursue what makes him happy?  &lt;-- Do you agree?</p>

<p>It seems more than anything in this year 2018 that there are so many community activist, so many people that say from ALL sides that the world needs to be better.  BUT they ignore the pink elephant in the room that dances around taunting.</p>

<p>What is this I speak of?  I&#39;m speaking of a segment of the populace that is hell bent on causing terror.  Sometimes we see this in public and on the news as their hate filled hearts just over flow and they go on a terror spree.</p>

<p>Who is it that I speak of?  Are you still with me?</p>

<p>These people in question just a few decades ago used to hunt down people, gather massive crowds, to watch a man and/or boy and/or woman get sodomized/raped, lynched, burned alive, penis chopped off and some times in that exact order.</p>

<p>Yes this is sick.  </p>

<p>What if the person I&#39;m talking about is your boss?  How would that make you feel?  What if it is the teacher that teaches your children?  </p>

<p>Would you have a problem with that?</p>

<p>Well if you do, then here is &#39;Project Where&#39;s Waldo&#39;</p>

<p>The pictures you will see below are from the 1910-1940&#39;s in America.  These terrorist events still happened after 1940&#39;s some have said even as late as 1970&#39;s with postcards proven such.  These images are gruesome but show the absolutely truth to what many called a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>These people pictured become police chiefs, law enforcement on all levels, congressmen, mayors and much more.  And if you notice in these pictures you will see hundreds of children.  HUNDREDS!!!</p>

<p>These children have been infected by their parents and are amongst us.</p>

<p>Where are you Waldo?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe that racists who would kill people of another race for a spectacle dont exist anymore?</p>

<p>Most of these are super old. But cops and people of authority didn&#39;t give a shit about this then. Some of these people in the photos are kids. They grew up in this. That&#39;s not a good environment to grow up in.</p>

<p>Remember when hanging someone was a public spectacle? Everyone would make a day of it to go see the traitor die? Yeah. Me either. Because eventually people realized that was barbaric and sadistic. This is the same thing. Except based on skin color.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously there&#39;s still places in the world where people are killing other races for spectacle.  For instance, the South African farmer murders are incredibly barbaric.  The Saudi operations in Yemen...  Then there&#39;s all sorts of hate crimes in the West...  I acknowledge this all occurs.  I&#39;m not against the idea of identifying people who had once participated in this awful shit...</p>

<p>So what you gonna do with people coming in with children with no papers? Assume they&#39;re the parents? Assume they aren&#39;t stolen/bought kids to smuggle the adults more easily in the country? Assume the people have no criminal background?</p>

<p>The problem with the &#39;&#39;let them in despite violating international borders law&#39;&#39; bullshit is that you just can&#39;t do that without endangering more people than you&#39;re going to help. People with criminal records have EXTRA MOTIVATION to cross border lines and wipe their past away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you know they are fleeing violence if they enter illegaly? The whole argument from the left is &quot;open borders for everyone, no checks necessary&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an absolutely insane idea on every level. You have no idea how bad north Mexico is. If you agree with this, you should own up to your choices and go have a bike ride in northern Mexico for a few days and let&#39;s see if you come back.</p>

<p>I feel people like you that think because someone enter a country with a child they are the parents. People that think everyone is nice. People that don&#39;t see that if you&#39;re telling on the news that you allow everyone in without check, ALL wanted criminals will get the fuck out. It&#39;s easy to get out, just buy the VIP package from your local smuggler so you get a child with you, it&#39;s a bit more expensive but increase your chances of getting in by so much. Then when you get there, you can dispose of it or do whatever, anyway no one will know since that child crossed the border without anyone knowing. YAY OPEN BORDERS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply choose not to waste my time arguing with people who aren&#39;t arguing in good faith. Democrats are not for open borders. We just disagree with committing crimes against humanity for &quot;deterrence&quot;. There have been plenty of deportations the past 25 years without intentionally cruel policies that irreparably harm children through no fault of their own. Guess Reagan and GWB are total liberals too right? They had vastly more sane immigration policies. This is my last response. There is no point in engaging with someone who is not honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not an assumption that you&#39;re arguing in bad faith. Democrats simply are not in favor of open borders, and to argue that they are is what&#39;s called a bad faith argument. &quot;There were kids in cages then&quot; is a total bullshit talking point you are repeating, as kids were only separated if accompanied by someone charged with a serious crime like drug trafficking, or if they were unaccompanied in the first place. That&#39;s a far cry from indefinite detention and throwing 3 year olds in front of judges alone. It went from something like 8% separated to over 90%. But sure these mothers and toddlers are just secret cartel in disguise! I mean if you like making them suffer as a deterrent, you do you, just fucking admit it and quit hiding behind bullshit. Done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay buddy. When children cross borders, you have two options, detain their parents then ship them together, or do it the Obama way and just give these children to random people that claim them. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.apnews.com/cc07b82ec58145cca37d6ff952f334c1">This was such a great idea, as AP has discovered.
</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without enough beds to house the record numbers of young arrivals, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lowered its safety standards during border surges in the last three years to swiftly move children out of government shelters and into sponsors’ homes. The procedures were increasingly relaxed as the number of young migrants rose in response to spiraling gang and drug violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, according to emails, agency memos and operations manuals obtained by AP, some under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>First,** the government stopped fingerprinting most adults seeking to claim the children<strong>. In April 2014, **the agency stopped requiring original copies of birth certificates to prove most sponsors’ identities</strong>. The next month, <strong>it decided not to complete forms that request sponsors’ personal and identifying information before sending many of the children to sponsors’ homes</strong>. Then, <strong>it eliminated FBI criminal history checks for many sponsors.</strong></p>

<p>Since the rule changes, the <strong>AP has identified more than two dozen children who were placed with sponsors who subjected them to sexual abuse, labor trafficking, or severe abuse and neglect.
**
**“This is clearly the tip of the iceberg,”</strong> said Jacqueline Bhabha, research director at the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University. “We would never release domestic children to private settings with as little scrutiny.”</p>

<p>Advocates say it is hard to gauge the total number of children exposed to dangerous conditions among the <strong>more than 89,000 placed with sponsors since October 2013 because many of the migrants designated for follow-up were nowhere to be found when social workers tried to reach them.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You know nothing about human trafficking. You&#39;re advocating for it and you don&#39;t even realize it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But I thought democrats want open borders? Now it&#39;s deportation explosion because of Obama? It literally can&#39;t be both. The doublethink is strong with this one. There are no easy options when kids are crossing alone. That doesn&#39;t mean for some reason we should take kids from their mothers with little hope of ever seeing each other again and stick them in front of a judge asking them if they know what a lawyer is. The right constantly says &quot;we can&#39;t even take care of our own vets, how can we take care of another country&#39;s kids!&quot; Yet here you are, I guess suggesting that taxpayers should pay to keep them detained indefinitely. Whatever argument is convenient at any given time! Who cares if they aren&#39;t logically compatible with eachother?! Doubleplusgood!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you think my argument was to keep kids indefinitely is very strange to me. I&#39;m against keeping them at all. I&#39;m against telling them to come. They should be sent home with their parents and if they don&#39;t have any, work with the country gvt to send them to their own foster homes or relatives. Not putting them in the hands of the most dangerous kids abusers in the fucking nation with zero background check or follow up&#39;s.</p>

<p>These was a deportation explosion under Obama because there are international border laws and they are forced to do things according to them. But the democrats actively removed security barriers (laws) to make it even easier to enter. Theyre feeding foster homes and when you try to contact these places the kids are no show. I mean fuck, do you even understand one bit how bad foster homes are for illegals? Many have family that got deported, but they get stuck in US and disappear. This is exactly what the left has been asking for. That these kids should stay in no matter what. Then they get sent to anyone since there are no background checks anymore. You think this is good? After all the actual proofs of rape, abuse, slavery, etc? How deep in the sand is your head? </p>

<p>That&#39;s not what&#39;s happening. They have had this violence for decades. What changed? We started saying we&#39;ll give them a house and money if they come in illegally. Before they knew they were on their own and risked getting kicked out. That&#39;s the difference. If you had lived outside your first world bubble like in Haiti, Senegal, India, madagascar, etc you would understand what&#39;s going on. One of my best friend during my life in India was an engineer from cameron with a private university diploma, coming from an obviously rich and educated family, told me he loves Canada because we are so rich and we have free house and money every month. Legit that. He truly believed before talking to me that this is what happens when you reach Canada. You get free money and house cause we&#39;re so rich. The reason is those that made it, they call home to their family. They tell them they got a apparament, get their social security check every month and get money for having kids. This is what actually happens. </p>

<p>Look at that fucking tweet from Trudeau &quot;you&#39;re all welcome! Come in&quot; or something after trump said fuck off.</p>

<p>After that we had thousands a day coming in for months. It costed us tens of millions to manage we had doctors at the border for months while having shortages all over the province and people die on waiting line. You&#39;re reinforcing their mentality that they&#39;ll get free money. For fuckin sure if you stop giving them shit they&#39;ll stop coming. They come cause they know they get free stuff,their family told them it&#39;s true. Everyone knows in the village. </p>

<p>I lived in those places. I fuckin know. Make friends with people from a Kenyan village and ask them what they like the most about your country. The answers may surprise you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are real. And the stories behind them are never told. </p>

<p>A few years ago, I came across a scanned image of an old newspaper from, like, the 1890&#39;s. It had a very familiar image that I was shown in my old history books of a black man being lynched by a white mob. In school I was taught to believe that the man was lynched for having the audacity to be black in a white neighborhood. Turns out, the guy brutally raped and murdered the 4 or 5-year-old daughter of the town sheriff because he was pissed-off about getting thrown in jail for being a drunken, disorderly piece of shit. He also lied about being brutalized by police (go figure). Eventually, I came to learn that lynchings were very, very rare, and often times justifiable.</p>

<p>(Here&#39;s the story I&#39;m referring to)[<a href="http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5487/">http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5487/</a>]</p>

<p>In school I was told that he was lynched because White Man = evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, natural rights being a produce of natural law.</p>

<p>I love how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIEemKcy-4E">Mark Passio describes</a> the liberty vs tyranny dichotomy as a full circle; it is natural law that makes the individual inherently free; in the absence of natural law (and thus natural rights), man would be born into servitude.</p>

<p>So liberty involves <em>being subject</em> (subjecting oneself) to natural law (which seems contradictory at first glance, but which he explains very well IMO). If ones push liberty further, e.g. &quot;fuck natural law, do what thou wilt&quot;, you circle back into a slave system/mentality. That made me understand differently the prologue of St John&#39;s gospel (which I used to reject outright), if you understand Logos as Natural Law.</p>

Usually this kind of thing happens when crime is ripe and the police isn&#39;t doing enough. </p>

<p>What we do know for a fact is that those who are EVIL manifest used to just make of things to a lynching/torture will follow.</p>

<p>Case example: Emmett Till who was tortured and hung for whistling at a Caucasian girl.</p>

<p>Decades later she admitted that it was 100% made up.  This is a fact. And this has happened 100s of times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You however ignore that some black guys did actually do far more than just whistle and yes some stories may even been made up  but don&#39;t ignore what I wrote.
If you want to go back into history, women have been burned alive for being a witches, all of the cases were made up [as none was supernatural, they were herbalists or nothing and just had a neighbour grass them up].</p>

<p>As a woman [and a modern witch] I still can see why though. At the time, they were hysterical and actually believed what they did was right.
I&#39;m not going on about it and call them evil, as they were not. Uneducated, a bit wild, yes.</p>

<p>Same with your selected images. Don&#39;t tell me every single one of the hanged black guys was innocent. They were still human and male, and from observing society, I can say 100% that they weren&#39;t all innocent fluffy bunnies.</p>

<p>Does it make lynching right? </p>

<p>NO &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; see that? NO. That&#39;s why they should have been arrested and brought to court. 
YOu are just as stupid if you think those &#39;evil whities&#39; did all that for lolz only. They didn&#39;t, they believed these guys committed a crime and some of them absolutely did. Or are you telling me as long as you are black, you are instantly the most innocent person ever who never does anything criminal?</p>

<p>You gotta be kidding.</p>

<p>Still should have gone to court.</p>

<p>Some were very educated.  In many cases the higher ups who were educated that sanctioned these acts.  These weren&#39;t a village full of fools carrying out these evils.  People have a weird mind-scramble when it comes to anything in the historical or in the past (and we&#39;re not even talking that long ago) by saying they were uneducated or just fools or they believed what they were doing was right.  </p>

<p>There is no difference than today.  You have people who are &#39;educated&#39; who do totally evil acts and to say they just that they were doing right and that they &#39;weren&#39;t&#39; evil is just putting a blind eye to it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re race baiting.  People of the Caucasian race (in which I&#39;m one) seem to get overly triggered when any type of image is shown that paints them anything other than their holier than thy self-image.  This is not a black or white issue.  What I posted was just an easy example of what the majority on all sides considered beyond evil.</p>

<p>And back just a few decades ago (when these pictures were taken) a &#39;black&#39; man could be hung just be speaking to a &#39;white&#39; woman.  </p>

<p>Since you &#39;seem&#39; like you&#39;re educated.  Emmitt Till was tortured and hung for whistling at and pursuing a &#39;white&#39; woman.  And decades later said woman (manifest of evil) said that she 100% made up the story.  100% was a lie.  </p>

<p>So keep believing what you in your bubble. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>From Richard M. Perloff, Professor of Communication at Cleveland State University:</p>

<p>“Approximately 4,742 individuals were lynched between 1882 and 1968; of the victims, 3,445 or 73 percent were Black.”</p>

<p><strong>All lynchings were in response to a claimed offense, such as a rape or stealing cattle</strong>. Blacks were 72.65% of all recorded lynchings while being ~26.87% of the population of the South at the time.</p>

<p>The Black population of the Southern US 1880-1970 averages 26.87% at each decade. And so based on their population alone, if lynchings were race-neutral, and we knew nothing about race differences in violent crime going in, we would expect 26.87% of all lynchings to be of blacks. Blacks comprised 72.65% of all lynchings, giving them a representation 2.70 times their population.</p>

<p>However, according to wikipedia, most lynchings occurred between 1882 and 1920, and during that time period the average black population was 31.76% of the southern US population. Using this number, blacks as a percentage of lynchings are only 2.29 times their percentage of the population.</p>

<p>If we split the difference and just say that the black population of the south was 29.32% of the total population, then blacks as a percentage of lynchings was 2.48 times their percentage of the population.</p>

<p>By comparison, in 2010, blacks comprised 12.6% of the total US population, but were 38.13% of the population charged for violent crimes, giving them a representation 3.03 times their population.</p>

<p><strong>And so by raw numbers the lynch mobs appear to be slightly less racially targeting than the current US legal system is</strong>. </p>
