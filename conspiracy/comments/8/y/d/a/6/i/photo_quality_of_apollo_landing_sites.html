        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was wondering why the Hubble Space Telescope hasn&#39;t been used to provide clearer images of the Apollo sites. Then I found that it has to do with <strong>limitations in optics</strong> [1].</p>

<p>Next, I found that the <strong>LRO</strong> (Lunar Reconn. Orbiter) is responsible for the current photos we have [1].</p>

<ul>
<li>It orbits some <strong>31 miles above</strong> the Moon&#39;s surface and was launched in <strong>2009</strong> [2] and its camera has a <strong>100m</strong> resolution.</li>
<li>Earth imaging satellites such as DigitalGlobe&#39;s WorldView-2 (also launched in <strong>2009</strong>), orbits at over 10 times higher than the LRO (480 miles) [4] and has a resolution of <strong>0.46m</strong>, some 217 times clearer (side point, in 2014 WorldView-3 was launched, capable o<strong>f 0.</strong>3m resolution, 333 times clearer than LRO&#39;s sensor).</li>
<li>Earth&#39;s <strong>atmosphere is some 62 miles high</strong> [3].</li>
<li>The Moon practically has <strong>no atmosphere</strong> [5].</li>
<li>The LRO mission is to <strong>map the Lunar surface</strong> for scientific study [6]. You&#39;d think they&#39;re want the camera to provide detailed photos for close examination.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>My question is, given the above, why was the LRO equipped with a subpar camera sensor?</em></p>

<p>Debunking conspiracies is not listed as an LRO objective, but you&#39;d think if the tech were available then it would be used to expel false ideas. It&#39;s almost as if the LRO was given a junk camera when better quality equipment was available.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all then why hasn’t any country confirmed our landing? The USSR was ahead of us in every aspect of the “space race” yet still has for some reason declined to be the 2nd nation to plant their flag on the moon. </p>

<p>And no, they wouldn’t have called our bluff because they simply wouldn’t have been believed. Who would have believed them? The US government would have called it communist propaganda. </p>

<p>More likely, they blackmailed us instead. Even more likely still, they are participants in the space hoax and always have been. Sputnik was fake; the Cold War was a goof. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These sources, and others about LRO that can be found by digging through the ones you have posted here, don&#39;t support your assertion that LRO&#39;s camera has a subpar camera in relation to cameras launched on other spacecraft at a similar time. Note the following quote from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The probe has made a 3-D map of the Moon&#39;s surface at 100-meter resolution and 98.2% coverage (excluding polar areas in deep shadow),[14] including 0.5-meter resolution images of Apollo landing sites.[15][16] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arizona State University is the group running the LRO&#39;s camera, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC). <a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/about">Their website</a> indicates:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LROC consists of two Narrow Angle Cameras (NACs) that are designed to provide 0.5 meter-scale panchromatic images over a 5 km swath, and a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) that provides images at a scale of 100 meters/pixel in seven color bands over a 60 km swath. The Sequence and Compressor System (SCS) supports data acquisition for both cameras.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the LROC has a resolution approximately equal to the Worldview satellite that was launched at a similar time as LRO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is huge. Thank you very much for taking the time to share what I missed.</p>

<p>The follow up question is, given the accuracy of the camera sensor and the better physical characteristics of the LRO (closer to surface, no atmospheric distortions), why do we have such poor quality, black/white images? WorldView-2 can provide color images.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know the details of why the LROC was designed the way it was, but from the available information I&#39;ll point out a few things:
* The LROC hardly produces &quot;poor quality&quot; images - the 0.5 m resolution images from the NAC <a href="http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/images">are tack-sharp</a>.
* Note that the NACs are panchromatic - meaning they record intensity of light hitting each pixel, not color.  It could be a design decision based on not wanting to store and transmit (the LRO sends 155GB of data a day already) that much color detail information about an object that is essentially grayscale anyway.
* The WAC supports <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/lroc-20100910_color_moon.html">color visualization</a>.  It may be that the science mission design only needed color visualization at that scale.
* <a href="https://quickmap.lroc.asu.edu/layers?layers=NrBsFYBoAZIRnpEoAsjZwLpNKG%2BscB2fDbMADlPnNAE5rDgiNEmiFYykAmOuqlxq9%2BDIVkzkeoHoyTBpnAuQDM0HoOW8KaxpPJw4UcfMNpxBuCQtI10Jd2Aq46vdo5vgcXTa-PP3ioBKni%2B3tZafmKRGiqyvhpE8ZFwKEKOGvR6krY8yawgcQ40OU7QKtFcAHRQhdBp2arl5qQ18moqxsqlHUEmdXzU0DVNPq3go8XDE7bl%2BTAjPTJyhaBTVTwzTqB946qoQyO2EIcTPeWa1bVlIaejEVf6tkQtBU5Eu9VGTTyvC9%2BzTaHAFlaTArZqHgPf5nVREUIEdpELqOFRES7Cd6VTEqCjpHEUYpMXHzYk6Ty4v4SchpfEIQr8CnqT449Skp7baH07YI1GgDFMRJ0-bY4ksCkeXxo9mlFC-FbAOUs4YqGlA9JVVVIOW8hZ0DkocAs7mG9na8Aohaw2ZwUXtaDQXXEh1UprlJkOzzgHjC7Q7TyZS2CigHBIhp1SEMCjngIwK2OupCxrnkWPRpO2r08dZEVN5Q65v0p2auKUOoP6TBAA&amp;amp;extent=-90%2C-29.461589977852704%2C90%2C37.43060472688395&amp;amp;proj=10">This map</a> is pretty neat and allows you to see the data that has been transmitted from the LROC.</p>

<p>In short, the images are high-quality, and I don&#39;t know what trade-offs took place to design the NACs so they only returned black-and-white images, but the transmission data bandwidth budget and science mission goals that are different from an Earth-image-providing satellite probably influenced how complex and data-intensive a satellite the US taxpayers sent to the Moon is compared to a commercial Earth-orbiting imaging satellite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no Apollo landing spot in the moon.</p>

<p>A team probably already &quot;reconstructed&quot; the landing area using computer graphics. The reason they don&#39;t want to show (fake) proof yet is because they are in the fence and don&#39;t want to dig a bigger hole of lies.</p>

<p>If it was me, I will wait until everybody to blame is dead.
Then after (fake flag /new tech disclose / nasa is cannibalized) say that Apollo &quot;was a rogue group inside Nasa&quot; / &quot;orchestrated by the deep state&quot; / &quot;most scientists were tricked too and not aware&quot; / &quot;a sad chapter in our history that we won&#39;t repeat&quot; / ...</p>

<p>Doing it after sending humans to the moon for real would be the best, so probably is not possible yet to do that. (radiation)</p>

<p>Of course, they might also be waiting for a big planned event or upcoming cataclysm to let time erase it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;We&quot; went to space before and after.</p>

<p>There are probably people in LEO (LowEarthOrbit) right now.</p>

<p>All missions except Apollo have been LEO (2000Km=1200miles)</p>

<p>Apollo manned spaceships went up to 400.000Km from the Earth.</p>

<p>So all missions went 0.5% that distance. All except Apollo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all then why hasn’t any country confirmed our landing? The USSR was ahead of us in every aspect of the “space race” yet still has for some reason declined to be the 2nd nation to plant their flag on the moon. </p>

<p>And no, they wouldn’t have called our bluff because they simply wouldn’t have been believed. Who would have believed them? The US government would have called it communist propaganda. </p>

<p>More likely, they blackmailed us instead. Even more likely still, they are participants in the space hoax and always have been. Sputnik was fake; the Cold War was a goof. </p>
