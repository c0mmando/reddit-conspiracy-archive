       Inform yourself. Then get involved- this doesn't just mean politically, which itself can take many forms. Just start talking- to friends, family, coworkers. But do it in a tactful manner that won't alienate them. Learn how you fit into your community and work outwards from there, being the change you want to see in the world. No snowflake thinks it's responsible for the avalanche, but they
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       are, and this goes for the good things in life too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get involved in local politics- and this doesn't mean it has to be within the 2 party structure. Find local activist meetings and go to them. Get involved in community initiatives. Work upwards from there. Grassroots power is the way to seize the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And always remember what Tolkien said: "It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay." Never forget this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay strong out there friend.

       Bypass the MSM. Start talking to people yourself- just those in your very life will do. Friends, family, your coworkers. Take your time and be aware that they will each receive what you say in a different way, and will require their own time to process it. Fight to see those who Truly represent you elected to local government. From there you form a pool form which you can draw for running for Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Work to encourage alternative media and knowledge by spreading it yourself, and by being able to defend it. Keep informing yourself and sharing that information, and don't feel rushed to do so. Realize that we are playing the long game here- Society doesn't change overnight. But it
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       change. And this is how we do it. One person at a time.

       Never going to happen. People are in their own little world and concerned only about themselves and close loved ones. It has been this way for a very long time. The powers that be continue to try to scare us into obedience and poverty. The public doesn't give a shit about the world - just their little corner of it.

       That is not 1000 people agreeing to anything. That is 1000 people following the money. Not the same.

       You'd have to overturn the system. That's those who run the whole world. They want to keep everybody powerless.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all about money, eh. You'd have to figure out how to get some initial seed money and gradually build up more in the business world. Start small and keep going. Later you can play ball with the big boys. Once you start getting some bigger money then you can do more things and it's easier. It's the most tough in the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to beat all these corporation guys though. Walk into any store or something, look around.. it's easy to spot inadequacies and deficiencies. They're all about treating the customer like dirt to try and save money. You think to yourself, if I could make a store, it'd be cooler than theirs. It'd look like a sci-fi movie set. Or a night club type place. I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like go into a walmart, look up at the tacky lighting. Their whole operation is not "cool" to the kids. Well if you could make a cooler store with low prices, kids would go there instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       To try and go against Goliath though is not where you begin this. That'd be a way later phase where you're at the multi-billionaire level. You'd start with your little initial business and keep going. Later on get chain stores of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you reach that billionaire level, always remain a private company. They all do stock and lose having to keep the graphs pointing upwards. If you're private you can do what you want. Now you can get into pharmaceutical research. Find damn cures instead of them having to take pills. They'll never get a cure and you know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with most billionaires is they got rich in one sector. Think of those internet nerds. Once they reach that level they get complacent and stop going for it. That's the point where you can begin but they all crap out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd want to get into all kinds of industries and kick their asses there too. They're all greedy and treat the customer like dirt. How you get rich is you make a little bit of profit in a bunch of places. Everybody should be getting paid minimum wage, even the CEO. If you don't like it, you're easily replaced with somebody who's unemployed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd also want to get into having your own universities to train these people. It'd be free schooling. Later on if you're involved in all kinds of industries, you'd own them. So you could give 'em a free house and free car that you make. If you think of paying the bills, if you could get this free stuff might at least not be in debt. Same thing with training doctors, lawyers. Now when you need these guys for your company they don't cost you hundreds an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on you can take on the billionaire company big boys. They key to kicking their asses is you be the guy who brings the robots in. No more humans with pensions and union wages. You'd need land to go mine for resources. Still lotsa room up north. You never want to need anybody. Paying middle-men for product components is what makes it expensive. That's why heavy equipment costs so much. You'd want to manufacture that and betcha it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper. Use that in farming too. Building roads. Your own cities where the damn roads are actually fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you'd need to own every step of the manufacturing process. If you can picture this, with the robots.. mining the materials. Growing whatever. Like what's "rubber". Well, do whatever it takes so you don't get ripped off buying it from somebody else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robots that fix other robots. Where's your expenses going now. Well you'd need to develop better propulsion methods and get away from fossil fuels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on you can get into that scientific research. Think of some gizmos that are sorta almost there and hire nerds to improve it. Or these guys who tinker in garages. Everybody's all individual and don't help each other out. You want to actually listen to what's in the suggestion box, unlike corporations. Meanwhile they're all failing eh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like one gizmo I saw was an electric motor with a belt hooked up to gears and an alternator. That'd generate current and power the motor. And they'd unplug it and also plug something else in there. Well keep improving that. Take a look at near perpetual devices, might be something there. Get that gizmo in your house and you put the hydro guys out of business. Put it in a car and killed the petroleum industry. Plus those wasteful battery chumps and solar panels, wind turbines.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're stuck for propulsion you can go the "alcohol can be a gas" route where this one guy was talking about using weeds and cattails from ditches, grass clippings.. get alcohol from that run it in flex fuel vehicles and it's free gas. Grow that stuff on your land. Betcha you could just leave a field grow whatever and use that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Water eh.. I think you can get it from the air. I've seen that around.  They act like it's such a problem the no water in those 3rd world countries. I also don't like dirty water.. I would distill it or use electrolysis and make new water from hydrogen and oxygen. Then you know it's not dirty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tellin ya.. it's all free, the products, once the robots take out the greed and human component. Where's your expenses now.. taxes. Well you'd want to get your own little country. Maybe buy some land from Russia or could probably easily afford some 3rd world country in Africa. Shipping wouldn't cost, so where's your expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get A.I. to think for itself.. develop new propulsion methods. Get it goin with outer space, lots of materials out there. Don't need to send humans so way less of a problem. If objects are free, what's the difference with something gigantic like a sci-fi space ship. You gotta think big here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd put those bad guys all out of business because everything would be free. Now they're powerless and don't have control on us. So no more having to work jobs or people starving. You could work on terraforming Mars. That could probably go on pretty quick because remember big is not a problem for robots. If you involve humans that's when things cost trillions. But even if it's gigantic, it's still free. Once you terraform Mars, you ship half these people outta here. Solved overpopulation. The robots could clean up the plastic in the oceans and the debris in orbit. On and on. Anything that the bad guys are doing which is a problem, you can easily clean up all this mess and pretty damn fast too because robots can move quick. So don't worry about the mess you're in.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead of workin towards you bein the guy that does that, you think you're powerless and play video games instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm powerless too but I've got a plan. Over the past couple decades thought of 375 business ideas. Things I'd do if I was a billionaire. Takes money to make money though. Workin on it.. I'll get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       How you beat these guys, is it's always about the cheapest price. Once you got the empire, you can go, ok I'll lose money in that sector to put the competition out of business. Later on, raise the price to just a bit above what it costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these conglomerates are into this mergers and acquisitions and takeovers these days. Well, you'd easily kick all their asses cause they all flunk. So let 'em do these useless takeovers.. they always lose in the end because of greed.

       Irrelevant. People have their own bias's and per-conceptions. They hate it when anyone attempts to alter this. They hate to the point if violence sometimes. Better to keep it to yourself and let things happen.

       You're on your own with the UFO coverups, but as for false flags and psy-ops, we have to keep exposing the lies that surround every major shooting event and terror attack. Notice the claims being made and how unsupported they are. Question the claims of the mainstream networks themselves, not just details of the claims.

       Whether you realize it or not, yet, what we are witnessing is the great controversy between Christ and Satan which has been raging since the dawn of creation. The battle between good and evil, truth and error, justice and corruption, is ongoing. What we wrestle against is not flesh and blood, but principalities and powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must place ourselves firmly on the side of right, walking in paths of righteousness, and then pulling others onto the firm foundation upon which we stand. If you want to have any power at all to make a difference, you need to ally yourself with the only One who has power greater than the king of darkness who currently has these governments in the bag.

       Crack open the Bible and study the bigger picture.

       That playlist that I already linked to in my first reply to you is full of just that. One aspect of evidence are the incredible prophecies of scripture which have already been fulfilled. There are many avenues whereby I can demonstrate the reality, but I figured the perspective of conspiracy and how it all ties in to Bible prophecy might be the most interesting to you.

       How many predictions have been made throughout history? 1% of them come true, by pre coincidence. This is in the 1%.

       <strong>
        Isaiah 55:1-3
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Is anyone thirsty?
        <br/>
        Come and drink—
        <br/>
        even if you have no money!
        <br/>
        Come, take your choice of wine or milk—
        <br/>
        it’s all free!
        <br/>
        Why spend your money on food that does not give you strength?
        <br/>
        Why pay for food that does you no good?
        <br/>
        Listen to me, and you will eat what is good.
        <br/>
        You will enjoy the finest food.
        <br/>
        Come to me with your ears wide open.
        <br/>
        Listen, and you will find life.
        <br/>
        I will make an everlasting covenant with you.
I will give you all the unfailing love I promised to David.
       </p>

       I see this question or essentially the same question on here alot and I always same the same thing...Invest in your community...bring people together...sounds simple but it's what they don't want you to do. The Greeks aligned hundreds, thousands of mirrors and we're able to burn whole ships to the ground. Imagine what million's of aligned minds could do.
