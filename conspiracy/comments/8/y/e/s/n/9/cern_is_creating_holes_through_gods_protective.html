        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Genesis 1:6</p>

<p>And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”</p>

<p>When GOD referred to the &quot;firmament&quot; in the bible, one way to think about it is that it&#39;s a protective barrier against other dimensions where CHAOS &amp; EVIL reside from invading our dimension &amp; conquering it.</p>

<p>CERN is creating holes in the firmament deliberately or accidentally IMO with experimentation with &quot;antimatter&quot; &amp; &quot;God particle&quot; (Higgs boson).</p>

<p>However, being very scientific minded &amp; curious myself. While part of me is apprehensive, part of me has an insatiable curiosity too.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s hope those that are in charge of these operations have &quot;Contingency Plans&quot; ready against all possible threats to our dimension from others.</p>

<p>To assume we can reason with any other entity is ignorant &amp; naive considering we can&#39;t even adequately reason among ourselves to have prevented World Wars &amp; have created World Peace &amp; true Advancement of Mankind by now.</p>

When I speak of &quot;Contingency Plans&quot;, I don&#39;t mean us fighting multidimensional invaders with the Bible. I mean using really advanced weaponry designed to fight invaders. For example, will bullets work against energy based invaders? Most likely not. But an energy based weapon could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would a king of the rats want to escape being a rat?  If this is the 3rd dimension and some science like string theory suggest there could be 10 or 11 dimensions, well lets just say nobody thinks this world is on top in the scheme of things.   The ancient Egyptians were obsessed with death and the afterlife (and the Mystery Babylon religion the elites practice is basically the same religion).  </p>

<p>Personally, I think they are just being played by the lower entities they worship.  No doubt that&#39;s who gave them the &quot;wisdom&quot; to build it.  Sorta like why the Arc of Baal is popping up in tons of cities.</p>
