    <div class="md"><p>i just meant i don’t automatically discredit a theory because i see a headline that says “No, there isn’t an elite pedophile ring operating out of a pizza parlors basement. pizzagate debunked” </p>

<p>i just don’t trust ANYONE using the word debunked, i prefer to look at evidence and make the decision in what i believe myself. not reading an article that’s sole purpose is to make you feel a certain way about something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is neither confirmed nor debunked. It&#39;s just a theory based on some circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Personally i think the structures of the operation may be real, or may <em>have</em> been real as they&#39;ve no doubt cleaned up any residuals. </p>

<p>However where PG research went wrong was trying to tie certain names to CometPP. Unfortunately with the election going on, these theories needed to be squashed.</p>

<p>You&#39;re literally making shit up about what we were doing to justify your stance.

    <div class="md"><p>All the really compelling stuff regarding CPP turned out to be less compelling as time went on. </p>

<p>I think the main thing that kicked it off in the beginning was the claim made by someone that they found actual CP hidden on the CPP webpage. That was never proven and the guy making that claim said later that he was working with police still on it, but obviously nothing has come of that. The other really weird thing that happened right at the start was the Besta pizza shop down the street having the supposed &quot;boy lover&quot; symbol in their logo. To further stoke the flames they actually changed the logo before the scandal even hit the main stream. So it seemed very much like <em>someone</em> was watching the chans and reddit in regards to the whole pizzagate situation. </p>

<p>Unfortunately people started finding &quot;clues&quot; everyplace they looked and a sort of mini satanic panic started up. People were posting music videos, movie clips, pieces of art anything you can think of really that they found troubling and holding that up as &quot;evidence&quot;, but in most of those cases the subject matter had no connection to any of the people or businesses that where being accused.   </p>

<p>As others have said there are most defiantly abuse rings that are real around the globe. What is not clear is the connection to the DNC, global elites ect. </p>

<p>Personally I got really tired of the culture that grew out of the PGers and their moralistic BS. Not everything you find disturbing is somehow related to PG FFS. This was particularly bad over on voat... but I&#39;m sure it would have happened here too if they had not shut down the sub.       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t actually seen any of them because Idgf about celeb nudes. </p>

<p>I was there too and saw the original instagram. Weird? yeah. Damning? Not in my opinion.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say I&#39;ll put more simply: There are some really concerning things with CPP and all the PG stuff. There are absolutely human trafficking rings that probably include rich and powerful people. </p>

<p>Having said that it does a huge disservice to serious inquiry into all of these things when people post any and everything they think is weird or gross and call it PG related. It makes the whole thing look stupid. Once it all started heading into the realms of Christian moralist ideals and over the top SRA speculation it became too cringe for the average person. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading about SRA and abuse rings since the 90s my friends. I personally know people who claim to be survivors of SRA. I&#39;m not going to sit here and say these kind of fucked up things never happen or can&#39;t happen now. I am going to need more proof then I currently have though in this instance before I take my pitchfork over to Marina Abramovic&#39;s house.... sorry.       </p>

<p>Listen I get a lot of flak for being a skeptic on this issue. I want to make it clear I&#39;m not trying to undermine people looking into this stuff. I&#39;m also not discounting the possibility of at least <em>some</em> of it being true. I just think people get obsessive and start falling into the confirmation bias thing. Next thing you know people are saying everything is pedo and Hillary Clinton is right now killing kids in front of an owl statue while going down on Huma Abedin.

Politics do not play into this for me at ALL, bc i believe both sides are fronts, and the private companies of the dnc and the gop handpick and groom these individuals, only allowing for polarity,  not the true spectrum of the nations populace. Hastert, for example. </p>

<p>I always have to clarify this when I talk about pizzagate/pedogate.</p>

<p>I am not saying its been proven to be untrue. I am saying that I have yet to see anything compelling enough for me to say with certainty that CPP specifically is guilty of anything. I have also not seen anything compelling enough for me to be certain pedogate stretches up to top gov. It might... I would go so far as to say that I&#39;m certain there are individual cases of pedos being in positions of power. I also think its very possible that the letters run blackmail ops on people involving pedo stuff. </p>

<p>With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping
up again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to
the farm in Lovettsville. And I thought I’d share a couple more notes:
We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. Bonnie will be
Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and
almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in
that pool for sure. And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun,
and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever
attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so
we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).</p>

<p>I am ccing Trudy to repeat the invite, and sending pining
wishes-you-could-come to Rima, John P, and Laurie &amp; Chris.</p>

<p>Con amore, Mrs. Farmer L</p>

<p>Tamera Luzzatto</p>

<p>Senior Vice President, Government Relations</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is a blanket term for an amalgamation of a lot of bullshit and some stuff that needs to be looked into further. Besta Pizza... This place is on the same street as CPP and ACTUALLY HAD the boylover triangles in their logo. The inside also had a poster that appeared to be of Masonic/occult origin (had a ladder leading to a window, it said something like &quot;you can live upstairs if you want to&quot;).</p>

<p>The emails from WikiLeaks are clearly code for SOMETHING. Theyve never been debunked or denied. The code is not definitely children of different races or whatever, but anyone telling you there&#39;s not a code is lying to your face. Podesta looks like a fucking methhead, it could easily be drugs, but I&#39;m not ruling out all possibilities. </p>

<p>So, Hillary Clinton running Satanic child sex ring in the basement of Comet Ping Pong... Yeah, that specific claim is debunked. Is there still some shit going on there? Yes. Does Clinton have ties to Alefantis? Yes. Has John Podesta been invited to a &quot;spirit cooking&quot; ceremony/ritual by an occult practitioner? Yes. are the Podestas and Alefantis into extremely eerie art that sometimes contains children in sexual depictions? Yes. Much work still needs to be done</p>

<p>There are so many extreme claims out there... like are we talking Kathy O&#39;Brian full on MK ultra + Moloc shit? Organ harvesting in Haiti and Croatia? The finders? Johnny Gosch as a call boy for Busch and company? </p>

<p>Or are we talking about a global ring of CP and sex salve shit that includes a lot of elites? That I can see... the rest is going to take more than circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p>Also not calling anyone out specifically I&#39;m just pointing out that seeing satanic pedo symbols in <em>everything</em> is delusional.       </p>
