    <div class="md"><p>Seriously, I feel like I could have easily been taken with the wave. I think it really has a lot of roots in the peoples distrust in the government&#39;s involvement in 9/11. </p>

<p>But the thing is with 9/11 for like a month straight we were all hooked to the news, nothing like this had ever happened before and we all were hooked.</p>

<p>And Remember that news didn&#39;t always have that constant stream ticker at the bottom telling you everything else that is going on. So here we are watching the news, and Fox news and cable goes 24/7 where CBS and ABC eventually has to get back to Friends and Football, so where did people go? Fox and CNN. CNN while not unbias, trys much more than Fox does, and with 9/11 just happening and Fox yelling fire and fury, they are going to get a lot of viewership.</p>

<p>9/11 fucked this country super hard</p>

<p><a href="https://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/private-banks-spurious-quotation">Here you go</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>from your source:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The second part of the quotation (&quot;I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies&quot;) is a slight misquotation of a statement Jefferson made in a letter to John Taylor in 1816. He wrote, &quot;And I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; &amp; that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale&quot;3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this quote is legit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; &amp; that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bank-paper must be suppressed, and the circulating medium must be restored to the nation to whom it belongs.&quot;4</p>

<p>That is a fake quote and is the majority of the quote in the diagram. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part is real but is taken out of context of what he was saying. It&#39;s because it&#39;s the fear of spending going too much to the point where it&#39;s not sustainable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.</p>

<p>even within that context, that comment alone says everything. Its true even if you take the quote on its own without any content. Look at the Ursury system, fiat, central banking, petro dollar, Federal reserve printing money at interest to the US Gov. These are all massive scams and Hierarchies that control America and its people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it was, but the quotes attributed as true in your source, still give the same underlying message. Too much power to a central bank is a danger to the whole country.

    <div class="md"><p>People once thought the internet would be the best development ever for conspiracy theorists, but the story is of course more complicated.</p>

<p>Yes, the internet allows us to share important information with one another, but it also allows the government to share disinformation. </p>

<p>Think of it like lobbying: at first glance it seems democratic to allow citizens to lobby Congress, but at second glance you realize that concentrated power (corporations, industries, etc.) can lobby more effectively than private citizens or even groups of citizens, so lobbying tends to serve concentrated power.  I think the internet works the same way. </p>

<p>Now turn to r/conspiracy: at first glance it seems like a great way for genuine conspiracy theorists to share important information with one another, but at second glance you realize that concentrated power (deep state, corporations, industries, etc.) can flood r/conspiracy with disinformation more effectively than private redditors or even groups of redditors can, so r/conspiracy tends to serve concentrated power. </p>

<p>As much as we try to share important, true things with each other, agents of concentrated power are paid living wages to flood this forum with important-seeming false things and in-important true things. If you pair this tactic with using bots (or bot-like accounts) to strategically up- and down-vote content, the result could be...something like the status quo.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>
