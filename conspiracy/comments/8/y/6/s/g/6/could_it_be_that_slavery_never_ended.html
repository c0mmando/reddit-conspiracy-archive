    <div class="md"><p>Thing is any one of us could have started Tesla or built not-a-flamethrowers like Musk, or invest and play the market like Warren Buffet. But you need to be intelligent, fast, brave able to start an Apple or Microsoft.  lt&#39;s rare to be smart enough to become a billionare. But thousands become millionares and even more reach upper middle class by themselves using their brains or instincts, yes without using anyone else&#39;s momey or support. You can do whatever you want (legally) to get rich in America at least. Equal oppotunity to work or take risks and get rich. Real estate for example, save up buy a dumpy house in the ghetto, fix it up a little rent it out buy another until you can afford shopping centers, boom millionare. Buy a beater sports care fix it up sell it rinse repeat until you own a car dealership. Write a program everyone needs or wants. Whatever it is no one is stopping you.</p>

<p>Not everyone can make music like say Kanye West or John Lennon or whatever, that takes talent. Same with being a billionare, you can be one if you want if have talent in the IQ brains department or built up your skill.</p>

<p>So what some Rockefeller grandson didn&#39;t earn his wealth, he&#39;s not rich because you&#39;re pooor. Your poor because you are not smart enough to get rich, or because you have no drive or skills, or you made a  bad decision/ make bad decisions, or because you choose to be poor.</p>

<p>I grew up dirt poor ob welfare and food stamps, now I&#39;m not through hard work and drive alone, with zero help, survived muliple layoffs and bad decisions. </p>

<p>I could have been a billionare today if I had the skills, IQ or ideas to develop but I don&#39;t partially because of previous mistakes and bad decisions, so I&#39;m not. But I&#39;m okay because I worked hard to be okay.</p>

<p>Do you think Warren Buffet or Bill Gates or Puff Daddy, Mark Cuban or FUBY shark tank guy sat sround on mom&#39;s couch smoking pot all day mad cause life wasn&#39;t handed to them on a silver platter?</p>

<p>I feel no feels for lazy entitled poor people bitching while I work hard to earn a decent life and not just survive waiting for someone to give me cheese.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes the bankers make or break you but if you have undeniable brains, finesse and/or good ideas they cannot turn you down, you&#39;re practically invincible. They will not and cannot say no or turn you down. They can&#39;t afford to lose you to their competition. Suge Knight got a bank to finance his record label despite his felon record and gang affiliation because he had a bulletproof business plan. Rappers like Tekashi have zero rap talent, yet got rich. Why? Bulletproof business plan,  killer online social media game plan, and a following he built from nothing. Apply the same principles to any business. You need some skill to earn trust and you&#39;ll basically print your own money. Coffee shop, T-shirt design, real estate, roofing. No one is holding any of us back. </p>

<p>No one gave the first Rothschild his billions for free, he had skills brains or talent, however evil they might have been, he had them. Whiners haters losers, no difference between them. </p>

<p>Trump proved the elections might have been fixed against him yet he still won in the end, because he has the talent, skills, or brains to run circles around his slower dumber less talented competition, even with a deck stacked against him. </p>

<p>Male giraffes don&#39;t sit around whining waiting for the alpha to feed them, they challenge the alpha. They either take his place, or get banished from their territory. You have to take the risk if you believe you can beat the system. Calling yourself a slave is letting the Alpha banish you to poor people island for life. </p>

Millions of women enslaved and beaten, their passports taken, owned by men who can kill them at a whim and nobody would care.
That&#39;s actual slavery.</p>

<p>Often slavery is not recognised as we have this image in mind that a slave is a half naked black person in shackles, picking cotton.</p>

<p>However that is an entirely outdated image. Modern slaves look modern, can be white, asian or any other colour, often have even a modern life to an extent [even the ones I described above].</p>

<p>This brings me to western slaves and what OP is talking about. We all shake our heads at factory workers during the industrial revolution, how they worked for long hours and under horrendous conditions. Yet here we are, having modern people without a choice, working jobs that gives them a pittance yet they HAVE to do it as else they lose their homes or need to take out more loans.</p>

<p>The conditions are often just as horrible [Toilet breaks timed, no sickness pay, cramped, long hours etc]. But in the end you are &#39;allowed&#39; to go home.</p>

<p>The &#39;allowed to go home&#39; is the smoke screen. It makes people feel they are not owned. But they are, only the employer has found a cheaper way of keeping you. In olden days he&#39;d had to provide at least some sort of accomodation and food. Now he can just use you and you pay for your own. Win win for employer [slave keeper].</p>

<p>Of course he doesn&#39;t actually own you. You are still free to quit you r job. But very few do as the consequences can be devastating [they make sure].
Therefore we are not owned by the employer but by the state. </p>

<p>A kind of slavery that comes disguised as freedom. Freedom to spend your imaginary money on your own accomodation and gadgets to keep your mind of work. They let you drink alcohol at weekends but no drugs [as they will open your eyes and mind too much]. 
Our data is mined and sold for profit instead of our actual bodies.
We don&#39;t get beaten physically though. </p>

<p>So yes, we are and have always been enslaved, but keep in mind that there are also still &#39;&#39;old fashioned&#39; slaves out there, right now who are seemingly accepted and not seen as slaves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Noam Chomsky describing Mikhail Bakunin&#39;s predictions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s a tragedy and a catastrophe that the left has accepted the idea of humans as historical products, simply reflections of their environment... Because what follows from that, of course, is that there&#39;s no moral barrier to molding them any way you like, and that humans have no inner nature.</p>

<p>If humans don&#39;t have an inner instinct for freedom, if it&#39;s not fundamental to their nature to have free, creative, productive work under their own control... if that&#39;s not part of their nature, then there&#39;s no moral reason for allowing them that space. You could just mold them into being what you think they ought to be. You can be the Central Committee, or you can be the managers of the corporation, or the directors of a fascist state, or whatever.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s quite interesting that the modern intellectuals have mostly moved in one or the other of those directions, overwhelmingly. In fact, this was foretold in maybe the only prediction of the social sciences that ever came so dramatically true: Bakunin&#39;s discussion of this in the late 19th century. He was arguing with Marx, and this is well before Leninism, but he predicted, very perceptively, that the rising class of intellectuals, who were just becoming identified as a modern industrial society, were essentially going to go in one of two directions.</p>

<p>There would be some who would believe that the struggles of the working class would offer them an opportunity to rise and take state power in their own hands. And at that point, he said, they would become the red bureaucracy who would create the worst tyranny that humanity has ever known, and of course all in the interests of the workers. That&#39;s one direction.</p>

<p>The others, he said, would recognize that you&#39;re never going to get power that way, and the way to get power is to associate yourself with what we would nowadays call state capitalism, and just become the servants of its ruling class. And then you become the managers, and the ideologues, and so on, for the state capitalist system. And, as he put it, those people will beat the people with the people&#39;s stick. In other words, they&#39;ll talk about democracy, but they&#39;ll really be beating people with the stick of democracy, which they&#39;ll turn into a mechanism of coercion.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some who think you can get power by exploiting popular struggles, and there are others who see that you can get power by just associating yourself with the people who already have economic power, that largely dominate. And I think that was a very accurate description of the century that followed him. This is fifty years before the Bolshevik Revolution, but he predicted its form very precisely, and also its ideological background.</p>

<p>He also predicted, quite accurately, what happens in the modern state capitalist industrial societies. And looking at it now, from the retrospect of a hundred years, we can see this development very clearly. It also explains an odd fact about 20th century intellectual life, which is how easy it has been for people to shift from one position to another. So the same person who is a Stalinist apologist one year is a super American patriot the next year. And this person is supporting every atrocity, like working in the Hoover Institute, and associated with the most reactionary institutions. That transition, which is sometimes called &quot;The God that Failed&quot; change, was sort of authentic in the early years with people like Silone, and others.</p>

<p>You know there was something authentic about it. It became a joke. In fact, we&#39;re seeing that in Russia right now. The worst commissars are now the ones who are most passionate about the free market, and investing, and enriching yourself, and so on. You see how they&#39;ve made the transition very easily, and this goes way back. And I think the reason is because there&#39;s no transition, it&#39;s just a different estimate as to where power lies, but the same ideology. The ideology is you beat the people with the people&#39;s stick. And we&#39;re going to do it. And if you look at modern democratic theory in the West, it&#39;s remarkably similar to this. It&#39;s remarkably Leninist in its character.</p>

<p>If you think of the leading tendencies of modern democratic theory in the West, in the adademic world, it would be the strands of political science that developed from the thinking of people like Harold Lasswell, one of the founders of modern contemporary political science, and in the general sphere, the Wilsonian Intellectuals, the so-called progressive intellectuals, of whom Walter Lippmann was the most striking example in the United States. All of these people developed theories of democracy, and they&#39;re quite interesting, they&#39;re very Leninist in their character.</p>

<p>The conception is that in a democracy there&#39;s two classes of citizens. There&#39;s the general public, who Lippmann calls the ignorant and meddlesome outsiders. And Lasswell says they&#39;re too stupid-- that we should not be overcome by dogmatism about the common man, who&#39;s too stupid to be able to do anything. That&#39;s the standard view. So there&#39;s these people, the ignorant and meddlesome outsiders, which is maybe 90% of the population, and then there are the responsible men, the wise men, you know, the smart people, the people with integrity, and honor, or the intellectual aristocracy, whatever you call them. And they have to rule, they&#39;re the ones who make the decisions, who do the thinking, and so and decide which of the smart guys is going to be their leader and then go home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slavery is pretty much alive. For example, in Russian North-East Caucasus criminal/tribal (it gets blurry) bands of Chechens or Dagestanis kidnap vulnerable people (mostly Russians, as most numerous) with promises of work or, in case of alcoholics/drug addicts, of dozes, then bring them as slaves to the Caucasus. Some are basically chattel slaves on the infamous &quot;Dagestani brick factories&quot; (as I recall, the most infamous case with dozens of slaves uncovered were in some brick factory)</p>

<p>And common men everywhere are serfs in all but name. Try not to pay taxes and see what happenes. Pretty much the same thing that would happen to a serf would he decide not to provide free labour to his lord for a change.</p>

<p>Just as there were different tiers of serfdom, so they are now, e.g. a person with a big mortgage is effectively in more bondage that a &quot;common serf&quot; paying just taxes for his privilege not to be caged/killed by state approved gorillas unless gorillas happen to come with Kingly Approval charter. It gets even more interesting when you consider that certain folks in certain Western countries mostly don&#39;t pay taxes and live on the welfare. Supposedly they are not serfs, as they are not obliged to provide free labour to the state-Lord in form of taxes or being a war slave (conscription), and can just live on the dole. But then the man providing them with freebies has control over their very, well, welfare. Such people are even more bonded, though the bonds are less evident. </p>

<p>Literally plebs living on free breads and circuses from their Caesars paid for by robbing&amp;enslaving random Celts, or overtaxing freemen and overworking the slaves, just like when the Western Rome overtaxed itself so hard that random bearded dudes from Scandinavia or somewhere with tribal customs instead of laws were actually an improvement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we never really got out of feudalism even though it is claimed we did. The lords just got better at hiding it and now they are more powerful than ever before. We just changed leadership from kings, lords, knights etc... to Corporations, companies, and organizations. That&#39;s the major issue with the current monopoly system that is in place. When one company can own a piece of everything you interact with on a daily basis than you are subject to their every whim and they will do what ever they can to keep that power. It&#39;s why there is so much collusion going on for fixing prices of goods/services and pay to workers. If you want to stop this or at least put a massive barrier to it, we NEED to completely redo the entire IP law that we have currently because it&#39;s the reason for all the problems we face. The government forgot to implement control measures to take the place of the natural market price that they removed. Normally a price for a good/service is dictated by the market but when patents, trademarks, copyright etc... get involved it removes that market price and allows the company to implement their own of which customers will be forced to pay without any alternatives available. Just look at any country that has very cheap healthcare and you&#39;ll notice that it also has very lax IP laws that either don&#39;t help the company control things OR it specifically helps the customers over said company. That&#39;s what IP law was originally intended to do, to generate lots of new content/ideas/products by protecting the less fortunate from more fortunate individuals/companies/organizations who could easily steal the content to make their own version.</p>

<p>We need to end the monopolies and fix IP law to stop companies from being able to collude together so easily. We need more competition for stuff.</p>

They use the money as the power, the fact that they have so much let&#39;s them do whatever they want, meanwhile we have to go to work every day for at least 50 weeks a year, just to have a chance to survive. The tricky part is, they have tricked all these people that are wage slaves into believing they are not poor, they are &quot;middle class&quot; since they make idk 50k a year. Thanks to the propaganda spewing from the media. The government is for people that make over 400k a year. Otherwise they don&#39;t represent you, they pay you lip service.</p>
