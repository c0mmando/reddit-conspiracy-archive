It&#39;s about the cashless/microchip/transhumanism.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/_78sl90ClAE">https://youtu.be/_78sl90ClAE</a></p>

<p>Btw, it was only meant to be 20 mins but it&#39;s longer, sorry about that. I&#39;m happy with it and think the info is really good. Hopefully red pill some people who don&#39;t believe there is a microchip agenda.</p>

<p>Took me over 7 hours of editing last night as my laptop is TERRIBLE. I was up till after 3am but I set myself a deadline and refused to fail. High effort and the next one will be much better quality! </p>

<p>If it&#39;s good please share, if it&#39;s shit please leave me feedback so I can improve.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had feedback to lose the mask but I work in the NHS and must remain anonymous as best I can for when I start discussing controversial topics.</p>

<p>Editing will be better, audio louder and the intro bit where I state the claim, shorter. </p>

<p>Any other feedback is GREATLY appreciated. </p>

<p>Future topics include - Operation paperclip
Fluoride
V2K
And much more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The microchip agenda is a precursor to the mark of the beast.  It will be used to buy and sell with a global currency system and probably a lot of other stuff.</p>

<p>Rev 13:16¬† And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:¬†</p>

<p>Rev 13:17¬† And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.¬†</p>

<p>The King James Bible is the only version that correctly said it would go &quot;in&quot; the right hand or forehead.</p>

<p>The chip is one part and other other is likely neural lace:  <a href="https://gizmodo.com/scientists-just-invented-the-neural-lace-1711540938">https://gizmodo.com/scientists-just-invented-the-neural-lace-1711540938</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it helps that I am on the niteshift now and can barely sleep ever.  So I am tired and a little confused at all times which is like being stoned except without any euphoria.</p>

<p>So, work the nite shift, and confuse your body to the extent it has no idea how to properly function, when its supposed to eat or sleep.  Feel like theres the rest of society and you.  Never be on the same page with anyone timewise.  And you will forget about pot. lol</p>

<p>I forgot what I was talking about midway thru that.  I am not sure if its bedtime or lunchtime or I just have to shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying I havent done that, but in this case no.  I am an every day smoker, but only usually after work or near bedtime.  Lately been working nights and havent touched it in 2 or 3 days.  Well I doubt 3.  But 2 definitely.  Dont usually skip a day.  Not even sure I stashed it.  Maybe it was on the table.  I dont know.  Not smoking seems to have affected my memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re on the same page then except about the bloodlines thing. I&#39;ve vaguely heard about it but it does make sense. Have you heard of this site? There is SO much information about this theory in there that you could get lost for days. I have tried to find holes in it as far as truth and morality is concerned and I can&#39;t find any holes. Granted I do not understand a lot of this extradimensial type stuff as far as figuring out what is true or not but the stuff that I do understand, it seems pretty on point. Especially the strategies used to turn us against each other. I know a lot about psychology and it makes almost too much sense. I&#39;m not entirely sure about the woman who writes the stuff. Seems a bit off to me but that doesn&#39;t mean the information isn&#39;t true. Not yet anyways.</p>

Tbf with the bloodlines thing I have no concrete proof but you know when something just ring true in your gut?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen clips that from movie before but wasn&#39;t aware of those books.   That&#39;s some long term predicative programming from the spiritual principalities and powers.  I&#39;m too much of a KJV literalist to believe Trump is the Antichrist though.  He has to be someone with Assyrian and Jewish blood and the catching away of the born again saints (rapture) will happen before he is revealed.  We are late in the game though and Trump is somehow involved with pulling together his kingdom.</p>

<p>Do you think Babylon is literally called Babylon too?</p>

<p>Technically he hasn&#39;t been revealed yet. That&#39;s when he calls himself God. You know what could push him to do that? A movie that speaks about the possibility that he is a vessel for God&#39;s work and a man foretold of this possibility years ago. I wonder what would happen if a malignant narcissist like Trump watched this movie along with millions of other people and started to believe he was sent by God? Hmmm.. I imagine it would be like Jim Jones or David Koresh having nukes and the largest, most powerful army in the world at their backs.</p>

<p>So do you believe this too? That Trump is being used by God? Why do you think this? Trump is literally an Antichrist in the sense that he is EVERYTHING Jesus stood against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I say Trump is involved in pulling together his kingdom I&#39;m talking about the Antichrist&#39;s kingdom.  Yes he&#39;s being used by God the same way the Antichrist (him or not) will be used by God to chastise Israel.  The great whore is the Vatican.  I know the statue of liberty is a androgynous pagan god.  Mystery Babylon isn&#39;t literally called Babylon because it&#39;s shrouded in secrecy now.  It&#39;s the Vatican/Jesuits and the secret societies/mystery schools that run the world.</p>

<p>If Trump has Jewish blood and perhaps somehow is mixed with assyrian then it&#39;s possible.  I just don&#39;t really worry myself with looking for the Antichrist.  I&#39;m just trying to get people inside Jesus Christ so they can get out of here too.  It&#39;s way easier to be saved now in this dispensation than after the catching away.  Grace is freely given by God by repenting and believing this:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1¬† Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;¬†
1Co 15:2¬† By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.¬†
1Co 15:3¬† For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;¬†
1Co 15:4¬† And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:¬†</p>
