        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At risk for what? Chicken pox? Ask your grandmother if she knew anyone who died from chicken pox or measles. Different diseases have different degrees of severity in different age groups. The misconception that ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt vaccinate, you place others at risk‚Äù is based on an assumption that vaccinated people do not get the disease they were vaccinated for. Did you know that a controlled study published in BMJ in school age children showed that of all the whooping cough that was diagnosed, over 86% of the children were fully vaccinated and up to date for the whooping cough vaccine? There are similar studies showing that mumps and measles breakouts often affect the vaccinated. People who are vaccinated can have their immune systems altered in a manner that leads to susceptibility to other infectious diseases, and can also leave them vulnerable to the disease they were vaccinated for due to a phenomenon called ‚Äúoriginal antigenic sin‚Äù.  What is ‚Äúoriginal antigenic sin‚Äù?  This is where an injected vaccine antigen programs the body to react in a manner that is incomplete, and different to the natural response to infection .  When the vaccinated contact that disease again, they are unable to mount an effective response to the pathogen because vital first steps are missing.  The whooping cough vaccine is an example of this.
<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7560/174.full">http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7560/174.full</a></p>

<p>A very noteworthy study was published in 2013, looking at baboons, which are susceptible and manifest whooping cough like humans do. In the study by Warfel, baboons that were either vaccinated or not vaccinated were later exposed to pertussis bacteria, something that cannot be done experimentally in humans (due to ethical considerations), but which yields very important data.
<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/20/1314688110.abstract">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/20/1314688110.abstract</a></p>

<p>As expected, the baboons that had never been infected got the cough and remained colonized with bacteria for a maximum of 38 days. But unexpectedly, baboons that were previously vaccinated and immunized vaccine-style, became colonized upon later exposure for a longer time than the na√Øve baboons; 42 days. However unvaccinated baboons that recovered naturally and were later exposed to the bacteria did not become colonized at all ‚Äì zero days.</p>

<p>Recuperated and vaccinated baboons were also exposed to pertussis bacteria and then placed in cages with naive baboons. Only the vaccinated baboons infected them. The naturally recovered baboons did not infect their naive cage mates.</p>

<p>The following video contains relevant information that every parent should know.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NtgiKFp9NJk?list=PLgH2vCx5TOgXZrRRM-ObX7JXt_0Ie8OI0">https://youtu.be/NtgiKFp9NJk?list=PLgH2vCx5TOgXZrRRM-ObX7JXt_0Ie8OI0</a>
So, who is providing better herd immunity in the face of whooping cough bacterial exposure? Vaccinated individuals who presume they are immune, yet remain asymptomatically colonized for 42 days spreading bacteria? Unvaccinated kids who get infected and remain colonized for 38 days? Or the naturally convalesced who are not able to be colonized and therefore do not spread bacteria at all upon re-exposure? Better still: natural convalescence makes for solid immunity which lasts decades longer than vaccination.</p>

<p>Many vaccine enthusiasts like to invoke the term ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù to make the argument that the non-vaccinated pose a risk to the vaccinated. But the concept of herd immunity has no relevance to the vaccinated as it was coined in reference to natural immunity in populations and what level the least epidemics occurred. There is no evidence whatsoever that having an 85% or 95% childhood vaccination rate necessarily protects from outbreaks.

<p>As for the worrying, it&#39;s generally better to have more defenses to sickness than not to. Like the link above states, it&#39;s like wearing a seatbelt. You don&#39;t <em>need</em> to have one, but in the off chance that you get in an accident, it severely increases your chances of staying alive.</p>

<p>Comparing to abortion is a false equivalence.  Mothers have 24 weeks to decide whether or not to carry to term.  After that, they cant get an abortion.  That&#39;s a decision that is up to the mother and does not put the nation or general public at risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re the one trying to say the state should mandate pregnancy for national security.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Never said anything close to this.</p>

<p>You implied that the &quot;my body my choice&quot; defense of vaccine choice doesn&#39;t apply because it can be argued that communicable disease is a national security issue.  I pointed out that low birth rates are also a national security issue so by the same logic the &quot;my body my choice&quot; defense shouldn&#39;t apply to abortion if it doesn&#39;t apply to vaccines.</p>

<p>They are completely alike because the entire crux of the debate is do individuals have ultimate authority over their own body or not.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pro choice on abortion and vaccines.  You&#39;re trying to separate the two groups arbitrarily because you&#39;re pro choice for abortion but anti-choice for vaccines.</p>

<p>There is no other way for you to frame this point I made.  You think a woman should have ultimate authority over her own body even if it causes the death of an unborn person, but you are against vaccine choice on the grounds that people might die.</p>

<p>Stop trying to twist my words and just think about the problem in your logic.  People either have a right to make medical choices for themselves or they don&#39;t.  You can&#39;t grant them choice for things you approve of but take it away for things you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Um, yea, that&#39;s kind of the point you are making.  That the state should mandate pregnancy for national security and public safety.</p>

<p>I am not implying, I&#39;m stating directly that vaccination is a public safety and national security issue.  And it is.  Outbreaks threaten public safety and just being searched by the TSA or NSA isnt a choice, neither is vaccination.  </p>

<p>Low birth rates arent a national security issue.  There is no same logic here.  It&#39;s a bad argument because they are nothing alike.</p>

<p>Women do have authority over their body under Roe V Wade as it relates to abortion.  They get 24 weeks to decide (depending on the state) whether or not carry it to term.  The government doesnt have an overriding concern over public safety or national security as far as it relates to mandating pregnant women carry children to term.</p>

<p>The context matters here.  In one instance we have an overriding public safety and national security issue, on the other we have a civil liberty issue.  You&#39;re the one that is trying to equate them as the same.  I&#39;m not twisting your words, those are your words and you&#39;re neglecting the context of the argument.</p>

<p>There is literally no difference between a person being able to choose to get an abortion or being able to choose to get a vaccine.   If public health is such a concern to you then why don&#39;t you go protest the ILLEGAL immigrants coming across the border with no vaccinations while actively carrying infectious diseases.  Nope you won&#39;t do it because fuck public safety that would be racist.</p>

<p>There is a ton of difference between a person being able to choose an abortion or a vaccine.  An outbreak exposes the general public to a potential threat, pregnancy does not.  You refuse to recognize this distinction.</p>

<p>Now, after deflecting to guns and free speech, you make another empty assumption about &quot;ILLEGAL immigrants&quot; coming across the border.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not quite. First, the antigen cannot program the body. The body is not a machine. Let&#39;s correct that definition with a copypaste from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Original antigenic sin</strong>, also known as the <strong>Hoskins effect</strong>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin#cite_note-1">[1]</a> refers to the propensity of the body&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system">immune system</a> to preferentially utilize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical">immunological memory</a>) based on a previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection">infection</a> when a second slightly different version of that foreign entity (e.g. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus">virus</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterium">bacterium</a>) is encountered. This leaves the immune system &quot;trapped&quot; by the first response it has made to each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen">antigen</a>,  and unable to mount potentially more effective responses during  subsequent infections. The phenomenon of original antigenic sin has been  described in relation to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_virus">influenza virus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever">dengue fever</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_immunodeficiency_virus">human immunodeficiency virus</a> (HIV), and to several other viruses. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin</a>As you can see, it is not strictly related to vaccinations. It is basically a memory B cell making antibodies that are rendered ineffective by the antigens changing, and naive B cells being unable to produce the antibody needed. not &quot;programming the body&quot;. Should you be infected, then an antigenic drift occur, this effect may occur without vaccination.</p>

<p>A very noteworthy study was published in 2013, looking at baboons, which  are susceptible and manifest whooping cough like humans do. In the  study by Warfel, baboons that were either vaccinated or not vaccinated  were later exposed to pertussis bacteria, something that cannot be done  experimentally in humans (due to ethical considerations), but which  yields very important data. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/20/1314688110.abstract">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/20/1314688110.abstract</a> </p>
