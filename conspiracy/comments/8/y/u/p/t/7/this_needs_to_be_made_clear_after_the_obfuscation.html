    <div class="md"><p>Will there ever be a day in court with witness, testimony and physical evidence/demonstrations of how their alleged &#39;hack&#39; worked? Probably not which is exactly they went ahead with it,</p>

<p>The word &#39;hack&#39; is being over used, spear phishing or scam needs to be in the reports alot more. One of the first and old rules of internet computer/safety is? -don&#39;t click on unfamiliar stuff which is apparently what Podesta and DNC staff did.</p>

<p>The attempted hacks of election systems is the biggest worry but is exactly why every state should be able to determine it&#39;s own systems and policies because if everything was the same it&#39;s only one target that would have to be attacked by hackers, not 50.</p>

<p>This logic seems... Flawed. Yes, they would have 50 targets, but if even a few of those systems aren&#39;t up to par with the rest, that would be enough to tip the entire election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop your lying. The Podesta emails were spearsphished by the Russian. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For  example,  on  or  about  March  19,  2016,  LUKASHEV  and  his  co-conspirators created  and  sent  a  spearphishing  email  to  the  chairman  of  the  Clinton  Campaign.  LUKASHEV  used  the  account  “john356gh”  at  an  online  service  that  abbreviated lengthy  website  addresses  (referred  to  as  a  “URL-shortening  service”).  LUKASHEV used the account  to mask  a link  contained  in  the  spearphishing  email, which  directed  the  recipient  to  a  GRU-created  website.   LUKASHEV  altered  the appearance  of  the  sender  email  address  in  order  to  make  it  look  like  the  email  was a  security  notification  from  Google  (a  technique  known  as  “spoofing”),  instructing the  user  to  change  his  password  by  clicking  the  embedded  link.   Those  instructions were  followed.   On  or  about  March  21,  2016,  LUKASHEV,  YERMAKOV,  and their  co-conspirators  stole  the  contents  of  the  chairman’s  email  account,  which consisted  of  over  50,000  emails.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear that Assange was asking for leaks from Guccifer 2.0, and got it, to help Trump​ by causing a riff between Hillary&#39;s and Sander&#39;s supporters during the DNC convention. That&#39;s again, Wikileak, Russia and Trump. It&#39;s amazing how these same players come up again and again and again and again for such innocent people! </p>

Yet guccifer2.0&#39;s texts were basically some script kitty russian whom spoke broken english. </p>

<p>Its almost as if the real story was that the dnc released guccifer2.0 to do damage control on the alleged hack. </p>

<p>Can we foia wordpress for the debit card used for the site because they dont offer whois protection to non paying users (to the best of my knowledge). So the americans that wrote guccifer2.0&#39;s site are apparently hiding in plain site, an no one is challenging this admission on the dnc&#39;s end.  They apparently feel more comfortable using materials produced by crowdstriker- /s

    <div class="md"><p>lol My TURN! </p>

<p>Gucciffer 2.0 (smoke screen) never gave the files to WL. Wikileaks had gotten their own set of files from a different source , a leaker (presumably Seth Rich). When the DNC/FBI found out about the leak and that Wikileaks was planning on releasing the documents, they came up with a smoke screen play to use &quot;Guccifer 2.0/DC Leaks&quot; as a distraction/ Russian set up. It was so fucking laughable in real time as it was unfolding. &quot;Guccifer2.0&quot; started tweeting to Wikileaks in efforts to associate their made up smoke screen to Wikileaks. But Assange already had the goods. Wikileaks vetted all the files/emails and provided 100% watermarked proof. </p>

<p>The files from Guciffer were electronically modified and they don&#39;t even match the files released by Wikileaks. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny that you are trying to associate &quot;the 12 indictment&quot; propaganda play with Wikileaks. The 2 are completely different. Nice try thou!</p>

<p>-10 downvotes says you won&#39;t respond once conforted with the truth 👍</p>

<p>Yes, Russia/Wikileak/Trump​ are being framed so many times it&#39;s quite amazing how Obama managed to get all these parties to meet and send messages to each other! No way is it illegal campaign coordination! No collusion! Witch hunt. Got it. 👍</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol My TURN! </p>

<p>Gucciffer 2.0 (smoke screen) never gave the files to WL. Wikileaks had gotten their own set of files from a different source , a leaker (presumably Seth Rich). When the DNC/FBI found out about the leak and that Wikileaks was planning on releasing the documents, they came up with a smoke screen play to use &quot;Guccifer 2.0/DC Leaks&quot; as a distraction/ Russian set up. It was so fucking laughable in real time as it was unfolding. &quot;Guccifer2.0&quot; started tweeting to Wikileaks in efforts to associate their made up smoke screen to Wikileaks. But Assange already had the goods. Wikileaks vetted all the files/emails and provided 100% watermarked proof. </p>

<p>The files from Guciffer were electronically modified and they don&#39;t even match the files released by Wikileaks. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny that you are trying to associate &quot;the 12 indictment&quot; propaganda play with Wikileaks. The 2 are completely different. Nice try thou!</p>
