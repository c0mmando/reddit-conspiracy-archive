       This is true.  The indictments of Russian intelligence officers are hilarious.  As if there will ever be a day in court.

       And it just doesnt matter.  An indictment happened yesterday.  The email scandal story has a nice bow on it and there is no further need to discuss.

       Will there ever be a day in court with witness, testimony and physical evidence/demonstrations of how their alleged 'hack' worked? Probably not which is exactly they went ahead with it,
      </p>
      <p>
       The word 'hack' is being over used, spear phishing or scam needs to be in the reports alot more. One of the first and old rules of internet computer/safety is? -don't click on unfamiliar stuff which is apparently what Podesta and DNC staff did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attempted hacks of election systems is the biggest worry but is exactly why every state should be able to determine it's own systems and policies because if everything was the same it's only one target that would have to be attacked by hackers, not 50.

       Of course theres no trial.  We completely agree.

       However there probably was no hack.  It was reported from the get go as a leak.  An insider leak.  Believe it or not, sometimes it can be something other than the Russians.

       This logic seems... Flawed. Yes, they would have 50 targets, but if even a few of those systems aren't up to par with the rest, that would be enough to tip the entire election.

       Stop your lying. The Podesta emails were spearsphished by the Russian.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For  example,  on  or  about  March  19,  2016,  LUKASHEV  and  his  co-conspirators created  and  sent  a  spearphishing  email  to  the  chairman  of  the  Clinton  Campaign.  LUKASHEV  used  the  account  “john356gh”  at  an  online  service  that  abbreviated lengthy  website  addresses  (referred  to  as  a  “URL-shortening  service”).  LUKASHEV used the account  to mask  a link  contained  in  the  spearphishing  email, which  directed  the  recipient  to  a  GRU-created  website.   LUKASHEV  altered  the appearance  of  the  sender  email  address  in  order  to  make  it  look  like  the  email  was a  security  notification  from  Google  (a  technique  known  as  “spoofing”),  instructing the  user  to  change  his  password  by  clicking  the  embedded  link.   Those  instructions were  followed.   On  or  about  March  21,  2016,  LUKASHEV,  YERMAKOV,  and their  co-conspirators  stole  the  contents  of  the  chairman’s  email  account,  which consisted  of  over  50,000  emails.

       It's pretty clear that Assange was asking for leaks from Guccifer 2.0, and got it, to help Trump​ by causing a riff between Hillary's and Sander's supporters during the DNC convention. That's again, Wikileak, Russia and Trump. It's amazing how these same players come up again and again and again and again for such innocent people!

       Weird because the entire guccifer2.0 website was created with harvard standard english. 
Yet guccifer2.0's texts were basically some script kitty russian whom spoke broken english.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its almost as if the real story was that the dnc released guccifer2.0 to do damage control on the alleged hack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we foia wordpress for the debit card used for the site because they dont offer whois protection to non paying users (to the best of my knowledge). So the americans that wrote guccifer2.0's site are apparently hiding in plain site, an no one is challenging this admission on the dnc's end.  They apparently feel more comfortable using materials produced by crowdstriker- /s

       You guys are either really desperate or really stupid. According to your theory, the DNC created Guccifer2.0, which then gave Assange the leaks to create havoc at their convention and caused a riff between Hillary's and Sander's supporters. That make complete sense!

       lol My TURN!

      <p>
       Gucciffer 2.0 (smoke screen) never gave the files to WL. Wikileaks had gotten their own set of files from a different source , a leaker (presumably Seth Rich). When the DNC/FBI found out about the leak and that Wikileaks was planning on releasing the documents, they came up with a smoke screen play to use "Guccifer 2.0/DC Leaks" as a distraction/ Russian set up. It was so fucking laughable in real time as it was unfolding. "Guccifer2.0" started tweeting to Wikileaks in efforts to associate their made up smoke screen to Wikileaks. But Assange already had the goods. Wikileaks vetted all the files/emails and provided 100% watermarked proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The files from Guciffer were electronically modified and they don't even match the files released by Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny that you are trying to associate "the 12 indictment" propaganda play with Wikileaks. The 2 are completely different. Nice try thou!

       I've been waiting for that for a year and half and so far nope, it's the kind of bullshit that claim Flynn is a good guy, Clinton and Podesta are going to jail, Trump​ Jr didn't meet with the Russian lawyer, Russians never employed a troll farm, Russians never hack the DNC, Trump​ never paid off a porn star during the campaign etc that turn out to be bullshit that they are. How many of Trump's people has pleaded guilty again? Sure, I'll wait for my world to "flip upside down" lol.

       Man, I hear the same things you just said from my family all the time. You have probably noticed that when you destroy them using sound logic and reason, and more importantly, facts, they quit babbling their talking points and just throw out insults. There really is no way to get any sort of truth through their skulls, they have been lied to by their leader for so long that truth is now opposite of what it actually means.

       Anyone who doubts that someone at the DNC created Guccifer 2.0 and DCleaks to pre-emptively discredit what they knew Wikileaks was going to publish, please read this article. New files were created with the software registration showing a DNC name, and just minutes later were edited with a Russian name. These files were then published by Guccifer 2.0, but were not included in the files Wikileaks published.

       Well, seeing as there is yet no evidence of that other than a few social media posts, I can and do wholeheartedly deny it.

       In any case, I actually do think that Russia has been meddling with America to some degree recently.  I also know for a fact that even if they have the degree absolutely pales compared to the amount of American interference in the Russian political process over the last few decades.

       The problem is, this Red Scare 2.0 thing is complete nonsense.  Sure, Russia probably meddled a bit, but no more than anybody reasonable would expect from any country that has an intelligence service.  Certainly far, far less than America has interfered with the Russian electoral process over the last 3 decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem arises when Blue Team is suddenly pushing for conflict with Russia because it serves their own political ends.  There is absolutely no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia.  There is no evidence that Russia acted in any unusual way toward America.  There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a massive propaganda campaign trying to drive America towards conflict with Russia.

       I can only sigh at such a response. I need to ask though, if the Russian thing is bullshit, even though people are in jail and many more are indicted with an investigation ramping up steam - what did you think of the 7 Benghazi hearings that turned up absolutely no evidence?

       You must not have followed the Benghazi hearings very closely.  They turned up lots of evidence that Hillary was negligent, but let her slide anyway.  I think they're the same as Mueller's investigation:  a farce.

       Gucciffer 2.0 (smoke screen) never gave the files to WL. Wikileaks had gotten their own set of files from a different source , a leaker (presumably Seth Rich). When the DNC/FBI found out about the leak and that Wikileaks was planning on releasing the documents, they came up with a smoke screen play to use "Guccifer 2.0/DC Leaks" as a distraction/ Russian set up. It was so fucking laughable in real time as it was unfolding. "Guccifer2.0" started tweeting to Wikileaks in efforts to associate their made up smoke screen to Wikileaks. But Assange already had the goods. Wikileaks vetted all the files/emails and provided 100% watermarked proof.

      <p>
       The files from Guciffer were electronically modified and they don't even match the files released by Wikileaks.

       It's funny that you are trying to associate "the 12 indictment" propaganda play with Wikileaks. The 2 are completely different. Nice try thou!

       Anyone who doubts that someone at the DNC created Guccifer 2.0 and DCleaks to pre-emptively discredit what they knew Wikileaks was going to publish, please read this article. New files were created with the software registration showing a DNC name, and just minutes later were edited with a Russian name. These files were then published by Guccifer 2.0, but were not included in the files Wikileaks published.
