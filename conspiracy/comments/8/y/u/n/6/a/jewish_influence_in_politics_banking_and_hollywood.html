       Do you think this is something to be concerned with? Less than 2% of the population in America control these industries.  Many of these people hold second citizenship in Isreal.  Isreal is an illegally made state and safe haven for criminals.

       Ok.  I think we are not gonna get anywhere if you think the Palestinian people prior to 1948 were out to murder all Jews.  Its funny that the people that survived the holocaust are the ones pushing for an ethnic state and created the worlds largest concentration camp in Gaza.  Its hard to not see that as ethnic cleansing, but the media has convinced most of us that Israel is the victim in all this.

       I clearly don't. That why I mentioned them being thrown off the roof: a reference to Hamas procedure on political opponents and dissidents.

       Ok.  Well the jewish population in Israel is in the low 70's currently while in the 40's it was in the high 20's.  So thats a pretty sharp rise.  I assume in France Germany and the US you are speaking of white european people being the majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       America was settled by Europeans who ethnically cleansed the Native people hundreds of years ago that is true.  We could point to other atrocities all day, but it doesnt change the fact that we are witnessing one.  America's population of white people hasnt just shot up within the last 100 years like Israel has.  It would be extremely troubling if it had.  Americas guilt doesnt clear any other country of any wrong doing.

       There wasn't an "Israel" in the 40s, so any increase is meteoric. It was a sparsely populated desert region before the Brits decided to dump Europe's guilt on a territory they owned, before the jews throughout the middle-east were expelled on the war of 1948+onwards, and before Father Time's and Mother Earth's sweet-sweet collusion that is natural population growth played out its game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Argue that it's shit, certainly, please. But argue it in good faith and in full knowledge of what this hot garbage fire is. If the Palestinians had taken a Gandhi-esque position on the matter, they'd've had their fucking nation way back in the 60s, fucking hell, probably even from the get-go during the partition talks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a Gandhi isn't what this is. A genocide isn't what this is. A Nazi-2: Electric Bogaloo neither.

       This is a low-grade conflict, with a majority party that consistently under-performs in regards to its capacity for violence, and a minority party that invariably sticks its fucking foot in its own mouth; in regards to actions that act a detriment to the supposed goal of getting its own nation.

       Your argument all rests on accepting that Britain owned this land because the league of nations which did not have a Palestinian voice decided it was right.  Because if you accept this, then you accept that this land was given to Israel legally to establish a Jewish state.  You can cuss up a storm and speak to me like I am an idiot all you like, but it doesnt do anything besides make you feel good.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to know exactly how the Palestinians could have saved the land they were born on, but you certainly dont know that for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your assertion that Palestine has won hearts and minds is arguable.  And irrelevant considering Israel has won legitimacy, the right to break international law, and all the military funding you could ask for from the US.

       They're being branded stomped-upon victims while literally, repeatedly, loudly, declaring their intent to drive the jews into the sea and the grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       They Palestinians have undeniably won the propaganda fight. If they had any actual intent for the state alone, whatsoever, they could argue a desire to put down the guns tomorrow and by the end of next year even the staunchest opponent would be hard-pressed to take the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       As is, the Israeli right - intent on forever refusing a Palestinian state -  is growing fatter and fatter upon the (rarest of all fucking rares!) a justified claim of an outer-enemy intent on its wholesale destruction; requiring only that they site the constant stream of Palestinian propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the Israelis have won from the US is thanks to sheer cynical geopolitics (and a fair bit of apocalyptic christian extremism), and whatever legitimacy they have stems from Britain's claim (which is more solid than a gross amount of other nation's claim to their soil) and defending the land despite numerous attempts at their wholesale destruction.

       I guess your still not getting what I am saying.  The entire debate on a two state solution or whatever solution you want to put out there is based upon an assumed right of the Jewish people to be able to confiscate land from other people based on the words in the bible.  While the Palestinians do as well, they were already there.  As you said, there was no Israel in 1948.  So imagine wherever you are from, lets call it Canada.  Lets say the united stated or England or whoever decides it is the birthright of the Mormans.  And a mormon state should be established.  Do you think you as a Canadian would have an issue with that?  Would you just allow it to happen or would you fight the Mormons tooth and nail for your country?  Lets say later negotiations were made so that the native Canadians could maintain some of their land.  However the pieces of land that the Canadians were given were did not connect geographically to each other and in order to travel to and from you would go thru Mormon checkpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would happen?  Wouldnt the Canadians start fighting back in every way they could?  Naturally the mormons would counter attack.  Also imagine the Mormons are backed by the United States with a with military aid package totalling 38 billion dollars over 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the Hamas argument, as most would classify it as a terrorist organization.  But groups like that gain popularity when a people are oppressed like the Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the arguments for Israel ignore that Israel is a colonial creation of the west.  And just because the west agrees it should be there doesnt mean it is just and legit.  And if you do not grant the state of Israel as legitimate then all of a sudden their actions are that of a terrorist organization.  We know this because Israel itself doesnt recognize Hamas (a democratically elected organization) as legitimate.

       For this argument I am just going to accept the official story for argument purposes because it helps to prove the hypocrisy of it all.

       Gotta be the shittest fucking genocide to have occurred on the entire god damn planet, when the Palestinian populace has quadrupled since the 40's and a single fucking month of the Syrian civil war killed more people that 65 years of the Israel-Palestine conflict (both sides - and various involved combatant nations - accounted for)

       It diesnt matter if its effective or not.  A genocide is defined as such: the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group.  Isreal has been seeking to destroy Palestine.  It doesn't matter what you think qualifies, its the action that matters here.  America has been fighting Isreals wars and paying for it economically and in blood.  BOTTOM LINE= NO DUAL CITIZANSHIP IN POLITICS,

       I hear what you're saying, but it's not a genocide or attempted genocide. The logic doesn't follow. Israel, if they wanted to, could genocide the Palestinians over the course of a couple days.

       If your really a critical thinker you'd realize they cant openly mow them down.

       They "defend" themselves against "attack".

       They show you one thing but actually do another.  (Typical Jews)

       Just because they have the capability to do it overnight doesnt mean they would get away with it.

       But if they slowly take land and create scenarios where they look to be on the defensive, they can create the image that they are the victims while achieving the goal.

       Thier actions fit the definition of genocide therefore I stand by my statement.  You saying it isn't a genocide because they could do it faster isn't an argument.

       There are some interesting stories about Hitler's rise to power during the early 1930s and the Warburg family. I seriously doubt that they financed Hitler knowing that he'd initiate the Holocaust, but instead made a

       That may have not been the plan from the start but it sure became the objective.  Btw I dont think the holohoax happened.

       Although I am sure it has been exaggerated, I don't doubt that the Holocaust occurred. The part that surprises me is that it has only happened once.

        consistently pushes a bill

       Punishable by up to $250,000 fine or 1 year in prison.  The bill itself breaks the first amdendment by making a peaceful protest a crime, but to do it so shamelessly in favor of your Heimish allies is disgusting.

      <p>
       And I'm just fucking sick of them calling pointing this shit they do out "antisemitic."  Fuck off.  You can't try to make boycotting Zion illegal and then claim you don't have a paranoid persecution complex.

       Exactly.  People have been duped into only listening to one side and,making a decision without looking into anything.  The programming is strong.

       Poor fucks have all probably died of old age or been thrown off roofs by this point; for actually wanting a Palestinian state, rather than just chasing the pipe-dream of murdering all the jews.
