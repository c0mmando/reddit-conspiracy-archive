    <div class="md"><p>“Favored” doesn’t even begin to come close to the measures that were taken to stifle the revolution. She would have lost Arizona if they hadn’t taken the election locations from 400 down to 60. They illegally wiped 200k off the voter roles in Brooklyn. Hell, I was provided a provisional ballot I didn’t ask for, and my signature on the request was from when I was in high school. They were getting wild variances from exit polling in many states, and what did they do to remedy the problem? Stop taking exit polls. The Bernie blackout was definitely a real thing, as confirmed by Ed Schultz, just weeks before his death. This is only a small list of so many criminal activities that occurred during the ‘16 Democratic primary.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no part of this comment which isn&#39;t bullshit.  </p>

<p>The DNC is a non-profit.  As such they are bound to their charter and bylaws.  Article V Section 4 of the DNC Charter clearly states:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 
the conduct and management of the affairs and procedures of the Democratic National Committee, 
particularly as they apply to the preparation and conduct of the Presidential nomination process, the 
Chairperson shall exercise impartiality and evenhandedness as between the Presidential candidates and 
campaigns. The Chairperson shall be responsible for ensuring that the national officers and staff of the 
Democratic National Committee maintain impartiality and evenhandedness during the Democratic Party 
Presidential nominating process. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That did not happen.  </p>

<p>What the DNC Charter does not clearly state is that a candidate has to raise money for Democrats.  That being said, Bernie did raise money for Democrats.  If the establishment wing hadn&#39;t been so busy trying to push the narrative that &quot;Bernie didn&#39;t raise money&quot; they could have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/sanders-democratic-fundraisers/index.html">nailed him on hypocrisy.</a>.  While it&#39;s true Bernie hasn&#39;t raised as much money for Democrats over his career as Hillary Clinton has, he raised far more than Barack Obama did when Obama decided to run, and nobody had a problem with how little Obama had fundraised for the party, even over Hillary Clinton in 2008.  </p>

<p>As for what legislation Bernie has passed, that&#39;s a demonstrable lie.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A Sanders amendment to the Victims Justice Act of 1995 required “offenders who are convicted of fraud and other white-collar crimes to give notice to victims and other persons in cases where there are multiple victims eligible to receive restitution.”</p></li>
<li><p>An amendment to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, making a change to the law that allowed grants to be made available to colleges and universities that cooperated to reduce costs through joint purchases of goods and services.</p></li>
<li><p>Sanders&#39; amendment to the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 2003 stopped the IRS from being able to use funds that “violate current pension age discrimination laws.” </p></li>
<li><p>One of Bernie&#39;s pet projects has long been community healthcare centers.  He got $100 million in funding for them in 2001 and $11 billion in funding for them through the ACA.  Those clinics provide healthcare to over 20 million Americans today.  Another thing Sanders got in the ACA was the ability for states to initiate pilot programs using ACA money to establish more comprehensive healthcare systems than the ACA was offering, as well as 1.5 billion for scholarships and loan repayment for doctors and nurses who work in underserved communities.  He also worked to rally other far left members of Congress who were turned off to the ACA after the public option was removed.  Here&#39;s <a href="https://youtu.be/zlvxDJt-k1o">Harry Reid talking about how Sanders was instrumental in getting the ACA passed</a></p></li>
<li><p>In 2004, Sanders won a $22 million increase for the low-income home energy assistance program and related weatherization assistance program, doubling the size of the program.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2005, A Sanders amendment successfully prohibited the Export-Import Bank from providing loans for nuclear projects in China.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2008, A Sanders amendment made a change to the law so at least 30 percent of the hot water demand in newer federal buildings is provided through solar water heaters.</p></li>
<li><p>Sanders used an amendment in 2008 to win $10 million for operation and maintenance of the Army National Guard.</p></li>
<li><p>A Sanders amendment to the bank bailout in 2009 ensured bailout funds weren&#39;t used to displace American workers.</p></li>
<li><p>A Sanders amendment in 2012 required “public availability of the database of senior Department officials seeking employment with defense contractors” which increased transparency within the military-industrial complex.</p></li>
<li><p>Sanders worked to help the military&#39;s healthcare system (Tricare) treat autism.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>His amendments over the years have increased funding for meals on wheels, prohibited U.S. funds from being used to import goods manufactured with child labor.  There&#39;s plenty more.  There&#39;s a reason the dude was called the &quot;Amendment king.&quot;</p>

<p>If those constitute &quot;hasn&#39;t really passed any legislation,&quot; are you not setting the bar a tad high? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know Hillary Clinton passed 3 laws in her time as a Senator?  One to name a historic site, one to name a freeway, and one to name a post office.  You don&#39;t have to be a Patrick Leahy writer of bills in order to be a good Senator.  Some, like Clinton, were excellent at retail politics and achieving consensus.  That was how she made her mark.  Good for her.  Some Senators go through the amendment process.  And for you to minimize Community Healthcare Clinics who service 20 million Americans today as anything less than an amazing achievement is simply hatin&#39;.</p>

<p>And if Ctrl-F my username in this post, you&#39;ll find a comment of mine talking about how to whatever degree the DNC can be held accountable, they have been.  I&#39;m not lamenting over Bernie.  I&#39;m all about moving on, with exceptions for people who want to straight up lie about him and distort his record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They both have long political careers, Clinton arguably has more useful experience being a governor, senator and secretary of state. Being first lady isn&#39;t bad experience either. I wasnt saying Bernie has never done nothing for anyone, just he&#39;s never been a big backer for the DNC. That&#39;s fine, that&#39;s not his shtick, I wanted him to win but he ended up losing by over 3 million votes. In a primary that is not even close </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one, Hillary Clinton was never a Governor.  For one, I don&#39;t rate &quot;experience&quot; solely as the number of jobs someone has had.  Nobody had more different prior jobs before becoming President than George H.W. Bush, and ask this sub on any day how they feel about him.  I&#39;m not denying that Bernie hasn&#39;t been a big backer for the DNC.  Overall, he was below average, but not bottom-of-the-barrell at that in his Congressional career.  Again though, Bernie had done far more for the party at the time he decided to run than Barack Obama had when Obama decided to run.  It didn&#39;t matter then.  It didn&#39;t matter when Bill Clinton ran.  The whole narrative that being a prolific party fundraiser is a valid qualification for the Presidential nomination wasn&#39;t a thing before 2016, when it could be used to help Hillary over Bernie.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t blame the whole of Bernie&#39;s defeat on the DNC shenanigans.  I&#39;d say it was like the 4th, maybe 5th biggest reason Sanders lost, but it was a factor.  I actually think, it&#39;s become a bit too much of a scapegoat for progressives, as it&#39;s something out of control, and has pulled too much focus away from factors within our control, which were more responsible for Bernie&#39;s defeat, like minority outreach.  </p>

<p>That being said, it&#39;s not a terrible thing to say that what the content of the e-mails showed doesn&#39;t not represent the values of what we want for the Democratic Party, that the people responsible for it have been replaced, we&#39;re currently working on steps to make sure it never happens again, however, we haven&#39;t held the bastards who attacked the DNC accountable yet, and the content of the emails doesn&#39;t excuse their criminal acts.  And the funny thing is, ALL OF THAT IS TRUE!  You don&#39;t have to defend the DNC on this, unless you want to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was wrong on that part, my bad. I actually agree with pretty much everything you&#39;re saying. I&#39;m more drilling down on your point of it might be the 4th or 5th reason in the list of why he didn&#39;t win. I&#39;m more confused by what progressives want to do about the 2016 primary at this point and more importantly in the future if a progressive candidate loses a primary are they going to not vote or vote 3rd party again? They need to fight for progressives but vote strategically when they don&#39;t get the exact candidate they want or else the GOP will keep steam rolling them in elections and keep stacking courts </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As for reasons why I think Bernie didn&#39;t win.  </p>

<ol>
<li> minority outreach<br/></li>
<li> Didn&#39;t start making headway on the very strong &quot;inevitability&quot; narrative and &quot;electibility&quot; narrative until too late in the primary process.<br/></li>
<li> Too many supporters who didn&#39;t know the difference between a &quot;protest movement&quot; and a &quot;political movement.&quot;<br/></li>
<li> Hillary&#39;s organization, her political machine, was far superior.<br/></li>
<li> DNC bullshit.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>As for what progressives want to do about the 2016 primary at this point, most, are slowly putting it behind them, and at least tentatively going down the &quot;work from the inside&quot; plan.  That&#39;s a good thing.  There were times during the primary where I legitimately thought an actual split might happen.  As for the future, a lot of that is also bullshit to beat up progressives with.  Sanders supporters voted 85% for Hillary Clinton in the election.  That&#39;s an extremely high percentage for a demographic of millions.  It was higher than the number of 2008 Hillary primary supporters who supported Obama in the general.  It was a higher percentage than Hillary in 2016 earned of the LGBT vote (77%).  It was a much higher percentage than Hillary earned of the women vote.  Donald Trump flat-out won the white women vote.  Who in the Hillary Clinton campaign is responsible for appealing to the white women vote?  s/  Hell, Hillary didn&#39;t earn 85% of the vote from people who thought Trump was unqualified to serve as President.</p>
