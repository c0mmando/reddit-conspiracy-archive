    <div class="md"><p>Doesn’t seem like Wikileaks is mentioned in that article. No other organization has a track record as clean as Wikileaks so I don’t really trust the smoking gun or daily beast or DC leaks. If someone has the data, why haven’t they released it? Also check out the CIA’s group remote development  branch, Umbrage. They have an archive of hacking exploits that have been confiscated over the years and this allows them to leave a digital fingerprint of whoever they want. Even Russia. Not only that, but they left the “door” unlocked and for a while, those tools were available to whoever had the means to make copies. So it might not be Democrats pretending to be Russians to do whatever, it might not be trump, it might not even be the Russians. It could be some rich hacker asshole who wants to fuck it all up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikileaks is implicated in today&#39;s indictments, not directly but there&#39;s lots of reason to believe they are Org 1. We know the RNC was hacked and someone has that data, possibly for black mail (pro Russian platform apart of the gop for example).
