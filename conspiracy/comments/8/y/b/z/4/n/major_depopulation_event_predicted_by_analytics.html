    <div class="md"><p>Below that chart is a longish section of text, which -- appropriately, some might think -- is entirely in purple.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the key chunk about why Deagel thinks the US and UK will go through drastic depopulation (it&#39;s mainly about the US):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The key element to understand the process [of Deagel&#39;s predicted depopulation] that the USA will enter in the upcoming decade is migration. In the past, specially in the 20th century, the key factor that allowed the USA to rise to its colossus status was immigration with the benefits of a demographic expansion supporting the credit expansion and the brain drain from the rest of the world benefiting the States. <strong>The collapse of the Western financial system will wipe out the standard of living of its population while ending ponzi schemes such as the stock exchange and the pension funds.</strong> The population will be hit so badly by a full array of bubbles and ponzi schemes that the migration engine will start to work in reverse accelerating itself due to ripple effects thus leading to the demise of the States. This unseen situation for the States will develop itself in a cascade pattern with unprecedented and devastating effects for the economy. Jobs offshoring will surely end with many American Corporations relocating overseas thus becoming foreign Corporations!!!! We see a significant part of the American population migrating to Latin America and Asia while migration to Europe - suffering a similar illness - won&#39;t be relevant. Nevertheless the death toll will be horrible. Take into account that the Soviet Union&#39;s population was poorer than the Americans nowadays or even then. The ex-Soviets suffered during the following struggle in the 1990s with a significant death toll and the loss of national pride. Might we say &quot;Twice the pride, double the fall&quot;? Nope. The American standard of living is one of the highest, far more than double of the Soviets while having added a services economy that will be gone along with the financial system. When pensioners see their retirement disappear in front of their eyes and there are no servicing jobs you can imagine what is going to happen next. At least younger people can migrate. Never in human history were so many elders among the population. In past centuries people were lucky to get to their 30s or 40s. The American downfall is set to be far worse than the Soviet Union&#39;s one. A confluence of crisis with a devastating result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How seriously do we take this? My own answer is that the prediction of coming economic catastrophe has been around a few years now, and might well come true. If it does, then western economies are in a bad position to weather it out. It could be ugly.</p>

<p>But would that catastrophe necessarily entail all the outcomes Deagel is prophesying, or even enough of them for Deagel&#39;s drastic scenario to be fulfilled? I think that&#39;s stretching it beyond any definition of the word &quot;reasonable.&quot; </p>

<p>YMMV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a ponzi scheme in any sense. What you are saying is that if people stop investing, the stock market will tank. Well, duh.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at a real-world stock market. London&#39;s stock exchange was founded over 550 years ago, and has never entered a debilitating deflationary spiral. </p>

<p>Perhaps Britain -- and indeed the entire planet, several times over, by my estimations -- has been miraculously lucky not to have run out of ever-expanding amounts of money to pump into the stock market to keep it afloat over the last half-a-millennium. </p>

<p>Or perhaps you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave the question open, for readers to ponder.</p>

<p>I think you are confusing investment (which seeks a yield, i.e. some return) with speculation (which typically relies on leverage, and seeks capital gain).</p>

<p>If people &quot;stopped investing&quot; (buying stocks), but didn&#39;t sell their stocks, the market shouldn&#39;t tank. Your comparison with walmart is completely wrong; do you understand the nature of the stock market? Its purpose is to allow companies to <em>raise capital investment</em> (not generate revenue).</p>

<p>The issue is not <em>people</em> (investors), it is <em>leverage</em>, i.e. the fake/fraudulent credit money managed by the politburo (the central bank). Every bubble in the era of fiat money is driven by <em>credit expansion</em>. If the credit dries up, the market tanks; in other words, it requires ever-expanding money supply (additional credit could be compared to &quot;new investors&quot;, to apply the term <em>ponzi scheme</em>).</p>

<p>The British stock market had several deflationary episodes - most famously in 1929. The komissars were always able to re-inflate it however; but it is an exercise of diminishing returns, as the sterling is being gradually debased with every new instance.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s something we&#39;ll probably agree on: the market in aggregate will never tank to zero, even if the money is destroyed. Indeed there are real, productive companies listed, which represent a hedge against inflation almost as much as precious metals.</p>

<p>This seems like an understatement.  There are probably a hundred million Asians who would migrate to the US if given the appropriate opportunity.  Not to mention another thirty million Hispanics.  The idea of the US suffering a precipitous population decline in any economic collapse is crazy talk.  If anything, the population could double.</p>

<p>Exactly. It reads like the kind of drivel found on ZeroHedge, predictions about impending doom that are proven wrong time and again. The use of the loaded term ponzi scheme in this context, is what made me sure that Deagel is written by some angsty autist sitting in his mother&#39;s basement. And his immature use of exclamation marks didn&#39;t give him more credibility, to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That has current world population at 7.4 billion and predicts that in 2025 it will be down 6.9 billion. Thatâ€™s about 500,000,000 people left. But it only predicts the US losing about 100 million (about 1/3 or its current population) so 2/5 of the surviving population would be in the US. Also, 500M is the population figure advised in the Georgia Guidestones which were erected in 1980 when the population was already almost 10x that. Maybe the Georgia Guidestones were erected by a time traveler who knew what was going to happen and wanted to set some guidelines to follow after the catastrophe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>U.S. government uses occult black magic, figured out that our reality is neither material or spiritual in essence, but actually is more akin to a dreamlike state. </p>

<p>Of course, being in bed with dark entities and using magic then also leads to the use of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; to derive a &quot;formula&quot; for simulating/creating dreams.</p>

<p>Your dreams - those you get while you are asleep - actually are just rudimentary dream fragments/micro simulations of the meta-dream that is our total reality --&gt; easy for artificial intelligence to predict the outcomes of the formula, when it can control most variables that lie outside of normal human perception for placement of memetic fragments within our semiotic technosphere (e.g. internet or offline print products).</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence can predict/control hidden properties of sign systems, namely intention and its hidden sub-property we could call &quot;Interung&quot; (no real translation into English available for that term, remember language controls your reality and our human reality is at its descriptive core modeled for 30th century German speakers somehow - it is all very strange).</p>

<p>Also, when I was a kid 20 yrs ago we were at the &#39;peak&#39; of it (atomic war threat was just recently waned, ozone depletion, global warming, peak oil and resource wars for water, etc)</p>

<p>People love to look at the current state of things but forget the past.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you all for your comments and insights! The event that got me curious to go back and research this topic again are the mysterious &quot;heavenly trumpet&quot; sounds from the past few years, which I did not realize was so far reaching and accounted for globally! </p>

<p>Rasied Catholic, I&#39;ve always had faith, but recently I&#39;ve begun to have doubt due to all the church corruption going on, in addition to all the corruption and hedonism surrounding us today (ie. PG). Researching these videos had affirmed my belief in God and led me to brush up on Revelations. Please please check them out and let me know what your thoughts are!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a recent prophecy video mention a phrase in Revelation -- &quot;the weapon of indignation&quot;.  The video mentioned Gog/Russia striking North America with a continent wide EMP.  Revelation mentions Babylon falling in a week/hour, and the nations bemoaning the loss of her and her commerce.  A week is, supposedly, how long a continent wide EMP would take to *** kill/doom 90% of America ***  if everything went dark for good, electronically.  It even connected the statue of liberty with the &#39;whore that sits upon many waters/whore of Babylon&#39; because the greek goddess Libertas, which the statue represents, was a sect that practiced temple prostitution.  Unfortunately, the video was to monetize prepper advice, yet I was dumbstruck at the interpretations it used, and had to wonder how the video creator came upon them.  Decades of eschatolgical prophetic curiosity, and I have never encounteted anything quite like it.</p>

<p>thank you so much for your insightful input. I actually came across that exact verse in Revelations earlier and recall reading about the Skull and Bones society and how George H. W. Bush&#39;s nick name was &quot;Magog&quot; (wiki) so I can definitely see what you mean. I googled &quot;weapon of indignation&quot; and the first result led me to this:</p>

<p><a href="https://lewis1946.wordpress.com/2015/05/21/6413/">https://lewis1946.wordpress.com/2015/05/21/6413/</a></p>

<p>which sounds almost verbatim to what you&#39;re inferring too. Long article, still reading but quite intriguing thus far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting article. I agree with most of the information in regards to Babylon, the US and the origins of the Statue of Liberty, but feel linking Russia to Gog is a bit of a stretch. I&#39;ve never really read anything linking those two together and get the impression that the article intentionally puts Russia in a bad light. Coupled with all of the election hacking news, etc. it comes off as an attempt to push a narrative IMHO. When googling &quot; the weapon of indignation&quot; the first 5 articles refer to the same type of theory, but the RUSSIA/EMP in the headlines seems way too sensationalized.</p>

<p>Yup, first saw a post about that a year or two ago.  So when I saw your post about it, I wanted to share what I heard about the EMP thing from that video.</p>
