       It's funny because even with their coordinated infestation backed by government money they STILL fail at their astroturfing. But I guess they're so genius we just can't understand their infallible strawmen arguments.

       Do you know how many videos like that there are? Countless, and many more every day. And just because a video is reported doesn't mean it should be taken down. They have to evaluate each video to see if it violates their terms. It's easy for copyright infringement because that can be automated. The other stuff, not so much.

       But these aren't Spiderman miniseries. There is a big difference here, and it's one that the fair use doctrine covers. There is no mistaking these for official Spiderman media, and the only thing linking them to copyrighted material is the costume. Why do you think parody porn is allowed to exist?

       Right, but it's much harder to detect that algorithmically. They need a human to evaluate it, and that's a problem at scale.

       The pizzagate stuff never made sense to me, but I just now did a search just for "spiderman elsa" on YouTube and a ton of creepy videos were there. Not just the lower results either, these videos are on the first page, including one that's labelled, "Spiderman kiss Elsa no clothes." Sick.

       Yeahh the rabbit hole is deep, sadly. Injections, scat, suicide, drinking, murder, sexual assault, stalking are just some of the wonderful (/s) topics taught to young children by Disney and Marvel characters. You'd think Disney would care? You'd think Marvel would care? You'd think YouTube would care? Nah. It's been years and it won't stop. I've seen it in the wild, the finger family song in real life with a child watching was scary.
      </p>

       Some say it's MKUltra, some say it's an ARG (augmented reality game) but at the end of the day this is turning the youth of the world into intellectual zombies. Or worse.

       Last I heard about Disney is that they gave up pursuing copyright infringement for the most part. They used to be very aggressive, but now they are so big the legal fees for going after small-time uses of their licensed material is not worth it.

       My hunch is that it has something to do with desensitizing kids for some reason, but that's just speculation, and it's beyond me why anyone would want that.

       Hey guys! The pizza club is also known as the Triple Crown - that is, the Queen of England, the Roman Catholic Pope, and the President of the United States of America. They organize and bank-roll basically every other principality on the planet through a combination of threats, intimidation, coercion, blackmail in the form of covert "black" and undocumented operations using public and laundered corporate funds. They've got their tentacles in everything, and basically we are completely outmatched here. Not only are they highly capable, but they're soulless, dead, psychopaths completely without remorse. They are like The Terminator.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have made a religion out of becoming as totally spiritually and emotionally dead as possible, while feeding the liberated energy into the mechanical or "reptilian", calculating parts of their brains. They have a spiritual science they have developed for this purpose which masquerades as a "quest for enlightenment" at the lower levels for the purpose of identifying promising candidates, but then gradually reveals the goal of becoming as evil, hateful, remorseless, and violent as possible. They have spiritual role models in the form of disembodied demons whom they worship and attempt to create "vessels" for through ingenious methods of abuse, torture, and "education".
      </p>
      <p>
       Their main weapon is exploiting parents' need to protect their own children first. Anyone who overstepped in a big way would be putting not only their own lives at risk, but their children's. They will frame you, lie about you, take your kids, abuse and probably murder them. And since they specialize in obfuscating their operations, and since they control all of the official channels which might be able to investigate them, they will always get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the reality we share. The only "enlightenment" you need is waking up to that reality and becoming both able to accept it and willing to fight it. How do we fight it? By developing compassion. Compassion is basically like penicillin for demons. It is completely foreign to them and will short out their logic circuits, because unconditional love is not logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trying to work from within the system will not be effective at all. Anything you do from any sort of "legal" perspective is only feeding them. Just do the minimum that you need to do to survive, and then work on compassion. Compassion means educating yourself so that they can help to educate others. Compassion means not expecting rewards or looking for vengeance. There will never be any vengeance. What these psychopaths have done to their souls to be capable of this is its own punishment, and will have eternal consequences. You don't kill a tree by starting at the top. You start from the roots.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are completely outmatched in logistical terms. And probably, this planet will fall to them. Earth will become a hell, both physically and in the spiritual mirror, which is ruled by these psychopathic demons. By developing compassion and cutting the umbilicus which connects us to these demons, we can enable ourselves to adapt better to the spiritual world which will be coming after our deaths. This will limit our need to associate with the spiritual mirror version of Earth on the other side and help us in migrating to new worlds which are not poisoned by these psychopaths. Those who have given themselves over entirely to the "reptilian" analytical/logical mind will not be able to navigate that world in the same way, because they are not capable of intuition and empathy, which are the means of navigation in the spiritual world, and they will be stuck in the mirror-hell created by the death of this planet for eons to come. Don't get stuck here with them.

       This is doubleplus ungood. Regardless of your thoughts on PG it's important to hear both sides of an argument, and while I don't 100% agree with everything presented in that vid, it's probably the most (most) unbiased video on the subject that provides a good overview.

       Similar to Ken Ham spewing utter nonsense about creation. The truly gullible are open to his chicanery but the vast majority of a general audience knows it's all complete bullshit with zero proof and can lead to dangerously regressive actions.

       I was never a Trump man but I definitely didn't like Hillary either, but I'm leaning towards the idea that the original PG theory was nothing more than another attack vector in the theorized Russian plans to get Trump into power, DNC manipulation to kill Bernie's chances, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       tbh, I think that's
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more plausible than an evil sex dungeon for underage childrern in the basement of a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       public place.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, sexual deviants among the rich and powerful are definitely a problem, glad to see that at least the shit in Hollywood is finally being accepted as a fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, I doubt that Hilary is an evil pedomonster bathing in the blood of underage children, though.

       Because that is the original theory, Comet fucking Ping Pong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not my fault its proponents when faced with a lack of proof, realized that it's fucking retarded, so they expanded it to include pretty much every sex offence involving minors and people with influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's mildly infuriating to see actual proven instances of sexual delinquency in Hollywood or government tagged as 'Pizzagate',  connecting nonexistent  dots like that just makes the whole look even flimsier, and doesn't help at all.

       Oh sorry, man. I was moreso referring to the seeming groupthink that seems to permeate this sub regarding this topic. And yes, i,m aware that many here
       <em>

       agree with it all, but those aren't the folks you see upvoted to the top, not by any means. Speaking out against PG (or that cesspool of blatant racism disguised as "freedom" Voat.co) seems to equal autodownvote here, or very controversial at the least.

       There are no "weird code words" in the Podesta emails. Someone on 4chan just made up a list of alternate meanings for common words and then told people to search Wikileaks for them. If he'd said "pizza" was code for "heroin" instead of "girl", the conspiracy theory would have all been about the Podesta drug ring. Give me access to your social media and hundreds of your emails and I could come up with a list of bullshit code words too.

       what does a "handkerchief with a pizza related map" mean to you? They are clearly speaking in some sort of code. I don't claim to know what the code words mean, I hope it's just drugs or something.

       That's just part of it. And I was discussing it with people a lot when it broke, and nobody (but shills probably) was talking about a basement dungeon. It was about the videos and the creepy instagram shit, combined with the Luzatto stuff, Podesta emails, spirit cooking, etc.

       It was a major part of it. That's why there was so much discussion claiming Alefantis had lied about there not being a basement under Comet Ping Pong (he didn't). People were constantly claiming that an Instagram image showing them digging what looked like trenches for utility piping was actually related to secret tunnels from CPP's secret basement where they were hiding children and transporting them across DC. If you really missed all that discussion about the basement, then you can't have been following it that closely. Some dickheads even posted a video on Youtube of them hanging around outside Comet Ping Pong and Besta Pizza, which then cut to them near a building down the road. They claimed that they sneaked into Besta and went through a secret tunnel, which took them down the road, but of course they didn't bother to film this non-existent secret tunnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I followed the discussions on reddit, Youtube, and Voat, and as u/stephen_1975 said that was the original theory. But when no evidence turned up, no victims, no witnesses, and no complainants,  and after douches like David Seaman proved to be full of shit that people started renaming the theory "pedogate" and widening it to include any child abuse case they could. Anyone else remember Seaman asserting in early 2017 that dozens of the Washington elite would be arrrested within a fortnight and that, if they weren't he'd name his supposed secret FBI informant? Of course, the arrests never happened, and Seaman never named his made-up source. (He weasled out of it by claiming that the arrest of Jerry Sandusky's son vindicated his prediction.)

       Yeah, I mean it was a nice try, definitely hooked quite a few people, but for me, anyway, it was just
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       too sensational and mustache-twirling comic-book evil. Real life tends to be much more banal/subtle, the conspiracies
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       there of course, but they tend to involve how events are spun and subsequently profited from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like 9/11. I personally believe that yes, planes did hit the WTC, with so many
       <em>
        thousands
       </em>
       of witnesses and footage of the 2nd plane and stuff, it's kinda hard to dispute, in my opinion. The real conspiracy is in
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       it happened and
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       those events were spun and used to justify all sorts of shenanigans after the fact. But did a bunch of pissed-off extremists actually fly planes into the towers and kill thousands? Yup. All the shit about thermite and jet fuel and stuff is just muddying of the waters to distract and misdirect from the truth and discredit those who question the narrative.

       The internet is a medium that allows for a "huge" amount of communication between individuals. "Good" individuals and "bad" individuals; good" information and "bad" information.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have always been able to communicate their ideas and opinions to others, whether verbally or in writing, and then, as now, the onus is on those who hear, see or read to use their discernment in embracing or rejecting said ideas/ opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that has changed is the ease of access -- TO ALL INFORMATION. The responsibility of discretion has not changed, nor should it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who would YOU appoint as the ultimate arbiter of what is "good" or "bad"? Of what is or is not fit for public visibility?
      </p>
      <p>
       What specific forms of speech/ information should be suppressed/ censored?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hate Speech"? Bad advice? "Wrong" religious ideas? Porn?  "Conspiracy theories"? Anything that might possibly "offend" someone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Make an exhaustive list for us, won't you?

       I read the fine print on my kids vaccines administered on an Army base, and they listed trace amounts of thimerosal. My family still got vaccinated, but mercury is still being added to vaccines. If you can't get that right, your credibility is blown.

       Reduced means "less". But extremists like you are pushing middle ground people like me into a tough spot. You're smart enough to know what reduced means. Now try to meet me in the middle where reason exists.

       I disagree. "Conjecture and bullshit" aren't the other side. They're arguing apples and oranges.

       If you say to me, "The sky is blue" and I say, "I think it's purple, based on these drawings that I think represent the idea of a purple sky" and other such nonsense--it's not "listening to the other side", IMO, to give credence to the ideas that are pure conjecture or bullshit.

       But I still learned where that person is coming from so I know what to say if it comes up again. Then the conversation can be steered some other way where it doesn’t have to be negative. I know what not to talk about with certain people. But if I do want to bring that certain topic up, I know how to do it without seeming like I know better or making that person feel stupid.

       You calling it nonsense brings up the most important part of this discussion. You only know what you are taught to know. By limiting the transfer of knowledge to that which is authoritative, you may be limiting the truth. How do you know what is just conjecture?
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't that long ago that astronomers were estimating that the number of stars were in the millions. We now know that the number of
       <em>
        galaxies
       </em>
       is over
       <em>
        100 billion.
       </em>
       Would it just be conjecture if someone 100 years ago suggested that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can hardly believe the Orwellian nature of some of the responses in this thread. "We must limit the transfer of information because fragile minds can't determine for themselves what is real." But what is real?

       Sure ya do. Have you posted any content to this sub, or sny creative thoughts of your own? Nope, you’re just a freeloader who has been programmed to react like you do when someone says something unapproved by TPTB. Pathetic and weak...

       Oh and Jesus really was a strong and honorable Aryan, which is why the evil, Satanic Jews had him killed. He was described as having hair more golden than his mother’s, with soft, blue eyes. I realize that you are brainwashed so you will not be able to except the truth but that doesn’t make it any less true.

       It is up to the reader/viewer to read/watch with a critical mindset. Your argument is basically "but people are dumb and can't discern bullshit!". Does that justify censorship? Banning steaks because the child cannot chew.

       It is not up to anyone to "allow" any arguments. The man preaching armageddon on the street corner has a right to be there, and you have a right to ignore him, listen to him, agree with him, or shout your counter arguments. You don't have the right to shut him up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you're transferring responsibility. We have the responsibility to criticize and test everything we listen to, but we are not responsible for others who choose not to do so. We are not our brother's keepers when it comes to ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is dangerous that people choose not to listen critically. Work on fixing that problem, and the entire issue of disinformation becomes a moot point. Denying people the chance to do so is the realm of dictators.

       libel/defamation is still against the law even if it's on the internet and youtube has a very clear policy on defamatory videos.  i know people are surprised that you can't just go around telling everyone that so and so rapes and murders kids, but we have laws against that sort of thing for a reason.

       They are not simply cracking down on libel / defamation.  There is a clear political bias to YouTube and it is very mainstream leftist.  A lot of libelous crap can be put up just so long as it falls in line with what is popular

       I'll try, but I would recommend you don't bother with it. It started with a handful of alt-right tweets, specifically from Britney Pettibone and Mike Cernovich, suggesting that a pizzashop owner in D.C. was abusing and abducting kids based on some fairly creepy images from his Instagram account. Then /pol/ on 4chan got ahold of it, and these slang terms and "codes" came out that related to child abuse, along with a series of symbols used by the FBI that are codes for pedophiles, those symbols appear to be real, but  pizzagate people started seeing them everywhere they looked, from restaurant signs to ice cream labels (as if the entire world was just broadcasting child abuse). The D.N.C. emails were leaked around that time that included some either vague or possibly coded language that "pizzagate researchers" were combing through to try and tie Democratic party officials to child abuse via this pizza restaurant. This was all happening at the height of the 2016 presidential election, and somehow involved the most prominent members of the Democratic party, including Hillary Clinton, and her campaign chief John Podesta, but oddly enough, no Republicans were implicated, and somehow the idea that this could all be political mudslinging on the part of Trump supporters is lost in the interpretation of people who think this theory is real. The pizzagate subreddit got shut down because people were being doxxed, and harassed IRL. The theory kept spreading, and eventually someone was so inflamed by this nonsense that they went into the pizzashop looking for the non-existent child dungeon, and fired an AR. In the next few months the story was pushed with virtually no developments or evidence, mostly on YouTube and Voat, and most notably by a guy named David Seaman, who would try to sell gold coins at the end of his videos. When it turned out that no victims emerged, and no evidence of wrongdoing was made clear, most people saw this for what it was and moved on. A committed core of people wouldn't let it go, and changed the scope of their "investigation" to include: all cases of child abuse in history, and the entire globe, and rebranded their campaign from pizzagate to "pedogate."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There are some interesting aspects, but they don't add up to much:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently the guy who went to the pizza restaurant fired a single shot through a door into a computer hard drive. This is legitimately strange
      </p>
      <p>
       The emails do contain strange phrases and possible coded language. This is worth skimming because it is a bit odd, but there's no context for most of it and it's open to interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The things working against the theory are obvious to a lot of people, but discounted by the really committed believers:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no victims ever linked to the original allegations about the pizza shop. None named, none alleged.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory is almost entirely partisan, the oroginal accusations were made by the political opponents of the Democrats, and all of the early "evidence" came from those same people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goalposts have shifted so far that there are no more goalposts. After awhile with no developments in the theory that the democratic leadership is involved, the more committed believers started dredging up child abuse cases from the 80's and 90's, many of them very real and incredibly disturbing, and attempted to put it all under the "pizzagate" label.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't seem to care much about the recent trend of kids getting locked up in blacked out Walmarts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more you look into it, the more ridiculous the claims get. Pizzagaters tried to suggest that the Podesta brothers were the murderers in the high profile Madeline McCane case, that all involved are literal satanists who take a drug from the human adrenaline gland, that Obama smuggled children into the whitehouse to abuse, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are a lot of people who believe this on the sub, go ahead and downvote me. I've seen the same things you have, and these are my conclusions, if I got something wrong feel free to correct me.

       There were two conflicting answers from two different people in two different departments of DC police. It doesn't look to me like deliberate lying, just a poorly worded response from the communications officer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagater Brian Rich asked DC Police why Wikipedia had them saying pizzagate was false. DC Police PR replied, pointing to a press release saying there was no ongoing investigation into the false allegations about Comet Ping Pong. Rich asked them how they could say they were false without an investigation and DC Police PR replied "After investigating those claims, we have determined those allegations to be false." Rich then filed a FOIA request to see the case files. Another member of DC Police (an FOIA officer) replied saying that they "did not conduct an investigation regarding alleged pedophile ring at the Comet Ping pong restaurant" and so there were no files.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the PR officer did say "After investigating those claims" but they probably just meant that someone had briefly looked at the conspiracy theory and determined that it was rubbish. Officers had gone to Comet Ping Pong and talked to James Alefantis and had likely seen that there was no hidden basement and tunnels and that nothing was going on there.

       This is a great answer but I would dispute two parts of it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Apparently the guy who went to the pizza restaurant fired a single shot through a door into a computer hard drive.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to court documents, Welch fired several shots within CPP. Welch was looking for the non-existent basement and tunnels and so he tried to shoot open a locked door (but failed). As far as I'm aware, the server was behind this door. It's not that strange for a bullet to pass through a door and hit what was behind it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The emails do contain strange phrases and possible coded language.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have read the emails and I've found nothing strange and nothing that anybody with an average knowledge of conversational English wouldn't understand. There's certainly no reason to suppose there's any code there.

       Even if you're right, it's still bad content for kids to be exposed to. They could make up characters and it would be just as bad.

       Don't break the rules, you won't have your shit removed, and you can share any opinion you want. It's really that simple.

       Unless you've got an example of a mod removing something simply for the ideas, and didn't break any rules, in which case I'd be very interested in seeing that.

       But it is also up to society what arguements we even allow. You dont see a problem with the greatest tool society has ever had can also be are greatest enemy and be a source of disinformation

       I wish this wasn't so bc now I have to sift through pages of muck in greatawakening and sites like GLP to find anything of quality. ZH is hit n miss, but I feel like I've reached the end of the internet aside from a few podcasts/YT channels.
