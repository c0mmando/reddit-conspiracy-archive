       Seriously, we're talking about a 79-year-old overweight smoker with an insanely high-stress job who had half a dozen chronic conditions, any of which could have caused his natural death. He also wasn't wearing his CPAP mask when he was found, meaning he could have suffocated due to sleep apnea.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the evidence for his "murder" is...what? That he had part of a pillow case over his eyes? Some dopey email from John Podesta?
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that we all love a good conspiracy, but this isn't one.

       No, but there are legitimate reasons as to why a family wouldn't want an autopsy done. They weren't thinking as the family of a SCOTUS justice, they were thinking as the family of a man they loved who died.

       Well, then that is why nobody did an autopsy. It wasn't considered an unexpected death with extenuating circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people die suddenly in hotel rooms with pillows over their faces, the police don't rule out homicide so quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, not usually, anyway.
      </p>

       The news is literally filled with investigations into cause of death of normal, everyday people found dead.

       Scalia didn't have a pillow over his face. And again, you'd think that if his family or the US Marshal's thought he'd been murdered, they would have, you know, done something about it.

       The family requested no autopsy iirc. Or something peculiar in that county meant they didn't require an autopsy. It came up at the time I recall that.

       Fair point, though I do think it’s hard to distinguish those separate parts from the outside given how much is going on behind closed doors. Regardless of factions though Scalia was a longtime supporter of oligarchy in general.

       Can you now clarify what did Bill &amp; Loretta discussed on that plane: was it their grandchildren's instagram feeds or lobster recipes? The doubt still nags me.

       Right?  I mean, they were just talking about grandkids... it had nothing at all to do with the wife of the subject of an investigation that she was overseeing and pressured Comey to call a 'matter'. Just innocent conversations about grandkids...
