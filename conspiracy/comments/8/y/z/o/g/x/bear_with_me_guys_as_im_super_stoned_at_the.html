        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay so I’m scrolling through all the weed related posts, and I keep noticing that basically every post related to weed was written by a user who was most likely pro marijuana. So I was going to see how many of you guys might be against the whole legalizing marijuana movement. I’m sorta against it because I was thinking it might be part of a whole bigger agenda like dumbing down society or something. </p>

<p>anyways I’m pretty high right now and looking for some good conversation so feel free to comment :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>meth and heroin(in my small opinion) are a scape goat into more psychological problems. most people that use them and stay on them(other than the addictive effects) are usually trying to cope with problems that stem from childhood or a tramatic event. most addicts that ive talked to will openly tell you of problems that theyve had but dont know how to change the negative side efeects of dealing with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in the right to your own body. I also believe you have a responsibility to take care of that body and use it to help others.</p>

<p>I believe in informed consent. A situation where the person is desperate is not true consent. If people do not have realistic consistent access to food, shelter, and basic security they will be in a traumatized state and self-medicate with whatever they can. However anything that activates pleasure centers can be addictive, especially if it goes in our bodies. Making sugar illegal would not stop anyone from craving sugar and seeking it out. However I didn&#39;t consent to be taxed to death for agribusiness subsidies so that we can be sold corn and cane sugar at every turn. America didn&#39;t consent as a whole to having family farms ripped out by the banks and turned into feedlots, or become vassals serfs permanently in debt making less than minimum wage working their ass off on our &quot;own land&quot;. Point is, shit is complex and there are more elegant solutions than prohibition, which is synonymous with black markets, which means organized crime gets that much stronger.</p>

<p>Portugal legalized and saw abuse rates drop. But they don&#39;t treat their poor with absolute contempt like here in the states, even though they have less money to work with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes we get a glimpse of how screwed up our lives are living out a pointless routine, being manipulated one way or the other. Often we lack the strength or resolve to keep fighting or digging or even the energy to try to bring meaning to our lives.</p>

<p>I think with most drugs it&#39;s nice to just get away from it all for a while. I think it&#39;s clear pot will put some people further from seeking anything except escape, but other people may find it a gateway to a new positive perspective. Almost anything can enslave you; religion, politics, hatred, entertainment, comfort, money, drugs, etc. Our minds are so conditioned, and shaped by things beyond our control, that&#39;s it&#39;s difficult to even envision what freedom and thinking for ourselves might be. ...and these words cast upon the breeze, what meaning do they have?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i feel like if you’re already dumb and you abuse cannabis very heavily you’ll become dumber, but you can’t discount how many intelligent people have used marijuana to look at problems differently, find out what’s really important to them and cancel out the overwhelming white noise that is every day life enhancing creativity for art of all sorts</p>

<p>but most importantly, weed makes you ask “why” </p>

<p>how much have you learned just from asking why something is the way it is instead of just accepting it without trying to understand because cannabis sure as fuck woke me right up. </p>

<p>do you actually feel dumber when you smoke? temporarily forgetting where you put something is a lot different than actually becoming dumber. </p>

<p>i had seen someone from my high school, who was legitimately dumb (came from money, smoked weed with the “krew” 24/7/365) turn out way worse but he didn’t respect the plant, and i think that is so fucking important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my favorite part about weed is the disrupted thought patterns. it’s much easier to separate yourself from your emotions and negative cyclical thought loops, to look at an issue you’re having rationally while still acknowledging your feelings, and not numbing them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My man.</p>

<p>They first had me on Trazodone, took that for about a year and I just felt like a zombie/husk. Then I stopped taking them once I started smoking weed, noticed the difference instantly within the first few weeks, and haven&#39;t looked back since.</p>

<p>I complete agree with the mantra &quot;Respect the plant.&quot;, I never smoked it with the goal of getting &quot;Lit&quot;, I did it more or less to  refine my ability to think in a positive mindset, and from there it&#39;s helped me gain motivation to start doing more, educating myself more, going out and seeing more, and eventually it&#39;s just sort of become a little niche of a routine that keeps the pep in my step and cheers me up, seems to have done the trick just fine since I was diagnosed in &#39;09. </p>

<p>On a final note, I know Mary Jane isn&#39;t for everybody, and it may not have the same effect for everyone as it did for me,
giving me the little nudge to do these things. For others it could be something more simplistic to get the ball rolling; Music, coffee, watching the sunrise, literally anything,</p>

<p>I think most people just have troubles trying to find what helps push them to be a more enlightened or positive human and Marijuana seems to be an excellent way to get that started.</p>

<p>I&#39;m for the legalization of all drugs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What gives you, or the government, the right to tell me what I can, or can&#39;t, put in my own body?  I own myself.</p></li>
<li><p>Drug laws have failed.  They pose a burden through taxation and are primarily focused on end users or low level dealers.  They crowd prisons, make felons out of honest people and destroy families and communities.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you really want to help the addict and the alcoholic, work to legalize all drugs and give money and time to help rehabilitate those in need.  If drugs are really so dangerous that you have to make them illegal, why make the situation worse.</p>

<p>Drugs and alcohol are bad enough.  Throwing in men with guns, badges, and prison time only makes matter worse, for everyone. </p>

<p>The main reason for violence in the drug trade is because people fear getting locked in a cage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe people have the right to do whatever they wish with their bodies, but I think the idea that weed is an answer to most problems and can be a substitute for other prescription medications is extremely harmful. There’s not enough education around the downsides and risks of marijuana, which do exist, contrary to popular belief. For example, if you have a history of mental illness in your family, weed is much more likely to send you into psychosis or trigger bipolar disorder or schizophrenia which may have not been triggered had you not used weed. </p>

<p>There’s really so many things to look at with it all. But at the end of the day, what people really aren’t understanding, is that the weed industry is just as much an industry as anything else. If there’s money to be made someone’s gonna make it. And imagine having a demographic that basically believes your product has no possible negative side effects. Easy $. I know people say its not technically addictive, but I know many people who can’t go a day without it and I have watched them deteriorate physically and emotionally over time. Now that it’s becoming legal that’s gonna be even easier and the lifestyle that leads to that will be basically advocated for. </p>

<p>But, at the end of the day, I do think weed helps some people and I still believe everyone has a right to use it if they want to. I really just think the negative sides need to be spoken about more openly than they currently are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal stance:</p>

<p>I&#39;m pro legalization of everything, but I have my own twist on how I&#39;d like it done.</p>

<p>Weed and Psychadelics(LSD, LSA, Shrooms, 4-HO-MET, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, etc) should all be legal for consumption to anybody who wants to try it. These are substances with a high safety profile. I&#39;m not super educated on varieties of RCs but there are definitely some with bad safety profiles. </p>

<p>Things like Heroine or other highly addictive and potentially damaging substances, I would prefer be introduced either through a medical card system or safe-injection sites. If anything it would allow users to get a clean, measured, reliable dose, which goes a long way. Kratom is also great for helping with Opium/Opioid addiction. </p>

<p>Also nootropics should be completely legal. SITSA is bullshit and ruining the lives of many(not mine, I only fuck with weed and psychs personally, but I know many who think SITSA is disgraceful and have great argument points). </p>
