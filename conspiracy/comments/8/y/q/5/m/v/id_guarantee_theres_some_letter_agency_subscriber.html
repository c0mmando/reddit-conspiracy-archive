       Or change us. That's the spookiest part, imo. At some point we are no longer in the driver's seat of what we digest online, but rather it's spoon-fed to us via algorithms. Our online environment becomes carefully curated for us, and when this happens, we become malleable to new ideas, thoughts, etc that we only believe are our own but are in actuality chosen for us.
      </p>

       Sometimes I even think conspiracy sites like these are actually beneficial to TPTB. The elite do not have to have all citizens blindly complying with their agenda, as there is benefit to hating/fearing it, too: that still gives them power. Paying attention to them is a form of legitimizing them. But that's a tangent for a different day.

       I'd assume at least a few are here, from different agencies around the world.  They'd probably have a presence and I'm guessing it's not limited to monitoring, and a few of our prolific members are possibly here to direct the conversation in certain ways.

       You like to point fingers at other countries,  but,  Eglin AFB in Florida is our very own US-based troll farm.

      <p>
       Eglin Air Force Base was "America's  most Reddit addicted city" because of their manipulative actions here. They keep close tabs and steer the conversation because our own government considers an educated American populace to be a threat to it's  power base.

       The US is just as culpable,  as is evidenced by the "most Reddit-addicted city" being nothing more than members of the military getting paid to be on Reddit all day.... So much so that the stats pop out like a sore thumb in the data.

       It sure does. Most folks with a minimal about of reading comprehension can see your intended spin:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'd assume
        <strong>
         at least a few are here
        </strong>
        from different agencies
        <em>
         around the world
        </em>
        <strong>
         a few
        </strong>
        of our prolific members
        <strong>
         are possibly here
        </strong>
        to direct the conversation in certain ways.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's like looking at a colony of hundreds of mice breeding under your own deck and telling your neighbors,
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'd assume at least
       <strong>
        a few
       </strong>
       mice are
       <strong>
        possibly
       </strong>
       under my deck, but,  probably from different nests around the neighborhood.
       <strong>
        A few
       </strong>
       of those mice are
       <strong>
        possibly
       </strong>
       here to breed...  but,  just a few".
      </p>
      <p>
       You're  being very careful in your wording to push any association of online manipulation onto other countries,  when data shows our own military is manipulating Reddit to an astonishing degree.

       I can understand that it makes you uncomfortable when I point out the subtle manipulations in your diction.  You're really good at it and a lot of people can't quite put a finger on what you're doing. I'm tired of seeing this kind of shit though,  so I've decided to point it out for others.

       I doubt there are any intelligence agencies actively posting here but I am sure we say enough buzzwords to flag up most of our threads for surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely think there are bots and paid trolls on Reddit though, not sure if r/conspiracy is big enough to catch their attention but we hit r/all semi-frequently so it's not out of the question, especially in those threads.

       Three letter agencies manipulate everything you see. Look into Operation Mockingbird.  The CIA was imbedding agents in journalism and TV production decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your stance that they are not actively posting to steer discussion here is naive, at best.  This is the new battleground in the war for your mind;  they're not disregarding it.

       It's easy to spot one, when they start disagreeing and trying to reel in people by planting doupt in their minds. It truly is a battle for the future of mankind. There are secret agendas to not only control us but the world and we never see it all just the tip of the iceberg. Anyway I'm at least grateful for the free flow of info on the internet, it helps.

       Pretty sure they're outsourcing the well poisoning and disagreeing to increasingly-sophisticated bots. There are a few with an actual pulse but I'm guessing there aren't many.

       What I notice though about the warm bodies when they do arrive is that haven't seemed to read the OP or articles or issues in question. It is more free association. Of course that is also true of many non-synthetic people as well.

       What leads you to this stance of minimalisation? Are you,  in any capacity,  able to accurately determine what is actually being done with the data Reddit hands over to them?

       your right i have no clue how the data is being used. I suppose im being nieve or just wishfull thinking that they are not conspiring to used it all against us in some way

       I think this sub may be an asset to them so its possible they dont want to disrupt the natraul flow. Keeping the pot full of honey

       I have a close friend I have known for 7+ years admit to me very recently that he "does stuff" for the government for the past three years that he can't talk about. It came out of left field but after putting the pecies together accounted for a lot of things I had noticed about him.

       Three letter agencies manipulate everything you see. Look into Operation Mockingbird.  The CIA was imbedding agents in journalism and TV production decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your stance that they are not actively posting to steer discussion here is naive, at best.  This is the new battleground in the war for your mind;  they're not disregarding it.
