    <div class="md"><p>Can you ask him a question?</p>

<p>Why is the &quot;temple of solomon&quot; the cornerstone of Masonic estotericism? I&#39;m thinking of the founding legend of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Abiff">Hiram Abiff</a>, and of course the two-column symbolism.</p>

<p>With all the marvelous (and more mysterious) stonework present in the world, whether older (the Pyramids) or younger (Gothic cathdrals), why would Masons choose to claim heritage over that particular building? Even its alleged former location is still undertermined (the so-called &quot;wailing wall&quot; in Jerusalem is likely to merely be the Western wall of the Roman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Fortress">Antonina Fortress</a>, see this fascinating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKTO8YYs29c">Zionist documentary</a> about the controversy).</p>

<p>What is it with Masons and Zionism? It seems unlikely to be related to the crusades (and its chivalrous orders), as Masons are typically not Catholic, and as Masonry is a historical enemy of the Roman church.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My uncle was one as well and pretty high up in his local chapter lodge..club? Whatever it is called... My aunt was in the order of the eastern star but wasnt as into it as her hubby. I think it was more of a tagalong thing for her than a lifestyle but he was into it enough that he had a masonic funeral and everything which is a pretty big deal considering that my family on that side at least prides itself on their hardcore Southern Baptist roots. That doesnt mix as far as the rituals go. I wasnt into the conspiracies as much back then to ask for their innermost secrets. I highly doubt that he would have divulged any anyway. I do know that when you die that they have someone come and collect your regalia normally which always is a red flag when you see items for sale that that family member at least wasnt down with the masons. I am always super suspicious of any group that makes you get knee deep before letting you know its inner workings. That is very culty to me. I know that not all things are divulged to all members but the secretive nature of the masons just sounds like they want you in so deep financially that even if you do hear some cult like quackery that you have already spent so much that you will be apprehensive to leave. You already bought and paid for such secrets and surely not everyone around you would fall for crazy stupid stuff right? I mean look around most of these 33rd degree guys are successful  rich and in high stations in life so surely those guys must hear something enlightening that will make sense of it all right? If not then they at least have paid to be that fraternal and believe that it will possibly help them in business at least. I mean my uncle wasnt a stupid guy he worked for Anheuser Busch and had a pretty cushy job so even if he didnt quite believe all the tenants of masonry he at least went with the group think and it seemed to serve him well. I cannot help but think surely he read about Albert Pike and had to comprehend as well as I did and HAD TO KNOW that not only was he a high level KKK member but also what I believe was a luciferian too. How does a christian man get past that part? For the brotherhood? For business? Or do they by then have something much larger and darker on you so turning back isnt an option at all? So many questions... </p>

<p>If you are an up and coming business man in the community and you want to posture within your community as one then I would say give it a shot. But I for one have never been a fan of buying friends so the fact that you are basically doing that at least make me wary. Its the secretive about what else it includes part that could either be really good or TERRIBLE. Think real long and hard before you act and GOOD LUCK!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Should I join him? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And give this sub insight of what their plans are? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, we are a bunch of nobodies who will never make change, the ones who make change take action, they don&#39;t sit in their room on the computer taking tokes and hacking up butts browsing reddit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He won’t tell me what Freemasons do until I join them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its basically a fraternity, its about logistics/networking/opportunity, you want to go work at mcdonalds and try to give a bunch of nobodies information that really won&#39;t be what you expect, go ahead, but its opportunity to be part of something bigger than yourself, its basically a brotherhood, some are MUCH sketchier than others obviously, but it sounds like your father is networked and well respected, you too can earn that type of network and respect if you follow his path.</p>

<p>Just because the internet told you all freemasons are evil, etc, doesn&#39;t make it so, most men want a better future, everyone does, everyone sees it a MUUUCH different way (FUCK YOU THANOS).</p>

<p>You won&#39;t even understands their ideology and their intended path for a few years after joining, and by then you could find out its benign, like simply a connected brotherhood for work purposes, etc. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He had been a grandmaster at 2 lodges and has been a Freemason for almost 20 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have one serious question before I can go any further, and I need it answered before I can give my final response:</p>

<p>Deep down, is your father a good person? Would he stop to help people that he KNEW where in need, if he had the capacity/etc to help? Was he a good father? Did he earn your respect? </p>

<p>If you do not answer me, I will give you my answer, I hope you say hes respectful and was a good dad, because that would tell me that he had an opportunity to lead a brotherhood and was able to keep it together for many years, run multiple lodges, etc, he is likely a benevolent person who simply networked within the lodge to help him do what he wanted, take care of his family. </p>

<p>It sounds more like you have an amazing life opportunity and you would rather compromise that for a bunch of nobodies who don&#39;t give a shit about you, who have never met you, and can&#39;t truly know whats best for YOU, unlike the person who raised you. </p>

<p>The answer is never in our heads, its in our hearts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure this is the best sub to ask.</p>

<p>Even if your father is (oddly) unwilling to talk to you about Masonry, you can educate yourself. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my standard copypasta:</p>

<p>We&#39;re a centuries old fraternal order, who exist to improve our own character (&#39;we make good men better&#39; is one of our slogans), and through that improve our communities. Along the way, we do a lot of charity (forex: Shriner&#39;s free hospitals for crippled children), and have a lot of cool and private ceremonies using the construction of King Solomon&#39;s Temple as an allegorical base for teaching Enlightenment ideals. (yes, we really do have secret handshakes).</p>

<p>We have several million Brothers world wide, but no central organization. Many prominent men from every walk of life have been members, including over a dozen US presidents.</p>

<p>Regular Masonry is open to adult men of good character who are not atheists - we require a belief in some form of &#39;higher power&#39;, but aren&#39;t fussy about what. As a rule, we don&#39;t recruit; we want an potential member to make the first approach of his own free will.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re curious, drop by our main hangout on reddit, <a href="/r/freemasonry">/r/freemasonry</a>. You&#39;ll find a lot of friendly folk there. If you prefer a book, for North Americans I recommend (seriously, I&#39;m not trolling) &quot;Freemasons for Dummies&quot; by Christopher Hodapp.</p>

<p>Seriously, check out Hodapp&#39;s book, or drop by <a href="/r/freemasonry">/r/freemasonry</a> to see what kind of people are there.</p>

<p>In before:</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;re low level, and don&#39;t know the <em>real secrets</em>.</li>
<li>You&#39;re high level, and are hiding the <em>real secrets</em>.</li>
<li>Will you fix my wall for free? (No).</li>
