       I don't know who is manipulating this sub but it doesn't make sense. This sub and conspiracy community in general is built on the idea that the US government has done all these malevolent things over the years. Yet when it comes to Trump, they are immediately taken at face value and people here start beating their chests on Russia basically demanding a new Cold or Hot War.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't make sense when this sub then goes and takes at face value the Iranians or whatever is reported on in Syria by non-mainstream news. Russia is the victim of American meddling and imperialism on this subject here. You all trust the mainstream media and alphabet agencies when it comes to Russia hacking the Democrats but you don't trust them when those same people/agencies/media tell you Assad gassed his people, Putin's aggressive actions need to be checked, who carried out 9/11, or basically ANYTHING the federal agencies/government tells you besides things pertaining to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       This double standard about Trump and Russia amuses me. The overall talking points here are to get rid of Trump but nobody here ever says who exactly they want instead. "All politicians are bad" and the usual meaningless non-real world fedora talking points. People here claim they didn't support Hillary yet carry her water daily which implies they actually DO want Hillary (the chosen candidate of the Establishment) thus a return to the government you accuse of being behind all the conspiracies in the first place! So what is it?

       Even on r/conspiracy nowadays, people let their emotions force a reaction. T_D users come here to brigade and post their deep-state-donald-trump-swamp-drain theories, and we all know how anal and retarded EVERYONE can be when it comes to trump. The human race will be dead in 50 years as we know it, we are more focused on arguing words on a keyboard than worrying about our ever-increasing global temperature and the effects it will bring. Some days I get the “I wanna go home” feeling, yet i’m already there :/

       What is Russia getting from Trump? He's attacked their interests twice in Syria, is reversing course on Iran, is browbeating Europe/NATO into strengthening itself, and is promoting domestic oil/gas that affects the Russian economy in a big way. Just this week he highlighted the Russia-Germany gas arrangement which basically highlights the ridiculousness of us protecting Western Europe from a country they are increasingly economically reliant on.

       That's one perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another person might view it as he went soft on interests twice in Syria, is isolating Iran from America, thus giving it no choice but to strengthen ties to Russia, we don't get our imported oil from Russia.  W. Europe, especially Germany, are in a precarious position in regards to Russia, due to their reliance on Russia for petroleum.  I can't argue that. Russia wants U.S.-Russia gas arrangements though.  Trump wants that too.  He's tried, though thus far has been unsuccessful, to get sanctions lifted so that a huge Exxon-Rostneft joint project in Russia can get started.

       He didn't go soft on Syria. He just doesn't want another expensive proxy war that will risk American tax dollars and soldiers for vague geopolitical interests. That is what he ran on and has been speaking out on for years in Iraq. Despite all that he still launched airstrikes on Syria and Russian interests TWICE, the only times during his Presidency he was applauded by the media and establishment mind you. Meddling in that part of the world has created the refugee crisis that goes against Trump's interests but helped that of the European leaders desperate for population growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran under its current leadership will never have strong ties to us. To do so would be trading Saudi Arabia, much of the Arab world, and Israel away which means nothing is gained/more is lost. Russia will align with whoever is against us, so aligning with Iran merely creates new enemies. Iran has proven to be an untrustworthy, erratic ally.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Russia and oil, you see the pointlessness of NATO if Germany and Western Europe are ultimately reliant on Russia? It is the equivalent of demanding more cops on the street to protect you from your drug dealer. How can Trump be blamed for anything when Europe is propping up Russia and Iran? When you treat these two nations as normal trading partners, why should we Republicans care about or fear Putin?

       He didn't go soft on Syria. He doesn't want to get involved in another expensive proxy war that will cost us hundreds of billions in tax dollars and soldiers for vague geopolitical interests. He has been talking about this for years with Iraq. Despite this he still launched airstrikes on Syria and Russian interests twice, the only times he has been praised by his detractors in the media and establishment mind you. A war would create a refugee crisis, which goes against Trump's interests and help the European (and American Democrats) politicians desperate for more workers &amp; voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran under their current leadership will never be close to us. Doing so would merely push Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other Arab states away from us. Nothing is gained, you see and more is loss. Russia will support whoever is against us. Iran has proven itself as an erratic and untrustworthy ally.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Russia and gas/oil, you certainly see the pointlessness of NATO. It's the equivalent of someone demanding more cops to protect them from their drug dealer. Trump is the only one who is pointing out how ridiculous this is. Why should he or any American worry about Russia when our supposed allies are treating them (as well as Iran) like normal trading partners. It is why this current Russia-Trump hysteria is falling on deaf ears with his base.

       Of course Russia knew where the strikes would occur. The entire thing was in response to the alleged chemical attacks.

       The OP said that Trump didn't go soft on them. That just isn't true. He did go soft on them and I was pointing it out. They were in comunication with the Russian Govt about where the attacks would be. To give them time to clear away from everything. That is about as soft as you can go. Again, don't want us in a war but just pointing that out.
      </p>

       As for the hundreds of dead mercenaries/troops. That was a our soldiers defending themselves. Not sure what that has to do with anything.

       That's the shitty part. I don't want our soldiers to die - I have many friends in the military - but at the same time they were illegally occupying a sovereign nation's territory - the Golan Heights.

       This has been answered so many times and is so patently obvious in the first place than anyone asking it at this point is just being straight up dishonest, either with themself or with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       To pick just the two most obvious examples, literally the only Trump directed change to the RNC platform was to water down support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine, and repeatedly he's blocked or dragged his feet in implementing Russian sanctions.

       How does that highlight what you claim? Looks more like a classic piece of Trumpian projection and whataboutism right in line with his classic "no puppet! No Puppet! You're the puppet!" meltdown.

       There isn't any other than digging up dirt on Hillary. Which begs the question why it is acceptable for Hillary to pay a MI6 ingelligence officer with his rolodex of foreign spies and contacts to dig up dirt on Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see what Russia gets out of this. Nobody expected Trump to win in the US. Not Hillary, not the Obama administration, not the media, not the GOP, and probably not even Trump. Why would Russia, already under sanctions, do something they were easily caught at, just to further poke the bear (or eagle in our case)? What harm did they expect to cause other than embarrassing Hillary and upsetting the Bernie Sanders supporters?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see where Trump comes into it for them. Comey reopening the Hillary investigation had more of an effect on the campaign than those laughable propaganda images on Facebook or the DNC emails.

       Christopher Steele wasn’t just a foreign individual. He was a foreign intelligence  agent/spy working with other foreign agents to dig up dirt on Donald Trump. You don't he had old MI6 contacts in Russia and elsewhere he leaned on?  Would you be fine with Trump hiring a bunch of retired not-active KGB agents to dig up dirt on whoever?

      <p>
       Stoking divisions? Hillary Clinton owns the media and most people in DC. The effect is much less when you are trying to harm an establishment person than an outsider.

       Right. Should they have hired a cobbler to do oppo research or...? The point is the Clinton campaign legal arrangement rather than an illegal one. That's the (painfully obvious) answer to your question about the difference between the two.

       I suppose that can be the case sometimes. My distaste for Comey goes way back before 2016 and I wasn't going to vote for either candidate in question in the first place, so this doesn't apply to me.

       Believe me, organic users do not take anything at face-value. You are completely correct about Russia being a victim of American imperialism. NATO explicitly promised Russia in the 90s that they would not expand east. Except now they are conducting war games on Russias border while, you know, expanding east and initiating regime change operations.

       Yeah, you are right. If Trump goes down we get... Pence. Horray?

       I think this is organic. Rightwing people have fewer difficulties incorporating conspiracy theories into their world-view. So naturally, there will be a fair amount of conspiracy theorising on this sub about plots
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why leftwing people are so instinctively-averse to conspiracy theories (in the popular sense). But they are, and it's pretty much an article of faith on the left that not only do conspiracies not happen but that anyone who thinks conspiracies do happen is either an imbecile or a danger to society.
      </p>

       It's ridiculous, but there it is.

       I think Trump people are just trying to believe in something &amp; hoping for the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they are feeling power they don't experience in their real lives by living vicariously through Trump's mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I voted for Trump only because I couldn't stand the idea of another Clinton or Bush in office....not certain he is doing the best for the citizens of this country by lowering taxes for the rich as far as he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the corporate media wanted to drown out a massively popular socialist candidate Sanders (Look at all his rallies in 2015-2016 on youtube &amp; decide for yourself who had bigger rallies) &amp; they did by elevating Trump 247 in the media &amp; letting Clinton skate to the Dem nomination without having to ask her any difficult questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what elected Trump, not the Russians.
