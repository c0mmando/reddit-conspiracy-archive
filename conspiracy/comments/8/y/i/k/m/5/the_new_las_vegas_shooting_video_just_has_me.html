<ol>
<li><p>Over 1,100 rounds fired and I don&#39;t see a single spark or sign of ricochet?</p></li>
<li><p>There were supposably over 900 injured yet I don&#39;t really see 1. Its not the best video but you should be able to see something seeing how the camera angle is focused in a populated area very close to supposed Shooters location. </p></li>
<li><p>Why in the hell did this camera not look for the shooting spot earlier and stay zoomed in basically looking at nothing for so long? Like it did <a href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/clip/14402756/new-video-mandalay-bay-roof-on-1-october">here</a> .</p>

<ol>
<li>Why is the Las Vegas Metro just releasing this now when they most likely have A LOT more video?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m sure I have many more but these are just what bugged me right away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of the 58 fatalities the narrative was that 34 in all were pronounced dead at hospitals or were found on neighbouring streets, meaning that people (friends, family, spouses, strangers, etc.) managed to get them off the grounds and to transport. Yet in this video I can&#39;t spot even one dead or dying person being carried out. </p>

<p>The narrative claims mnay people got into the medical tent and that four died there.. But when you actually examine the video I see NO injured carried there which is surprising. Most run right by it. Finally I see one guy go in.</p>

<p>I see people hitting the deck, then moments later they are gone. It looks like an evacuation not a mass casuality event of 500. </p>

<p>It would take a vivid imagination to spot more than a handful of victims here. I see a crowd being stampeded only. In the beginning of the video it shows a dense crowd supposedly being hit with AR rounds. It would be hard to miss. There should be carnage everywhere. Where are the dead and injuried?﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that&#39;s the video, somehow I forgot the link. What this video really showed me that really surprised me is how fast people got out of there. The place seemed almost empty within 20 minutes. With over 800 injuries reported u think you would see a few stragglers or people left behind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good. It wasn’t real world, it was a drill and wasn’t even necessarily filmed the night of Oct 1, 2017. </p>

<p>Exposed to so many lies we forget what the ring of truth sounds like. Nothing about Vegas has the ring of truth to it. You can consider and examine every aspect, every detail, and ask whether it seems to be a relic of a real mass shooting or an effect of a large scale fabrication and you come up with the latter every time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are people being dragged out or assisted. or acting as such.</p>

<p>lots of the area the camera covers is fuzzed out to conceal that the areana is mostly empty of people, before and after the supposed shooting. the main concentration is the before the stage area, there does not seem to be 10s of thousands there, maybe 500.</p>

<p>two automatic guns are heard at 6:15, one light one heavy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just for you first point but sparks?</p>

<p>Seriously? This isnt holywood and that isnt a high quality film camera. It would be more surprising to see sparks.</p>

<p>Question of my own. Why are 58 victims named and why do they have a past, school history and families? </p>

<p>Do you think that hundreds of people are lying and following the same script?</p>

<p>There is a level of difference between going to see a celebrity or a rally to pretending to know a fake dead body for the rest of your life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and there’s no guarantee these things are actually filmed on the day they’re said to occur. I’ve always thought that because of liability and wanting to keep everything tightly controlled, there are mostly no “innocent bystanders,” in other words no one really thinks there is a shooting/bomb and is wildly stampeding with the possibility of trampling an actor to death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually had a guy PM me who was an Uber driver in Vegas at the time and told me there’s no way it was a real shooting. </p>

<p>As for the Parkland thing, you are the millionth person to say “I know a guy who knows a guy” and not to back it up with any substantiation. Parkland was also staged — there were no people shot and no real shooting. We know this for the same reasons we know Vegas was fake: total lack of evidence and the existence of ridiculous crisis actors and obviously staged news stories. </p>

<li><p>Even if there was sparks and ricochet to be seen the camera is too far away. This is not a Hollywood HD production. </p></li>
<li><p>The camera is zoomed in on a small back section of the grounds. This was not the main area targeted by the shooter. Even still, you do see people getting hit and later being dragged away. </p></li>
<li><p>This is a rooftop security camera. These cameras are monitored but not manned 24/7. Picture a large security office with dozens of screens and hundreds of feeds on rotation. The cameras just record 24/7 and then if someone sees something they click on the feed and are able to zoom in/out and move the camera around. Whoever is controlling this camera was prob switching back and forth from looking at other feeds. </p></li>
<li><p>Insurance. Metro/MGM is being very careful with what and when things get released. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok but secrecy?</p>

<p>There is a level of difference between going to see a celebrity or a rally to pretending to know a fake dead body for the rest of your life. </p>

<p>Are there any examples of large numbers of people lying repeatedly like this and not getting caught almost immediately?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We took a hard look at crowd management at <a href="https://www.newnationalist.net/2017/06/05/an-examination-of-the-london-bridge-terror-attack/">the London Bridge event in 2017.</a> Some of the videos in this post were lost in the You Tube purges, but if you go to ‘Crowd Control’ and Everybody Running Away&quot; in the second half of the article it explains how it&#39;s done. Basically they just stampede people and use them for photo ops. At Las Vegas strangely they hardly bothered.</p>
