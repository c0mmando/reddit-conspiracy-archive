    <div class="md"><p>The fbi agents who covered for Clinton in the email probe are some of the same agents who were leading the investigation into Russian meddling and collusion into the Trump campaign. The IG report exposed how Hillary was never questioned about her intent with the email servers by the fbi, even though the fbi decided not to charge her because they didn&#39;t think there was intent to circumvent security measures. How could they determine intent without questioning the person who would have been the one person who would have known the actual intent of the actions taken? All that while intent isn&#39;t actually required for her to have been indicted. </p>

<p>The report also exposed how Comey himself thought Obama&#39;s DOJ was too corrupt to handle her case, so he took it upon himself to simply broadcast his &quot;findings&quot; a week before the election on national television.  </p>

<p>Above alone gave Trump reason to fire Comey, but when Trump fired Comey Trump said it was for the investigation into the Russian meddling which is what gave rise to the special counsel Mueller now leads. A curious aspect about it all is the day before Trump fired comey, Trump met with Mueller under the guise of interviewing for a potential new head of the FBI position even though Mueller was ineligible. </p>

<p>Trump meets with the person who would lead an investigation into him a day before Trump does something completely unnessecary which starts an open ended investigation at a time Trump knew people wanted to start an investigation into him, his campaign and of general corruption? </p>

<p>Smells like a set up, might not be, but it&#39;s certainly curious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. This is certainly an explanation.   </p>

<p>Seems tenuous at best. I don&#39;t see the massive conspiracy though. Comey seems to have been wishy washy and had no real agenda. And I think it&#39;s a bit of a stretch to say those agents &quot;covered&quot; for anyone. I don&#39;t see the malicious intent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It started when the texts were released between Storzk and Page showing them literally saying &quot;not my president&quot;. Then you have all the IG report evidence stating they had a case against HRC but dropped it due to political bias. </p>

<p>The goal for them was to taint the Russian investigation so it made trump look guilty. Were 2 years into it and how much evidence have we seen of Trump Russia collusion? How much evidence do we have of HRC/Obama admission collusion with russia? The demand accused trump of what they were doing which is a classic trick of the left, projection. Uranium One and the Iran nuke deal were set up behind the backs of the american people and our representatives. Does that not worry you a bit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uranium one. Fully debunked. </p>

<p>Also, why is it that you expect us to know what proof Mueller has?  Also, Trump made himself look guilty by having so many Russian meetings and connections and then lied about all of them.  Where is the Dem collusion you speak of and why would it excuse trump?  </p>

<p>If Mueller had proof he would have came out with it by now, again 2 years and nothing but indicting Russians. </p>

<p>The dem collusion is then all shouting russia at the top of their lungs and not holding their own party accountable. </p>

<p>Storzk and page are 2 HIGH LEVEL FBI agents. He directly oversaw investigations in the HRC email investigation as well and the trump/russia investigation. His texts prove political bias. Plain and simple and you cant argue that away. </p>

<p>Gowdy is in charge of the investigation into the investigation right?  He&#39;s said bad things and critical things about the president. Why is he allowed to continue?</p>

<p>Mueller has locked up trump&#39;s campaign manager and Russian stooge Paul Manafort as well as many others directly connected to Trump. This isn&#39;t nothing and we don&#39;t know the connections yet.  Paul Manafort&#39;s job for over a decade was to get pro Russian candidates elected in Ukraine and other countries ffs. Also, just a tangent, but why are there so many Russian meetings and connections that were almost all lied about?</p>

<p>Political bias doesn&#39;t preclude FBI agents from doing their jobs. Like it doesn&#39;t preclude regular police officers from doing their jobs or teachers or...  </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s quite an over simplification.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A couple of agents texting each other? </p>

<p>These weren&#39;t &quot;a couple of agents&quot;. You have the lead investigator for both the Clinton and Trump investigations.  Using FBI equipment, on FBI property, during normal working hours, explaining to other FBI agents involved in the most critical investigations in modern history that they want to destroy one candidate over the other.<br/>
Senior agents of our chief law enforcement agency were actively discussing how they could bypass the US constitution and choose who was elected at the president of the United States.  Post election, they actively discussed how they work to get a duly elected president impeached.     </p>

<p>I disagree that this is the case.    There is a difference between speaking ill of someone and scheming with fellow Federal Investigators to have the president impeached.  I don&#39;t think you grasp the scope.  The lead investigator, at the highest levels of the FBI communicating with other high ranking FBI officials on the best ways to ensure a president is not elected?  They needed an insurance policy to make sure that didn&#39;t happen.  It was discussed openly in the assistant director of the FBI&#39;s office.    </p>

You keep going back to the &quot;said something bad&quot;.    </p>

<p>There is a VERY big difference in &quot;I hope Trump doesn&#39;t win&quot; and even &quot;fuck Trump&quot; with &quot;We need to set up an insurance policy to make sure if he wins, we can get him impeached&quot;.</p>

<p>Making a statement that you don&#39;t like someone/something is fine.  I draw the line when you take/threaten to take action.  You and I (assume) have big problems when our elections are meddled with. The difference between you and I is that I also have a problem with senior members of the FBI attempting to do the same.</p>
