       For some reason I keep getting loads of ads for this app on youtube. I decided to just search youtube to see what it was, and found this video titled "What kids really do on Musical.ly":
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PmphkNDosg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like it's just a bunch of young teens (13, 14 etc), dancing/singing and making sexual signs and acts with their hands/mouth on video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably harmless as it's just a social media app targeted to that age group. But in the above video we are shown a youtube video called "FUCKBOY COMPILATION!!! EXTREMELY HOT!!!" or something along those lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which includes a bunch of young boys dancing in sexual manners etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea where I'm going to this, but it seems like a Pedo's dream. And the whole app to me just seems pretty fucked up and as if it probably shouldn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone looked into this at all?

       My little bro, playing a horror game where the main thing is to survive, you need to listen and for this we put the volume at maximum to hear any approaching creak. Guess what kind of advertising the creators put on this application? This "musical.ly" appears every time in the form of a screamer and my brother and I already hate this advertisement.

       As someone in there mid twenties, who grew up during the birth of social media... this shit absolutely terrifies me. Kids eat this shit up, all these little kids want to grow up and be youtube famous. We have no idea how this is going to effect the future.

       Same age group, I remember all the drama SM caused growing up, the bullying, shit talking and fights generated from it, but we were all so scared to be overly sexual on there because Chris Hansen might show up at your door. Now kids basically lose their innocence before they even have a chance. And I cannot stand seeing these children with iPads and iPhones, I see it all the time, I mean I had a gameboy but I was linked to the world on it. It’s all a plot trickling down and just seems to be more evident than ever we are so easy to have our strings pulled

       Same age group with my third kid on the way and it’s scary stuff. My oldest is 6 and all of her friends have tablet and a few even have cell phones. My kid has a 2ds but we disabled the internet, and we’ve already decided she can have a cell phone when she has a job and pays for it.

       I caught my niece watching an elsagate video a few years back and I clamped down, but so many more parents don’t have their eyes open.

       No you probably grew up with Gameboy and flip phones like me. Nothing compared to the technology that literal children are given unrestricted access to. Clearly you aren't interested in a discussion just want to say you're right.

       Oh so you're just another loser that comes here to not discuss conspiracies but comment on posts you disagree with and shit on them because you can't people discuss things without them knowing your irrelevant opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why comment here if you don't like conspiracies? Do you have nothing else going on in your day that you go out of your way to comment on things you don't believe in or care about? Get a life.

       Yes, kids. But in general, more bad than good comes from social media. It's turned into mostly attention whoring. Something like reddit which is relatively anonymous is one thing, but Facebook, etc. is pure trash and the fact that anyone is dumb enough to keep using it speaks volumes about the current state of our culture.

       It's trash, sure, but it doesn't mean anything. They're attention whoring to people willingly taking it in. People seek validation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just cause it's more anonymous doesn't mean Reddit isn't full of people doing the same.

       It 100% creeps me out. Seeing Musical.ly videos make me feel weird, they’re something I’m sincerely not comfortably with. I noticed when young family members posted videos. I don’t really know what happened to lip syncing and dancing around in private anymore either.

       So, I installed musically once before I heard anything about it. I'm a musician, so part of the hustle is trying to find any possible place people might be receptive to music, so I usually try any service that is tangentially related to music. I sign up, create a profile, and start browsing to figure out how people use the service so I make appropriate stuff and I'm bombarded by videos of extremely young girls engaging in sexualized behavior. I immediately realized that this was fucked up and absolutely no place for me and deleted the app. In like the couple of minutes I had it I literally could not run a single search of see a single thing that didn't have sexualized content in it. That's a completely fucked up social network.

       I found this app on my kids phone a while back. She’s in band at school so I assumed it was something regarding that. Although, I didn’t find any of this on hers (maybe I wasn’t looking in the right place) it wouldn’t surprise me at all that the app is full of sexual content. Kids today are the most promiscuous little things I’ve ever encountered.

       I have fantasized about this many times, and everyone I ask about this scenario is sort of hoping for it as well. It's like people realize this whole internet/social media thing is actually bad for them, but can't stop using it because it's so pervasive.

       I think we need a reset- life wasnt meant to be how it is now. People are more interested in their next selfie, than getting out in their yard &amp; building and growing a garden that will help nourish them, or teaching their kids how to.
      </p>

       I havent watched tv since i injured my back in 2013- watch heaps of youtube's on self suffiency, hoesteading, gardening etc. I definitely feel more awake now than i ever have, yet getting other people to wake up is like getting blood from stone.

       See this is what sucks too tho, because the technology is actually usefull and really amazing. I’ve learned tons of awesome skills and diy stuff from YouTube. It would be a shame for the masses to lose such a powerful tool for sharing amongst ourselves, it has weakened the leverage of gatekeepers more than any invention since the printing press and it’s only getting started. We just need to learn how to control it, ie not letting kids turn their brains to jello with iPhones at the age of 6

       Tv and social media are hardly the reason people aren't more self-sufficient and/or active in their community.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of ways to put gardening knowledge into practice, but to be self-sufficient from it when roughly 50% of the population live in urban cities? 40% of those live in densely populated areas. Plus, you've gotta worry about climate, which for a good portion of the world population means canning and preserves. Don't get me wrong, it can be done, but why would I spend all of my non-work hours cultivating, growing, feeding, sowing, canning, preserving? Unless it was a community thing, but then we've gotta account for the ones not sharing the workload and balancing the reality that you've gotta keep your 1 kid fed, but the Smiths have 5 children and so of course they should put more into the process. And who gives up what when the weather changes and we don't have a decent haul for the year? Etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       We're 'more interested in our next selfie' because society and humankind got beyond the need to be self-sufficient, at least is developed nations.

       The problem is that within 48-72 hours every nuclear plant will melt down and many of them are much, much bigger than Fukushima.  Plus all the spent fuel ponds which are even bigger.  These plants are all conveniently located close to cities and large bodies of water.

       A week after the grid goes down, large swaths of the northern hemisphere including all heavily populated areas in the West will become uninhabitable.  Even if you are not in a direct fallout zone, the atmospheric radiation will spread around the planet and cause developmental stunting and birth defects for generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's keep the grid up until shut the plants down safely.

       I have never understood this. That sounds awful. I guess it's difficult to speak to the benefits of technology without warfare brought up, but surely technology as a whole has done more to enrich our lives than not.

       Kids presenting themselves is not as natural an impulse as you seem to think it is, however. Kids lived for years, decades only being able to take polaroid pictures of themselves and there wasn't nearly the sale of polaroid cameras are there are this app. Kids wanting to or feeling pressure to "present themselves" is (maybe not entirely, but predominantly) a side effect of the digital age and the general culture of today.

       I happened to rig up parental controls on a tablet for a 9 year old girl, and since her mom was too busy off shooting fentanyl into her neck, I moderated which apps she could use and what youtube content she could watch.

       How many of these are getting made and released because other under age persons look at them? Kids are becoming more sexually active and aware because of social media. Framing this as some pedophile conspiracy is not always accurate.

       (I just use the DM feature to talk to some of my internet friends) and trust me, there's a ton of pedos on there. Late twenties, thirties, and even forties (I've seen some elderly people as well) will "duet" the musical.lys of 14-17 year olds and basically give them sexual glances, gestures, and generally be creeps. The management has done nothing about it, in fact, the problem has only gotten worse. Hopefully the app will fall out of use as soon as possible, or even better, get pulled from the app store

       Yeah music.ly and live.ly are bad news for anyone under the legal age really.  Any old stranger can tune in and watch kids on these apps. My daughters have phones/tablets and they are only 7 and 8 (phones are against my wishes!) and they wanted this app, until I seen a dude from Germany watching them and jerking off.

       I took dance growing up for 12 years actually. So sometimes I like to watch dances on YouTube. There's a lot of really inappropriate ones in terms of moves or costumes or both and I don't understand how everyone was okay with it from the parents to the teachers and sometimes I wonder who's running the dance competitions where it's almost encouraged. It's also hard to find anyone who critiques it.

       If you criticise it the parents tend to say that children are inherently nonsexual no matter what they wear or how they dance, therefore if you find it offensive it's because YOU'RE a pedo.

       It really is specifically for kids to share videos with each other? I don’t think that’s a good idea. The IP and signup info could be used to locate these kids and stalk them. It would be really interesting if there were something nefarious going on with the app. Stranger things have happened.
