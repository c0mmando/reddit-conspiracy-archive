       Current rate is 1 in 22 boys, still going up rapidly.

       taking vaccinations OUT of the equation, regardless of reason behind it... if that stat is a reasonable expectation of the raising autistic population, it IS a problem. on the other hand, infertility is also shooting through the roof, so maybe instead of half the male population being autistic, maybe it will be 1/2 the amount of children being born, and 1/4 of them being autistic. sweet world, we're in.

       The vaccine depopulation plan is I believe mostly due to the Elite being worried that overpopulation will destroy the planet in a small number of generations, so they've started up a massive covert cull.

       i dont think they are as worried about population as they would have us believe. they can cull as they have, since time and written history began. they use wars, vaccines, viruses, toxic materials, and actual weather events to curb our ability to rise up, at least in terms of actual numbers. i think they let shit happen, and often times assist in the amount of devastation some natural incidents would accrue, or more importantly WHERE the event would manifest. I also believe there is an event they know about, coming to fruition by 2025, i believe sooner more 2021, so perhaps THAT'S what all the bunkers and bullshit hunger games propaganda is about. I used to be mad at myself for not "preparing" enough, but in terms of actual disasters, anything you have accumulated is now owned by the govt, for THE GREATER GOOD, whoever the fuck that guy is.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, when everyone is wiped down to a finite few, we will have been convinced it's our own fault, THIS i think, is more the plan. we have been programmed to think we are destroying the planet, we are causing wars bc we dont get along, we are a greedy destructive parasitic race, on the whole... and we NEED a leader. Thankfully, your govt will be there, right? Rounding people up to safety; assured of water, shelter, food, and medicine. Leave your munitions at the door though, it keeps the "terrorists" at bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you and i agree in thinking we don't, but there are many people who are "patriotic" in the way of being cultish, and they will flock to their shepherds. that's the pan, imo. Step one: kill them off using each other, their vices. Step Two: tweak their aggressions to desired focus,  establish a narrative,  destroying  "the free world &amp;#8482 ," Step 3: Profit, obviously. Step Four: Rebuild in one's own image.

       wash rinse repeat. i believe we are in the wash cycle.

       Do tell what anti vax propaganda is? Ever wonder why we have aluminum and mercury adjuvants in vaccines? Well becaus ethey're there to be anti fungals and to increase the immune response when administered. Unfortunately they're also highly neurotoxic, especially to young children. Ever wonder why double blind studies of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals are never done? Because they would show that unvaccinated individuals are more healthy than their vaccinated peers. Think of much money big pharma companies would lose? How how bad it would be to have a healthier population? You wouldn't want that now would you?

       I'm trying to understand what anyone has to benefit from being anti-vax. Makes no sense. Think about who would most likely have an agenda out of those two sides. The billion dollar business or parents worried for their children's safety. I know which one history tells us it is.

       She also tweeted stories that put forth debunked information about the danger of vaccines at least
a dozen times, Mediaite reported. Any link between autism and vaccines has been disproved by various studies over the years.
 Here's the propoganda,this is obviously not true and is the trigger piece that most uninformed/brainwashed will latch onto.

       The only vaccine ingredients that have been studied is thimerosal (10 or so)and the only vaccine studied is the MMR vaccine(another 10 or 15). Aluminium adjuvants are incredibly toxic and there is only 1 study the CDC bases the safety on (mitkus study) and its completely flawed. The science coming out now is showing the exact opposite of what the CDC is saying. The link is aluminium adjuvants go into the brain, cause massive rise in interleukin-6, brain inflammation, autism.

       The big pharma / cdc have done an amazing job at convincing people that the rise in the rate of autism is completely due to better diagnosis. Its gone from 1 in 10000 years ago to 1 in 32 boys, to think that you'd have to think doctors years ago were completely incompetent. How the hell this isnt a bigger issue amazes me. What happens when its 1 in 20 or 1 in 10. "oh its just better diagnosis" Load of shit.

       correct. I think it is already 1 in 20 for 2018 births. It is now 1 in 34(girls and boys) for 8 years old I think. Autism is now a bigger cost than Diabetes or Cancer the most important diseases of our time. They want us to believe that we could have overlooked something as big as Diabetes or Cancer.

       They are just covering up the damage they do. Look at this, how everyone says there is an increase and then the pharma shill comes and says doctors got so much smarter.

       the number varies, factors looked at include: location, race, gender, age.  blacks have a higher rate of autism than whites, boys have a higher rate of autism than girls, children have a higher rate of autism than adults by comparison (they also get more vaccines, 11 was the required in 1986, today its 53)

       I don't have a source for his number because I don't know what he used.

       1 in 59 from the cdc, but they use children of both genders, boys have a several fold increase in the rates of autism.

       these are the rates for vaccines, not hard to look up "vaccine schedule" on google, you don't need a talmud decoder ring.
