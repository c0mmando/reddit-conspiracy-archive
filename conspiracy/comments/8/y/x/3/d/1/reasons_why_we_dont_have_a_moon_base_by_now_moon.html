<p>Elon Musk is right saying, &quot;It’s 2017. We should have a lunar base by now. What the hell’s going on?” Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve gathered about the Moon Conspiracy Theories.</p>

<p>So the USA first landed on the Moon in 1969. We want to colonize Mars but we don&#39;t even have a Moon Base in 2018.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s some Conspiracy Theory reasons. Please comment &amp; I will add more to this list as we go.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Moon Landing was faked.</li>
<li>There&#39;s an Alien Base on the dark side of the moon &amp; they told us to stay away.</li>
<li>There&#39;s a Nazi Base on the dark side of the moon &amp; they told us to stay away.</li>
<li>The USA Secret Space Program already has a base there &amp; other planets in our Solar System.</li>
<li>There&#39;s vast amounts of Gold &amp; other precious elements on the moon that needs to be secretly mined or protected.</li>
<li>There&#39;s ancient alien artifacts, frozen aliens, bases &amp; crafts on the moon that need to be researched in secrecy first.</li>
<li>There&#39;s a &quot;firmament&quot; as described in the Bible that keeps us encapsulated on a &quot;flat&quot; Earth -- we&#39;re trapped like fish in a &quot;fishbowl&quot;. The farthest we can go is Low Earth Orbit where our Space Station &amp; Satellites are.</li>
<li>1 or more of the above.</li>
</ol>

<p>In my opinion #7 is the wildest theory of the bunch BUT the Bible does mention a &quot;firmament&quot;, so there&#39;s that at least.</p>

<p>Check this out. Flight from Taiwan to LA...Half way through the flight a woman went into labor and they had to make a emergency landing in Alaska. Look at the path of that on a globe and the path on a FE model and tell me which one makes more sense. </p>

<p>Question: Why do flights from the USA to Asia travel far north (above Alaska/Siberia) rather than the seemingly more direct &quot;straight line&quot; across the Pacific?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answer: It is shorter to fly the Great Circle route than a straight line due to the circumference of the earth being so much greater at the equator than near the poles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I have doubts of going to the moon. The radiation seems in sane. I think it&#39;s possible to fly rockets to the moon (obviously), but I do not think organic life could survive the radiation.</p>

<p>Before going to the moon I think we have to create a magnetic field which can deflect solar flairs and continuous radiation, similar to how the Earth does to protect organic life on this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think that? You can easily work out from the Apollo trajectory and the intensity of the Van Allen belts what radiation dose the astronauts would have received as they crossed them. The effects of ionizing radiation on the human body are well understood, therefore the (minimal) effect on the astronauts can be easily predicted.</p>

<p>Every satellite going beyond low-Earth orbit must be designed with those radiation belts in mind - special rad-hard chips are used, critical ones may have small metal shields. But that&#39;s because astronauts spent a few hours in the belts, but satellites may spend many years exposed to them.  </p>

<p>So to assume crossing the Van Allen belts is deadly is to assume they&#39;re vastly more intense than publicly stated. And since people designing satellites rely on that data, you must also assume that every single government, commercial or scientific entity that has ever launched a satellite is somehow in on the conspiracy.  </p>

<p>In the end, isn&#39;t it just more likely that the Americans went to the moon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mark Lehner  set up an experiment to see if it was possible to quarry, move and lift an obelisk weighing 1/10 of what the largest Egyptian obelisks weighed. It was filmed by NOVA and was an utter failure.</p>

<p>The team&#39;s master stonemason could not quarry the 35-ton obelisk so a bulldozer was called in. They could not move it, a truck was called in. These failures represent a turning a point in the long-standing debate.</p>

<p>Lehner actually confirmed what a Japanese team funded by Nissan had already learned in 1979, it is not possible to duplicate what the ancients did using primitive tools and methods.</p>

<p>Team Nissan was trying to prove something and they were very confident. But when they could not begin to excavate the blocks of stone they planned on using for their small scale-model of the Great Pyramid with ancient tools they turned to jackhammers.</p>

<p>When they tried to ferry the blocks they quarried across the river on a primitive barge, the stones sank. When a boat got them across the river they discovered that the sledges sank in the sand. They called trucks in to move the blocks to the site.</p>

<p>Once at the site they could not manipulate the blocks into place and found, to their ultimate embarrassment, that they could not bring the four walls together into an apex despite the deployment of helicopters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there are already bases on the dark side. Run most likely by the US but potentially Russia or China too(or either). If this is the case, why would they not tell anyone? </p>

<p>I think either, they have spent LOTS of money doing this but are still yet to reap any rewards, thus avoid pissing off tax payers or embarrass themselves. </p>

<p>Or they are slowly but surely developing it and they essentially have &#39;the best most secure bunker ever&#39; for when nuclear war or whatever destroys earth.</p>

<p>I think the latter is more likely. If the average Joe knew that the govt had a super massive livable base on the moon for emergencies, it would create doubt and even hostility amongst the population. It would also paint a target on where &#39;they&#39; are going or will be. </p>

The Nazi&#39;s we&#39;re into occult research &amp; maybe if they had more time, they could&#39;ve won with new advanced weaponry. After the Nazi&#39;s lost the war, &quot;Operation Paperclip&quot; was a then secret program where about 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians were taken to the USA for government employment including &quot;Wernher von Braun&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to speculate, if you had tons of gold (still unaccounted for <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/billions-dollars-treasure-looted-nazis-still-hidden-m.html">https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/billions-dollars-treasure-looted-nazis-still-hidden-m.html</a> ) and were losing a war - the best option would be to fake your death and escape.  The amount of money the Nazi&#39;s (more specifically, the upper echelon) had is nearly inconceivable.  That kind of money can move mountains (figuratively..).  It&#39;s precisely because they were that advanced that they could escape (to Argentina, or the South Pole or quite possibly the Moon?) and restart fresh with a smaller, more clandestine cabal.  It is my belief that the main &#39;losers&#39; of WWII started a splintered-off faction of humanity (with it&#39;s own ethos and goals) with nearly infinite resources.  The money has never been retrieved or accounted for.  It would be foolish to think it just disappeared.  That kind of money starts Empires or can influence politicians or pretty much anyone.  </p>

<p>So although speculation, it&#39;s quite conceivable that the Nazi&#39;s exited stage left after the War while every one was taking their finals bows and signing peace accords - to start again, unhindered by the base politics of mankind.  /shrug</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon landing consisted of a three-man crew and a lunar lander weighing just 18 US tons.</p>

<p>It was propelled there by a Saturn rocket.</p>

<p>The first stage of that rocket was essentially a fuel tank, and it burned up 770,000 liters of kerosene and 1.2 million liters of liquid oxygen.</p>

<p>All that fuel got the payload to an altitude of 67kms.</p>

<p>When the first stage of the rocket was jettisoned, the second stage kicked into gear. </p>

<p>The second stage of the rocket was also a fuel tank, and it burned 984,000 liters of liquid hydrogen 303,000 liters of liquid oxygen. </p>

<p>This total amount of fuel lasted a few seconds over nine minutes before it was exhausted and the second stage of the rocket was jettisoned.</p>

<p>The third stage of the rocket then activated.</p>

<p>This third stage was also a fuel tank, and it burned 252,750 liters of liquid hydrogen and 73,280 liters of liquid oxygen.</p>

<p>And all this fuel (which obviously is part of the total weight of the mission) was burned in under 15 minutes, just to get less than 20 tons of payload into a low-Earth orbit. The actual journey to the Moon hasn&#39;t even started by this stage.</p>

<p>So yeah, I cannot imagine why NASA hasn&#39;t been sending up near-armies of construction engineers, and a fleet of heavy machinery (and the fuel to power it all), along with all the necessary food and water supplies, radiation shielding, medical personnel, radio equipment, etc, etc, etc.</p>

<p>I dare say that the actual navigation and trajectory side of things would be a doddle these days. But it doesn&#39;t alter the fact that getting things into orbit is a huge effort and requires a massive rocket generating unbelievable amounts of thrust. </p>

<p>Even the space shuttle didn&#39;t manage to break free of that limitation. This isn&#39;t some lack of creative thinking, it is definitively un-get-round-able.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why speculative minds have been attracted to the concept of the &quot;space elevator.&quot; Which has different problems but of a similar magnitude, and that&#39;s why no-one is attempting to build one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The moon contains ancient/futuristic soul containment systems technology desinged to attrack our souls or spirits at point of death thats used to contain or farm our energy then when soul or spirt reviews past lifes and gives all it can to this moon system it gives us the option to go back as flesh forms and reincarnate. </p>

<p>They want to keep this a secret becuase it could fry ppls minds and they risk loosing control or risk ppl refusuing to reincarnate</p>

<p>Perhaps thats what the dark side of the moon is, a rather dark secret.</p>

<p>Who knows whats real? How deep of dream we may be in? How far we may have fallen?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL I added to point #11. As long as it is related to &quot;Moon Conspiracy Theories&quot;, it relates one way or another. After we compile a list of all of them, it&#39;s easier to see if we can &quot;connect the dots&quot;.</p>

<p>And for the moon base. Wouldn&#39;t we need rockets going back and forth to it to re supply it? NASA doesn&#39;t even do that, they have SpaceX do those missions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t it be cheaper to create a Moon Base than Mars Base? It would also take less fuel to launch from the Moon to Mars than Earth. Also, launching &quot;nuclear missiles&quot; to defend against &quot;Killer Asteroids&quot; would be faster &amp; more efficient from the Moon. It would make more sense to &quot;practice&quot; colonizing the moon before mars IMO.</p>
