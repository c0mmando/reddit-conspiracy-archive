       Antartica is very mysterious &amp; there are lots of Conspiracy Theories about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are no VISA requirements or travel documents needed to go to Antartica, good luck getting there. Once you're there, you'll definitely be tracked &amp; monitored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to "Global Warming" &amp; "Climate Change", they stress the need to protect the ice &amp; glaciers from melting rapidly due to increased human activity, so sea levels don't rise even more quickly than it already is.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Antarctic Treaty
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Antarctic Treaty" is an unusual occurrence in the realm of international relations. It is a treaty that does not recognize any sovereign nation's claim on any part of the Antarctic territory as well as a treaty that states that the purpose of the Antarctic continent is dedicated to "peace &amp; science".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Operation Highjump (1946 - 1947)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1947, Admiral Richard E. Byrd led 4,000 military troops from the U.S., Britain and Australia in an invasion of Antarctica called “Operation Highjump”.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is theorized that Byrd &amp; his forces encountered heavy resistance to their Antarctic venture from “flying saucers” and had to call off the invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conspiracy Theories
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the Conspiracy Theories about Antartica that I am aware of. Please comment &amp; I will add more to this list.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        There's a "Nazi Base" with "advanced unconventional weapons" there, where Hitler escaped to.
       </li>
       <li>
        There's an "Alien Base" with "advanced unconventional weapons" there.
       </li>
       <li>
        There's an entrance to "Inner Hollow Earth" there &amp; at Arctic Pole as well. That is why no one is authorized to fly over the poles.
       </li>
       <li>
        There's ancient Pyramids &amp; "flash frozen" human bodies there that need to be carefully excavated &amp; preserved.
       </li>
       <li>
        There's ancient Pyramids &amp; "flash frozen" alien bodies &amp; technology there that need to be carefully excavated &amp; preserved.
       </li>
       <li>
        There's an enormous "Wall of Ice" blocking us from "Other Lands" in a "Flat Earth" model.
       </li>
       <li>
        There's an enormous "Wall of Ice" holding up the "Dome Firmament" in a "Flat Earth" model.
       </li>
       <li>
        Due to highly elongated orbit of "Nibiru" (Planet X), it's approach can only be seen from the south pole of Antarctica. This is a potential "Extinction Level Event" (ELE) that needs to be suppressed, so mass "fear" &amp; "anarchy" doesn't spread. This is also related to the "Return of the Annunaki".
       </li>

       I'm just open minded about anything &amp; everything. Of course, I like many others want to know the real "Truth" -- even if it's frightening. Many enlightened people working together in synergy to solve any problem is better IMO than lies, secrets &amp; compartmentalization.

       I semi recently came to believe Antarctica might be like our last free space in a planetary game of monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all screw up so here’s a last ditch free space. Play fair and respect the gift, the game continues. Screw up again, game over. Your thoughts?

       Submerged continent? Lake Vostok is just a lake which has ice covering it. Just read the wiki and it's interesting, no evidence concerning the creatures. The only evidence was a YouTube video saying about a unusal shape on Google earth but it turned out to just be an unusual rock.

       I can understand where your coming from but evidence has shown that pole shifting takes millions of years (1 degree for every million years). No evidence for a rapid shift so far though which is the only way you would have catastrophic events such as tsunami's etc to cause an entire continent to be submerged.

       It is an hypothesis, somewhat valid by itself although not enough for judgment one way or another in my opinion, but I would not say that there is no evidence. For example the frozen mammoth found in Siberia, or Hapgood heory on the Piri Reis map.

       I'll read up on the mammoth one. Read up breifly on the Piri Reis map and it seems as though it was wrongly interpreted and later decided that it wasn't accurate and "serious scholarship holds that there is no reason to believe that the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast"

       I play some strategy games. Why destroy a resource when you can steal it? Why build what you can take and corrupt for your own ends? I'm not ruthless and calculating in real life but those games gave me a better understanding of systematic thinking. If you wanted revenge on an organization, making it an embarrassment and running counter to its previous goals would be pretty devastating. Then it's yours to use for other goals too.

       No one wants to believe anyone is smarter than they are! But even a dumb person can lie to or trick someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your viewpoint sounds similar to gnostic Christians, except most of them believed that Jesus would save us from the Demi-urge YHWH thing eating all those souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus, you threatened people with eternal torture if they didn't worship you. I blasphemed the holy spirit, which the bible states is unforgiveable. So what's up? You know what, I'm going to be good in spite of your threats and promises, on my thought out terms, for the sake of goodness,
       <em>
        because it's the right thing to do.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever is responsible for truth and love, I guess you could say I worship that. But not as a surrogate father figure, or murderous tribal king, or any blend of myth and legend that makes god into a character. It's something that we are all part of.

       If a flock of birds can move as one (seriously, watch sandpipers or another aerial acrobat swarm species) then it points to something like a morphic field. A near instantaneous transfer of energy / information. If the little birdies can do it, why can't we? And what if our electromagnetic fields are something MORE, something wonderful than meat and electricity? Our brains and nervous systems are electromagnetic says mainstream science. Electromagnetic fields extend and interact with fields beyond our skin and biological cells. Yet say that on the streets and you will be spat upon for blaspheming the white lab coat father teacher god that tells them how to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... if there are different kinds of herds, therefore different morphic fields, what's up with hominid fields? What if we, plus all the little birdies and bacteria, make up a collective connected energy field that makes shit happen? What if we are all partly responsible for the state of the world because we are all part of it? And what if that's the closest thing we have to god, an ever changing, mostly unseen field with countless inputs?
      </p>
      <p>
       A loving god with absolute power and knowledge would not make or allow such a world as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have been taught we have to pick between loving and strong, competent and vulnerable, blue or red, nerd or jock. Or just one identity, as if you are only what society uses you for. I'm Joe, the mechanic. I'm Joel, the accountant. Fuck that. So much has been twisted and hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       This looks like the planet of the apes, of self serving desires. All living creatures live, by definition, they try to survive. To do that they follow instinct to meet their needs. I manipulate my dog's instincts to lead it to behavior patterns I want. In this case I my training ultimately makes the dog more secure and happier than if I just let it "be natural" meaning confined in a house but neglected. I manipulate the dog with treats and deliberately timed praise, in turn it is manipulating me to provide more treats and praise. It's a symbiotic relationship where we both benefit, therefore it is ethical. The dog and I negotiate what we will give and get. Benevolent manipulation can exist. But I wouldn't say the dog has complete "free will" as if it were deciding rationally and spiritually to follow the treat biscuit each moment. Oh we're so different, eh? Well we are far from the only species to use tools, have a language, or love their families. If I haven't eaten all day, then ya wave a cheesecake slice near me, I'm willing to listen. Probably start salivating as my cheesecake memories and cheesecake reflexes kick in, nostrils fare with eagerness as more senses are engaged, and the bacteria in my gut that feeds off lactose, glucose what he you do what they can to influence on a chemical level. Energy is life so I better get that treat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But... I could say no to that slice of pie, or pussy, whatever. Having elevated myself above the level of a toddler, sometimes I exercise discipline. Ultimately human actions and emotional reactions are tied to survival or reproduction instincts in some way, sometgni that helped our ancestors DNA (and possibly more) survive and change based on trial and error in a changing world. Stuff like insults and shaming is still tied to survival and reproduction of DNA, because of the ear of being banished from he tribe having your resources limited. In some circumstances banishment is a literal threat too, as more than one "runaway:" could tell you. Our entertainment is usually people fucking, killing, swindling each other on screens, or mock war like in football. Survival stuff. Can't get out of animal mode as a world, not yet. Because the very real human tyrants that act in the name of God or the name of the dollar fuck us all up so we are easier to control. As if we are video game peons from a captured tribe. I open the HOLY bible and find story after stry of conquest and genocide and slavery done at the hands of the Hebrews. But God's ordered killings are nothing compared to the direct, active, conscious murders of han beings the story describes. The book "Drunk with Blood" counts them up. Something round 25 million is the estimate. Then Jesus doesn't execute but is all too ready to send people to Hellfire. Even curses a fig tree for not bearing fruit out season. Like what the fuck is this? I remember being a boy, learnign the word whore at age 10 from Genesis, not the only WTF moment. And I'm not Jewish so why is my whole family and town obsessed with Jewish legends?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to be a good person. Without all the mishmash of mespotamian campfire stories inspired by temple prostitutes and abusive father figures. Not always easy in this world. It doesn't help that a Luciferian network is only one of many competing criminal empires that have infiltrated religion, politics, business, war, and all levels of society.

       Well "they" are blocking any civilians from going there. There is something there they do not want us to see. It has to be a secret elite city there but I have no idea what they could be doing. I do believe there is ancient untouched human civilization somewhere on earth with technology that we think is alienly, that has closed themselves off from the rest of the world. I think they hide in Antarctica. This mostly coincides with Operation Highjump and Byrd and his crew were warned to see themselves out.

       The only parts that you are restricted from accessing are areas of ecological significance and these are usually islands of the coast of Antarctica. The tours will go to the same sites because it is a packaged tour, the same as a bus tour around Europe or a cruise in the Caribbean with a much lower temperature.

       Yes but you still don’t go where you’d be able to go if you went yourself. It’s like taking a tour of Europe and saying you’ve seen all of Europe, you haven’t you’ve just seen what they want you to see to paint a good picture of Europe.

       You can go and explore any part of Antarctica you like as an individual if you want to, excluding the areas that are protected by the Antarctic Treaty (areas of ecological significance basically). You do not need to go on the tour but if you do go on a prepackaged tour then yes, you are restricted by the tour company, not any particular nation's government.

       I'll preface this by saying I don't believe there's anything of note in Antarctica, but your argument is basically the same thing that North Korea employs to give a positive tour to foreigners. They only show the nice bits. Doesn't mean there's only nice bits (but there's a huge base of knowledge and accounts regarding the not so nice bits, obviously).

       The majority of the no go areas are due to the protection of flora and fauna, basically making sure that some moron doesn't introduce rodents or something that can destroy the fragile ecology like bacteria, viruses or fungi.

       I'm not trying to say that there IS these hidden cities or military bases or whatever. In fact I highly doubt there is. However I'm just saying that they technically could hide these things under the guise of protected areas like you said flora and fauna. We as every day people can't really know 100&amp;#37; unless we were allowed access to explore those areas ourselves.

       As a private citizen, you can go to any part of Antarctica. You may not necessarily have the skills to survive there but that is very different to not being allowed to go anywhere  in Antarctica.

       Sorry but as a private citizen you cannot go to any part of Antarctica, that is exactly what I am trying to tell you. Rich guys would be all over there with huge offroad vehicles. You will be stopped an questioned Im serious. Antarctica is off limits. If you were to go there as a private citizen that was rich for example in a bunch of tucker sno-cats, a full crew of people with wagons of food and shelters like tents etc, basically a mobile mini HQ, probably enough to cover a couple hundred miles and back you would legitimately be stopped. Most likely CIA would show up some time before. Why do you not think anyone is doing this?

       The reason why rich guys aren't doing this is most likely because there is no financial reward at the end of this. Basically, they cannot set up shop to extract minerals. Yet.

       While tours there are a thing, people are only allowed to visit a very strict pre planned route and are only allowed to visit established out posts near the coast. They do not allow people to travel into the interior of the continent's where these conspiracies are said to be located.

       As a private citizen, you can plan your own expeditions to any point in Antarctica from any point in Antarctica. This is not the same as having the necessary skills to do this. The tours are a money making venture and will be going to fixed places like any package holiday

       The "abiotic" oil theory postulates that oil is a natural part and product of the inner Earth's chemistry and known thermodynamics that has nothing at all to do with any ancient plant or animal life on the planet's surface, (which was and still is an 18th century notion that no mechanism exists for and that has never actually been proven in any demonstrable way).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Russians, however, have done extensive scientific research for over 50 years to arrive at that abiotic theory, which they consider to be a scientific fact and not some theory at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the theory has accurately predicted and led to the finding of at least a dozen major oil and gas wells deep beneath crystalline rock layers in areas that were rejected and discounted because they were unlikely prospects for those looking for fields where ancient plant and animal life would most likely to have been abundant and buried and crushed over eons of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Russians there is no shortage or limit to the amounts that are yet to be found in those much deeper reservoirs which they believe are the actual source through cracks and fissures of what has already been tapped at far lesser depths.

       One thing that I've found interesting having worked in oil and healthcare is that oil wells almost have a pulse when they're first opened. Like it's the equivalent of a mosquito bite, a good spurt that slowly tapers off and dies down, then a pump installed later to keep it flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the shale/bakken boom, I was on or around numerous locations that were drilled conventionally in the 1940's that they thought had gone dry but sprang to back to life or had pressures increase when other new wells in about a 5 mile radius were fracked. So that sort of tells you that the 1940's reservoirs had a deeper source or it's just a series of reservoirs which means there are probably pockets of oil at all depths.

        "The continent as a whole was much warmer and more humid than it currently is today," says Gulbranson, a professor at University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee. The landscape would have been densely forested with a low-diversity network of resilient plants that could withstand polar extremes, like the boreal forest in present-day Siberia.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Oddly enough, these field sites would have actually been very close to what their current latitude is," he adds.

       Yea, Antarctica was once a continent that resembled the swamps of Florida. What changed was that the ecosystem became dominated by freshwater plants that just sat on the surface of a lake or river and ate up CO2 while producing oxygen. Thanks to this temperatures started falling rapidly and now we got the ice continent.

       Thanks for sharing. I added this to #9 as the warm caves could support life in conjunction with under the ice fresh water lakes -- especially life that developed differently in an isolated environment.

       LOL ... keep in mind that these are all just "theories" in a long list of Conspiracy Theories about Antarctica. If we had definitive proof, there wouldn't be need for discussion right? I made this post, so that we can all discuss Conspiracy Theories related to Antarctica no matter how "unbelievable" it may sound.

       this whole comment is fucking pants on head retarded. our concept of "up" and "down" is based on the gravitational pull of celestial bodies. up is anything going away from the center of gravity and down is going closer to the center of gravity

       Scientists say they discovered hundreds of isolated "fresh" water lakes underneath the ice. The largest one is "Lake Vostok". When the Russian scientists were researching the region they came across the frightening creature which they called "Organism 46b". This creature can "shape change" to mimic the shape of divers. It can paralyze people with strong venom from 150 ft away before eating it's prey. They found this out the hard way of course.

       should practice finding their own sources, multiple sources. Prove it to yourself! Or "debunk" it yourself. Think about degrees of certainty. Arguing on the internet about trustworthy sources is not enough, it's asking strangers to tell you which authority is reliable.

       Stop demanding links without trying to find it first! An initial search takes about as much time as a comment.

       The theory is objectively false when the right sources are found and thus there's no point in even posting it. Googling for a few minute showed me that the first source ever that claimed the existence of this organism was a British tabloid that quoted people that were probably made up. No official source has ever answered on the topic and a credible newspaper or researcher has never written on it. It says a lot when the first search thst comes up is cryptids wikia page.

       I doubt anyone in the general public has evidence of "Organism 46b", especially if it is being "weaponized". Let's evaluate the basic claims though. It's supposedly a giant squid or octopus that evolved in isolation for millions of years in  a lake that has 10 times concentration of oxygen. It's highly intelligent. It can camouflage &amp; shape change. All the claims seem to be a stretch but not a far stretch, considering what we already know about "cephalopods". Also consider the fact that we only relatively recently have proof of the existence of the mythical "giant squid".

       OP never accepted it as truth, though. In fact, OP seems to generally be going out of their way to use words like "supposedly". OP even says further up that it's a stretch, just not a giant one.

       All they're saying is that it's possible. The whole point of this post is posting possibilities, some more likely than others.

      <p>
       One of the biggest problems in this sub is that some people seem to believe that if you post a comment or a link about a mere possibility, you must also wholeheartedly believe what you've posted about. That obviously can't happen in a conspiracy sub, but for whatever reason some people expect it anyway.

       That's my thought too.

       Maybe we lived there at some point and then the poles shifted, making Antarctica a frozen wasteland and thawing out where we live today. Might've happened very fast too, since supposedly there's still a lot if frozen greenage under the ice, and a lot of unfrozen places are still so barren.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might also explain lost locations like the Garden of Eden or Atlantis

       It makes sense when you consider the Conspiracy Theory about "Nibiru" &amp; "Nibiru Cataclysm" with it's elongated orbit that passes every several thousand years. When it comes close to Earth, it most certainly would affect Earth before it slingshots out to space again.

       Have you heard about the recent discovery of Planet Nine that is hypothesized to follow a highly elliptical orbit around the Sun lasting 10,000–20,000 years. So apparently, there many "objects" with eccentric &amp; elongated orbits. "Gravitational Pull" is why they even orbit our Sun but imagine if one the size of Earth gets close to affect our own orbit &amp; rotation around the Sun? Imagine if our Solar System is binary star system, as hypothesized too, and that other "Sun" comes near our "Sun"? What kind of Gravitational Pull is the Earth going to get pulled apart from? Source:

       LOL ... The main point of this post is to list off "all" the Antarctica related Conspiracy Theories out there. They are not my theories &amp; you can find more details about each one listed on your own with simple Google searches. Once we have collaborated &amp; listed off all the "theories", we can try to "connect the dots" to see which ones seem more plausible.

       'pole shift' theory sounds like someone misunderstood the whole thing about
       <em>
        magnetic
       </em>
       pole shift. The magnetic pole can and does shift due to the internals of the Earth being liquid iron. But this has nothing to do with a
       <em>
        physical
       </em>
       shift where i.e. the Earth flips over in its orbit and south becomes north etc. A physical shift would require an enormous outside event like another planet crashing into Earth (but that would likely destroy the whole planet anyway).

       Actually that's my understanding as well, I appreciate you clarifying that. I was a bit hasty in my comment. It has also been a long time since I read Hancock's books. Through continental drift, or some cataclysmic event, it is possible that the earth shifted somehow to change the climate of Antarctica. I don't find it likely though. I just don't like to rule out things I don't have to. Mostly I wanted the idea of Antarctica being some kind of Lemuria, Atlantis, or cradle of civilization to be on the list of unusual ideas.

       Hapgoods theory of pole shift is that the earth wobbles and every so often the wobble gets larger and cause the earth to roll so the poles shift. Not necessarily full north to south but enough to make the poles relocate

       best conspiracy theories I heard is that it's a place for geo engineering the weather. The o-zone hole is proof of this somehow. And given its central location on the map, maybe it does have large effects on the earth's weather what they do there.

       Definitively some very dark things happening there. The documentary mentioned in the 1950s that the plan to carve up the Continent and prevent any national aspirations was an early attempt at UN control and "cooperation". Antartica in many ways was the first post national experiment and they had big plans for it.

       Just thought of another one, the claim that the Extra Biblical book of Enoch mentions a Mountain range there.
      </p>
      <p>
       That it is where the Fallen Angels are Imprisoned, In the book of Enoch, It says they gave man technology, things like Metallurgy, Chemistry, Herbal medicine, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of stuff in that that could correlate with other extra terrestrial and Nazi conspiracies as well.

       Thank you. This is a very good one. I remember hearing about this too. It's even more intriguing &amp; mysterious because it includes the forbidden "Book of Enoch" &amp; "Fallen Angels". I'll add this to the list.

       Apparantly Admiral Byrds personal diary was recently released and he wrote of the hollow earth and an advanced civilization. It apparantly states he was sworn to secrecy but wrote about his encounter in his personal journal so that one day the truth would come out. Either he was bat shit crazy or their is an advanced civilization there.

       Admiral Byrd is a very interesting man. He went to both the "north" &amp; "south" poles. I doubt they would entrust someone "bat shit crazy" to be in charge of "Antarctic Developments Project" with "Operation Highjump" &amp; "Operation Deep Freeze" for example. Operation Highjump included "Taskforce 68" with 4700 men, 13 ships, and 33 aircraft. That seems like an invasion force to me &amp; not just a scientific expedition. LOL

       that was just one example, what about schizo spectrum, bipolar, DID, PTSD BPD, substance abuse/or the resulting DTs (which cause audible/visual haluciantions and paranoia?

       Abstract:
      </p>
      <p>
       Martha Deane interviews Byrd, his opinion on socialism, power of government, communism and human relations. Additionally Byrd talks about his stay in Antarctica and how he almost died of carbon monoxide poisoning from the stove in his shack during his second expedition to Antarctica (1933-1935).
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       His "visions" at the time of his second expedition were they result of carbon monoxide poisoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this interview he talks about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To show just how serious and mind-altering CO poisoning is, there is the well know story on where a redditer was writing notes to himself and he thought it was some else stalking him until until a commentor put two and two together.

       I googled it personally. As with everything on the internet I do take it with a grain of salt. Thats why I say apparantly. I didnt buy a copy just read about it and watched a video of it being read.

       Yes I understand the vernacular. Just trying to point out that a theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. While a hypothesis, is just that, an unsupported a guess.

       Atlantis is there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I speculate/theorize there is a supervolcano there, they can call it a mantle plume but I see it as a supervolcano, there are also tons of volcano's already present on Antarctica.
      </p>
      <p>
       That explains the volcanic winter, but does NOT explain how there is soo much ice/water built up, so my theory is cool, but likely not the culprit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The volcanic event was likely a secondary event caused by the true cause of the water/ice buildup, like the younger dryas event or something.....
      </p>
      <p>
       But..... who knows?

       The reason travel to Antartica is discouraged is because 1. Its a difficult place to get to and the southern ocean is a dangerous place making help for rescues hard to come by and 2. Once there it is an inhospitable sparsely populated place making it difficult to survive and get help if you need a rescue.

       But yeah go there and have a look around and get into some trouble costing some country you don’t pay taxes too millions trying to save you and your dumb ass.

       and we all want to believe, but Antarctica is a massive continent covered in fucking ice and constantly being battered by gale force winds. No shit people aren't strolling all over it. The nearest city is like a thousand miles away.

       You're right but I find it "odd" that there were so many "high profile" visits to go see "penguins &amp; ice" so far. I find it odd that the Roman Catholic Church Pope &amp; Russian Orthodox Patriarch would meet after almost 1000 years of not &amp; then the Patriarch would go to Antarctica to perform a "ritual". This is more odd considering the Conspiracy Theory about the "Ark of Gabriel" &amp; the forbidden religious book of "Book of Enoch" are related.

       The Piri Reis map was compiled from other sources and depicts Antarctica accurately without ice. This is something that was only recently achieved technologically, mapping under the ice of Antarctica. So the question arises, how the hell did they map it way back then.

       The map doesn't even depict the coast of Spain accurately. The logical and probably true explanation is that the Antarctica that we see on the map is actually Southern America since the map shows 'Antarctica' and SA connecting. The map is probably like this because the map was compiled from different sources and not because Piri Reis himself visited these lands.

       Why does it matter if you have "2 engines" or 1 over the "north pole"? Wouldn't it make more sense to have that apply to aircraft that could potentially crash over heavily populated areas instead? rather than unpopulated land? Are they implying that "polar bears" are more important than "humans" with regards to safety?

       well in the event of a single engine failure a plane over land has a small chance to make an emergency landing and even if it crashes its most likely in a place than it can be recovered in a timely manner. In either of the poles, you tend to be thousands of miles any from any sort of help or recovery, thats why you need 3 or more engines to cross a pole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also why the fucking is all that is quotes? does you not know how those work or are you so crazy you thinks all those are fake?

       You're right, they're so concerned &amp; care so much about people's safety regardless of how well maintained airplanes are &amp; the probability of a catastrophic engine failure. I can't believe airplanes are allowed to fly over the great Pacific &amp; Atlantic Oceans. LOL ... there are also accounts of people who went to the "north" &amp; "south" poles that make fantastic claims -- including Admiral Byrd.

       I'll preface this by saying I have no prior knowledge regarding any of this. Doing a quick search, I can't find any mention that twin-engine planes are specifically barred from flying over the Arctic, but based on travel distance to a suitable airport.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would include Trans-Pacific flights but I'll be honest in that I'm at work and don't care all that much to dig into it further. Look up ETOPS which appears to be the basis of the claim.

       what if they discovered some technologies and more importantly a history book written by these advanced beings?

       what if things (tech) got so advanced in their history that things such as a nuclear bombs can easily be made by the populace at their stage of technological progress?
      </p>
      <p>
       what if these issues caused their leaders to execute and get rid of all "morally impure" beings and their society was such a dystopia that made 1984 seem like childsplay?

       things seem to be at a standstill in terms of technological progress.  moore's law is dead.  free energy is supressed.  most in guise of artificial slowdown of progress for squeezing the most profit from smallest of incremental advancements.  that might just be a cloak over another cloak.  something bigger going on.

       Apparently people still sail there. I found this article:
       <a href="http://www.bwsailing.com/bw/cruising-news/antarctica-on-our-own/">

       The point that sticks out to me is the need to have a dingy ahead of your yacht to guide the bigger boat through the ice.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the main risk seems to be lack of proper planning, like the guys in this story:
       <a href="https://www.yachtingworld.com/blogs/elaine-bunting/antarctic-deaths-enormous-ramifications-6330">

       Another ‘conspiracy’ factor to consider is if ‘they’ make you disappear, it would bring attention to the area and likely search parties would converge to where you disappeared...

       Just the fact about the heads of the Russian Orthodox Church &amp; Roman Catholic Church meeting in almost 1000 years &amp; Patriarch Kirill going to Antarctica afterwards to perform a "ritual", are reasons enough to know there's something going on in "Biblical proportions". Maybe even the "Pope" secretly went there too or is going there in the future. The fact that the "Nazis" were also looking for this "Ark" (Ark of Gabriel or Covenant), which also adds mystery to it. The Nazis were looking for "religious relics" like "Spear of Destiny" too.

       Oh ... LOL but in a respectful way. Yes, it's interesting these "Operation" code names. I always assumed "Highjump" may refer to trying to jump over the "Wall of Ice". Another example is "Operation Fishbowl", which allegedly nuclear missiles to test the "Dome Firmament". The code name metaphorically implies that we're all trapped in "fishbowl". I also agree the "true patriots &amp; heroes" are the ones that risk their life &amp; limb to "do the right thing" for the people &amp; not because it's their job to, like Phil Schneider &amp; Edward Snowden to name a few.

       I had been thinking that they are building a large bunker to protect a group of people from solar flares that may wipe out most of the human race. My thinking was that they would house government leaders , the pope , and other people who may be able to help maintain humanity and rebuild if and when it’s safe to re-emerge.

       This is getting a little deeper but this may also be why Elon Musk is trying so passionately to get things going on Mars. Maybe he wants to see if he can evacuate people and sustain them on his base there.

       Why Antarctica though? They're allegedly already building "underground bunkers" like the one supposedly under "Denver Airport" for example. In an ELE where the Earth burns for example, the ice won't protect them but it may provide sources of fresh water at least. Also, they have "Svalbard Global Seed Vault" &amp; other related vaults for "redundancy" sake to ensure the survival of DNA for example.

       I guess I was thinking more about coronal mass ejections. Maybe they wouldn’t cause deaths directly but they would indirectly through just shear chaos. Antarctica, being as difficult as it is to get there without t technology, would be a safe place.

       You're right. It is alleged they discovered the frightening "Organism 46b" the hard way, managed to capture one &amp; are "weaponizing" it. Considering 1 can potentially lay "thousands" of eggs &amp; they can potentially live in any body of water, it's something to potentially be concerned about.

       Yes Biological Warfare &amp; the "Agenda 21 Depopulation" Conspiracy Theory with new forms of bacteria &amp; viruses is concerning -- especially if it was like Prometheus movie style or Zombies. Organism 46b seems plausible too because of what we know about "cephalopods". It's a stretch but not an impossible stretch considering it developed "isolated" for potentially thousands of years or more.

       Interesting post but organism 46-B sounds like a load of shit. I can't gind any official sources on its existence, the best I get are Youtube videos with a bots voiceover and irrelevant websites. The story saying that it could paralyze foes from 150 feet away, disable communications and strangle someone with a dismembered limb sound fantastical af.

       Let's hope so because if it was "real" &amp; was "weaponized", imagine what it would do to unsuspecting people in all the fresh water lakes in the USA for example. One of them can potentially lay "thousands" of eggs like other cephalopods. Scary thought. I think I'm going to stick to chlorinated swimming pools for awhile. LOL ;p

       Google "buzz aldrin evil itself tweet". There's lots of sources mentioning this with images &amp; videos. It's more likely a Buzz Aldrin Twitter "parody" account that tweeted it IMO. You can try tweeting or DMing him but he'll probably ignore you. LOL ...

       One thing that I've found interesting having worked in oil and healthcare is that oil wells almost have a pulse when they're first opened. Like it's the equivalent of a mosquito bite, a good spurt that slowly tapers off and dies down, then a pump installed later to keep it flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the shale/bakken boom, I was on or around numerous locations that were drilled conventionally in the 1940's that they thought had gone dry but sprang to back to life or had pressures increase when other new wells in about a 5 mile radius were fracked. So that sort of tells you that the 1940's reservoirs had a deeper source or it's just a series of reservoirs which means there are probably pockets of oil at all depths.

       If a flock of birds can move as one (seriously, watch sandpipers or another aerial acrobat swarm species) then it points to something like a morphic field. A near instantaneous transfer of energy / information. If the little birdies can do it, why can't we? And what if our electromagnetic fields are something MORE, something wonderful than meat and electricity? Our brains and nervous systems are electromagnetic says mainstream science. Electromagnetic fields extend and interact with fields beyond our skin and biological cells. Yet say that on the streets and you will be spat upon for blaspheming the white lab coat father teacher god that tells them how to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... if there are different kinds of herds, therefore different morphic fields, what's up with hominid fields? What if we, plus all the little birdies and bacteria, make up a collective connected energy field that makes shit happen? What if we are all partly responsible for the state of the world because we are all part of it? And what if that's the closest thing we have to god, an ever changing, mostly unseen field with countless inputs?

       A loving god with absolute power and knowledge would not make or allow such a world as this.

       We have been taught we have to pick between loving and strong, competent and vulnerable, blue or red, nerd or jock. Or just one identity, as if you are only what society uses you for. I'm Joe, the mechanic. I'm Joel, the accountant. Fuck that. So much has been twisted and hidden.

       This looks like the planet of the apes, of self serving desires. All living creatures live, by definition, they try to survive. To do that they follow instinct to meet their needs. I manipulate my dog's instincts to lead it to behavior patterns I want. In this case I my training ultimately makes the dog more secure and happier than if I just let it "be natural" meaning confined in a house but neglected. I manipulate the dog with treats and deliberately timed praise, in turn it is manipulating me to provide more treats and praise. It's a symbiotic relationship where we both benefit, therefore it is ethical. The dog and I negotiate what we will give and get. Benevolent manipulation can exist. But I wouldn't say the dog has complete "free will" as if it were deciding rationally and spiritually to follow the treat biscuit each moment. Oh we're so different, eh? Well we are far from the only species to use tools, have a language, or love their families. If I haven't eaten all day, then ya wave a cheesecake slice near me, I'm willing to listen. Probably start salivating as my cheesecake memories and cheesecake reflexes kick in, nostrils fare with eagerness as more senses are engaged, and the bacteria in my gut that feeds off lactose, glucose what he you do what they can to influence on a chemical level. Energy is life so I better get that treat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But... I could say no to that slice of pie, or pussy, whatever. Having elevated myself above the level of a toddler, sometimes I exercise discipline. Ultimately human actions and emotional reactions are tied to survival or reproduction instincts in some way, sometgni that helped our ancestors DNA (and possibly more) survive and change based on trial and error in a changing world. Stuff like insults and shaming is still tied to survival and reproduction of DNA, because of the ear of being banished from he tribe having your resources limited. In some circumstances banishment is a literal threat too, as more than one "runaway:" could tell you. Our entertainment is usually people fucking, killing, swindling each other on screens, or mock war like in football. Survival stuff. Can't get out of animal mode as a world, not yet. Because the very real human tyrants that act in the name of God or the name of the dollar fuck us all up so we are easier to control. As if we are video game peons from a captured tribe. I open the HOLY bible and find story after stry of conquest and genocide and slavery done at the hands of the Hebrews. But God's ordered killings are nothing compared to the direct, active, conscious murders of han beings the story describes. The book "Drunk with Blood" counts them up. Something round 25 million is the estimate. Then Jesus doesn't execute but is all too ready to send people to Hellfire. Even curses a fig tree for not bearing fruit out season. Like what the fuck is this? I remember being a boy, learnign the word whore at age 10 from Genesis, not the only WTF moment. And I'm not Jewish so why is my whole family and town obsessed with Jewish legends?

       I just want to be a good person. Without all the mishmash of mespotamian campfire stories inspired by temple prostitutes and abusive father figures. Not always easy in this world. It doesn't help that a Luciferian network is only one of many competing criminal empires that have infiltrated religion, politics, business, war, and all levels of society.

       You're right. It is alleged they discovered the frightening "Organism 46b" the hard way, managed to capture one &amp; are "weaponizing" it. Considering 1 can potentially lay "thousands" of eggs &amp; they can potentially live in any body of water, it's something to potentially be concerned about.
