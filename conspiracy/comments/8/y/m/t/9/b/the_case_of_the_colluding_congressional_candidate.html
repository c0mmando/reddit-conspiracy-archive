        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the Mueller indictment, a &quot;candidate for US Congress&quot; reached out to Guccifer 2.0 for documents stolen from the DCCC, and received said documents.</p>

<p>Speculation is flying as to who that candidate is. Some guesses are Republican Ron DeSantis, Democrat Joe Garcia (who won his primary but lost in the general), Republicans Matt Gaetz, Brian Mast, Dana Rohrabacher, or Devin Nunes.</p>

<p>The voters in the district of whoever this candidate was have a right to know if this person is on the ballot coming up again. They have a right to know if they unwittingly voted for someone who colluded with Russian intelligence. And if this person is in Congress, they have a right to know if their best interests are being represented.</p>

<p>Mueller needs to reveal who the candidate is ASAP. </p>

<p>In psychology we say the biggest predictor of future behavior is past behavior. The intelligence community has a long history of lying to the American people in order to manufacture consent for unpopular courses of action, like Iraq, fir the camper.</p>

<p>I’m wondering if you’ve always been so trusting of the intelligence community. And why you’re so willing to trust them now?</p>

<p>But I get it.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re choosing to deny the evidence and spin the outcome.  How would this be manufacturing consent?  How do you resolve this with all the other evidence and public admissions from members of the administration about their meetings with Russians and trying to get ahold of Hillary&#39;s emails so they could use it for their campaign?  It&#39;s pretty damning when Donald Trump Jr admitted taking a meeting with Russians, along with Manafort, Flynn and Kushner, to get these very same emails.  Roger Stone bragged about getting the emails from the guys talked about in this indictment.  That corroborates the veracity of this evidence.  Finally, we have Donald Trump himself requesting Russia to hack those documents on TV.</p>

<p>I mean at some point your argument holds no water.  It&#39;s denial for the sake of denial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Trump jokingly ask Russia to recover Hillary’s 33,000 deleted emails if he was secretly colluding with them? That doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>Yes members of Trumps team met with some Russian citizens apparently because they were trying to lobby Trump to lift the Magnitsky Act. But I thought we were talking about collusion between Trump and the Russian government. Do you have any evidence emails were offered in that meeting?</p>

<p>I understand it. You hate Trump, you can’t understand why he got elected, and you’re desperately searching for an explanation, so you’re willing to overlook any and all inconsistencies. </p>

<p>He isnt joking.  We&#39;ve seen that by his actions.</p>

<p>The evidence is corroborated by actual emails and previous prior admissions.  Donald Trump Jr&#39;s emails didnt mention the Magnitsky Act, they mentioned Hillary&#39;s emails.  He made it very clear that was his priority.  The fact they keep bringing an adoption act as a cover for their meetings they had originally failed to disclose is a farce.  The evidence is literally in front of your face.</p>

<p>I understand you support Trump, slavishly, and refuse to accept any evidence he might guilty.  That&#39;s your choice.  It&#39;s willful ignorance and you have an agenda to spin the evidence to deflect and cast doubt on it because you refuse to Trump might be guilty.</p>

<p>You&#39;re the one willing to overlook the evidence here, not me.  Quit projecting.  You pretty much made your agenda clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty clear you do support Trump despite you saying you dont.  I can read your comment history always trying to deflect in defense of Trump and apologizing for his administration or supporting the undermining of the investigation into Russia&#39;s involvement with the election.</p>

<p>Look at the evidence.  Be objective based on the evidence.</p>

<p>I support better relations with Russia, but make no mistake, they are an adversary and private citizens meeting with them to talk about the release of illegally obtained emails in order to influence an election is collusion as it is defined.  This evidence connects a bunch of dots, many of which from prior disclosures by the people implicated in Trump&#39;s campaign.  </p>

<p>In your mind, the email evidence is tainted because of the intelligence community, and the public admissions are just jokes.  That&#39;s a pretty pathetic defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can’t say it’s a fact if there isn’t any evidence. As of now, there’s no evidence Russia interfered in the election. </p>

<p>I do not think it’s ok for candidates to collude with foreign governments whether it’s Russia, Israel, Saudi Arabia, etc. </p>

<p>It’s amazing to me that Hillary’s campaign chair was a registered foreign agent on Saudi Arabia’s payroll. Imagine if that was Trump.</p>

<p>So, exactly like the 13 Russians he charged and then delayed the trial when they actually showed up in court and asked him to show the evidence? </p>

<p>How’s that trial going? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors on special counsel Robert Mueller&#39;s team are asking a judge to delay the first court hearing in a criminal case against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities, according to court documents filed Friday.</p>

<p>But the motion revealed that lawyers for Concord Management made a series of discovery requests seeking records, including statements and electronic surveillance of the company&#39;s executives and employees, from Mueller&#39;s investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like this new indictment, the indictment of the 13 Russians was just political theater and propaganda. When they actually showed up in court, Mueller was forced to delay the trial because they case will get dismissed on lack of evidence. The bar to get an indictment is extremely low. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t speculating on the guilt or innocence of the the allegations if that helps you see my words more clearly.  I am not fighting a side here.</p>

<p>The indictments are allegations.  Plain and simple.  They are alleged crimes.  The facts presented in them can be argued and possibly disproved.  We cant just throw around the word fact just because the government put it on a piece of papers.</p>

<p>I didnt move from confirm to prove anywhere in my statement, but even if I did I dont see a whole hell of a difference.  I am not playing word games with you, or making a political argument here.</p>

<p>I am saying that an indictment is allegations.  You cannot use an indictment to establish a fact as you claim in Mueller is doing.</p>

<p>I get it.  You don&#39;t like Trump.  But there is no reason to ignore common sense just because it helps your argument.</p>
