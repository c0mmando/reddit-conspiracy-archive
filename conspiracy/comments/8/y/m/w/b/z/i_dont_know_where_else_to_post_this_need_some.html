       Mods if this is not the correct forum, please remove. Hello all, first time posting here, would like help on a unique situation my family has found itself in. We own land that was handed down to us and recently received a notice from the FCC stating that they will be installing a communications tower on our property. Now for obvious reasons, we object to the placement of this tower. I have been seeing posts online and hearing from people that these towers are radiation hotspots causing headaches and other problems. Also they are an eyesore. My question to the conspiracy community is besides the legal route, is there any other way to prevent their installation? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

       it's your land fight them in every way. i am land surveyor by trade and i have found that you keep on fighting them, even if they threatened emanate domain, they will take you to court or ask your neighbor. but if you refuse in every way they can't do it. i hear they pay alot to put a tower on your property. Did they make you an offer?

       Property Taxes aren't what makes the land not technically yours, imo...it's the legal claim to eminent domain and the "greater good" that allows the government, both locally and Federally, to take your land if they so desire. They've simply created a legal mechanism of disenfranchisement.

       Taxation is more of a Social Contract though. It's a societal agreement to assess what one owns in order to determine how much one ought to pay back to society. You can disagree with the concept, but it doesn't disenfranchise the landowners. Eminent domain makes it so that you never Truly own your land permanently- not taxes.

       If you are worried that you can't meet the expectations of the social contract for your area regarding taxation, you should be free to move to another community where you feel you can.

       No, it's your property. But it's also up to you to choose carefully where you live and to engage with the local political landscape there. If a commune of People democratically decides that, within their borders (such as that of a Municipality), they shall all agree to pay a certain percentage in taxes based on the value of their property, that is their Right as a community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your Right as an individual within that community is to engage politically for or against these measures, and also to leave with all movable property and to sell the property you retain there, if you so desire.

       Nope letter states that we have a right to appeal but that it will basically go up anyways under some legal guideline. Also we are not rich people so getting a lawyer and fighting it will be very expensive and properly a waste anyways as courts will side with the government.

       Should be an easy case that you can get pro-bono work for.  Hunt around.  The payoff will be worth it.  If your worried about radiation, sell the land outright and move somewhere nicer.

       i am wondering, where do you live? is a rural area or highly populated? because i dont understand why a company would spend millions of dollars just to have coverage for a few people unless it is meant for much more then cell phones and internet. where i live it is a rural area and we have cell phone towers in the middle of no where, where only a couple farmers live and everything else is farm land. it doesn't seem economical at all.

       Yeah, I think the only way a phone company could force you to put up a tower is if the tower is deemed essential to public safety. E.g., there is no communications connection to a town.

       Interesting. I didn't know that the FCC actually owned/operated any hardware, I thought their "mission" was bureaucratic -- overseeing permits, license, compliance and such.

       It's probably radio or to expand communications between services for police, fire, or emt communications. There is no telling though.

       If it's your actually 100&amp;#37; your land that your land, you can (and should) fight it to the extremis.

      <p>
       Ignoring any particular merit of whatever it is that is proposed(I personally think that communications/radio-tech is fairly innocuous to humans and should be spread); if YOU are not certain or actively disagree with whatever it is that is going to happen on YOUR land, you should resist and resist and resist.

       Could be a new tower for 5G hardware...which is shorter range, thus the need for more towers between existing towers.  However, to be frank, the only people I've ever known to lease their land for cell towers have never made much of anything from it.  One family I knew received $15 per month for letting a company put a cell tower on their land.  This was a decade ago, but still, I can't imagine it being very lucrative for the leaser even today.

       I've been to some of the towers in Central/Southern California and a lot of them are one private property. I'm not sure how much fighting you can do if they've decided this is a good strategic spot to expand communications for the state or county.  They'll probably just drop eminent domain if you guys try to fight and pay you pennies on the dollar for that portion of the property.

       You do not have to pay much, or anything, for attorney consultations. You can at the very least go to a couple lawyers and see what they have to say for a minimal fee. Many might even have a free consultation. I always recommend doing that for any legal problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       People think that they’re going to have to pay thousands and thousands of dollars to get any advice, but you can get a lot of advice during the consultation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That way, you’ll know what your rights are and by knowing that, you can do research and represent yourself, if needed.

       I am in Real Estate and you should appeal this. See if your neighbors will go along with it too. The more people that go up against this the better. Call the local news, radio stations, attorneys, state reps, mayor, etc... Call everyone you can and make it about David and Goliath. The problem is that if they go with eminent domain, you may be screwed if you don't have the money to fight it. Even then, you won't win. How much land do you own?

       Side note, I contacted , a congressman(Diane Black) in my area a couple of weeks ago for a client buying a home with a VA loan.  Anyway, we sent her an email, her people got back with us the next day, we told them we needed help with the VA redtape on my clients loan and they got on it. I haven't ever done that before but it was awesome to have the full power of a person in congress actually get something done for the little guy. I will give it to her, she did it, got my client his house and I will be voting for her when she runs for Gov

       Taxation is more of a Social Contract though. It's a societal agreement to assess what one owns in order to determine how much one ought to pay back to society. You can disagree with the concept, but it doesn't disenfranchise the landowners. Eminent domain makes it so that you never Truly own your land permanently- not taxes.
