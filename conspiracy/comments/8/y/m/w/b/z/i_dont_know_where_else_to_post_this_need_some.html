Hello all, first time posting here, would like help on a unique situation my family has found itself in. We own land that was handed down to us and recently received a notice from the FCC stating that they will be installing a communications tower on our property. Now for obvious reasons, we object to the placement of this tower. I have been seeing posts online and hearing from people that these towers are radiation hotspots causing headaches and other problems. Also they are an eyesore. My question to the conspiracy community is besides the legal route, is there any other way to prevent their installation? Any advice is greatly appreciated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s your property. But it&#39;s also up to you to choose carefully where you live and to engage with the local political landscape there. If a commune of People democratically decides that, within their borders (such as that of a Municipality), they shall all agree to pay a certain percentage in taxes based on the value of their property, that is their Right as a community.</p>

<p>Your Right as an individual within that community is to engage politically for or against these measures, and also to leave with all movable property and to sell the property you retain there, if you so desire.</p>

One family I knew received $15 per month for letting a company put a cell tower on their land.

Call the local news, radio stations, attorneys, state reps, mayor, etc... Call everyone you can and make it about David and Goliath. The problem is that if they go with eminent domain, you may be screwed if you don&#39;t have the money to fight it. Even then, you won&#39;t win. How much land do you own?</p>

<p>Side note, I contacted , a congressman(Diane Black) in my area a couple of weeks ago for a client buying a home with a VA loan.  Anyway, we sent her an email, her people got back with us the next day, we told them we needed help with the VA redtape on my clients loan and they got on it. I haven&#39;t ever done that before but it was awesome to have the full power of a person in congress actually get something done for the little guy. I will give it to her, she did it, got my client his house and I will be voting for her when she runs for Gov</p>
