        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yesterday a congressional council interviewed Peter Strzok under subpoena regarding the facts surrounding his investigation of Hillary clinton and potential bias that may have entered the investigation based on inflammatory leaked texts from Strzok to his lawyer.</p>

<p>The actual interview video paints a picture of Peter being backed into a corner. Peter was like a dog running with his tail between his legs while he is lambasted with facts showing his bias to help elect Hillary Clinton over Trump. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANohtXQhkQw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=113">Any reasonable person watching these interviews would be infuriated by the behavior of the FBI and their obvious bias during the investigation. Here is Trey Gowdys portion of the interview</a></p>

<p>So how do the Democrats and the MSM flip this news to seem like a joke to their electorate and reduce damage to party perception? They black list the news in the MSM and instead hand it off to HITMAN colbert to spin. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siYIEmHOvDU&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Here is a video of Colbert spinning this interview to seem like a republican circus, completely removing any context showing Peter Strzok being backed into a wall and destroying the seriousness of these accusations and the potential future that perter may be thrown in prison!</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/for-some-the-satiric-colbert-report-is-a-trusted-source-of-political-news/">Here is data regarding how many on the left get their news direct from colberts manipulative poison mouth &quot;Roughly a quarter (26%) of consistent liberals reported getting news about government and politics from The Colbert Report in the &quot;</a></p>

<p>This type of spin and bias is what is dividing the country. The left isn&#39;t receiving or even willing to view the facts and the reality of the interviews. Instead the see spin and think that an FBI agent betraying the will of the voters is a joke</p>
