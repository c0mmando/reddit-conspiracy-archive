<blockquote>
<p>The Conspirators also used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to release additional stolen documents through a website maintained by an organization (&quot;Organization 1&quot;), that had previously posted documents stolen from U.S. persons, entities, and the U.S. government.     </p>

<p>On or about June 22, 2016, Organization 1 sent a private message to Guccifer 2.0 to &quot;send any new material [stolen from the DNC] here for us to review and it will have a much higher impact than what you are doing.&quot; On or about July 6, 2016, Organization 1 added, &quot;if you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo [sic] days prefable [sic] because the DNC [Democratic National Convention] is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after.&quot; The Conspirators responded, &quot;ok... i see.&quot; Organization 1 explained, &quot;we think trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary... so conflict between bernie and hillary is interesting.&quot;    </p>

<p>If this is true, it proves Seth Rich wasn’t Assange’s source and Assange will likely face indictments for knowin requesting the stolen emails.  </p>

<p>Has Assange been indicted for requesting stolen documents in the past?  I mean, that&#39;s kind of WL&#39;s &quot;thing&quot; - to post stolen/leaked/hacked documents.   </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t that long ago we were praising Assange for posting Iraq War documents that were damaging to the former Bush administration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guccifer 2.0 was a DNC-related fictitious entity used to get in front of what they knew was going to be a forthcoming leak. By releasing the leak themselves, they were also able to plant malware in the documents and trace exactly who and what groups were investigating the material. </p>

<p>Look into the connections between the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/comments/5t0rhq/guccifer20_game_over_evidence_emerges_that/">DNC and Warren Flood</a>, and there will be your info. </p>

<p>In addition, the FBI never investigated the leak. Its (private company) offshoot, Crowdstrike, did. So, whatever yarn is being spun by the above gov article likely emanated from this cleanup/coverup/hack job done by CS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That thread says that Warren Flood&#39;s office (the true source of the Guccifer 2.0 files) is not the source for Wikileaks, because you can tell that the wikileaks version is earlier than the Guccifer 2.0 versions.</p>

<p>It does not say that Warren Flood&#39;s is not the source for Guccifer 2.0.   It is pretty much proven that it is.  </p>

<p>The Mueller probe is basically wearing glasses with opaque lenses if they say that Russian nationals are behind Guccifer 2.0.  The fingerprints to Warren Flood&#39;s office are still right in the documents, right there for anyone to verify from a terminal:</p>

<pre><code>curl -vs https://guccifer2.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/2.doc 2&gt;&amp;amp;1 | strings | grep &quot;Warren Flood&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Try changing the URL to anything else (<a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a> for example).  It won&#39;t find any mentions of Warren Flood.  Try it on the guccifer 2.0 documents, and his name pops out.</p>

<p>You should check out <a href="http://archive.is/2dMfC">this article</a> that Medium wrote on it (then later deleted for some reason).  Here&#39;s a piece of it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Archived versions of 1.doc exist from as far back as the 15th, a day before the pdf mailouts were generated. The archived docs have the same checksum from then till now; no English error msgs were ever in situ. It is easy to translate error msgs and verify they are native to MS Word. I sent a series of DMs to Tait before I was blocked, and an email too. I also contacted two other prominent journalists who cited Tait’s work. No replies yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WMDs in Iraq came from the politicians directly, with help from the press. I get really tired of people blaming some cryptic &quot;deep state&quot; for what the people who are elected to run the deep state do with it.</p>

<p>I get that JFK was killed. That was a long, long time ago.</p>

<p>Since then, investigations of the deep state have always led to the politicians: Richard Nixon had to step down, Ronald Reagan admitted it on television, George Bush was &#39;out of the loop&#39; until he wasn&#39;t but that didn&#39;t stop him from pardoning all the remaining big political players, George W. Bush and Tony Blair personally &quot;fixed&quot; the intelligence...</p>

<p>And now we are supposed to believe Donald Trump is some outsider draining the swamp based on all we&#39;ve seen, including his love for the same old GWB policies like giant tax cuts, deregulation, sabotaging agencies from the inside, &quot;streamlining&quot; government also known as taking tighter crony control at the top, tearing up the Iran deal, and we could go on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, the old working theory was that it was compromised (I.E. Asange and folks loyal to him have no influence over its postings). And that Wikileaks social media was functioning as a “controlled opposition” entity. When’s the last time something impactful leaked through them, in lieu of re-hashing the DNC leaks? </p>

<p>Now, the question for “say it ain’t so” believers like me is, what does all mean about their drivers? Is Wikileaks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Actively in bed with the Russians and always has been</li>
<li>Started neutral and got compromised by force</li>
<li>Started neutral and felt the draw of money and power</li>
<li>Strayed from Assange’s direction after he went dark</li>
<li>Being set up by a series of fall guys, most of whom are conveniently pleading guilty</li>
</ul>

<p>I can feel in myself the mental gymnastics. It’s hard to watch your heroes die. But there had been such a concerted and seemingly transparent effort to run Assange through the mud that it’s hard to react in any way other than, “here’s another attempt to weaken Wikileaks.” </p>

<p>Is it possible that the concerted and transparent effort to run Assange through the mud is because he&#39;s actually part of a conspiracy to undermine democracy in the west? This might not be his intention - he might have just hated Clinton so much, or he&#39;s under duress - but it seems pretty transparent at this point that Assange is not the heroic freedom fighter he was once painted to be. And since there&#39;s a lot of people who refuse to believe that, an effort has been taken to try and sway public opinion towards the truth.</p>

<p>Like what the DNC and Hillary did to Bernie lol...  and all wikileaks did was what they&#39;ve done since their inception.  It should be funny to everybody that they&#39;ve created a narrative of &quot; russia attempting to undremine democracy&quot; when the dnc is bankrupt and letting hillary buy them out and fuck over bernie.  </p>

<p>Not to mention her efforts to boost Trump.  Not to mention the fuckery with the dossier.  Not to mention the fact that the Ukraine president outed Manafort so as to help Hillary...</p>

<p>I worry you are not sincere by avoiding my question, ignoring plain evidence to the face and repeating yourself.</p>

<p>He literally stated that they have stuff on the RNC campaign. Can you try harder to spin it, I love seeing you do mental gymnastics.</p>

<p>How is that you’re able to overlook the fact that Assange never released anything bad about Russia , or the RNC , or Trump, despite the over and over proven <strong>fact</strong> (which probably triggers you hard right now) that he has stuff on the RNC and trump AT LEAST.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you are talking about me? Feel free to see what Hazel Press, a member of the Wikileaks Task Force leaked about Assange in private convos with him. That the &quot;true hero of transparency and democracy&quot; was Pro-GOP in this election. And that Clinton was a Sadistic Sociopath. That is only me sharing a fact. I used to applaud him as well but being for a candidate, and then leaking only dirt that helps the side he is for isn&#39;t very transparent. </p>

<p>If you would like for me to share my reasons on Assange being Q, I would be happy to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah! There we go! Nope, I wouldn&#39;t. But! if you are being 100&amp;#37; transparent and not for one side but true democracy, you wouldn&#39;t have an agenda! You would allow the democratic process to take place instead of only hurting one side. Hence, the issue with his private conversations about it and that he only leaked things that helped the side he &quot;liked&quot;. Then all of the direct messages with Trump&#39;s team, etc.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well he certainly had an agenda: one of transparency and true democracy.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I believe what you’re saying but it’s a difficult position to be in. Do you help evil in support of democracy? Maybe evil would ultimately be bad for democracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, his own people leaked their convos with him because of how shady it was. It was the exact opposite of what they stood for and that is why they leaked them. You can throw a fit all you want, call me the boogeyman and yadda yadda but I am only putting out the facts of what he did. And it wasn&#39;t true transparency. If it was, he should have come out and said, everyone needs to back Trump in this election and I am taking dirt on the Dems so send it my way. I won&#39;t post anything on the GOP though. If he would have done that, to the public, <em>then</em> he would be transparent. Did he do that? Nope</p>

<p>I find it hilarious that you are coming to Assange&#39;s rescue when his private convos are leaked, showing that he wasn&#39;t being transparent. Yet call him a hero for leaking other peoples private convos showing the dirt they were doing. Do you not see the hypocrisy in that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It definitely isn&#39;t one person. Whoever was doing it with him took it over after his internet was cut. The main reason for me is the fact that the day before his internet was cut, Q posted, &quot;will be offline&quot;. Then, the day after his internet is cut, Q had to move to a new board. Now, that could be a complete coincidence but the timing on that seems strange. Not only that, but after I posted my theory, someone told me about MEGANON saying she had been larped and that Assange was Q. Then, the way that Assange would never just come out and say what was in Podesta&#39;s emails, he would always say you had to look for it. Same way Q doesn&#39;t come out and say things. The similarities in the way Assange and Q say things in general. Then, since the new Q board has come up, there is tons of stuff constantly posted on there. Done differently though. Worded differently, different type of content too. Not to mention the guy that came out and spilled the beans saying it is a group, how they got access to Trumps tweets, that there was a power struggle, etc... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I want to respond to your post above. How am I posting &quot;dumb, fake shit?&quot;. Or anyone in this thread? And I love how you posted that right after saying Assange has a statue in Berlin. Lol.</p>

<p>You must not keep up with the hero Assange too well if you think his internet was cut in 2016. I was cut in 2018</p>

<p>The sad thing about yours, and other posts in this thread, is that you chose to come on here and call us names for not believing what Assange has become. And our belief is based on things he has said and done. Not based off of &quot;taking things out of context&quot; like you say. </p>

<p>I would have to say that you are the problem with r/conspiracy. You start out with name calling because you have no counter argument, then post falsehoods, then attack the people who show actual evidence to back up their argument. That is called being close minded and childish. Not a very good combo for a conspiracy theory sub.  </p>

<p>That was the post I was referring to. And since it was a response to my post, I guess it was referencing me?</p>

<p>While there was a statue erected for a couple of days, it wasn&#39;t by a city or the country. Maybe it was too vague for me to understand that part. </p>

<p>And yes, I do get mad when people call me CIA and Israeli mouthpiece. Or goons, insidious, snarky, &quot;you can&#39;t argue with stupid&quot;, etc... And then imply that I am posting, &quot;dumb, fake shit&quot;, exaggerate past events, etc... </p>

<p>Other than my theory of Assange being Q, I posted nothing but non-exaggerated facts about what Assange did in the election. So when people reply to my posts with stuff like that, yeah, it pisses me off. Especially being on r/conspiracy. When you are presented with <em>actual evidence,</em> and not a theory that shows a conspiracy, people like to close off if it is against their &quot;guy&quot;. That isn&#39;t what this sub is supposed to be about. This sub is for finding the truth, no matter what. But, because I showed facts that people don&#39;t want to hear, they shut it down and begin the referenced above. I hope you still love me though. I love our late night convos</p>

<p>There he was opening up secrets of the government to show alleged war crimes. Now he was working <strong>with</strong> a government to undermine the will of the people. I wonder why public opinion has shifted.</p>

<p>I kno wpeople would like to focus on the narrative of working with russia.  But that&#39;s not proven for one, and all it does is try to take away from looking at how the dnc and hillary fucked over bernie and greatly damaged the public trust in the process.    </p>

<p>Russia didn&#39;t have to do anything... DNC did it for them.  wikileaks would have taken that info from anybody.  Trying to suggest they were working with russia is a misrepresentation given their history of putting out leaks.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also a direct charge that Guccifer 2.0/GRU was the source of the DNC email leaks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After failed attempts to transfer the stolen documents starting in late June 2016, on
or about July 14, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, sent
Organization 1 an email with an attachment titled “wk dnc link1.txt.gpg.” The
Conspirators explained to Organization 1 that the encrypted file contained
instructions on how to access an online archive of stolen DNC documents. On or
about July 18, 2016, Organization 1 confirmed it had “the 1Gb or so archive” and
would make a release of the stolen documents “this week.”</p>

<p>On or about July 22, 2016, Organization 1 released over 20,000 emails and other
documents stolen from the DNC network by the Conspirators. This release occurred
approximately three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention. Organization 1
did not disclose Guccifer 2.0’s role in providing them. The latest-in-time email released through
Organization 1 was dated on or about May 25, 2016, approximately the same day the Conspirators
hacked the DNC Microsoft Exchange Server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and the Podesta email leaks:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>On or about October 7, 2016, Organization 1 released the first set of emails from the
chairman of the Clinton Campaign that had been stolen by LUKASHEV and his co-conspirators.
Between on or about October 7, 2016 and November 7, 2016, Organization 1 released 
approximately thirty-three tranches of documents that had been stolen from the chairman of the Clinton Campaign. In total, over 50,000 stolen documents were released. </li>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, the old working theory was that it was compromised (I.E. Asange and folks loyal to him have no influence over its postings). And that Wikileaks social media was functioning as a “controlled opposition” entity. When’s the last time something impactful leaked through them, in lieu of re-hashing the DNC leaks? </p>

<p>Now, the question for “say it ain’t so” believers like me is, what does all mean about their drivers? Is Wikileaks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Actively in bed with the Russians and always has been</li>
<li>Started neutral and got compromised by force</li>
<li>Started neutral and felt the draw of money and power</li>
<li>Strayed from Assange’s direction after he went dark</li>
<li>Being set up by a series of fall guys, most of whom are conveniently pleading guilty</li>
</ul>

<p>I can feel in myself the mental gymnastics. It’s hard to watch your heroes die. But there had been such a concerted and seemingly transparent effort to run Assange through the mud that it’s hard to react in any way other than, “here’s another attempt to weaken Wikileaks.” </p>
