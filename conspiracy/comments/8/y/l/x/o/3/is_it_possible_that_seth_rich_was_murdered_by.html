    <div class="md"><p>SS: I really don&#39;t like speculating about this kid&#39;s death, as he, by appearences looked like a good kid. We don&#39;t know who did it. We know Russia is not beyond killing people on foreign soil. In fact, it&#39;s kind of a hobby of theirs. What if Seth somehow was working for them or found out about their hacking and was going to somehow expose them, so they did him in? We know they reached out to all sorts of people looking for leads.    </p>

<p>Think about it. He found out about the biggest hack in history and was going to expose it, the jig would be up. Millions of dollars of investment wasted. A plan years in the making brought to ruin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m been tilting that direction as well, although I realize it isn&#39;t a popular idea. It&#39;s laughable that almost no one will even consider a Russian angle. I&#39;m not sure what Seth would have had on the Russians or anyone else because the damage had already been done when he was murdered, thus killing him for revenge doesn&#39;t make as much sense as stopping him from doing something even more damaging. However, he could have also simply been a victim of a cold-blooded psy-op.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While we are considering actual conspiracies, I have one that probably won&#39;t go over well. Donald Trump is fully on board with the NATO &quot;Grand Strategy&quot; agenda. We are being misled by TPTB and by Donald Trump. Donald Trump has no intention of cutting down NATO.</p>

<p>In fact, he will do just the opposite. He is threatening members not so that NATO will fall, but rather, in typical Trump style, so that he can extract the best deal (the most additional funding) out of those nations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has never been any good evidence to indicate that someone on Hillary&#39;s side killed Seth Rich.</p>

<p>The profiling of the situation -- namely that Hillary had Seth Rich killed as retribution for leaking -- never made sense. It never made sense because it would be plainly obvious to anyone that Republicans -- who routinely use &#39;mysterious deaths&#39; against Democrats -- would do so.</p>

<p>So the better motive for killing Seth Rich is to create a fall guy for the DNC leaks to help Donald Trump. I&#39;ve said this here before.</p>

<p>However, unless or until we have some information beyond the obvious motive, we have nothing but what criminal investigators would call a &quot;working theory.&quot; In this context, a working theory is nothing more than a hunch.</p>
