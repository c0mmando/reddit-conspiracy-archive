        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is to all the people out there that have the idea that perhaps the human species is secretly being controlled by an all powerful group of beings from the shadows. You know, the ones that can shapeshift and have infiltrated every level of every major government within their infastructure and have some sort of terribly awful plot to feed off of our suffering and negative emotions and energy. These guys are said to also be the leaders behind the curtain of the &quot;illuminatti&quot; , have a severe distaste for human beings and are actively working towards the destruction of our species and eventually drain us and this planet on its way to galactic domination....I speak of course of the oh so infamous &quot;reptilians&quot; ....</p>

<p>Look all I want you to do is just follow with me. I&#39;m going to use very simple logic and historical info to paint you a much different picture.....One that starts by first dropping what many UFO/E.T. believers and theorists might try to sell you...That is that we as human beings are being controlled or in any way shaped by a wicked alien species bent on domination. First off....I&#39;ve heard the supposed belief these snakelike beings apparently have about their race being &quot;royalty&quot; and thinking themselves superior. Not just that, but they would be so much more advanced and could just crush us without a single issue...I say this to that. Since when did you meet any human who doesn&#39;t believe they are the best ever? The most important? The most formidable? I&#39;m being told that us humans....our military and strategic leaders are so cowardly that they just gave control of our population and whatnot to eveil alien overlords who would spit at our very existence...Sorry but I&#39;m not sure you&#39;ve ever picked up a book in history. ...every single conquering force of humanity that took another started by killing all who resist, then enslave the survivors. Then over time the fact that this land once belonged to another army or something just is lost. Literally told to never be spoken of again in many cases. Burnt out of civilization. This is what happens when humans conquer other humans. This is what happens when any specific race conquers an inferior and technologically deficient one specifically. This would be the same of any overlords and humans would absolutely never be a subservient species to some controlling hand who has no true muscle or ability to truly take this planet and it&#39;s people&#39;s. I call one hundred percent bullshit. We are not just under the control of anyone but greedy terrible human beings and that&#39;s the sad fact.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why it&#39;s a fact. The atomic bomb....The world was given its way to literally destroy any being or beings of biological matter that stood before them and in any numbers. America alone has tens of thousands of nuclear warheads that are all many times stronger than the two that were shown before and has them tuned to a single point and could put it on that spot without error a million out of a million times and literally blow whatever the target may have been to dust and shadows burnt into the freaking ground. We are not under the thumb of any alien overlords. We are the overlords. Antarctica??? Ever think it is most likely a prison? The most remote and inaccessible in the world. Where no one can go...how about area 51? Roswell? Think those UFOs just fell from the sky? They were attacked and shot down. On the orders of humans. Humans with big ol American nutsacks who simply are not under any thumb of a snake person or anyone else. If anything we are the assholes of the Galaxy and we probably talk big to other species if they are around. </p>

<p>Perhaps we are actually the more advanced and capable species. Perhaps we have been told intelligent life from outside Earth would be more than us and we just sucked it down. Making it seem like we were not really in control. All the while we are really pulling the strings. We have imprisoned and experimented on other being and it is us that truly run the show. </p>

<p>Look idk how many actual military guys might see this but there are reasons why as of yet we don&#39;t have any other ways of flying planes or shooting guns. Because our designs for flight using rocket fuel is the best and most formidable way. Because shooting metal projectiles that move 700 feet per second is capable of killing anything out there. And our big bombs are able to deter everyone out there from knocking on our door. You all need to start thinking about just how much your government does whatever it wants whenever it wants and ask yourself if it met a challenge from a hostile race of lizards whether they would choose to bow to it or to blow it the fuck away. And it&#39;s not anywhere near the first choice here. We&#39;d kill them. We&#39;d kill them all until human beings were feared and known as the ones to not come mess with. It&#39;s quite funny that so many alien believers have just forgotten how amazing we are as humans. How violent....how cunning. How just plain murderous and proud of it we are. </p>

<p>No lizards are out there pulling strings on this planet. If anything they might be forever imprisoned in a 6 million year old hunk of ice at the bottom of the planet and never going to get what they want out of us. Sorry to be the one to break it to you all....but we humans are actually very very smart and amazing killers. The best that this planet ever saw for sure....and it&#39;s not ever going to change. No alien species has or will ever be able to take this world and do whatever it is so many try to argue is already going on. Which is just messed up humans being Satan loving jackholes. Doesn&#39;t make them snake people. Makes them child loving piece of shit Lucifer praising fucksticks that are gonna get there&#39;s before it&#39;s done. But they are just humans. Ordinany humans. This includes the queen of England. Any other royalty for that matter from Europe. Business owners and politicians in North America, and anyone who&#39;d be in line for power and that people see as a snake person. Which they are in fact not. They are bad bad humans. And nothing more. Remember this if nothing else....think of the native Americans and the pilgrims. Think of the mogols conquering China., Think of any bigger and badder force of humanity that just took the inferiors kingdom and all else it desired....because it could. Because it thought its way better. Killed and pilliaged the indigenous. Until they were either gone for good or placed on land that even though they just owned was somehow given to them. Defeated and broken, never to be the same now that the conquering army was there. That&#39;s what superior forces do in real life battle strategy. They don&#39;t wait a millennia and never seem to be more than whispers and insane rumors. They don&#39;t just have no control and basically get seen as if they were a fairly tale. Pretty sure you&#39;ve understood by now that it&#39;s all misdirection and false info to make you feel insecure. When in reality, there&#39;s no need to feel anything but joy knowing that it was the collective strength of your fellow man and the fact we are the Pinnacle of the Galaxy and have been for some time. </p>

<p>Stop believeing in unfounded stories and incorrect accounts. Lies.....Believe in what you can easily just research and observe.....the pure and utter merciless type of things we humans truly are. What we are capable of doing....what we would do to keep ourselves from shackles and tell me that you don&#39;t at least think maybe it&#39;s true that we are as advanced if not more advanced than whatever other species may want to be messing with us. Which again, they cannot and have died trying because while the sharpest tools in the shed we humans may not be relatively if that&#39;s the case....well, when it comes to violence and killing anything in our way. We are unchallenged......we are more than Apex predators at the top of the food chain. We kill for sport and for entertainment. Children wipe the blood of their first kills on their faces annually. Thousands of people die each day from being murdered by another person....and yet somehow some freakishly tall snake person is meant to scare me into conspiracy theories and believeing the purely illogical and irrational....</p>

<p>No. No. I think not. </p>

<p>How easy it was to forget just exactly who we truly are as a species....The most horribly hostile, violent, murderous, sadistic, unforgiving, and truly merciless thing that&#39;s ever seen the sun rise on this planet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nuclear weapons don&#39;t exist.  They are a complete hoax.  Reptilians from &quot;outer space&quot; don&#39;t exist either.  Both of those are a hoax.  The beings that people think are reptilian shapeshifters are devils/fallen angels.  They can masquerade as humans.  There are way more than people are comfortable beveling.  This is how so many worldwide hoaxes are being pulled off.  The movie &quot;They Live&quot; really is a documentary using Aliens as a replacement for these spiritual principalities and powers.</p>

<p>Repent and believe this to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; </p>

<p>1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. </p>

<p>1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; </p>

<p>1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to watch test footage to know and very easily understand that any nuclear weapon is achieved one of two ways to be as real as can be.....those are nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. In fission the nucleus of an atom is split by a neutron, this is done using uranium or plutonium. Fusion, is when two or more smaller atoms of hydrogen are merged, creating a massive implosion of energy and is literally how the sun and most other stars are able to produce energy.</p>

<p>Look I&#39;m sorry but this is relatively easy to not only understand and build, but actually apply. Those test rolls you are watching is not anything compared to the level of destruction a modern nuclear weapon can dish out. And like I&#39;ve said previously, these are armed within a drone capable of pinpoint accuracy up to a beyond thousands of miles away and will not miss the target. And again, the u.s. has tens of thousands of these all scattered around. If you truly believe that in this day and age we do not truly have nuclear detterents then I&#39;m sorry but that&#39;s more insane than telling me that reptile alien is really a demon from Christianity and look man....to the outside world, you a believer in faith and whatnot are more insane than all of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is all false scientism cult nonsense.  Atoms don&#39;t even exist.  It&#39;s just atomisim repackaged.  Nobody has &quot;split the atom&quot; and nobody ever will.  You need to figure out how much of your &quot;science&quot; belief is faith vs actual knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok....this is some actual knowledge for you....</p>

<p>The atom has not only been split, but it has been dissected and identified down to it&#39;s very most microscopic level. That is what&#39;s called the Higs Field. The Higs Field is what contains the Higs boson. Which as of a few days ago according to the standard model of matter, of an atom....was just observed through decays that represents about 70 percent of the possible observations and has all but proven the Higs boson is very much real and not any theory. All of that junk I just said is about a much smaller and far more microscopic part of an atom, which is what youre telling me isn&#39;t real. Which is just annoyingly incorrect. Atoms are just pieces of the elements from the periodic table. Which I swear if you say is not real so help me God.....So these elements are arranged into solids, liquids, and gasses and are at all times apart of the very well known law of physics that says matter cannot be created or destroyed. When wood burns it is a solid pack of atoms being turned into a gas....very easy example. What&#39;s sad is that not only do we observe normal matter, we&#39;ve built hadron colliders to smash particles at light speed and in the result of those collisions we were able to observe and contain anti-matter. Positrons. Aka anti electrons. And we literally fucking pulled those from an alternate space and time. And you sit here telling me atoms don&#39;t exist. Don&#39;t ever speak to me about what is fact and science again. This could be much more than me showing you just how far behind you are intellectually but I&#39;ll stop and say good day now. Try not to let your faith lead you to be blind of the fact that if you believe in God then you believe in his works created by man. Thus were created by him. How the hell am I telling you this. It&#39;s like saying you don&#39;t take medicine because it&#39;s wicked science when it would be a creation of God right? And therefore a holy thing. Just like the science in his kingdom for a person like you. Einstein said that without science then religion wouldn&#39;t exist and vice versa. They tend to walk the same paths much of the time. Until Uber wing nuts like you pull up and ruin it. This has been me owning you. I release you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think me some sort of heratic atheist. I grew up in the church. I know it back to front. Also I know every other ancient mythological belief system that all mirror the same stories of the Bible. I believe in a higher power. I believe it may be a spirit or alien. Or whatever it may be. But I also know sheeva the destoyer is the equivalent to both Jesus and Satan in one in Hindu. I know promethus is the god banished to Tartarus for illuminating the human race and Zeus kicked him off Olympus. Promethus the morning star. Like lucifer. Who coincidentally also is with his boys banished to Tartarus. Funny. Greek mythology and Christianity. Same story. Same outcome. Same prison. Only 3000 years of separation. Hmm.

    <div class="md"><p>If gravity isn&#39;t real then how are we able to stay stuck to the ground....If we can create an environment that&#39;s a contained zero gravity simulation and inside said simulation anything within the containment is in a state of constant floating and drifting in any direction, then how is it possible to look at any area that is not under the same zero g conditions and see that everything is stuck down and somehow not conclude that gravity does infact exist and we see it with our own eyes....it&#39;s not really expensive to go to any science center that has a zero g simulation and be able to experience this state for ourselves, and if after that in regular reality again, then how is it not that we are under a force of gravity at that point again....I just don&#39;t get the total lack of rational thought here. I get this is a satire board or whatever, but I&#39;m posing a real question here.....how does anyone that believes flat Earth and uses the gravity is fake logic not see that they are literally being seen by even dumb people out there as total morons. It&#39;s that easy to not only prove gravity exists but I mean it&#39;s to the point that to say it doesn&#39;t is something that a child in grade school could argue you into the ground over. It&#39;s able to be seen and tested. Able to be changed in condition by simulation of lesser gravity forces, and if it&#39;s not gravity then I don&#39;t know...call it something else but it&#39;s simply free fall inertia. This thought that it&#39;s some invisible force that is immeasurable is so wrong...it&#39;s just an object in free fall towards the ground. Jump off a balcony and there you go...gravity.. but yet it doesn&#39;t exist. The one smoking gun above all others that kills flat Earth and is beyond a doubt to it&#39;s fact and reality and the response is, oh well thats just fake so doesn&#39;t count....amazing. Apparently that&#39;s how to win a debate now.... someone makes a case making and winning point that is beyond question and the other side just says....nope doesn&#39;t count cause I don&#39;t think it&#39;s real even though literally the other 99 percent of humans do. Doesn&#39;t count cause me the flat Earth believer is such an authority in science I can just say gravity is fake so it is fake. It&#39;s not even something a child would try in order to win an argument. Not even they are so stupid and oblivious to reality. </p>

<p>how does anyone that believes flat Earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe it is a combination of factors.</p>

<p>1:  It makes them feel special having <em>secret</em> knowledge that others don&#39;t have.</p>

<p>2:  They like the community.  The flat Earth community, as long as you don&#39;t question things, is very welcoming and loves to tell people who smart they are.</p>

<p>3:  As a rule they don&#39;t do experiments or read science tests.  They also show a lack of knowledge about what the scientific method is, what scientific theories are, and what constitutes scientific <em>proof</em>.</p>

<p>4:  Some of them - Mark Sargent, D. Marble, Jeranism, FEAOTP, and a few others appear to be in to for the money.  Jeran, for example, makes 2/3rd of his income from patrons which incentivizes them to not actually do valid experiment.</p>

<p>5:  Others, like YourCurveLessEarth, appear to be religious people with mental issues. </p>

<p>6:  While others, like Nathan Oakley, appear to be highly narcissistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So all humanity has fallen short of God&#39;s glory.  There are no exceptions to this no matter how good a person thinks they are.</p>

<p>Rom 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; </p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>We humans like to compare ourselves to each other and not to a perfect, holy God who can&#39;t tolerate any sin at all.  He looks at one white lie the same way we look at a child murdering pedophile.  We can&#39;t comprehend that kind of holiness.</p>

<p>Isa 55:8  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. 
Isa 55:9  For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you worship Satan or are a perfect Catholic or an atheist who does nothing but what they think is good and righteousness their entire life.  Every single person is headed to an eternal lake of fire due to our sin:</p>

<p>Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. </p>

<p>However God realized how hopeless we were and came in the flesh of Jesus Christ to pay the price we owe.  He shed his blood and died for us:</p>

<p>Rom_5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p>Because Jesus Christ was God in the flesh he was able to live a perfect holy life without ever sinning.  He was crucified on the cross and shed his blood to atone for the sin of all of us.  When one believes the gospel (good news) they receive Jesus Christ&#39;s perfect righteousness.  It is imputed to them.</p>

<p>Rom 3:22  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>

<p>Nothing any person does in this life can save them.  It is a free gift of meriful grace from God:</p>

<p>Eph 2:7  That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. 
Eph 2:8  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: </p>

<p>Being a good person doesn&#39;t save you.  Neither does going to a buildign called chruch, donating to charity, being a good person, being baptized in water, doing sacraments, keeping the jewish law, nothing at all saves but having the imputed righousess of Jessu Christ by grace throuhg faith in the gospel.</p>

<p>To accept the gospel one most repent (change their mind) about who they are, who God is, who Jesus Christ is, what sin is, pretty much everything in their life.  They must know they have been doing wrong by God, deserve the eternal lake of fire and realize that God was so merciful he took their place and died for them.  He took our death penalty.</p>

<p>2Co_7:10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>

<p>Understanding all of the above this is all that must be believed to be saved.  This is the gospel for this dispensation of God&#39;s grace:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>

<p>Simply repent and belive the above.  Jesus Christ (who is God) died, was buried, and ressurected.  He died for your sins.  HIs blood supernatually washes them away.  Once you belive that you are saved and simply tell it to God the best way you know how:</p>

<p>Rom_10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>

<p>Rom_10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>

<p>Once you are saved you cannot lose your salvation.  There is nothing left to do.  You will receive the Holy Spirit and he start working with you.  Any sin your flesh does no longer pollutes your soul because it has been separated:</p>

<p>Col_2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:</p>

<p>There is no worrying about losing your salvation.  All the false religions and false versions of Christianity lie about this.</p>

<p>Eph_4:30  And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p>

<p>Rom 8:38  For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 
Rom 8:39  Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>If you are able to repent and believe this gospel in your heart then get yourself a King James Bible and that&#39;s it.  The Holy Ghost will take care of the rest.  You don&#39;t have to worry about a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone can repent and belive the gospel at any time.  Murders, Satanists, Elite pedophile murderes, it doesn&#39;t matter who you are or what your situation is you can repent and belive.</p>

<p>Simply believing is not enough to be saved.  Even the devils believe Jesus Christ is Lord:</p>

<p>Jas_2:19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</p>

<p>True biblical repentance is key.  It means you have Godly sorrow in your heart for your current state.  A repentance heart is the only way to receive the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p>Mar_2:17  When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>

<p>Luk_5:32  I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>

<p>Once a person recieves the Holy Spirit their own spirit will come alive for the first time since their childhood.  The Holy Spirit will renew their mind:</p>

<p>Rom 12:2  And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>

<p>A saved believer has two people residing in them.  The &quot;old man&quot; (who they were and who their flesh still is) and the &quot;new man&quot; (their new spiritual birth)</p>

<p>Eph_4:24  And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</p>

<p>Col_3:10  And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</p>

<p>These two natures do battle with each other.  It&#39;s a spiritual battle:</p>

<p>Gal 5:17  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit will work inside the newly saved believer to sanctify their life.  Things that seemed impossible before will seem easy.  However the newly saved person must yield to the Holy Spirits convictions.</p>

<p>If a saved person willingly sins they will be conviced by the Holy Spirit.  They can either resist that conviction or respond to it.  Save people can become very wicked and fall into the worst kinds of sins.  The differnce is that they are now God&#39;s children and are held up to his standards.  God will &quot;take them to the woodshed&quot; so to speak.  He will wreck their lives and eventually kill them off if they continue.</p>

<p>Heb 12:6  For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. 
Heb 12:7  If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? </p>

<p>1Co 3:16  Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 
1Co 3:17  If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. </p>

<p>So yes a saved believer who has truly repented can fall back and do wicked things but they will feel the Holy Spirit&#39;s convictions and things will happen in their life letting them know they need to stop.  If they continue God will kill them and bring them to heaven with a full loss of eternal rewards.</p>

<p>If someone says they are a saved Christian and live in sin and their life seems to be going swimmingly.  That is a sign of a false convert.  Someone who never truly felt Godly sorrow for their sinful state at the point of salvation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s truly hard to accept once you come to it is the fact that perhaps we are not going to be able to see this type of awakening that was promised. I thought the world would have become so much bigger and more than our own world by now....what truly saddens me is that as a whole I believe we might&#39;ve just not been ready to receive another species and broaden our minds in that way. That maybe unlike so much believed we are not the generation to transcend the cosmos. After all my digging. All my reserach. All my hope....it comes down to the fact we are plain killers of anything unlike us. As humans we are just awful and it may have led to whomever might&#39;ve come around being turned away and met with hostility. Possibly they are just higher up than us on a conscious level. Their thought is so far beyond. Maybe it&#39;s on the same level. Maybe they are freaking monkeys to us. But it&#39;s our behavior that took away and stole our very birthright in this day and age. To expand the reach of our universe and make new discoveries on life itself. It&#39;s very disheartening to keep living after you see this. </p>
