        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The question is not &quot;is r conspiracy being brigaded and astrotuffed&quot; bc that answer is obvious. The question is &quot;should we keep commenting and rebutting and arguing with people that we know are being disingenuous and have no intentions of furthering certain topics?&quot; </p>

<p>We also know that this subreddit and web site in general are main battlegrounds in the spread of deliberate disinformation.  We know that the brigades don&#39;t show up for posts about aliens or lil peep, but post something critical of the deep state and watch them swarm like flies on shit.  Call out obvious hoax shootings and get the same response from 10 different people.  &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t the government just actually kill the people&quot;  or. &quot;You need meds&quot;  </p>

<p>So if the purpose of reddit is to control the narrative, and reddit controls reddit...should we even spend time and energy debating disingenuous people? Can&#39;t the truth community organize itself somewhere outside of reddit, or do you think our voices are still needed/useful here at r conspiracy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol at the sign off at the end. The sub has more liberals around than it used to. Over time that happens with almost every sub because reddit is super liberal. And every time a post gets to r/all, it will pull in a few new people. So theres no much you can do. If youd like to join the conversation then do it. If you dont like hearing different opinions and having a conversation then you might want to avoid it.  </p>

<p>The sub has more liberals around than it used to.  Over time that happens with almost every sub because reddit is super liberal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not because reddit is &quot;super liberal.&quot;  r/conspiracy was created as a containment board for the (predominantly right-leaning) 9/11 truth, End the Fed, etc., contingent to discuss their topics without &#39;tainting&#39; other discussions.  Over a number of years as the (again, predominantly right-leaning) undesirables were shamed out of the default subs&#39; comment sections a critical mass began to develop.</p>

<p>Then came the high profile shooting hoaxes, the White Helmet fraudsters, the NYE rapes in Europe, the &#39;Soros&#39; movements in the U.S., pizzagate,  etc., and suddenly this group of outcasts became themselves the very center of &quot;what all the fuss is about.&quot;</p>

<p>For every headline and controversy, &#39;conspiracist&#39; counter narratives were spawned on the fly.  How could it be any other way?</p>

<p>And at the end of the day, <em>that</em> is why there are more liberals around now.  You&#39;re not here to participate; in typical liberal fashion you&#39;re here to push.  You don&#39;t like what you see, so now you&#39;ve followed everyone here as yet another attempt to crowd everyone out.</p>

<p>You cannot stand for &#39;conspiracy&#39; to be anything other than a thought-terminating cliche, a label at which you can point and laugh.  </p>

<p>But that time has come and gone.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s why you (liberals) are here you now pretending to belong.</p>
