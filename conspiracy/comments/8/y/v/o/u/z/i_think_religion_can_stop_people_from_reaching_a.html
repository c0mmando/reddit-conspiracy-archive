       I usually have dreams of things to come. They are weird dreams about power, myself in different times and common events related to synchronicity. Because of that, I'm sure that destiny and a higher power exist to some extend, but it surely isn't what we are told since we were little, if I was chosen for a mission, why are so many others not that lucky? I refuse to believe in a just and fair god.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to practice active imagination in order to make sense out of the whole thing sometimes, I've seen things to come many times, althought right now I usually have nightmares. I wonder how different the spiritual experience would be if it wasn't because of the influence of the mainstream religions?

       I'd like to weigh in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the Annunaki King Anu is Yahweh. I believe he called down the flood in order to exterminate us. I believe his first born son, Enki, created us
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       warned us of this flood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Enki held dominion over the Earth in the last Golden Age. I believe this is where the idea behind Atlantis exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Anu came down and destroyed the Enkist cities. I believe this was done with nuclear weaponry. This allowed him to take control of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to answer your question, I do believe that every religion today is a control mechanism of Anu. Except the teachings of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       My gut tells me that Jesus was Enki.
      </p>
      <p>
       My gut also tells me that Lucifer is his half-brother, Enlil. I believe Enlil worked with Anu in the beginning but "fell from grace" later to do his own thing. I believe Freemasonry worships Enlil. Enlil is the God of the Air and the Lord of Command.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki is the God of the Water. The serpent and the fish were symbols associated with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget about the Jesus fish! It is pretty clear to me that Jesus, when speaking of God, is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       speaking of Yahweh/Anu/Saturn. Don't forget that Yahweh required sacrifices, burnt offerings and then there was the whole passover thing and the killing of the
       <em>
        first born.
       </em>
       Why did he have such a problem with first born children? Maybe he still hates his first born (Enki).
      </p>
      <p>
       The serpent isn't Lucifer. That's a deception.

       I work with people who work on axhealogical digs in cultural sites and stuff I don't really know much about they are highly religious, yet accept there is no evidence of a massive flood that was meant to wipe us out. Explain the stories of Giants and dragons. Nothing but windmills and shit. I don't at all nor will I ever critisize someone for believing in their religion of choice or none at all. But the idea of a flood doesn't really hold weight with myself nor with my highly devout friendd

       From the ones that donate. The government own the land for major discoveries anyway if extra excavation is required. If someone truly makes a discovery why not announce it to the public have on public land the bones available for people to study? It's always just a photo or a YouTube video rxpaining it. Never allowing study

       I did like it. I don't agree with it, but I liked it. Sorry if I came off like a jerk. I was trying to keep the puns going cause you said it was good. Re reading, it came off mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       I meant you started with a "w" cause you said weight, so I expected "water" and I laughed, but then it was "weight" and I got disappointed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you started with a W and ended with an L. Like you had an op for a great pun and missed it. Sorry man, I'm buzzed.

       The biggest problem with you is the flood?  Not the gathering up of every animal (male and female) and cramming them onto the titanic and having enough food/water for all of them to eat/survive for 40 days?  This was just one family, so imagine all the incest that must have taken place to repopulate the Earth.  I do believe it could be true since many peoples today are pretty retarded.

       Religion, philosophy, and spirituality all have their merits. Awareness that mob mentality usually deals in substandard interpretation and consensus really opens the eyes and ears.

       Baby/bath water sort of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as your question about stripping away programming to reach deeper states of spirituality- well yeah, that's what it's all about. Finding the connection to the source of everything that is within and without us.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I know of, Catholicism is the only organized religion that openly states that you need an intermediary to know God, but they also adorn their church with idols and graven images.

       Religion is man made and we should always keep our leaders accountable to what is actually written. You can’t just let other ppl decide spiritual truth for you. However, we are vulnerable to deception (internal and external) so we need, and have, an anchor to compare perceptions against —the Bible.  Thus filter will protect us from error and self deception.

      <p>
       jeremiah 18:18 Then some said, “Come, let us make plans against Jeremiah, for the law will never be lost to the priest, or counsel to the wise, or an oracle to the prophet. Come, let us denounce him and pay no heed to any of his words.”

       it's as true now as it was then. 
hopefully, the penholders are still owned by people i wouldnt trust with quotation accuracy. i'm not trying to sound cynical... but the vatican originally published the quran, for example.

       that last passage is beautiful. i sometimes feel like a recluse hidden in these bizarre texts, but i've found more enlightenment in the books than i ever did listening to the elected shepherds.

       Religion is a man made tool to stop the poor from killing the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that simple. There is more to this world that we know, there are hidden truths everywhere, the big players on this planet know what the story is, they know what is what.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot get my head around the whole religious aspect of life. Buddhism is something I can subscribe to, but there are some parts that I do not agree with nor can comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion has ruled for far too long and how people can adopt to that method of "control" without a second thought drives me crazy, accept and accept but never question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing I like to ask a person of religion when they want to engage me on the topic, I simply ask them, when did you decided to become X religion? Generally their response will be, what? What you mean? I'd ask the question again, they are very uncomfortable at this point almost refusing to answer the question until they respond, I did not make this choice, my family made it for me when I was born. 0 Fucking choice and not a critical thought in their minds what so ever. Sad.

       you seem to bundle religion in whatever your perception is without consideration to its full spectrum. Heck, there are religions that knowledge has been forgotten, others so hermetic that only the most initiated are ready

       I disagree. I think having no concept of morality and being a depraved sociopath are very different things.

       You must stand alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       No teachers. No books.
No techniques. No rituals.
No saviors. No gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then and only then will you be capable of Perceiving directly what is...the isness, the fact, the act, the actual, what is actually taking place, without bias or prejudice.

       No one is going to save us.
Not the gods. Not the ETs.
It is up to us--each &amp; every one of us, without exception.
We made the mess. We can clean it up.
Now let's get to it already.

       Here's my proposal: First the cities, then the states, then the nation and then the world. "Creating a Wonderful World. (let's get it done already)"

       it's as true now as it was then. 
hopefully, the penholders are still owned by people i wouldnt trust with quotation accuracy. i'm not trying to sound cynical... but the vatican originally published the quran, for example.

       that last passage is beautiful. i sometimes feel like a recluse hidden in these bizarre texts, but i've found more enlightenment in the books than i ever did listening to the elected shepherds.
