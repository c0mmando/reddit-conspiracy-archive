        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I usually have dreams of things to come. They are weird dreams about power, myself in different times and common events related to synchronicity. Because of that, I&#39;m sure that destiny and a higher power exist to some extend, but it surely isn&#39;t what we are told since we were little, if I was chosen for a mission, why are so many others not that lucky? I refuse to believe in a just and fair god.</p>

<p>I like to practice active imagination in order to make sense out of the whole thing sometimes, I&#39;ve seen things to come many times, althought right now I usually have nightmares. I wonder how different the spiritual experience would be if it wasn&#39;t because of the influence of the mainstream religions?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to weigh in.</p>

<p>I believe that the Annunaki King Anu is Yahweh. I believe he called down the flood in order to exterminate us. I believe his first born son, Enki, created us <em>and</em> warned us of this flood.</p>

<p>I believe Enki held dominion over the Earth in the last Golden Age. I believe this is where the idea behind Atlantis exists. </p>

<p>I believe Anu came down and destroyed the Enkist cities. I believe this was done with nuclear weaponry. This allowed him to take control of the Earth. </p>

<p>So to answer your question, I do believe that every religion today is a control mechanism of Anu. Except the teachings of Jesus. </p>

<p>My gut tells me that Jesus was Enki. </p>

<p>My gut also tells me that Lucifer is his half-brother, Enlil. I believe Enlil worked with Anu in the beginning but &quot;fell from grace&quot; later to do his own thing. I believe Freemasonry worships Enlil. Enlil is the God of the Air and the Lord of Command. </p>

<p>Enki is the God of the Water. The serpent and the fish were symbols associated with him. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget about the Jesus fish! It is pretty clear to me that Jesus, when speaking of God, is <strong>not</strong> speaking of Yahweh/Anu/Saturn. Don&#39;t forget that Yahweh required sacrifices, burnt offerings and then there was the whole passover thing and the killing of the <em>first born.</em> Why did he have such a problem with first born children? Maybe he still hates his first born (Enki). </p>

<p>The serpent isn&#39;t Lucifer. That&#39;s a deception.</p>

<p>another one i found that really resonates, despite not being a subscriber to zoroastrian tradition backs up your claims,</p>

<p>jeremiah 18:18 Then some said, “Come, let us make plans against Jeremiah, for the law will never be lost to the priest, or counsel to the wise, or an oracle to the prophet. Come, let us denounce him and pay no heed to any of his words.”</p>

I have listened attentively,

None of them repent of their wickedness,

<p>Doesn’t this sound familiar to what we see often? </p>

<p>”New Living Translation
And the people of Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, and they listened eagerly to Paul&#39;s message. <em>They searched the Scriptures day after day to see if Paul and Silas were teaching the truth</em>.  —Acts 17:11</p>

<p>that last passage is beautiful. i sometimes feel like a recluse hidden in these bizarre texts, but i&#39;ve found more enlightenment in the books than i ever did listening to the elected shepherds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion is a man made tool to stop the poor from killing the rich. </p>

<p>It&#39;s that simple. There is more to this world that we know, there are hidden truths everywhere, the big players on this planet know what the story is, they know what is what. </p>

<p>I cannot get my head around the whole religious aspect of life. Buddhism is something I can subscribe to, but there are some parts that I do not agree with nor can comprehend. </p>

<p>Religion has ruled for far too long and how people can adopt to that method of &quot;control&quot; without a second thought drives me crazy, accept and accept but never question.</p>

<p>The one thing I like to ask a person of religion when they want to engage me on the topic, I simply ask them, when did you decided to become X religion? Generally their response will be, what? What you mean? I&#39;d ask the question again, they are very uncomfortable at this point almost refusing to answer the question until they respond, I did not make this choice, my family made it for me when I was born. 0 Fucking choice and not a critical thought in their minds what so ever. Sad. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t choose to believe, I sought something ineffable. I got a glimpse of it. 
I sought it harder. </p>

<p>It is a higher authority than human. 
Your condescending attitude is disgraceful. Think about what that word means. If you think others are sad, you don&#39;t see that you are them. </p>

It&#39;s easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today</p>

It isn&#39;t hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you</p>

I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

<p>OR this god knows what is happening but is too weak to do anything about it,</p>

<p>OR this god knows what is happening and is able to end to all conflict, violence, and suffering but refuses to do anything about it. In which case, he/she/it would be a depraved sociopath lacking Love and Wisdom.</p>

Not the gods. Not the ETs.

We made the mess. We can clean it up.
Now let&#39;s get to it already.</p>
