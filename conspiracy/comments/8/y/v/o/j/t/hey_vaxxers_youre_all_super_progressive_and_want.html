        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Face it, these vaxxers that come here to mock and ridicule anyone who dares to question to safety or necessity of vaccines are also the same people crying about how ILLEGAL immigrants have a right to be here.</p>

<p>But if they aren&#39;t coming here legally then they aren&#39;t being vaccinated or screened for infectious diseases before entering the country.  As a matter of fact they post a much bigger risk to the sacred herd immunity than home schooled kids who&#39;s parents have chosen to abstain from vaccines.</p>

<p>Why are ILLEGALs a bigger threat?  Well for one there are 10 times as many of them as there are anti-vaxx kids and adults and they also come from countries where deadly diseases like Tuberculosis are a daily reality.</p>

<p>Look at the stats of all the new confirmed cases of Tuberculosis and their proximity to the southern border.  Keep in mind that we had erradicated TB before the nuclear bomb was invented.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have it both ways.  You can&#39;t demand your fellow citizens vaccinate their kids and then go ahead and welcome in a bunch of people from the third world carrying diseases.  People who will probably end up working in the back of the house at your favorite restaurants.</p>

<p>Meanwhile your immune comprised mom catches TB from her salad and dies because of your poor choice of ignoring the illegal immigration problem.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t there a meme about a guy trying to decide which button to push but both buttons force him to acknowledge his hypocrisy?</p>

<p>That&#39;s you.</p>

<p>No I&#39;m pointing out that the people mocking anti-vax users are also crying about how ILLEGAL immigrants are fine.  Problem no problem.</p>

<p>It&#39;s disingenuous to be so butthurt about 100 kids in homeschool who aren&#39;t vaccinated while being perfectly fine with 60,000 people a year coming unscreened and unvaccinated from a country with sewage in their drinking water and a problem with TB and polio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re new here I understand. </p>

<p>If you put up a post about the dangers of vaccines, you will generally receive criticism about how it&#39;s dangerous, selfish, and child abuse. </p>

<p>Generally(but definitely not always) it&#39;s left leaning people making these claims. </p>

<p>Left leaning people tend to be against heavier border policies. </p>

<p>More undocumented and unvaccinated people entering the country should create cognitive dissonance for those who are scared of the dangers of lack of vaccination but are also into open borders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Missing the point.</p>

<p>The point is that we dont hear anything about vaxers being concerned over getting illegals vaccinated once here.  The reason this is bothersome is because there is a huge concern from when americans do not vaccinate their children.  When that happens vaxers point to the threat posed by even 1 unvaxed person on the rest of the population.</p>

<p>Thats fine if you dont hold it against them.  But what about the public health hazard that is claimed?</p>

<p>Thats what I think his point was.  If not it should be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like I get the point just fine. What they&#39;re not getting, I don&#39;t think, is that pro-vaccine people aren&#39;t against the people themselves, they&#39;re against the thought of a pandemic raging across the country. The more people vaccinated the better. Those that can&#39;t get vaccinations, or those that never had access to them when they were young, obviously aren&#39;t the target of pro-vaccine people&#39;s ire. It&#39;s the ignorant, anti-science people that don&#39;t vaccinate their kids because they don&#39;t understand things, are easily misled, and scare easily. Those are the people that get us riled up. Do we wish the refugees and immigrants had their shots? Yes. But they don&#39;t - so it&#39;s that much more important that everyone that&#39;s born here takes advantage of it. I&#39;ve never seen a pro-vaccine person <em>literally</em> say that even one unvaxxed person is a issue, I&#39;ve always read and seen the argument being that a vast majority of people need to be immunized, around 80%, for it to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a deal where David Brock of media matters basically bragged that he was investing millions of dollars into an organization called &quot;correct the record&quot; commonly referenced around these parts as CTR.  The objective was to &quot;fight back&quot; against negative commentary on social media surrounding Hillary Clinton.  They we&#39;re going to correct the record and set things straight.</p>

<p>The problem was that the disciples they had piously defending HRC were so dedicated that they sounded like North Korean government aids being interviewed about Kim Jong Ill while they know he is 8 feet away off camera listening.  Nobody bought their shit so Mr. Brock basically bought their shit.  Literally taking over organic social media Hangouts like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and turning into creepy ass cults.  It&#39;s kind of a running joke now.  Everyone knows there is some creepy ass pro Hillary cult out there that is too vocal.  It&#39;s kind of like the people who hang out in Conspiracy to do nothing but complain that nobody here is correct about anything.  How could a normal person not getting paid for it, spend all day long talking about shit they hate?  </p>

<p>That would be like me trying to hang out at /mylittlepony and enjoy myself all dya every day for weeks on end without fail.  There is no way I wouldn&#39;t get tired of hearing about cartoon unicorns that already annoy me at a distance.</p>

<p>So why are they here?  Why are they always in alignment with MSM?</p>

<p>The answers are obvious but if I say it out loud someone will have to show up to correct the record.</p>

<p>(Afternote: it&#39;s definitely not abnormal in any way for podesta to have pedophile art works decorating his house.  Nope as much as the world hates pedophiles and everything they stand for it&#39;s just trendy art to have molested kids in oil on canvas)</p>

<p>I always assumed the majority of the cultist mentality was herd extremism. I see partisan extremism and injected opinions as fact from both sides. Extreme aggression. </p>

<p>I chocked it up to useful idiots. </p>

<p>Someone being unaware of the meaning of their username combined with responses to people while not keeping track made no sense to me. </p>

<p>Recognizing a lack of investment in opinion or stance is one thing, but having a name chosen for you was never a thought that crossed my mind. </p>

<p>I recognize the circumstantial aspect of the evidence I&#39;m now accepting. </p>

<p>But I accept it. Clearly a throwaway, not logical enough to be tmor, not arguing with anyone in particular, unaware of their own name. </p>

<p>Despite my account age, I&#39;ve been here a bit. Not a long time, but a few years. Mostly lurked due to paranoia about social media. But I made an account a while back and just delete it once I&#39;ve made too many revealing comments. </p>

<p>well its not that they would have any reason to not allow you to create your own name.   Think about how many twitter and reddit accounts get banned from the &quot;battleground&quot;.  They probably have a team that does nothing but make usernames and comments in the /NFL sub or <a href="/r/catpics">/r/catpics</a> to get past the 1800 karma lockout (you know the &quot;you must wait 8 minutes before you do that&quot;) for low karma users.</p>

<p>So you have your team of cat picture specialist cooking new accounts until they reach 1800 degrees karma, then the pre-heated accounts are turned over to topic specialists that immediately dive into to shit pot forcing whatever PR mandate has been handed down to them.  </p>

<p>the same firm could hire out the service to hillary clinton for politics, monsanto for PR cracking, Elon Musk for sweet hipster crowd support.  As long as you have the supply chain of disposable accounts already cooked and waiting it doesn&#39;t matter what you use them for.</p>

<p>However, I believe in the benefit of the doubt, and I only post a couple places myself. But I&#39;m a technophobe posting on a conspiracy or drug forum. </p>

<p>The sports + con threw me for a loop, but I figured it was trolls. I&#39;ve known plenty of people who only talk about sports and politics, so I assumed we were dealing with the common person (troll). The useful idiot. </p>

<p>I always figured ctr or shills only stepped in to silence unpopular debate. And politics and sports are always a popular debate. </p>

<p>I honestly believed that anyone paid to enforce mainstream topics and coverage were most likely ([(Rebbit)]) employees. Mostly P R. Trying to ensure an edgy but safe and merchandiseable product. </p>

<p>Maybe ctr does political propaganda, which is highly effective btw (through bots and keyword algorithms), but I kinda still think the media platform is just trying to better their image. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are 100% correct I live in southern California in a town deeply affected by illegal immigration. We&#39;ve had T.B. , measles and several other infectious diseases that the U.S. had all but eradicated. Brought back in to our schools and communities by illegal aliens. Not to mention violent crime is at an all time high. It&#39;s just common sense that if you let a large amount of the third world population into the country illegally. Without background checks without health checks without searching for drugs and weapons. You will have third world problems diseases, cartel violence, a flood of drugs etc... but unfortunately there is no common sense with liberalism it&#39;s just based in emotions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my point exactly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m vaccinated, I believe in vaccines effectiveness.  There are some vaccine schedules that I think are dangerously aggressive and wouldn&#39;t sign my kids up for but my kids WILL be vaccinated on a schedule of my choosing.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m tired of hearing people bitch about the handful of anti-vax kids living their lives in peaceful seclusion on the family&#39;s farm, blaming them for the outbreak of diseases vaccines can protect against and then turning around and protesting any attempt to secure our southern border from illegal immigrants who live in diseased little hovels where there is sewage in their drinking water and daily deaths from easily cured communicable diseases.</p>

<p>The truth is that mandatory vaccines are about control and unfettered immigration is about control.  It&#39;s all about control. Controlling your body, controlling your wages, controlling your opinions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m tired of being lectured about it.  My body my choice right?  Doesn&#39;t that apply across the board if it applies at all?</p>
