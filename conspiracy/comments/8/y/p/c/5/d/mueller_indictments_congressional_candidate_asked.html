       S.S.: A U.S. congressional candidate contacted Russian operatives in 2016 and successfully obtained damaging stolen information on their opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The indictment of 12 Russian intelligence operativesfiled Friday by special counsel Robert Mueller stated that "a candidate for the U.S. Congress" who was not named in the filing contacted Russian operatives posing as the hacker "Guccifer 2.0" and requested information stolen from the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) email server.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The conspirators responded using the Guccifer 2.0 persona and sent the candidate stolen documents related to the candidate's opponent," the filing reads.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court filing does not name the candidate involved in the information transaction or their party affiliation.

       Mueller has been getting it done. The actual collusion indictments can't come until they establish the foundation of the conspiracy as true, which is why there are these charges against Russian individuals, prosecuters need to establish a theory of the case and prove the basis of it before anyone can be charged for the grand conspiracy.. I know I kind of butchered wording that, but it's coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obstruction of justice, conspiracy to defraud the US, aiding and abetting computer crimes. These are the charges waiting for Trump and his family and allies

       All good points. This isn't over, I'm just filling up my popcorn. I'm eager to see what's coming down the pipe. I'm glad this was done on Friday the thirteenth. What a horror show.

       It is good to finally see some results from the probe, but the only thing today's indictments suggested is that a foreign intelligence agency hacked Americans and attempted to influence the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, that is not really surprising. In fact, it sounds more like par for the course. I can only imagine this is the exact kind of action taken on a daily basis by those within the intelligence community.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am keeping an open mind, but this is too much of a reach for me to believe this is connected to Trump yet.

       There's a bit more to it than that though
      </p>
      <p>
       July 27th Trump asks Russia to get Hillarys emails, that night Russia made its first attempts to hack Hillary
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia had the DNC files no earlier than March, no later than April. That following June is when Don Jr took a meeting to get dirt to use against Hillary
      </p>
      <p>
       They got access to over 500k peoples voter data and access to a company that registers voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an unnamed congressional republican who sought after dirt from Russian hackers, it's not publicly known if this person knew they were talking to hackers
      </p>
      <p>
       There are messages sited that match up verbatim to messages Roger Stone had with the guccifer, Stone claimed he wasn't GRU. Now we know he is and Stone claims he wasn't sure. He should be really worried at this point in the investigation and not been interviewed yet, that means he might be a target of the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's lots more to come from all of this

       My bad, they did attempt to hack her email that very night, I thought that was the first actual hacking attempt and up until then was a disinfo campaign

       Yeah probably, but that is a damming coincidence to say the least. Coupled with the Trump tower meetings too show a willingness to collude
