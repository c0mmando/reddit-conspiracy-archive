       Now if anyone creates a sub making fun of gays, trans, lgbtq community they are seen as a bigoted hatesubreddit and the Reddit Admins eventually ban them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But TMOR is allowed to exist making fun of and hating on us, making various bigoted anti-conspircite comments against us, and are allowed to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that fair? Shouldn't the admins ban that hate sub?

       The admins support TMoR.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is a threat to Reddit's corporate cocksucking. The admins do absolutely nothing concerning their shenanigans here.   I honestly think TMoR is a brain-child of the admins.
      </p>
      <p>
       They utilize TMoR like the U.S. uses ISIS, to cause problems while flying a different flag. Polkadotgirl (creator of r/conspiracyundone) sent messages to the admins every day about insane harassment from TMoR cunts, and was ignored.

       I had an exchange with this meatsack in the comments of a post about the results of a vaccine study that used an actual saline solution placebo, instead of a different vaccine or the vaccine constituents minus the antigen. The findings of the study indicated there was an increased risk (5.5 x from memory) of several health issues for the group receiving the vaccine vs the placebo (whereas typical vaccine studies use another vaccine or background ingredients as the placebo and get far less significant variation in results, surprise surprise).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, meatsack jumps in with his copy/pasted list of reasons why OP was wrong, the first of which was "hundreds of other studies have been conducted that support the harmlessness of vaccines".
      </p>
      <p>
       So I asked mr sack if the studies he referred to also used a saline solution as this appeared to be the critical piece of information pertaining to the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr sack replied asking why I thought this was a critical piece of information and pasted a link regarding vaccine denier syndrome or some kind of mediocre attempt at sophistry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pointed out I was reiterating what OP had said and repeated my question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaty (I felt like we were on close enough terms to call him this at this point) then asked AGAIN why I felt it was a critical piece of information, however he did also include a link to 1 study that (fuck me! meatsack express delivers) referred to a vaccine study using saline as placebo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used the words with the least amount of syllables I could think of to state it was OP's point, not mine, and that I had asked The sack whether his reference to "hundreds of studies" were conducted with real placebo as this was the whole fucking point of the article (only in a neutrally toned manner).
      </p>
      <p>
       I also took a look at the study he cited and it was conducted on 65+ year old veterans, injecting either a vaccine first, then saline 2 weeks later or vice versa. Whereas OP's study was vaccine or saline only and lasted over 9 months (so they're totally similar, in the same way that an orange can be considered analogous to an apple due to it being a fruit that is round in shape).
      </p>
      <p>
       I pointed this out to the meatiest of sacks and his response was "you asked for an example, you have one", before hearkening back to his pet link on vaccine denial and something something moving targets and did I understand the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just replied clarifying that the study he cited wasn't relevant or applicable because of x and could he understand the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, point is, meatsack hadn't excreted a reply to that for over a day so I checked to see what had become of the silly little puppy and, would you fucking look at that, he posted in TMOR feverishly reaching out for a supportive circle jerk over the fact he'd been banned from r/conspiracy (appears final straw for mod was him trying to shit on linked data indicating dangers and harm of vax in a thread, while attempting to supplant them with a link to sanitized data), bemoaning mods and users of this sub in a litany replete with hypocrisy and a total lack of cognizance to the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one was astounded this utterly disingenuous and semantically challenged sack of meat could have been a member of TMOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I have no idea why I wrote all this shit when I could have just linked to our discussion, anyway TMOR are a joke told by a cognitively impaired person that you laugh at despite it's muddled delivery and terrible punch line, but then you just feel kinda weird about afterwards because the whole experience was just sad and pathetic and now you're angry because why the fuck did you just have to go through the awkward and taxing experience listening to a broken joke from a retarded comedian? Is this what the future looks like? At what point can eugenics programs be justified just to never have to deal with the 'on the spectrum' sense of humor of a complete fucktard?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I could have stated my feeling toward TMOR more clearly than this.
