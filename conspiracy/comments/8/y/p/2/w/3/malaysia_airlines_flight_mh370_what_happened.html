<p>I came across this passenger manifest info here, <a href="https://m.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1443730/full-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-passenger-list">https://m.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1443730/full-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-passenger-list</a></p>

<p>Are any of these people important?</p>

<p>Is there any connection to the incident four months later, where a plane was shot down? What&#39;s the bigger picture?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>bringsmemes is referring to a story which was posted on the internet not too long after MH370 disappeared, claiming things about Freescale patents that were issued the week MH370 disappeared. In truth, everything about the story is wrong: the importance of the patents, how patent law works, who owned Freescale. But most of all, none of the patent holders were on the flight.</p>

<p>So I was just challenging bringsmemes to find a patent holder on the list of passengers.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t.  The patent rights for the inventions of Freescale employees belong to the company by virtue of their employment contracts. That&#39;s why Freescale is listed as the assignee on all the patents. The inventors <em>assigned</em> the rights to Freescale. Whether the inventors lived or died is completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also no evidence any Rothschild had anything to do with Freescale.</p>

<p>Like I said, <em>everything</em> about this story is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very key detail to me. Was this before or after the plane allegedly crashed?</p>

<p>Another angle shows Freescale Semiconductor had 20 employees on that flight, and their company worked on countersignals controller chips.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, this has Def Sec written all over it, and imo increases the liklihood of an even grander sort possibilities. Did the plane even crash, or did it land safely somewhere with everyone popping champagne?</p>

<p>March 19, 2014: 20 employees of Freescale Semiconductor were aboard the plane, all of which had high positions. Freescale happened to be working on technology which could help a plane escape detection by radar systems. Could MH370 have been a real world proof of concept? <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/465557/Malaysian-plane-20-on-board-worked-for-ELECTRONIC-WARFARE-and-radar-defence-company">https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/465557/Malaysian-plane-20-on-board-worked-for-ELECTRONIC-WARFARE-and-radar-defence-company</a></p>

<p>Feb 9, 2018: Malaysia &quot;sidelines&quot; 4 investigators and seeks to replace them with air force pilots that have less crash investigation experience, <a href="http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-08/malaysia-replaces-civilian-mh370-investigators-with-pilots/9410586?pfmredir=sm">http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-08/malaysia-replaces-civilian-mh370-investigators-with-pilots/9410586?pfmredir=sm</a></p>

<p>March 19, 2018: 25 year Aussie crash investigator and Engineer claims he has proof of location of plane riddle with bullet holes, and supplies pictures, but is quickly denounced by the Australia Transport and Safety Bureau, <a href="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/03/mh370-conspiracy-australian-officials-slam-investigator-over-cover-up-claims.html">https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/03/mh370-conspiracy-australian-officials-slam-investigator-over-cover-up-claims.html</a></p>

<p>May 18, 2018: Canadian accident investigator who wrote a book claiming he believes that it was a murder-suicide, goes on 60-Minutes Australia as part of a team of &quot;experts&quot; (conjecture artists), <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-370-crash-deliberate-panel-of-aviation-experts/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-370-crash-deliberate-panel-of-aviation-experts/</a></p>

<p>May 29, 2018: Malaysia officially closes investigation again, <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/malaysia-ends-four-year-hunt-missing-airline-mh370-82121">https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/malaysia-ends-four-year-hunt-missing-airline-mh370-82121</a></p>

<p>Afterthoughts: Maybe we have all been distracted by the bigger picture. Proving their technology works would have made Freescale Semicpnductor a lot of money. Sure enough within a year of the incident Freescale became poised to take over as leader of the market, <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/story/13063305/1/freescale-semiconductor-fsl-stock-soars-today-on-40-billion-nxp-semiconductors-deal.html">https://www.thestreet.com/story/13063305/1/freescale-semiconductor-fsl-stock-soars-today-on-40-billion-nxp-semiconductors-deal.html</a></p>

<p>Now in 2018: Freescale Semiconductor is poised to merge with Qualcomm, and it&#39;s stocks plunge, dispite good first quarter earnings, making their purchase desirable, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/03/why-nxp-semiconductors-nv-shares-plunged-today.aspx">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/03/why-nxp-semiconductors-nv-shares-plunged-today.aspx</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I met a private jet pilot at a bar one night who flies various executives and celebrities around for a living, and he told me that “someone who would know” told him what actually happened. </p>

<p>Apparently, the pilots were moving something incredibly illegal and/or dangerous on that plane.he said they ended up releasing a gas into the cabin to put everyone to sleep, then they landed to drop off their cargo. After that, they took off again, and then parachuted out, leaving everyone to crash and die in the middle of the ocean. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seem to be a number of leaps of logic here. Which was it, dangerous or illegal?</p>

<p>First it is useless to put all of the passengers to sleep, because they aren&#39;t the only ones witnessing the plane&#39;s actions. Military and other signal operations would have tracked the irregularities in the flight path.</p>

<p>If they parachuted out in the middle of the ocean who picked them up? Did they swim home?</p>

<p>It seems obvious, that there are way easier ways to smuggle things. The CIA uses shell companies for instance. Your story sounds very James Bond and larger than life (ie. Far fetched). Unless you have some evidence what you were told is true, I&#39;d be sure to deny what we cannot confirm, especially when there are such interesting things that we can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After watching a few docos about mh370, my opinion is UFO encounter.  Not that I believe much in aliens and stuff (i have yet to see a convincing video record), but I can&#39;t think of any other fully convincing hypothesis.</p>

<p>I like the freescale hypothesis. However, there are too many things around this case that cannot make it a fully believable scenario. Why did all foreign authorities agreed to stay quiet ? Why would they crash a plane full of passengers just to get rid of these 4 chinese guys ? Organizing a plane crash seems overly complicated here. They could have got say, freescale to arrange a team building trip by bus, and have the bus fall over a cliff or something. Or even pay a hitman, or disguise a suicide, or poison the guys. Not a specialist of this, but that seems way easier to do than arranging a plane crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for representing the UFO angle. I was waiting and hoping somebody would present that angle. Do you have links to some documentaries? </p>

<p>I can think of other plausible hypotheses. Please see my large comment where I update on the research I&#39;ve been doing. Freescale Semiconductor is painted on a lot of moving pieces here, and had monetary incentive to conduct this event, for reasons which I have guessed at. The year after the event, the company became the industry leader, and now is about to merge with Qualcomm. The company was working on chips that would help an airplane evade military level detection systems. So in my humble opinion, this could have been a real world proof of concept, and all the people could be alive. On the other hand they could really have died, but we havent found any of their bodies, though wreckage washed ashore allegedly. Thats a huge glaring hole in the official story it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was about a guy (call him Mr Rothchild or whatever), getting their hands on a very valuable patent, why would authorities from other countries such as China, Malaysia, Thailand etc... cooperate with the official narrative ? What do they gain here ? They don&#39;t get a share of the patent rights, do they ? </p>

<p>Why would that British satellite images company (inmarsat) refuse to release satellite images with the plane flight path ? If it was about the pilot who committed a suicide, the blame goes on the now defunct pilot, doesn&#39;t it ? Malaysian Airlines gives a formal speech and say they are sorry for the loss, and case closed.</p>

<p>Why would this former French commercial planes pilot, who initiated to conduct his own investigations, say that his mate working at the French secret services &quot;strongly advised him to give up&quot; ? (this comes from a documentary I watched on YT).</p>

<p>To me, these 3 questions alone rule out the freescale patent scenario, however interesting that scenario sounds.</p>

<p>Another interesting scenario is a diplomatic accident. Like, the Americans at diego garcia accidentally shot down the plane. But that doesn&#39;t make sense either. Because, commercial planes leave a different radar signature than military planes, so you cannot take a commercial plane for a military plane. And I don&#39;t think you can &quot;accidentally&quot; shoot a missile. That must require several levels of approvals in the military hierarchy. </p>

<p>The other most plausible scenario (given the UFO can be called plausible) would be that the plane was shot down to move forward an agenda or to solve some diplomatic tensions between Malaysia and another country. You know, like when they do these false flag attacks in the UK, US or France, and they are meant to send a warning, or to push an authoritarian state agenda (=we need to record everyone&#39;s Internet activity to avoid any such attacks repeat in the future)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that there are a number of Freescale Semiconductor theories which are far-fetched, but when I see a cloud of mis and disinformation wrapped around something that perks my detective nose.</p>

<p>First to make something seem absurd, then to discard it, but I am not finished yet or ready to discard Freescale. In my research which is found in a big main reply to this post, I uncovered that Freescale was working on tech that allowed planes to escape even military signal ops. I say, that one detail should perk anyone&#39;s ear. The question that popped into my mind is, was this plane event merely a real world proof of concept? After all, the company Freescale Semiconductor became the market leader a year later, and now is poised to merge with Qualcomm.</p>
