       Was having a chat with a user on here where we kind of got off on a tangent on Kazakhstan. This post wanders around a bit, I hope you guys are able to piece together where I am coming from. I just started thinking about this yesterday, and the ideas are by no means well organized yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, wtf even is Kazakhstan? I think I vaguely remember it as a shitty piece of real estate in the board game Risk. Surely it is just a little 3rd world country where people scratch out a meager existence like much of the other countries in the area? Nope, it is large and it is very wealthy, and it is run by a despot that has some very interesting tastes in architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, watch this quick 10min video on what is going on in Kazakhstan.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Then check out the Wikipedia entry just for background:

       What is with all the Masonic/occult symbolism? How are we not aware of the thriving economy there? What is its history?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, here it is on a map. Note that huge border it shares with Russia, I will get there later.

      <p>
       Ok, what is the history here? Is it important? There was another influential group of people that originated here. The Ashkenazis. Let us take a look at where they originated from:

      </p>
      <p>
       Map is from here, I would read this too if you are not familiar with the subject of Ashkenazis:

       All of the happenings in Saudi Arabia have many of us excited, and believe me I am too. I don't want to be a wet blanket, but I have had reservations, and I would love to be wrong here. See, there are rumors that the SA royalty may secretly be jewish, of at the very least have a much better working relationship that is implied by the media. How is the relationship between Israel and the new ruler in SA? You know the one that just purged the "corruption" in SA? I found this, and this guy looks pretty good for Israel:

        https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.797007
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if there are better. But these happenings have undoubtedly been of great benefit to Israel. What if this isn't swamp draining, what if Israel is just consolidating power?
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know that Israel has major issues with Russia which I never really understood until I looked at this stuff, and realized Russia shares a massive border with Kazakhstan. In fact, I believe all of this conflict with Iran and Russia has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, or suspected hacking, or terrorism. It has more to do with Russia being a historical enemy of the Ashkenazi. What if Israel is just bullshit that was used as a means to an end, while the Ashkenazi were secretly preparing for a return to their homeland?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you guys think, am I totally nuts?

      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: one more thing I think is related that I am exploring now, was anyone aware that there is a Chinese sect of Ashkenazi jewish people? I think this could be very important too:

       If it is then it's a Jewish fabrication because they now fully admit and are even proud of what that empire was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it's completely true and there has been a conspiracy to cover-up it's historical existence mainly by British and American historians who have deliberately omitted any mention of it among the major empires of the past or the role that it played during the period that it existed.

       Well I subscribe to a version of the new chronology and it states that much of our history is fabrication. And I don't see a lot of evidence for khazaria or a Jewish state in that region. And the only sources seem to be Jewish sources. Probably an attempt to further obfuscate the empire of grand Tartaria. And legitimize Jewish presence in the region. Much like Israel , think that there is more evidence that biblical Israel was in France and not the Middle East. Lots of fuckery if you ask me.

       The origins of European Jews from some completely non-Semitic Eastern Eurasian stock has actually been borne out by numerous DNA tests and studies that there's also been a concerted effort to  suppress and dismiss as much as possible by the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also not so small mystery of where the "Yiddish" most European Jews speak happens to come from in that despite being written in the Hebrew alphabet it bears no resemblance to the Hebrew language whatsoever and doesn't share so much as a single solitary word with it and despite having plenty of borrowed German words and terms has no discernable relation to it, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the possibility that started out as an unwritten Khazarian language that also adopted the Hebrew alphabet and phonetics in order to be able to write it would also dovetail nicely into the Khazarian and Judaic conversion narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The so-called Khazarian Empire was also bordered by Christian, Islamic, and Mongol empires who were all at odds and constantly warring with one another making their official conversion to Judaism a pragmatic way to avoid become associated with or embroiled in any of those hostilities.

       The prominent and highly respected author, Arthur Koestler, who also happened to be a Hungarian Jew was one of the first to discover that his own roots had no connection to the Jews in the Bible or that originally inhabited the Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quest and what he discovered in the process that he documented in the book he wrote about it that was simply called "The Thirteenth Tribe".
      </p>
      <p>
       The opposition was both loud and predictable and on the same level as the opposition and outcry turned up against Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's "Russia and the Jews: 200 Years Together" which attempted to completely ban and prevent an English version from ever being sold in the US despite just how well researched and brutally honest his analysis was in all of his works including that one as well. Both books are well worth the read with plenty of factual information surrounding this entire topic.

       The Borat movies are all about Jewish ethnic hatred for gentiles. Have you ever heard the expression "beyond the pale "when referring to objectionable behavior? This originated in the hatred and superstitions the Jews who lived inside the "Pale of Jewish settlement" had for those goyim who lived "beyond the Pale." Every behavior that is evil, unseemly, or objectionable is attributed to those who live "beyond the pale." Sascha Baron Cohen's borat movies just take this anti-gentile hatred and put it on the silver screen.

       For over a millenium, Jews have rehashed the narrative that they are blameless victims hated for no other reason than because they are Jews. Of course it's a lie. They are hated because of the crimes they commit against goyim.

       That’s not where “Beyond the Pale” comes from. It comes from the 800 year English occupation of Ireland, in which the area surrounding Dublin was known as “The Pale”, and remained under strong British cultural, military, and judicial control whereas the rural areas outside it were harder to control, more culturally Gaelic (and after the reformation, Catholic), and represented a greater departure from English culture and society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Irish people from outside of Dublin still refer to it jokingly as “The Pale”, and the origins of this term are very well documented.

       I have a friend who I grew up with, and he is an engineer in Kazakhstan. Before that, he was working in Russia. Regardless of the public perception of these places, the US has always done business with these countries closely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our perception is based on what we know, and we are led to believe things based off movies and TV, but i doubt it's intentional. I remember moving from the south of the US to the north as a child, and having everyone ask if we rode horses to school.

       Kazakhstan and ASTANTA are some interesting places for sure. I appreciate your looking into and compiling the data here.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple years back there was a group called TENGRI 137 that was........ an interesting saga to be sure.

       I found after doing some research that they were based out of this mystery school in Kazakhstan.

       It looks like they were looking for the seekers and the 1 percenters who see between the lines. I know it is stated that page 23 is still unsolved BUT it could be that SOMEONE solved it already but wasn't aloud to reveal the answer.

       The biggest element of this to ring supernatural is the Hebrew name of god formula that results in the Fine Structure Constant.
      </p>
      <p>
       (pi/7)/Pi to the 7th power= the fine structure constant to 3 decimals, then divide that by 6.67b and you find a much closer representation of the FSC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going further, the FSC is the number at which light interacts with matter.  and let there be light. haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a christian BTW but the bible is original Hebrew is Supernatural.

       ♫ Kazakhstan is the great.. est country in the world... All oooother countries, a-are run by li-ttle girls. ♪
      </p>
      <p>
       Jokes aside, Kazakhstan isn't wholly the successor of Khazaria. It ranged from Turkey to Kazakhstan to part of Russia, by modern maps. But you're right, though, about the evil history of Khazarians and the modern descendents aka Ashkenazi Jews. The only way to make sense of the "RUSSIA REEEEE" nonsense of the media is to learn about the millenium-old grudge between Ashkenazim and Russians due to their being forced to convert to Judaism by that Russian emperor in 1100 AD, for doing things that we think of today as typically Ashkenazic behavior such as engaging in usury; stealing identities to better infiltrate host societies; ritually sacrificing children in the same fashion as is in JRM and pizzagate; etc.

       Kazakhstan has one of the world's most sophisticated headquarters for all things artificial intelligence and neural networks. In addition, they have tons of uranium which is necessary for both weaponry and for quantum computing due to its ability to convert into element 93.

       If Putin is correct that he who has control over AI will effectively rule the world... well, there you go. That certainly makes this country of significant importance.

       You dont know about Kazakhstan because you're American and you probably couldn't even find Ottawa or Mexico city on a map, nevermind realize that there are extremely wealthy people in pretty much every country in the world. You buy your gas directly from the Kazakhs. Also, the khazar ashkanezi connection is a fringe theory, debunked by actual science based on genetics tests, linguistics, anthropology , archaeology, and history.

       The prominent and highly respected author, Arthur Koestler, who also happened to be a Hungarian Jew was one of the first to discover that his own roots had no connection to the Jews in the Bible or that originally inhabited the Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quest and what he discovered in the process that he documented in the book he wrote about it that was simply called "The Thirteenth Tribe".

      <p>
       The opposition was both loud and predictable and on the same level as the opposition and outcry turned up against Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's "Russia and the Jews: 200 Years Together" which attempted to completely ban and prevent an English version from ever being sold in the US despite just how well researched and brutally honest his analysis was in all of his works including that one as well. Both books are well worth the read with plenty of factual information surrounding this entire topic.
