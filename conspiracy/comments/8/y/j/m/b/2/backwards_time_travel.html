       I have been thinking about this.  If you can move forward in time through a wormhole.  Why cant you go back through to where you came from?  It only makes sense.  I personally think time travel is bullshit because speed of light is what it is.  Speed of electrons.  Its not moving forward in time.  Its very fast.  So who the fuck thinks speed of light makes you fast travel in time?  That's a idiotic ideology.  If I traveled speed of light right now I would simply get somewhere very fast but I wouldn't be altering time at all.  Time travel is make believe conspiracy.  You could travel speed of light all god damn day but you will just be moving around fast in this time like a light switch.  You wouldnt be moving ahead in time. Common sense

       Uhh... Time travel has always been a fictional concept. Not once has it been demonstrated at any level. The closest you'll get to "speeding up" time would be to travel at speed of light, at which point,
       <em>
        theoretically
       </em>
       , the temporal processes in your... vessel?.. will pause to a halt, meaning that in effect, you would be unable to perceive time at all, through aging, senses, thought, or otherwise. Pretty much putting your life on pause. That is, however, only a theory, since no actual experiment has ever measured the effects of travel speed even close to the speed of light on a reasonably massive object.

       People say when you look through a telescope and see something light years away it happened already.  Thats a fucking lie.  If you visually witness it.  It just happened.  Not such thing as it took 80 million light years for you to witness this.  Dont act like a genius dude

       Bro, are you saying that light travels instanteously from the point of emition to the point of observation?  Because you would in fact be wrong, and wrongly proved through experiement. 
Light takes time to travel across a distance, x, just as any other moving object would. It just travels faster than other objects.  It would still take light a determinable amoun tof time to travel from one object to another regardless of distance.  But if the distance is astronomically huge, then yeah it could take milennia.

       Well... math isn't wrong, really, it's more of an information transfer concept. Think about it this way: what you see is never an event, it is a projection onto your retina of the light reflected by objects participating in an event. So catch my drift here: you don't see things, you see the image of things. Like a photograph that travels at the speed of light. Put this photograph very-very far away, and it will take many years to get to you. Just like a photograph of Marylin Monroe: she's long dead, and the photoshoot happened a long while ago, but you see it. This is essentially information that takes a long time to get delivered. Like mail by courier: first someone writes the mail, then courier takes a few days to deliver it, then it takes you some time to read it, and by that time, the news is stale, it's already happened a while ago, but you know it only now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think you are trying to say is that some idiot claims you can witness things, then move away really fast and witness them again. That is just someone being stupid, that's all.

       I'm trying to think about this practically... so bear with and please please, correct any misconceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this, lets just assume we can actually travel 2x the speed of light, due to some science (or fuck it, magic) that allows it.  To be clear, as of now, even reaching the speed of light seems to be fairly impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       So scenario 1.  We are on earth, but we have an astronaut that is able to drive his space ship 2x faster than the speed of light.  He is stationed currently 50 light years away, directly in the line of sight of an exploding star, 100 light years away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth ---- 50 light years ---- Our hero, buzz double light year ---- 50 light years ---- Star
      </p>
      <p>
       So, The star explodes.  Buzz sees it in 50 light years, as the light from the explosion only travels the speed of light.  He now decides to experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buzz shifts his ship into hyper speed and travels 25 light years back to earth.
Earth -- 25 light years -- Our hero, buzz double light year ------ 75 light years ------ Star
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, The light of the explosion kept moving, but not as fast as buzz.  I would presume here that buzz would witness the same event again.  He is seeing the same light, but now at a further distance.  Okay, so with this theory, viewing something live that you have already seen before, IS possible.  Albeit, no one would consider this time travel.  More like an echo than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       So scenerio 2.   The star explodes and now buzz decides to travel 25 light years toward the star.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth ------ 75 light years ------ Our hero, buzz double light year -- 25 light years -- Star
      </p>
      <p>
       When Buzz Arrives, he looks at the star and sees it done exploding.  Would you consider this seeing the future?  Or more of a preview of something that already happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the rub...
       <br/>
       Lets assume instead of a star exploding, a speed of light rocket was launched from that star.  Buzz then 'races' the rocket back to earth to warn the earthlings.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims to have seen a rocket fired at the speed of light 100 light years away, and in 50 light years it will reach us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is buzz aware of the future that earth didn't experience yet?  Yes.  Did he time travel?  Not in my opinion, but he could probably convince us he did.  When radar detects a moving vehicle in the distance, do we consider this time travel? or more of an early warning system?  Are we able to predict the future or are we using recon to establish more current information?  Is there any possible situation where buzz could have prevented the rocket from being launched, before it was launched?
      </p>
      <p>
       The leap to actual time travel just seems impractical, even if we bend every law of physics to get there.

       It doesn't matter if he travelled back at 2x light years.  Time remains the same youre right.  Speed can not alter time or change it.  I watched ancient aliens and a dumb fuck scientist said its possible to travel forward in time at light speed.  He will be moving but time wont be moving.  Its a simple understanding.  He will basically make a ton of laps around earth but when he stops time will still be the same.  To time travel you have to warp time.  I think it is possible but it needs a wormhole.  Quantum theory.  Time itself has to be manipulated.  I think cern is trying to manipulate time with those tunnels in Switzerland.  A higgs field.  But they aren't close.  I think they gave up

       I think for the most part we agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that just circling the earth faster than light would somehow change time in the rest of the universe seems, well off.  I know in super hero comics, the flash and superman could circle the earth to change the speed of time.  But no.  Regardless of the speed, the earth's speed of rotation hasn't moved any faster or slower, which is how we denote time (essentially days).  Even if it did change the speed of rotation, EVERYONE's day would become longer or shorter.  Not just our super heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, even in my example I needed to use the impossible to make it fit.  Wormholes (as we are aware at our current scientific understanding, don't exist.  They might, they have been theorized.  But even if those wormholes were real, why would we immediately assume it would be some sort of teleporter?  Most of the things in space will immediately kill us if we even got close to them, black holes, all stages of stars, most planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, even if they did exist, and were able to transport us.  Why would we assume it could transfer us as a 'whole.'  I feel like it would more likely transfer the individual molecules.
      </p>
      <p>
       With our current technology, we cannot take the absolute molecules that make up a human and create a working human from them.  The cells must grow together.  Even if we clone, we're not making an exact replica.  We're making a new entity that shares the genetic characteristics of the original.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to be wrong on this, but just waxing curiosity based on what we know now seems that this concept would have to defy logic.

       dude, if the light, from whatever point in space it reflects off of, is super far away it would take a long time to reach us, therefore whatever we are observing when that light reaches us actually happened in the past.  And, the amount of time in the past it occured in, is equal to the amount of time it would take light to travel from the point of reflection to the point of observation

       Einstein is wrong.  I understand relativity.  They are moving matter at cern at speeds of light.  So if you can bend time and go into another dimension you guarantee a paradox.  Wrong answer

       Its called THEORY of relativity.  How do you asshats know what is really going on?  Lol nobody does.  We have knowledge.  There could be time travellers and all kinds of shit we would never know bc we are idiots!  We know NOTHING.  We have no idea why we are even on this planet or where this planet came from. Lmao.  Theory of big bang. Big bang THEORY????? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.  YOU DONT KNOW WHY YOU ARE HERE!

       If we live in computer simulation, then all physics go out the window if the system can be hacked in some way IMO.  Lots of alien abductees that experience lost time say aliens can manipulate time.  Who know what tech can be develop in an extra million years (or however advanced they are).

       Yeah but dumbasses claimed you could fly at speed of light and beat time.  As of now there is nothing feasible more than speed of light mathematically.  So more than speed of light is basically going into quantum theory and bending time.  4th dimension bc nothing is more than speed of light so they develop quantum theory

       Negative matter.  Dark matter.  Time is looped.  This could all be a loop.  Everything we are doing now could have already happened.  Like a cd man.  Skip and rewind.  A loop.  Where did that energy come from?  Think about it.  Parallel universes.  Multiverse.  Frames

       The energy uses itself and collapses and renews.  Over and over.  You could be living on earth x100 right now from energy collapsing and renewing.  A big bang repeating itself over and over again.  The energy indeed could be infinite.   I know what you are saying.  This is the hidden piece.  That one star does not refuse but how can you say the energy has not been dispersed during its span.  Everything released must come back? Right?  Just bc something burns out does not mean the energy simply vanished.  Have you not read on dark matter?
