<p>This was from a Business Insider article posted today on why we haven&#39;t been back to the moon. Most of us that are &quot;Fringe Analyst&quot; question if we ever did...I personally don&#39;t think we did for plenty of reasons. </p>

<p>In the article....</p>

<p>There is no mention of NASA losing all of it&#39;s tech the used in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s. Even though they admit that here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl1H1WxWTuc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl1H1WxWTuc</a></p>

<p>There is no mention of the moon landing tapes being lost. Even though they admit it here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1l-jf3KqA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q1l-jf3KqA</a></p>

<p>Below is a video that I would recommend to anyone that wants to solidify the proof we never went, anyone that questions the official narrative, or anyone that believes we have been to the moon. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrujSJPLHOA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrujSJPLHOA</a></p>

<p>Space is a HOAX, and is the biggest lie ever told. Why the lie? To make us feel insignificant, and to take away how important we all are. What has &quot;Modern&quot; Scientism been teaching us? That there is no God, and that we are a small spec, on a small spec, apart of a small spec, within another small spec in a Universe that is never ending.  What does that mean? That means we don&#39;t matter and will go along with whatever we are told (Sheep). What do they not want you to know? That we were created by a higher power and meant to live a life of love and happiness. </p>

<p>How do you brainwash? Keep repeating the same thing over and over again. Even if someone is resisting the concept and you keep repeating it they will eventually incorporate it in their brain. </p>

<p>Back in the 60&#39;s when &quot;we went to the Moon&quot; this was the first time we had a instrument of flight that could go up high enough to actually check out what we all agreed to 500 years ago was real. So if they were wrong after 500 years, the question is...Would they tell you? </p>

<p>Again watch this....<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrujSJPLHOA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrujSJPLHOA</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with OP except that clip of &quot;Kubrick&quot; talking about the Moon landings is hoaxed - that&#39;s an actor, not Kubrick.  Someone made that clip within the last few years and it&#39;s made the rounds countless times.  Does resemble Kubrick but pull up a picture and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s not him.</p>

<p>I concur that Kubrick helped film the moon landings during the mid to late 60s - It&#39;s public knowledge he worked with NASA around this time and they assisted him with 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Whether he was actually there while the footage was being faked - who knows - but they definitely use front screen projection - a technique the Kubrick is famous for.  There are also artifacts in the moon landing footage that suggest other film techniques Kubrick used frequently.</p>

<p>Recap- If you go to a remote area away from the city lights and look for Polaris (North Star) and take a good camera and film the sky for a long period of time. Then take that footage and do a time lapse video. You will see all the stars rotate around Polaris and make circles above of.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I guess my take would be that I&#39;m not certain.  And I don&#39;t think anyone has visited any stars or devised any means to test their composition or nature very accurately, so I&#39;m not likely to know for certain.  I honestly believe that most of modern astronomy is pseudoscience and I would say you are assuming the existence of outer space and then assuming the stars are there.</p>

<p>When I look up and see the stars I try to appreciate them for what they are - which is somewhat mysterious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in Science that is observable and repeatable every time. (Fire is hot, water is wet, objects heavier than air fall, objects lighter than air rise)  I do not believe in Scientific theory (Evolution, Big Bang, Gravity, Relativity etc)</p>

<p>Cells can be seen with a microscope and I&#39;ve seen them with my own eyes so yes. Evolution, no...At least not what we&#39;re taught (Apes to Humans). But I do believe in the ancient Nephilim (Giants), but I haven&#39;t seem them so just a personal belief based on The book of Enoch and plenty of stories of people finding Giant human bones. 
I believe the Earth is very very very old, but I don&#39;t think any one person can put an age on it. 
Plate tectonics is a scientific theory not fact. Earthquakes are real so plate rubbing against themselves would be real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went looking for info this because I had the same conversation with some people when this video came out, in 2015, I believe.</p>

<p><a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/2017/11/moon-landing-hoax-why-the-faked-kubrick-confession-matters%ef%bb%bf/">This says it&#39;s fake</a>, but the linked video with the included outtakes where the director, Murray, refers to Kubrick as &quot;Tom&quot; and tells him what to say has been removed for copyright claims, as is any other link to copies of it I&#39;ve so far found reference to; my guess would be this was done by Murray.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niEcNiU_2jA">Here is a podcast debunking it.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to look around some more, watch/listen to these + your links. Will get back if I find anything else. Thing is, I&#39;m thinking this is the second fake interview purported to be with Kubrick, because the stills don&#39;t look like the they&#39;re from the fake interview I remember, and the 2k15 date seems much later than when I remember the fake being discussed [~2k9?].</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome/sure, no problem. </p>

<p>OK, I&#39;m pretty sure this wasn&#39;t the same interview I saw ~2k9. I was in a different house and a member of a different message board where this was discussed sometime between 2k6 &amp; 2k9. That one was in a well-lit room in a house. There was also outtakes back then showing them walking around in the house, talking. Pretty sure it&#39;s the same &quot;Kubrick&quot;, so same director, too. I seem to remember the Murray name associated with this. My best guess is he&#39;s redone/repackaged this to be something new. For a laugh/joke? $? Clicks? It sure does confuse the issue. Maybe just a big time waster, as I&#39;ve proved here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny. The idea of space doesn&#39;t make me feel small. And it damn sure doesn&#39;t eradicate either the possibility OR the majesty of a Creator.  </p>

<p>I am sorry if you feel that the idea that we are part of a vast cosmos somehow makes you feel insignificant. I truly am--because it has never made me feel that way in the slightest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t feel insignificant but thank you for apologizing if I did. </p>

<p>If you imagine Earth shrunk down to the size of a single grain of sand, and you imagine the size of that grain of sand relative to the entirety of the Sahara Desert, you are still nowhere near to comprehending how infinitesimally small a position we occupy in space. The American astronomer Carl Sagan said, &quot;Our planet, is nothing more than ‘a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam’.&quot;</p>

<p>The American author John Updike expressed it in 1985 when he wrote of modern science that:
We shrink from what it has to tell us of our perilous and insignificant place in the cosmos … our century’s revelations of unthinkable largeness and unimaginable smallness, of abysmal stretches of geological time when we were nothing, of supernumerary galaxies … of a kind of mad mathematical violence at the heart of the matter have scorched us deeper than we know.</p>

<p>Recap- If you go to a remote area away from the city lights and look for Polaris (North Star) and take a good camera and film the sky for a long period of time. Then take that footage and do a time lapse video. You will see all the stars rotate around Polaris and make circles above of.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I guess my take would be that I&#39;m not certain.  And I don&#39;t think anyone has visited any stars or devised any means to test their composition or nature very accurately, so I&#39;m not likely to know for certain.  I honestly believe that most of modern astronomy is pseudoscience and I would say you are assuming the existence of outer space and then assuming the stars are there.</p>

<p>When I look up and see the stars I try to appreciate them for what they are - which is somewhat mysterious.</p>
