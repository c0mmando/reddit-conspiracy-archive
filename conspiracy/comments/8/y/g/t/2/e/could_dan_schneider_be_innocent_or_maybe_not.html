        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-07-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/thecanonanon.html">thecanonanon</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Eh...I still think the feet thing is weird, but...</p>

<p>The only time someone actually asked an actor about this situation was with Noah Munk (guy who played Gibby on iCarley) and Angelique Bates (chick from All That!). Noah Munk said that he didn&#39;t see or think Dan was acting weird while they were on set, and would be devastated if the rumors were true, but he did hint that he understands why people are questionable about it because of the whole feet thing. Angelique Bates said in an interview podcast on Revenge Of The Cis (a YouTube podcast that&#39;s been studying hard on this conspiracy) that Dan never touched her or anything, but she did say that he did cuss her out for something she didn&#39;t do, and that he told her to stop making the audience laugh because it&#39;s &quot;stealing the spotlight from other kids&quot;, so there is a chance that he may have a temper.</p>

<p>Also it pisses me off how people are using the Jenette McCurdy Vine as evidence. If you know Jenette McCurdy&#39;s sarcastic sense of humor, you can obviously tell she was kidding, and the reason why she was dressed up all weird looking was because it was for an episode of Sam &amp; Cat. They even made a stunt devil dress up the same way. This pretty much proves that the people investigating this theory aren&#39;t looking deep at both sides of the story (Not gonna lie. I think a huge portion of the people who think that he&#39;s a pedophile only believe that because he&#39;s an obese and socially awkward dude who works with children). I don&#39;t believe that he&#39;s the father of Jamie Lynn Spears&#39; daughter because that would have been revealed. I&#39;m pretty sure that if he did do something to one of his major stars, they would have admitted it already, because they&#39;d be so huge in the industry, they wouldn&#39;t care too tell their experience with him and make him look bad. I mean, Ariana Grande hasn&#39;t said anything about him, and I&#39;m pretty sure Brittany Spears would&#39;ve exposed his ass if he was actually the dad.</p>

<p>And no. Reddit posts, and anonymous forum sites do not prove anything. There have been anonymous posts that say Dan is innocent, and that Nickelodeon had been very strict about predators, but does anyone ever look into those? There&#39;s even people from his shows like Drake Bell that have said that he&#39;s a &quot;genius&quot;, and Ariana Grande even cried and hugged him when Victorious ended. They&#39;ve talked about how much they loved their job on social media, and look back at all of it. Don&#39;t you think that if something horrible did happen, they wouldn&#39;t have done that?</p>

<p>Hell! last year, Grande even tweeted Dan Schneider DEMANDING him that she wants a Victorious reunion episode, and the rest of the cast agreed.</p>

<p>And seriously guys? You can&#39;t CAUSE people to get schizophrenia. Amanda Bynes did not &#39;get schizophrenia&#39; and go crazy because of Dan doing anything to her. People who have the disorder normally don&#39;t show symptoms until their late teens or early 20&#39;s. And she never even brought up Dan...she said that her Drake Bell fucked, and that her father molested her, but she never said anything about Dan. Drake Bell even said in an interview that he doubts that her craziness came from anything involved with Nickelodeon (he also said that he thinks of everyone who worked on Drake &amp; Josh as a family).</p>

<p>There&#39;s also been on drama on his shows that have been shown to the public before. Like that shit that was going on with Victoria Justice and Ariana Grande, or when Jenette McCurdy actually quit Nickelodeon because the executives wouldn&#39;t give her a break even after her mother died. </p>

<p>And also that picture of Dan hugging Miranda Cosgrove, and seeing what looks like tears in her eyes, may have been because that photo was taken during the same day that they produced the last scene from the final episode of iCarley, iGoodbye. She could&#39;ve been crying because it was her last time filming at Nickelodeon. </p>

<p>The only thing that&#39;s making me question this a little, and not immediately jumping to conclusions by saying he&#39;s innocent is because the feet thing still does gross me the fuck out, and even if the guy does have a foot fetish, that doesn&#39;t make it right for him to incorporate it with his teen stars (and I&#39;ve met people who do have foot fetishes, and they typically do prefer younger people). And also how he hasn&#39;t said shit since his mysterious depart from Nickelodeon (and by the way, according to a former Nickelodeon employee, he was actually fired, but it was only because of the rumors. Not because they knew he actually did anything). Revenge Of The Cis also claims to know people from Hollywood who say that all the rumors are true about him, and they&#39;ve even had phone calls with some anonymous people who say that he was perverted. A news writer named Kira Davis also claims that her actress friend that worked on one of his shows, was apparently molested by him. The online film, &quot;An Open Secret&quot; was also apparently supposed to be about Schneider, but all the people they found didn&#39;t want to come forward. According to them, there&#39;s a BIG sex scandal at Nickelodeon. They also said that they know 3 girls who worked on his shows who aren&#39;t ready to come forward about their experience with him, but that they will eventually expose him at some point.</p>

<p>I know I just explained how anonymous posts aren&#39;t reliable, but people that are willing to speak up or show their face and talk about this is kind of a different story. </p>

<p>These people on Nickelodeon usually do get called out eventually too. Everyone already knew John K. was a piece of shit because people who worked with him described how awful it was, and two girls admitted he was a pedophile and ruined their childhoods/young adult life because of what he did to them. Chris Savino, the guy who&#39;s made Nickelodeon&#39;s biggest cartoon since SpongeBob, was immediately fired after several sexual allegations that we didn&#39;t even know about. Hell, pedophiles like Brian Peck who worked on Dan&#39;s shows have even been fired. Nobody has came out and said Dan Schneider&#39;s a creep.</p>

<p>Instead of just constantly spamming the guy and his wife&#39;s social media pages &quot;Dan Get In The Van Schneider&quot;, I think we need to actually start asking the people who worked on his shows about the whole thing. I noticed that NOBODY comments that shit on Miranda Cosgrove, Jamie Lynn Spears, Victoria Justice, Jenette McCurdy, or even some of the men&#39;s profiles.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not saying the dude is innocent, I think there is something sinister about his work, but I&#39;m just saying that there isn&#39;t enough legitimate evidence that he&#39;s done all this shit, and the only way we&#39;re gonna find out the truth is if we start digging deep into this, rather than relying on anonymous posts that anyone could have made (hell, one leaked post of him DM&#39;ing a chick even got debunked).</p>

<p>I highly doubt it, but if anyone reading this worked with Dan and has anything to say about this situation, I&#39;d highly suggest doing so (not anonymously but to the public). </p>

<p>If he didn&#39;t do anything to you...say something about it. You don&#39;t have to disagree that he&#39;s a predator, but just say that he didn&#39;t do anything to you.</p>

<p>If he DID do something to you, you need to stand up and tell everyone. He CANNOT leave silently if the rumors of him are true.</p>

<p>And also, I know that this is going to sound very risky, and you don&#39;t have to do it, but maybe DM me if you know anything about this and/or worked with him. I know some people who can probably help.</p>

<p>(please show actual evidence of your claims before you message me).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if amanda said her father actually molested her and it wasn’t just some drug related delusional psychosis comment, you don’t question that her father may have allowed others to do to her what he had put her through? mostly to land a part and so her father or mother can be mom-and-dad-agers of the year and handle all her finances. </p>

<p>self medicating and substance abuse is typically indicative of abuse of some sort, so i wouldn’t completely discount it for now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, like I said, I&#39;m not saying Dan is innocent. I do believe that something fishy was happening. But she never at all mentioned Dan, and I feel like she would have. The closest thing she&#39;s brought up to Nickelodeon was that her and Drake Bell smashed a lot. Also lmao.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.</p>

<p>But if she&#39;ll bring up information about her dad molesting her, and her and Drake fucking, why didn&#39;t she bring up Schneider? And like Drake Bell said, he highly doubts this tragedy of hers came from Nickelodeon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i would think she wouldn’t mention for legal reasons, for fear of legal recourse if it’s just he said she said. (defamation, slander, libel, etc) the legal system offers protection for some victims but also can allow protection of predators with good enough lawyers or the right connections and a little ca$h incentive to look the other way.</p>

<p>it’s probable, however unlikely it may be. 
SOMETHING happened to her, that much is clear. </p>

Not to mention Jamie Lynn spears got pregnant and rumors of him being the father....
I have no clue how you could defend someone like him after years and years of speculation....people just don&#39;t start rumors with the intention of destroying someone for no reason...</p>

<p>Disney seemed to think there was enough there to let go of one of their biggest money makers and honestly...</p>

<p>They held on to him until the spillover started to affect their bottom line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people get a little too wrapped up in the MKultra/Demon cult stuff sometimes when discussing with these Hollywood types. Rather than blame it on weak wills they&#39;d rather make up excuses, and victimize. A lot of times they just don&#39;t seem to get human behavior/anatomy either. You can bet they&#39;ll bring up that Britney Spears video where she starts crying, and say it&#39;s evidence of some sort of malfunction, but nothing about it is actually unnatural though. Only when viewed in that specific context is it even slightly suspect. People dig themselves in way too deep, so when they see anything out of the ordinary like a foot fetish combined with close proximity with younger folk the perv radars start going off. Not enough theorists are actually skeptical. I commend you on looking at this theory from multiple perspectives in such a detailed post.</p>

<p>Personally I find it hard to believe someone like that could get away with it given how many different people he&#39;s worked with, and the scale of the business he was involved in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks dude for actually READING my post. Everyone else just looked at the title, and immediately jumped to conclusions that I&#39;m defending him, and yes, I completely agree. At the same time though, I guess we can&#39;t blame everyone for freaking out about this due to events like the Harvey Weinstein incidents, its effects, and the #Metoo movement. Not to mention that To Catch A Predator randomly got popular again. I think it&#39;s great that we&#39;re looking more into this, but we can&#39;t just rely on everything we see online. There has to be evidence like what Revenge Of The Cis has been doing, and actual interviews with the stars. If he did do something though, we NEED to know about it so we can expose him and end all of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you talking about the one where britney suddenly starts crying and speaking like a baby with diane sawyer? bc that shit was weird, straight up. fucking weird. </p>

<p>also, bpd, which used to be diagnosed as both bipolar disorder and multiple personality disorder, is a condition where the individual sequesters memories into partitions of themselves. britney&#39;s behaviour is bpd manifest, in this video and in her overall life. </p>

<p>secondly mkultra and monarch are ideas that need to be addressed. i notice you didnt bring up laurel canyon. or the cia. or the mamas and the papas. or the weird cult rose mcgowan and joaquin phoenix were both raised in. this is bigger than creep shots, ffs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video with Britney isn&#39;t weird though. She doesn&#39;t do anything out of the ordinary. You just think it&#39;s weird because you&#39;re already convinced they&#39;re all slaves.

    <div class="md"><p>right... i watched that video years ago... like, when it originally aired. yeah, i&#39;m kinda old. if you think that behavior is normal for a twenty something year old woman, you are horribly mistaken. as for not being aware of the spectrum of human behavior... that was actually my focus in college, psychology.. more specifically deviant outward social behaviors, an their cousin disorders that are more internal... the vast emotional differences between npd and bpd... for example. you really have nothing of substance to rip my analysis apart. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How far removed are you from high school? I think your age is a sign of how you&#39;ve forgotten how young people, or people in general act, and can act. A twenty year old can be quirky, any age can without it being some disorder, or creepy act. You shouldn&#39;t read too much into psychology if you can&#39;t moderate your perception.</p>

<p>Also I find it very convenient you happen to have not only seen it when it aired, but also have studied psychology in college. Kind&#39;ve seems like you just spent the day reading about stuff to try, and prove something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can kinda see how Dan could be comparable to Michael Jackson. (A genuinely nice guy who got thrown under the bus as an easy target to cover up for higher-up abuse.)</p>

<p>There seems to be too many coincidences for him to be completely innocent. Besides the foot fetish theres other questionable pictures with the nerd from Zoey101 sitting on his lap. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe.</p>

<p>I mean, if Dan actually did what Angelique Bates said he did, I wouldn&#39;t call that off as nice, but I guess he may have just had a temper. Which may not have necessarily been his fault.</p>

<p>And yeah, I know what picture you&#39;re talking about. I don&#39;t know. The dude might&#39;ve been just very close with his stars. I mean there&#39;s a video where he actually kisses Jerry Trainer&#39;s cheek. He could just be very socially awkward.</p>

<p>Again, there&#39;s just something about him based on the foot fetish and his alleged temper, lack of information (especially about him and his wife), and quietness ever since he departed from Nick that just doesn&#39;t seem right. I remember reading his blogspot, and he always talked about how much he was against &quot;mean stuff&quot;, but also how nickelodeon modded his accounts which deleted comments and blocked certain users, and he even said that someday when he doesn&#39;t work at Nickelodeon anymore, he&#39;d get rid of these rules.</p>

<p>I guess since now, all over his comments, it&#39;s just nothing but jokes about him, and people calling him a pedophile, there may have been a chance that the mods said &quot;fuck it&quot;, and that&#39;s how Cyma Zarghami would&#39;ve supposedly heard about the rumors, and fired him. Just like what the Nickelodeon employee said about him.</p>
