       I might be dodging downvotes from all directions on this one.  But some people are just not ready to accept that left/right is the great show to divide us.

       So then you did the right thing by walking away from walkaway?  Maybe you should have joined the trolls that see right through the fake astroturing and were punishing that sub for lying?

      <p>
       That was non partisan?  What amounts to a trolling of the Democrats sub gets trolled and you pick a side (the walkaway trolls) so now you're hear claiming to have not taken sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make up your mind please.  Centrists don't pick sides in a troll fight.

       The fact that they banned you for that post just proves again that the sub is run by the_donald mods and everybody there is just a trump cheerleader pretending there is some movement going on. People arent leaving the democratic party because they are too left. If anyone is leaving, it's because the party hasnt been left enough. That's what the_donald fucked up when they manufactured this movement.

       Well Bernie Sanders invigorated people and Hillary was painted as a neocon establishment centrist. Yall have pretended we are a bunch of communists since Obama got in, so might as well fight for things the left wants like universal healthcare.

      <p>
       The fact is, you have ZERO background in economics. I don't care what your HSE propaganda promotes, the system you're advocating for (for Americans, for some reason) is completely unsustainable for a country of our size, and a government of our level of corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you bend over for the government, doesn't mean we should too. If people can't afford care, we should help them through charity and volunteer work... not at the end of a gun from big government.

       SO are you when you argue it wouldn't work. You are arguing in favor of a high cost to medical care which benefits guess who? big Pharma, Insurance companies and a host of other parties with lobbyists and a narrative that cheap affordable healthcare would not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       To move onto your arguements you state that the best doctors in the world people come for treatment etc etc. And your right thats true.

       Know what your missing though? All these amazing things are not available to the average american. All those things are available to the wealthy american, not your working class, not your underclasses or lower middle class.

       Don't listen to him.  It's absolutely possible if we choose to allocate our tax money differently than we are.  He throws keynes' name out there to try to impress you but it has little to nothing to do with whether or not the government can afford public healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forget for a second that we already pay $400-$500 per month per person for private healthcare in this country, that would go away with public option.  Maybe the government, with all its inefficiencies, can manage to budget that program to a breakeven by tapping into that enormous profit that the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries generate.  They would actually be able to increase inefficiencies in cost of goods and services provided by using bulk discount negotiating that smaller private general hospitals and healthcare providers cannot do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So forget all that, because after all, this boils down to an issue of how we are allocating the money we are all paying in taxes, our national budget.  It's got nothing to with fiscal policy, as mr. Keyne's namedopper up there is saying.  Leading economic theory in the most effective ways to influence the factors contributing to GDP is going to dictate how much tax revenue we generate within our existing tax structure. You and I are talking about national public healthcare, a use of those funds.  This does not take money out of our economy, and should tend to have the opposite effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       We spent $8 trillion on US wars and regime changes overseas since 9/11.  $8 trillion.  All the people are asking for is a slice of the military and national defense spending to make this happen.  Hell we probably don't even need it, considering the increase in tax revenue by taking our private insurance premiums and calling it healthcare tax.  But how scary would it be if we were only leading in military spending by 4 times the next closest nation?  Anyone feel like that would put our country at risk?

       Can you name me another area of commerce where a heavily government controlled and regulated system outperforms the free market? I'd be very curious to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       From my experience, the most costly, over-inflated, poorly run systems are all the ones with the most government intervention (banking, education, insurance, health care, auto manufacturing, hell even parcel delivery, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes you think the government would all of a sudden be able to get its shit together enough to properly and efficiently run a system as massive as universal healthcare??? We already know for a fact that the government is filled with shady siphons which drain taxpayer dollars from virtually all areas of government spending. Do you really think that this would not IMMEDIATELY occur when implementing something like this?
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to be

       What about the fact that these countries don't need to pay to secure their own borders, thanks to the US military and things like NATO? They barely spend 1% of their GDPs on military expenditures, because the US acts as the worlds police (not saying I'm a fan of that by any means). It's easy for them to have vastly expensive social programs when they don't need to worry about military. Just look at our budget... over 65% of it is already occupied by social programs like medicare and medicaid. People talk about how much we spend on defense spending, but that's because SOMEBODY has to, don't they?

       Do you not think it's suspicious that all the other first world countries have healthcare systems that are statistically superior to the American system yet the country with the highest GDP in the world has been convinced they can't afford it, despite the fact their current system costs them dramatically more than other countries?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that the supposed reasons it would be impossible to implement such a system in the US are all entirely self-imposed by the government, like being the world police?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or that even most
       <em>
        developing
       </em>
       nations have some form of universal healthcare these days?
      </p>
      <p>
       You pivoted from "it doesn't work" to "it wouldn't work here" as soon I brought up the fact universal healthcare is statistically more effective for less money, does this mean you tacitly acknowledged that universal healthcare provides better outcomes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how arguments against universal healthcare rely on rhetoric whereas arguments for universal healthcare rely on actual healthcare data. Notice how the rhetoric revolves around the idea universal healthcare is expensive when the American system costs dramatically more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's especially suspicious when the "reasons" America can't have universal healthcare are also sort of backhanded compliments to America, like saying they can't afford it because all the other countries rely on them or because they're too "free" for such a system.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality America could implement such a system, and if it couldn't that is a sign the country is deeply broken in a way none of its peers are.

       There's nothing "suspicious" about simple economics. It's not a coincidence that most of the greatest advancements in medical science in the last century have come out of our system. Had we all just been like "other first world countries", who would be innovating??? Where's the incentive to create new drugs and tech when the government is just going to tell
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       how much they will pay for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason we left Europe. There's a reason we've becoming the greatest economy the world has ever seen. There's a reason why medical advancement's happen here more than anywhere else. That reason, is free market capitalism, and the competition created by it.

       Longer life expectancy, less people dying of preventable causes, less money spent, that sort of thing.

       So for example I'd say the US has statistically superior cancer treatments (for most forms of cancer, I think there are one or two exceptions)

       I don't think it's a coincidence that the country with the highest GDP can afford to subsidise more research or that big pharma would focus their research in a nation where they can set their own astronomical prices for drugs.

       The USA, only more Americans would benefit from these innovations instead of subsidising them through taxation and then having to pay an uncapped price for the drugs anyway.

      <p>
       There's a reason Americans live short, sick lives compared to their European counterparts. There's a reason Americans are dying of preventable causes. There's a reason the ruling class don't want you to support universal healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason so many Americans resort to Americans Exceptionalism delusions when faced with uncomfortable truths about their country. Stops them from objectively comparing America to its peers and realising they've been fed a crock of shit about policies like universal healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trained by the ruling class to block their ears and chant "we're the best" over and over, eyes closed to the facts.

       What is this #walkaway thing? I haven't seen any of the political independent personalities I follow talking about it, so where is it coming from?

        I see that Niko House made a video saying it was an establishment scam

       , but I haven't gotten a chance to check it out yet. Is it a campaign by Trump shills to scoop up left-leaning independents who might vote Democrat or Green or something?

       Eh, if progressives don't vote for progressive candidates *within* the democratic party, then the republicans will always win. So for many progressives it makes good sense to continue to vote for democrats, all the while pushing them to adopt more progressive policies.

       I personally don't think that the parties are made to divide us. I think the basic idea of these parties and how one has to dig their heels in to their ideas only leads us to yell at each other and appear more divided. In conclusion, left/right is not good for an open dialogue, which we desperately need right now.

       I'm apprehensive towards most movements so I'm not sure what to think of Walkaway as a whole, but I liked your post and found a lot of it resonated with me. It only stands to reason that someone(s) would want to stifle discussion on that page, as it doesn't reflect positively on the party as a whole if it's seen fracturing. Sorry your words weren't well received.

       The comment before you got banned was fantastic.  You summed up a lot of what's happening in a thoughtful and civil way.  People should be welcoming posters like that, not banning them.  I'm on T_D a lot.  There are democrats leaving the party for various reasons, some probably because they have such lowered expectations from the constant barrage of negativity that when the actually examine what trump is doing they are overly impressed. I think the T_D folks just came up with a hashtag for those tweets or posts that have surfaced of former dems with something nice to say about trump.

       Sorry your post wasn't received in the same spirit in which it was written.  They look like the words of an honest and earnest person.

       They banned you for calling out their bullshit, it's painfully obvious it's full of LARPing right wingers. Just check the post history and other moderated subs of the mods.

       Possibly the biggest give away is the way they conflate walking away from the Democrats with becoming a conservative, despite the fact most disillusioned Democrats abandon the party because they don't feel it's progressive enough.
