<p>Because of my odd interests I happen to have several answers for you, but I&#39;ll start with one of the more surreal ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Project Artichoke was a Central Intelligence mind control experimentation program from 1950-73 iirc. The goal was to find a method to control someone against their will. It&#39;s on their website if you want to read through it.</p>

<p>At least in the excerpts I read, they were focusing on hypnosis as a method. They knew that it&#39;s not possible to hypnotize someone to just get up and kill someone because people will not do something under hypnosis that they would absolutely never do in their normal state, so they had to get creative with it. What they found was that they could tell a woman under hypnosis that a man was going to kill her family, and the only way she could stop him was to shoot him with the gun they gave her. She got up, aimed the revolver at him and pulled the trigger, yielding a click because it was an empty revolver of course. (might have been blanks or dud rounds, don&#39;t remember this detail exactly)</p>

<p>They also found that one of the most effective tricks they could pull was &quot;programming&quot; a message to relay with a keyword in someone without them realizing it. So the person could become a messenger without their knowledge, be sent to a location, the receiver would say the keyword and that person would divulge the information without even consciously knowing they had that information.</p>

<p>One quote that stuck out to me was from one of the contracted researchers in the midst of these experiments. He said, &quot;Never have I been more aware of the claustrophobia of book and lecture hall knowledge&quot;.</p>

<p>Another detail that I find even more intriguing  and opening up more doors of creepy possibility is that people are much easier to hypnotize in large groups than they are on a one to one basis.</p>

<p>Honorable mention for MKOFTEN, Mockingbird and the child sex blackmail portion of MkUltra.</p>

<p>Edit: Amazing what you can find on wikipedia. I am not angry about these things, I have accepted that they are just how things work. The world is a stage, and sometimes we get a peek behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Nayirah Testimony </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nayirah al-Ṣabaḥ during her testimony. It was later revealed that she was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States and that her testimony could not be verified.
The Nayirah testimony was a false testimony given before the Congressional Human Rights Caucus on October 10, 1990, by a 15-year-old girl who provided only her first name, Nayirah. The testimony was widely publicized, and was cited numerous times by United States senators and President George H. W. Bush in their rationale to back Kuwait in the Gulf War. In 1992, it was revealed that Nayirah&#39;s last name was al-Ṣabaḥ (Arabic: نيره الصباح‎) and that she was the daughter of Saud Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, it was revealed that her testimony was organized as part of the Citizens for a Free Kuwait public relations campaign which was run by an American public relations firm Hill &amp; Knowlton for the Kuwaiti government. Following this, al-Sabah&#39;s testimony has come to be regarded as a classic example of modern atrocity propaganda.[1][2]</p>

<p>In her emotional testimony, Nayirah stated that after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait she had witnessed Iraqi soldiers take babies out of incubators in a Kuwaiti hospital, take the incubators, and leave the babies to die.</p>

<p>Her story was initially corroborated by Amnesty International[3] and testimony from evacuees. Following the liberation of Kuwait, reporters were given access to the country. An ABC report found that &quot;patients, including premature babies, did die, when many of Kuwait&#39;s nurses and doctors... fled&quot; but Iraqi troops &quot;almost certainly had not stolen hospital incubators and left hundreds of Kuwaiti babies to die.&quot;[4][5] Amnesty International reacted by issuing a correction, with executive director John Healey subsequently accusing the Bush administration of &quot;opportunistic manipulation of the international human rights movement&quot;.[6]</p>

<p>Pentagon Military Analyst Program</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A page from one of the weekly public affairs briefings distributed from defendamerica.mil in May 2003
The Pentagon military analyst program was a propaganda campaign of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) that was launched in early 2002 by then-Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria Clarke.[1] The goal of the operation is &quot;to spread the administrations&#39;s talking points on Iraq by briefing retired commanders for network and cable television appearances,&quot; where they have been presented as independent analysts;[2] A Pentagon spokesman said the Pentagon&#39;s intent is to keep the American people informed about the so-called War on Terrorism by providing prominent military analysts with factual information and frequent, direct access to key military officials.[3][4] The Times article suggests that the analysts had undisclosed financial conflicts of interest and were given special access as a reward for promoting the administration&#39;s point of view. On 28 April 2008, the Pentagon ended the operation.[5] </p>

Other namesCurveball
Alma materBaghdad University
Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi (Arabic: رافد أحمد علوان الجنابي‎, Rāfid Aḥmad Alwān; born 1968), known by the Defense Intelligence Agency cryptonym &quot;Curveball&quot;,[1] is a German citizen who defected from Iraq in 1999, claiming that he had worked as a chemical engineer at a plant that manufactured mobile biological weapon laboratories as part of an Iraqi weapons of mass destruction program.[2] Alwan&#39;s allegations were subsequently shown to be false by the Iraq Survey Group&#39;s final report published in 2004.[3][4]</p>

<p>Despite warnings from the German Federal Intelligence Service and the British Secret Intelligence Service questioning the authenticity of the claims, the US Government and British government utilized them to build a rationale for military action in the lead up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including in the 2003 State of the Union address, where President Bush said &quot;we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs&quot;, and Colin Powell&#39;s presentation to the UN Security Council, which contained a computer generated image of a mobile biological weapons laboratory.[2][5] They were later found to be mobile milk pasteurization and hydrogen generation trailers. On 24 September 2002, the British government published its dossier on the former Iraqi leader&#39;s WMD with a personal foreword by Blair, who assured readers Saddam Hussein had continued to produce WMD &quot;beyond doubt&quot;.[6]</p>

<p>On November 4, 2007, 60 Minutes revealed Curveball&#39;s real identity.[7] Former CIA official Tyler Drumheller summed up Curveball as &quot;a guy trying to get his green card essentially, in Germany, and playing the system for what it was worth.&quot;[2] He lives in Germany, where he has been granted asylum.[8]</p>

<p>In a February 2011 interview with the Guardian he &quot;admitted for the first time that he lied about his story, then watched in shock as it was used to justify the war.&quot;[8]</p>

<p><em>The 28 Pages</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 28 Pages refers to a section at the end of the December 2002 report of the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities before and after the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, conducted by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that contains details of foreign state sponsor support for Al-Qaeda prior to the attack and the Saudi connection[1][2][3][4][5] to the hijackers. The pages explain that some of the September 11 hijackers received assistance and financial support from individuals connected to the Saudi Arabian government,[1][2][3][4][5] including Saudi intelligence officers,[2] embassy staff,[2] and members of the Saudi royal family.[1][2][3][5]</p>

<p>REX 84</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Contingency plans by the US Government for rounding up people perceived by the government to be subversive or a threat to civil order have existed for many decades.[7] For example, from 1967 to 1971, the FBI kept a list of over 100,000 people to be rounded up as subversive, dubbed the &quot;ADEX&quot; list.[8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_84">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_84</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland amendment, the NSC established &quot;the Enterprise&quot;, an arms-smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer Richard Secord that supplied arms to the Contras. It was ostensibly a private sector operation, but in fact was controlled by the NSC.[19] To fund &quot;the Enterprise&quot;, the Reagan administration was constantly on the look-out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government in order not to explicitly violate the letter of the Boland amendment, though the efforts to find alternative funding for the Contras violated the spirit of the Boland amendment.[21] Ironically, military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986, a month before the scandal broke.[22][23]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always recommend people read through the Greenbaum Speech. I&#39;m not going to link it, not with this account (sorry). There are several different versions on the net. The one with &#39;trigger&#39; words &amp; phrases left in often gets taken down, but that&#39;s the deepest &amp; best version. </p>

<p>Basically a well-respected psychologist at a yearly symposium breaks ranks with the rest of his profession, and decides to talk about trauma-based mind control. Not only talk about it but more importantly, how to properly deal with the recent wave of mkultra casualties (&amp; it&#39;s derivatives) which were starting to flood the profession in the late 80s-early 90s. None of these psychologists wanted to talk about it openly, so there was a disconnect in the business with how to really deal with the problem. This speech was an attempt to rectify that. It also gives a fairly detailed history of how it all started, at least from the histories given to him from multiple patients.</p>

<p>Supposedly, someone named Dr Greenbaum was the original pioneer of the craft within the CIA, which was used first with the Nazis. It had came from Greenbaum&#39;s own background, being from an old &#39;Black Nobility&#39; family.  Trauma-based programming wasn&#39;t exactly new to anyone, but some of these old Kazarian families used an ancient form, which was very tied in to &#39;Black-Kabbalist&#39; kind of stuff.  Apparently, he was a young Jewish boy when he was taken in by Nazis after they slaughtered his family. He was from a very old bloodline that practiced this sort of thing for centuries (going back to ancient Kazarian Black-Magic/Baal worship). He was a gifted kid who knew all the family secrets. They brought him into the fold, which eventually brought the &#39;family craft&#39; to Nazi Intelligence. Then once Project Paperclip happened, he became an American &amp; the rest is history. </p>

<p>So the &#39;Greeenbaum Speech&#39; was this particular psychologist breaking it all down for his colleagues, explaining how to deal with all the different &#39;alters&#39; that get installed into the personalities of the people that undergo the trauma-based mind control techniques (which was brutal stuff). Some of these people had <em>many</em> alters, some of which he was told have designations like &#39;Psychic Killer&#39;, &#39;Sex Assassin&#39;, etc.  He spoke about it in such a way that he didn&#39;t necessarily believe the occult elements himself. He was not a conspiracy theorist, he was a mainstream professional doctor, had no background into how deep the rabbit-hole goes.. He naively assumed that was all just used to help break their minds, instill fear, add exotic details to their trauma, make them sound crazy if they ever went to police (that part was definitely a built-in benefit), etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really a fascinating &amp; scary read. Required for folks here IMO. A truly historic document, but one that was never meant to get the attention it eventually got by people like us. Last I heard, that doctor retired &amp; went into hiding a few years later, never speaking on the topic again. </p>

<p>So just do a little digging &amp; perhaps be a little cautious. I do know that educate-yourself.org (?) used to have a copy up, not sure now though. Good luck ;)</p>
