        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I joined this sub because I’ve witnessed the biggest co-ordinated cover up possible. This goes across search engines, news media, papers, no doubt governments and likely many other channels. </p>

<p>Some of us in here have experienced the mandella effect. For anyone that isn’t aware what it is, this is where history, song lyrics, positions of countries, logos, films, animals and buildings inexplicably simply change. </p>

<p>I’m not going to try and convince anyone of it as im also aware that thinking history has changed is not our first goto when we witness this. But here are a popular few. </p>

<p>For those who’ve research JFK assassination, as I did, you may be as dumbstruck, as I was, that there are now six people in the car. </p>

<p>The position of South America has changed. 
Tom cruise in risky business doesn’t have sunglasses and a white shirt 
Sally field(s) never said you like me, you really like me 
Kit Kat never had a dash in it
Ribbon seals now exist 
Rainbow trees now exist 
Berenstein (Bernstein) bears are berenstain bears. 
We are the champions by queen doesn’t have “of the world at the end of it” 
The A team van has a grey top now 
Mirror mirror on the wall is now magic mirror </p>

<p>Anyway there are hundreds if not thousands more. </p>

<p>What I’ve witnessed is the ME being contained to a few corners of the internet and ridiculed and belittled/ dismissed everywhere else. From silly teens on you tube talking about silly MEs to respected papers like the telegraph saying “look at the quote you’ve been getting wrong” </p>

<p>The cover up is huge, international and goes across every news and media outlet. Even here the ME forum is policed by paid shills, the only place that can be talked about relatively freely on reddit is r/retconned a quiet corner. Wikipedia page is nonsense and searches bring up stuff about false memories and silly sites saying how you’ve been getting it wrong.<br/>
There’s even a film about how the guy has a bad memory, And an episode of the x files. About bad memory. It’s quite astonishing the lengths.  </p>

<p>The point isn’t to convince anyone the mandella effect is real, the point is the concerted and amazing cover up I’ve seen. It’s got just the right tone to make it look ridiculous and convince many to dismiss it. And I guarantee, it’s well known about at the top. </p>

<p>So if the effort to cover this up is so successful, then it gets me thinking much of what is “leaked” “found” on the internet is meant to be just that. Even here when the syria gas attack is talked about. I see very little in the way of debunking, propaganda, the governments given viewpoint etc.  And yet I post that I don’t remember North Korea having a Russian border in the ME forum, and I get jumped on by shills. </p>

<p>The Syrian fake gas attack was all over the internet, it’s meant to look fake and obviously so. (Half the outrage is likely propaganda) There’s meant to be no evidence it was Assad. Even the man on the street knows it’s nonsense. Most of us could have faked a better attack and blamed Assad, surely a more convincing target for one.? It just has the feel of a charade, a play with most parties knowing their role, keeping us on edge, for what reason ? The Russians are even worse, their state TV warned their people of what to do in a nuclear attack. Fear mongering has reached epidemic levels. </p>

<p>I’ve seen how capable the media is of covering up things. </p>

<p>This isn’t a post about the Syrian attack or the ME per se. It’s about how good the propaganda is now. It’s really good, make no mistake. Not impossible to see through, but still very good. Is it about governments and trump ? No it’s defiantly not, this really goes down the rabbit hole. Deep state ? I don’t know. But it’s a maze out there and a lot of what you see, you are meant to see. </p>

<p>We are entering a mini ice age, that is a fact, it could really be damaging, yet where is it being talked about ? Global warming is now climate change. (So we both cool and heat the planet now ?) the global cooling is more likely to bring on war and unrest, than who flew what into what towers and why. How bad will it get ? Snow in Saudi Arabia this year is a good start. </p>

<p>I have no wish to shout about the ME it’s strange enough as it is. But the cover up is what has really opened my eyes to the power of information these days. </p>

<p>Peel back truths protective layers. To quote Neil Armstrong.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to conspiracies such as the Mandela Effect, I have an open and fair mind so I&#39;m able to analyze everybody&#39;s point of view and understand why they think the way they do about it. </p>

<p>I personally had experienced the &quot;effect&quot; at the same time as everyone else, and while I found it odd that we all were misremembering the same things I figured that scenario wasn&#39;t impossible. </p>

<p>However, what made me a firm believer in the effect or something similar to the effect, was when things started changing back and forth for me. I distinctly remember everybody on the Mandela Effect train going crazy over the famous quote &quot;Houston, we have a problem&quot; now being &quot;Houston, we&#39;ve had a problem.&quot; I clearly remember sitting there and reading about this, and watching the links provided to hear this new change for myself. But about a week or so later, all the posts I read were gone and it was back to the original &quot;Houston, we have a problem.&quot; People in the ME community call this a &#39;flip-flip&#39;, and I was not the only one to experience the Houston flip-flop. Something strange is happening with this effect, and whether you believe me or not I know for a fact what I had witnessed. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That specific X-Files episode is propagandist <em>perfection</em>. In one singular episode, they checked off EVERY box in order to make the ME as laughable and ridiculous as possible. </p>

<p>This specific episode is the biggest outlier in the whole season. It conveys a most absurdist and comedic tone, the main guest is a comedian known for playing mentally unstable characters, and the whole goddamn affair finishes off with the ME experiencer being carted off in a straight-jacket in a silly Ghoatbusters-style vintage hearse. I mean, what the fucking fuck?</p>

<p>The worst part is that after we watched it, my normie fiancé looked over at me with a bit of pity. The propaganda was obvious to me... but I guess it works great on those who don&#39;t realize how flimsy the papery holographic veils are around us and how corralled we are (like livestock) on the surface realm of Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the same boat as you—I too never used to think like that. I thought propaganda and social engineering was endemic in places like China or in pre-WWII Germany, not in &quot;bastions of liberty&quot; like the United States and other &quot;developed&quot; Western societies. </p>

<p>However there&#39;s something in us awakening souls that allows us to discern between authenticity and bullshittery. And we can clearly see attempts at cover-up and obfuscation as veils of ignorance and control begin to crumble and fall. </p>

<p>I guess I do remember the Skinner Easter egg but after the laughingstock episode was coming to a close, Mulder and Scully chalked everything up to mis-remembering and that was, well, expected yet semi-lamentable. </p>

<p>It’s more about the propaganda associated with it. I end up on the defensive as often we have to be when talking about the ME. Not many will openly post outside of the ME forums even there many won’t because of fear of ridicule. But if we all cower in fear and don’t say anything then where does the world go ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>French Revolution. All Chinese dysnaties. Mongolian invasions. Downfall of Roman Empire. Yes and possibly even more so these days with 7.5 billion mouths to feed.  Check the jet stream it’s already wobbling all over the place. Arable land decreases in places like the Canadian and American plains. Russian steps etc. Other areas see droughts and monsoons are disrupted. Volcanoes and earthquakes are more prominent</p>

<p>A little research doesn’t hurt.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe in that ?  It’s fact there is no belief needed. The French Revolution happened because Katla volcano erupted causing crops to fail in Europe. Volcanoes erupt more when there is a solar minimum </p>

<p>Basically sunspots “power” our magnetosphere. When there are low sunspots our magnetosphere weakens allowing more cosmic rays to penetrate the to the earth. Cosmic rays act like a kind of microwave heating the mantle (to a very small degree) but the pressure sets off more volcanos and earthquakes.  The jet stream wobbles around and drops down (this is more to do with stratosphere and troposphere which is more complicated). And therefore colder artic temperatures are felt for longer periods. If sea ice becomes prevalent and doesn’t melt in summer then the suns heat is reflected of cats ice sheets and we spiral into a cold period pretty quickly. </p>

<p>Feel free to see if any of that is wrong. But yes you’ll find dynasties and revolutions often happen during solar minimums because crops fail and people revolt. Or invade other countries for resources.  </p>

<p>But your a fool for not at least showing where any of this is wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we have 7.5 billion people to feed on this planet. If crops fail en masse. Then the ensuing riots will be a direct result. And it seems to me China buying up swathes of Africa may well be a direct result. </p>
