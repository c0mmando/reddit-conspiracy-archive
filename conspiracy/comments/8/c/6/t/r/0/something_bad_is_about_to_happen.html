       I can sense it.  This isnt based on the airstrikes, though retaliation is something we shouldn't be too surprised of, however what will be labeled as retaliation is actually just the powers that be disguising themselves.  They are the ones who are about to murder a lot of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people that survive will be obedient drones.  Their fear will lead them to believing anything authorities tell them.   Everyone will want to protect themselves and their family, who can blame them?
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been other people who have tried to tell you on this subreddit that you are an immortal light being.  Even here you are all laughing it away because you dont have emperical evidence at your fingertips.  These threads are always downvoted or they get very little upvotes and fade into obscurity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ARE being kept from the truth, and if you let this thread thrive I will answer every question you have for me.  I'm requesting one thing, please, just entertain the idea that what I suggest is possible, because if you die before you awaken your third eye you will again only serve to be a puppet that TPTB can feed off of.  It would do you a world of good right now, being the conspiracists you are, to sincerely entertain the possibility that I am telling you something that is accurate.  Of course only you choose what to believe and what is real. ♡
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB certainly know what I am saying is true.  They are using children and younger people to stay in power.  A child light being is a lot more open and thus a million times more powerful than we subdued and controlled adults are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think that high-standing religious people and rich celebrities are ALL raping and murdering children?  Oh it's just a coincidence that power and money and greed leads you to be a pedophile?  COME ON.  This has been happening for thousands of years.  And it is written about literally everywhere.  If you spend two hours of this current life researching this you will go down a rabbit hole you wish you had never dared to open.  Sometimes I think people just want to hide from the truth because its ugly and terrifying, but the longer we hide the longer they stay in power.
      </p>

        You are a light being.  What does that mean? It means that your source of being/consciousness uses energy, ie electricity, to manifest reality.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Yes.  It's a little bit out there.  But its not "magic", and it CAN be explained objectively and with science, we just can't yet with our current level of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum physics will show you that atoms and particles behave differently based on whether they are being observed or watched.  This is the tip of the iceberg, and it's a clue to the real universe that we exist in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Energy makes up all of Existence, if you were to look closely at a bar of pure titanium the closer you get the more you realize its 98% made of non-physical electrons and particles.  It's just energy.  You are the same.  You are less "physical" than you realize yourself to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a light being you can manifest reality,  Ever heard of the law of attraction? Study any person in our past that has made a huge difference in our society or someone who achieved what they wanted in life.  They ALL will tell you that they got what they wanted and achieved what they wanted by believing that nothing in the universe could stop them.  100% of them will tell you it was positive thinking.  That also is NOT a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not only true for success. Look at AMAZING results of placebo medicine.  Actually research it.  They oftentimes cure ailments BETTER than approved medicine.  They work EVEN better when the patient pays more money for them.  THIS IS PROVEN.  Somehow we believe deep down that if we pay more for something that there's a higher probability it will work.  And THUS THE UNIVERSE reflects that belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take time out of your life to meditate.  There are apps that can teach you.  Meditation can legitimately HEAL you.  It can also do a lot more.  There are reasons why cultures in our past devoted their entire existence to meditation.  It's not "hocus pocus"
The powers that be have trained us to laugh and mock anything that sounds magical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its another way they have made us weaker and thus if we all begin to believe that it's all hocus pocus that doesnt work then THAT will become our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You all have been complaining forever that this subreddit has been taken over and is being controlled and that it's hard to find good conspiracies these days, and you are all also responsible for that being true. You create reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just the very tip of the iceberg. The universe is legitimately infinite.  It doesnt end   It never began either.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot more to say.  I hope you all take the time to at least consider what I am saying.

       Russia is playing tit-for-a-tat strategy. They said they warned and had plans. This was in a official tweet. Something is comfirmed to be on the way. Russia wants some retaliation. Not neccessarily military, but definitivly something. Might even be something cyber or trade related.

       Israel went in and bombed sites, then Russia said it was the UK and false, USA said they'd look into it. They did, bombed weapons making facilities and went home w no Russian retaliation. This is all chess. There will be no war.

       He’s basically saying if we don’t collectively change the way we think since we are beings of light, then something bad is going to happen because we are all feeling hopeless or negative or whatever and we’re just accepting Illuminati gonna do what they do so in turn we’re helping the Illuminati manifest their own reality.. why do you think they have us worship their image in songs and movies?

       Jesus was an awakened consciousness.   He made a great impact on humanity.  Most of what's written about him is exaggerated stories.  His influence was borrowed and corrupted after he left that incarnation.

       Critical mass adoption is 3,141% of the population to adopt an new idea or concept.
 It's that number that "creates" the posibillty for a concept to be realized in this "reality"
(PI)
Als having doubt (regarding the law of atrraction) only creates more possible timelines for you to take. Narrowing that doubt factor down creates a bigger propability for you to succeed.

       Yes, and you're going to need a citation for that for when you're doing interviews on all the major news networks. You're going to be famous! Finally someone has shown that astrology isn't completely worthless! Can I see your proof, please?

       Let me get this straight: your idea of proof is windows of correlation that are
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       wide? WW1 started in July, not October. You can't use several years of Hitler's ride to power as a direct connection. WW2 didn't start close to any interactions. You can't vaguely connect it to a years long recession or an "escalation in the Cold War" without connecting it to a specific event or date.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these correlations are so vague as to be useless. On top of this, there's no actual proof in the entire article that there was any interactions between the two planets whatsoever. It's entirely paragraph after paragraph of invented correlation with nothing actually connecting the events or proving they happened in the first place.

       Show some proof that they are "aspecting," how that affects anything, and how you can use correlations that are multiple years wide as proof. Show that every single time they have "aspected" something major and negative has happened, and how those were affected by the planets.

       Look up a planet calculator to see where the planets were on certain dates. The tighter the aspect the more intense the energy is. I don’t think it’s a coincidence every time a catastrophe happens Saturn and Pluto are aspecting each other in the tightest degree.

       Don't be ridiculous. You have to define it if you are going to claim this correlation. What is a catastrophe? WW1 and WW2, sure. But the"escalation of the Cold War?" The US economic recession? Not various genocides, invasions, deadly natural disasters? You can't say "Here's a handful of kind of bad things that happened within a few years of this vague astrological event." That's not even a real correlation, it's just selection bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you properly define "catastrophe," then show a stronger and more precise correlation, then it would be more believable.

       Critical mass adoption is 3,141% of the population to adopt an new idea or concept. It's that number that "creates" the posibillty for a concept to be realized in this "reality" (PI) Als having doubt (regarding the law of atrraction) only creates more possible timelines for you to take. Narrowing that doubt factor down creates a bigger propability for you to succeed.

       There is even more to this. But i am carefull dropping this because the consequences are far greater then i can imagine.

       i'm particularly worried about the surveillance apparatus being used to solidify TPTB's control over the entire globe. Weaving webs of blackmail. Blackmail, combined with people's desire that they do not become super unpopular and hated over social media, could prevent almost anyone from speaking out. When they see everything we do, and we see almost none of what they do, they hold all the power and they can build the hell-on-earth that they fantasize about. I guess the first step is, on a personal level, speaking truth to power and putting your values before your selfish worries about how others think about you. Please let me know if you have insight on this issue because it really stresses me out.

       I pretty much agree with everything you said. How easy would it be to just pay a country to attack us? How FUCKING easy would that be?????? Pay the guy at the top, he’ll pull the strings, and nobody else needs to know. Eventually, maybe assasinate that guy you paid, and bam there’s NO shot at the truth coming out.

       Your perception is your reality. Are we light or vibration(or are they one and the same)? Prayer changes things. Our spirituality defines us it shapes your light(vibration). Give up your fear and reclaim your sovereignty, take responsibility for your actions in this lifetime. Manifest the life you want to live, believe, visualize it then build it. The true beginning of knowledge is calling things by their correct name. Know thyself then know the world. Right now praying is a all we can do, right now praying is all we needed.

       Careful of this thread, regarding to opening of third eye and all that new age shit. It opens doors to demons and evil spirits that will fk your soul up. I've been there and saved by Jesus Christ. Submit to God, resist the devil and it will flee from you.

       Don't fear anything. Open all of your higher faculties and understand you are sentience incarnate. From there help to birth a new wrold with compassion and peace. We were given these higher faculties for a reason, not to shut down in fear, but to open up in grace and service to the Greater Self that we are all a part of; Christ Consciousness

       i'm going back to that one consciousness trap. My body, mind and soul were literally tormented by evil spirits. Scratch marks all over my arms and body when I woke up from sleep, everything felt wrong like I was possessed. I could start sensing supernatural entities and hear them talking to me. They are all demons disguising as light trying to trick you. New age is a trap of satan.

       Do you think Jesus came down because He wanted a bunch of followers or because He wanted Us to reach the same level of awareness and compassion that He reached?

       Instead of worrying about the herd mentality of those who laugh at the wisdom that you are a being of Light, just laugh back. They are trading their sovereignty of consciousness for a preprogrammed "comfortable" sheep timeline that keeps them on the wheel of incarnation. They are afraid of their own immortality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sucks for them :) I don't worry about it anymore nor try to change their awareness (unless it's close loved ones, which will extend to the rest of humanity in due time) they've dug their own graves and are intimidated by others who transcend their game of insecurity and dependency on the external world.

       On the same tolken, you are using your consciousness to focus on giving power to TPTB in a fear-based way. Ignore the airstrikes and all fear based programs. Even opposing it is giving power to it.

       Just focus on the humans that DO understand and keep embodying compassion.

       Finally somebody else is saying it!
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB use the children to stay in power. Fully distracted and the complete conditioning taking place through carefully structured areas in education and media.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that’s not even delving into the occult side of everything!
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no idea the truth being kept from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wouldn’t believe some of the people  who have hidden behind a computer screen trying to tell you these secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       But fear and a massive loss in spirituality reign dominant in the hearts and minds of humanity. Excluding those who find life within the artificial system in place of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who have dabbled in psychedelics have seen through the vail and understand how it FEELS to be immortal. That true self observing behind many layers and reflections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, strong conditioning has taken place from a very early age. Your concept of drugs is most definitely inaccurate. Drugs are gateways as well as powerful tools to gain insight and deep revelations. Try it. No need arguing on this. If one wishes to dispute drugs, they must first have experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites don’t have the slightest bit of empathy for you. They distort all of information about reality, life, science, space, psychology and use the energy/power of children in sexual practice and rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t get it muddled though, the education and a lot of information regarding the subjects mentioned above that people receive, do contain truth. But distorted and missing the esoteric side of matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re true self IS immortal and life could be utopia if you are willing to make a sacrifice and stand up. Otherwise you and all those you love will just continue rebirthing into this artificial construction. Darkness and fear, used, and a life truly of suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody revolts because they are truly ruled by the thought of non-existing and their hearts weigh heavy on this. People think this is the best it can get and stay distracted with such empty matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not and you know the beauty of it? You can see and feel this for yourself if you’re willing to expand consciousness through chemicals and/or meditation!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t even need to mention the East being an epic centre of wisdom and esoteric knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay attention and take a chance people. Everything you hold to be true is most probably distorted to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Math really is the language we possess in order to understand how the universe operates. Learn the golden ratio. Look to nature and open your eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I’ve written is barely scratching the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult is real. 
If you stop living in fear, giving power to others, instead of going out there and seeing for yourself, then you are doomed to a life of mental suffering. Spiritual suffering even.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were gifted long ago with intellect, it’s up to us to use it.

       I agree with your prescription of meditation, but I disagree with assessment that something bad is about to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to know the truth behind Jesus' knowledge and teachings. Meditate on how this rectifies with the feeling you have that something bad is about to happen.  We are creators.

       I can relate to many of what you said. But to be completely honest im kind of lost and don`t really know what to believe. The only thing that im really sure of is that my true passion in this life is trying to look behind the curtain. But there is so much different information out there that i get confused over time and fall back again. When i try to meditate my thoughts run wild and i give up relatively fast. Can you give a lost soul like me some concrete material to read that could help me develop?

       Regarding your meditation and thoughts running wild, allow them, it’s ok. Just focus on observing. If you make judgments, find yourself caught in a thought, it’s ok, just step back and observe again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making meditation  a daily practice is what I would say is most important first. Even if it’s only 10 minutes in the morning.

       Just an all around great post here and most definitely a few words I needed to read to get me motivated again. Here recently I’ve been doing a ton of research into the quantum world. Everything you said is true and couldn’t have come at a better time in my life for me to read. Currently working on myself and my thoughts to have a much better life. Congrats on your battle with Cancer and I also hope the best for you and the battles your dealing with at the moment. Remember, “this too shall pass.” Thanks OP!

       Psycho drugs are a tool that you can use to connect with the spiritual universe.  Though I dont recommend it unless you know how to use the drug responsibly.  There are safe ways to get high or trip. I personally dont am not using any drugs.  I meditate and raise my frequency.  ♡

       This thread's success confuses and scares me. I've been here for years and the number of crazy text only posts has gone off the charts but this one is just so vague that I wonder... are conspiracy users this desperate for content that they'll upvote a wall of text that says nothing? Based on the responses and the post history, I'm guessing OP believes she is helping and contributing with this vague word vomit (coming from a person who does a lot of meditating but doesn't believe in andromedeans).
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at OP's post history. In many posts, she's critically examining video games. In many of them she's MTF trans, in one she's FTM trans and pregnant. In many posts she's talking about how much she loves mind expanding drugs (in this thread, too).
      </p>
      <p>
       But the weirdest part of all is the comment section. I've never seen a fantasy text post with this level of universal praise on conspiracy. Even when there was this level of support in the past, there's also a vocal bunch of people shitting on it but here... this is dumb even by conspiracy standards.

       I want to escape this place. I lost a lot of my beliefs throughout my life. The one that stays constant is that this is a place to get out of and never return. I'm not religious and not into new age woo woo either. I think reincarnation sounds like a never ending prison sentence and I've bitched about that and karma in a lot of my other posts. There will never be a day where I think any of that sounds wonderful and worthwhile. Especially since I think the shit in this world is poisoning and making us all sick in various ways. I know it because I can feel it inside of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a feeling if I don't get the hell out of here this time than I'll never make it out of here. I think the window's pretty much about to be closed and locked for good. I trust myself. I'm not turning my trust over to 3rd parties anymore. Don't care what they label themselves. I have no reason to follow their orders or give them my trust. It's over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that's tripped me up is synchronicity. I don't think this is something positive. One sync in particular angers me more than anything. I know something's happening in regard to that because I'm not actively looking for this stuff. And I don't think it's mind patterns either. It just pops up like a jack in the box toy and that might be an awkward way of wording it. What do you think about synchronicity, OP?

       Yes, and you're going to need a citation for that for when you're doing interviews on all the major news networks. You're going to be famous! Finally someone has shown that astrology isn't completely worthless! Can I see your proof, please?
