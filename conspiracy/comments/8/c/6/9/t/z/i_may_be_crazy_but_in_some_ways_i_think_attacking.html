        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Putin&#39;s stranglehold over Russia is enforced by the fact that he seems like a strong leader. When their economy is failing and their life expectancy is like 55, what else do the Russian people have to put their faith in? Putin. But how can Putin actually standup against the US in a military conflict? He can&#39;t. That is why he ultimately takes most conflicts to the UN. But if the US keeps pushing, eventually the Russian populace will start to recognize the facade Putin is putting up and turn on him. At least in theory.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not actually supporting a US lead attack on Syria because I think that such actions are bad. I&#39;m just trying to think outside the box.</p>

<p>The Russians are world leaders in rocketry and always have been, they very likely have enough of them to sink every US warship, they also appear to have outclassed us in digital warfare if the account of the USS Donald Cook story is true</p>

The reason Putin “takes most conflicts to the UN” is because he is trying to follow a thing called “international law” (granted not always) and is not trying to start WW3.

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of highly competent professional people that I also highly respect for the very thorough and commendable way they happen to do their jobs that has nothing to do with liking them as people or wanting to associate with them in any private or personal way and it&#39;s important to separate the difference between those two perspectives and exactly what you are attempting to criticise in that regard. </p>

<p>Putin&#39;s ability to lead and pull his people and the entire country together and back into being a world power to be reckoned with in the face of the circumstances that prevailed at the time can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be underestimated. </p>

<p>He&#39;s not the type you want to make an enemy out of or to be foolish enough to disregard or belittle the actual nature of what that altogether remarkable accomplishment entailed. </p>

<p>The more pressure the west exerts on him the more self-sufficient and internally strong he proceeds to make Russia in response to it and with no difficulty of any kind in persuading anyone about the vital necessity for it to get their full and enthusiastic support and co-operation with it. </p>

<p>He rarely goes anywhere that he doesn&#39;t ink billion dollar deals for pipelines, power stations, high speed railways, or four times the bang for the buck in defensive military hardware to ensure that there&#39;s plenty of work at home to not only keep but expand the country&#39;s industrial base with more and better paying jobs. </p>

<p>He&#39;s done the same thing with agriculture which has taken Russia from being a major importer to a major exporter of strictly organically and traditionally grown foodstuffs that lack any taint of GMO&#39;s laced with toxic herbicides and insecticides that no one can find enough of or at a reasonable price. He very directly does what other leaders only talk about doing while throwing money at private industry that simply pockets the windfall and keeps right on doing what they were expected to change and improve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously haven&#39;t been keeping up with either the changes that have taken place in Russia under Putin over the past 15 years or stayed on top of what the current status of Russia&#39;s military and it&#39;s technological advancements in that area are, which are at least a decade ahead of anything the west has at this point. </p>

<p>You also overlook the fact that Russia and China have a mutual defence agreement in which they&#39;ll go down trying together rather than a more certain fate if one of them goes down before the other.</p>

<p>Putin is undoubtedly the leader among leaders from any unbiased and objective point of view. The kind of representative and spokesperson that every independent sovereign nation, culture, and society needs to have and to speak up for itself in international affairs. </p>

<p>All those that don&#39;t which is to say most if not all of the western nations is simply the measure of just how very little independence, sovereignty, or ability to defend their national identity and culture those leaders and their countires happen to have by comparison.</p>

<p>What you happen to call a &quot;façade&quot; is something very real and very dangerous to fuck with and the continual US &quot;pushing&quot; as you call it is seen as an effort directed against and designed to make the lives of every ordinary Russian worse and more difficult because Putin has been so successful in finally making them better in countless ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to disagree with you on almost every point.</p>

<p>Have you ever lived in Russia? </p>

<p>The military is an army of conscripts and most people avoid it if they can, corruption is epidemic and equipment is decades behind the west. </p>

<p>China has no love of Russia and still look at the far east as an easy conquest and would have no problem with capturing it. Most Russian people I speak to are far more worried about China than the west.</p>

<p>Putin cares only about himself he has no love from the Russian people. Russians are angry at the corruption they see in their everyday life, the polltuion around them and image which is portrayed to the world.</p>

<p>His &quot;high popularity&quot;? I guess he didn&#39;t he cheat in the last election then? I loved the ballon gag the best.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ayglwqw_fo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ayglwqw_fo</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have a long tradition of being led by &quot;strongmen&quot; as you might call them that have ruled over them by force and intimidation, and yet have no inclination to be led by weak one, or any consortium of them either. </p>

<p>As for corruption they have a long sad history of that as well which was at it&#39;s peak when Yeltsin was in power and would have turned the entire country into the kind of  basket-case the Ukraine now is if the west could have shoe-horned Berezovsky into Yeltsin&#39;s shoes as they&#39;d planned in order to finish the country off once and for all. You going to tell me that you didn&#39;t know that? </p>

<p>And I suppose you think all the people of the Ukraine are just tickled to death with the new and improved government the US arranged for them with armed fascist thugs patrolling their streets and shaking them down with shortages everywhere and prices that have climbed out of sight.</p>

<p>A hundred years ago the vast majority of Russian people were living as indentured serfs bought and sold with the land under an absolute monarch and his aristocratic relatives and ne&#39;er do wells and military enforcers that served them.</p>

<p>Their rebellion only turned to and resulted in communism because none of the democratic western nations had any regard for their plight nor any interest in pressing for the kind of reforms they themselves had enjoyed after breaking out of that feudal mode centuries before and that attitude hasn&#39;t changed in the slightest. Their only concern was in trying to preserve that order which had no general support for it at all.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been one long uphill battle for those ordinary Russians and for anyone paying attention things as they are now are certainly far better than they have ever been at any other time by comparison and by any measuring stick you might care to apply. </p>

<p>So kindly don&#39;t play the violin and shed any crocodile tears over how hard done-by they all are under Putin, as if you actually gave a damn about them. </p>

<p>They may still have a ways to go but at least they&#39;re going there and in the right direction not sitting smugly on their ass in a country that had everything going for it from the outset only to be ruled by series of governments that have deliberately pissed that all away while still pretending that it&#39;s somehow better than anyone else&#39;s and entitled to pass judgement how they should live in comparison to the vulgar reality of what they and their own country have actually become. Like Mussolini said, &quot;Don&#39;t call it Fascism it&#39;s actually &#39;Corporatism&#39;.&quot; and the US has not only has it writ large but far and wide beyond it&#39;s own borders.</p>

<p>What can you say in the defence of any country that spends more on making weapons of war and going to war than all of the other nations, friend or foe, put together?</p>

<p>A nation with only 5% of the worlds population that it takes that kind of spending to protect with over 800 military bases all around the planet to supposedly do it? </p>

<p>Against what kind of threat would that be since only one or two other nations actually have a base or two outside of their own borders? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t ever kid yourself, those bases exist to intimidate and exploit smaller nations and the military that operates out of them is equipped for that purpose and not confronting any foe that might actually be something to seriously worry about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you have not been to Russia or spoken with ordinary Russians then?</p>

<p>Corruption has been reduced? That will come as a big shock to the Russian people.</p>

<p>The Ukrainian people have no desire to be ruled by puppets from Russia, this is a fact.</p>

<p>If you spent time in Russia I think your view of the country would change a lot.</p>

<p>But how can Putin actually standup against the US in a military conflict? He can&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? I guess that explains why the US ran for the hills when the Russians invaded Georgia...</p>

<p>In fact, it seems whenever the Russian military shows up, the US decides not to risk direct confrontation. I wonder why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe. But Russia can&#39;t win a conventional war with the US. And Putin&#39;s position is based upon appearing to be a strong leader. He probably doesn&#39;t want to start a nuclear war though, ya know, because nobody does. </p>
