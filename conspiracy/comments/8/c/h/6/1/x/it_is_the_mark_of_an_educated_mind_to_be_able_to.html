       I guess this is for some of the newer guys, and some of the older users that have picked up bad habits.

      <p>
       Sometimes it seems we have become so reactionary to ideas or theories to where we can not even entertain an idea or discuss an idea unless we fully subscribe to it as truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a random example, UFOs. They are fun to discuss and entertain, but I do not really believe little green men are out to get us. And I will not be changing my life style in preparation for a green invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       This post isn't meant to call out a particular instance, but is meant as a friendly reminder that you can civilly discuss theories you do not fully believe.

       I don't rule out the possibility of ET life. In fact, I feel that based on the size of the Universe it's almost impossible for there
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to be any. Of course, it gets difficult to determine just how much life there might actually be out there- and if it is sentient or not. Perhaps only a handful of sentient species arise per galaxy- perhaps only one? Perhaps sentient Life exists but is very rare...or perhaps the universe is crammed full of it. Honestly, at this point, there's no way to know.

       My bigger worry about aliens is something like Blue Beam.

       I tend to lean more to the breakaway civilization theory to where the UFOs we see are actually earthlings who posses more advanced tech than us and try to keep it hidden from the world... And that their are aliens but they watched our video signals and don't want anything to do with this crazy planet. LOL

       That basically ties into Blue Beam. BB is when they finally reveal that Tech under the guise of Aliens.

       Especially with the recent announcement of advances (however minor) in mind reading tech, and especially in the ability to now beam individuated messages directly into someone head w/o others hearing. That's how they'll fool everyone into believing the aliens can communicate via thoughts.

       What if people living in jungles in South America and Africa are the long separated members of a previous global system.  Now we find their quaint backwardness as something to protect.  In the same way if humans left the planet with great technology then they might see us as something to preserve.  They might think that its really quaint that we go to McDonalds and so don't want to homogenize us with interplanetary culture.

       To those few uncontacted tribes in the Amazon, one of their members describing a modern world like our own existing across the world would probably be dismissed as a mad man. If he recounted seeing a helicopter circling around him and told everyone it was the people from the outside world, his fellow tribe members might ask "If they have the technology to build flying machines, why would they be interested in us?"
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if we have been contacted by aliens or not. The problem is that I've never really seen much proof that his convinced me. However, I also respect that fact that we do not have the knowledge to say how unlikely it is.

       We actually do kinda have the knowledge to say how unlikely is. We can use the Drake Equation to estimate how likely it is to contact life.

       We know rate of formation of stars relatively accurately, there's much larger error on stuff like how often intelligent life forms. But we can at least estimate.

       But we have no idea of the variety of life (e.g can non-Carbon based life exist?) and the possible environments it can live in. We also don’t know what kind of technology is possible and whether there are ways to travel extremely long distances, for example across galaxies or even between them. All this stuff could effect how likely it would be that aliens would visit us. All we have is speculation based on a very limited amount of knowledge and zero idea of how much we don’t know.

       Even if you take the most conservative estimates you still end up with millions of intelligent civilizations out there. I wouldn't take the Drake equation too seriously though imo.

       If intelligent life has a chance of one in a trillion trillion on a habitable planet, then boom- extremely unlikely another civilization exists because there aren't that many stars. I pulled that number or of my ass, but essentially so does everyone else because we have ONE data point for the existence of life.

       All true. I don't put much stock in the Drake equation for that reason. My point was more to the fact that the universe is so unfathomably huge that even if you assume life is extremely rare and intelligent live is even more rare, and it can only spring up on rocky planets with liquid water ect ect you still are almost garunteed to have plenty of other civilizations. But yea the Drake equation is just a random line in the sand that some guy drew so we could have a metric, not a good one, just have one at all.

       It seems unlikely that non-carbon based lifeforms would be common. It is also possible for faster than life warpdrives to exist depending on whether we can find "exotic matter" that has the properties of negative mass.

       It's almost impossible for non-carbon-based life. Silicon blows and is too unstable, and there's nothing else that's common enough can form enough bonds to maintain such complex compounds.

       Imagine we have a massive quantum blindspot and travelling some distance away from here of closer to some specific region of space enables us to experiance something previously undetectible. We don't like to admit and assume that massive unknowns like this could exist though.
      </p>

       Idk man. I actually have a massive blind spot myself having no knowledge into any of this myself. Maybe they do consider unknown unknowns, to the most rational degree that they can anyway.

       I'm starting to think that there is something hardwired into physics that makes space travel over long distances prohibitively expensive in time and resources. This is based on the assumption that there is no way to break physics as we know it completely, like worm holes or FTL travel. The resources required to build spacecraft and the distances between interesting objects are so mind numbingly vast.

       FTL travel is actually theoretically possible without breaking the laws of physics with something like the Alcubierre Drive. If you compress spacetime in front of you and expand it behind you you could effectively travel faster than light through space without ever exceeding the speed of light locally. This would require exotic matter with the properties of negative mass. We currently don't know if any such matter exists, but if we discover matter with the properties we need it would be possible.

       Yea good point. Even though nothing can travel faster than light, space itself is not bound by that. That's also how we end up with the "observable universe" because beyond that line space is expanding faster than light can travel, so we'll never know what is beyond. I forgot all about the Alcubierre drive. I guess negative mass is theoretically possible on paper.

       This is the kind of stuff that people come up with once they let their mathematical constructions supersede their ability to observe "reality".  They get so wrapped up in their mathematical imaginings, they forget that their numbers on paper have nothing to do with the real universe.

       I could easily counter with my own link that shows lensing, relativity or gravitational waves but I'd rather discuss it. I'm going to assume that you don't accept pictures from telescopes as evidence. Special relativity follows from two postulates: The speed of light is the same for all observers, and the laws of physics work the same in any non accelerating frame (if you were trapped in a box with no windows, you would be unable to determine whether the box is moving or at rest through observation). Which of those do you disagree with? General relativity introduces another postulate that in the same box, gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration. You wouldn't be able to tell whether you were on the surface of a planet or accelerating upwards at a constant rate. Upon proving these, all of special and general relativity follows.

       I showed video evidence of relativity being falsified.  Actual photos played in sequence showing a complete absence of lensing.  You have... nothing but a few words(?) and the lies of a research team which had to fabricate evidence to justify it's obscenely bloated budget.

       A sufficiently advanced species could build an autonomous spacecraft that only has artificial intelligence, thus no need for food, water, oxygen, etc. Check out the concept of a Von Neuman probe — they could cover the galaxy in less time than you would imagine because they self replicate.

       NASA has lied in the past = NASA lies about everything = FE and Never been to moon must be true.

      <p>

       <em>
        any

       A discussion is not necessarily about convincing someone that your perspective is the only right one. NASA lies and makes fake videos. You are correct that that doesn't mean you can blanket assert that everything they say is a lie and every video they make is fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       But at the same time there are many facts that would suggest we  did not go to the moon. Or at the very least are hiding what they did find. So it is a 2 way street.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as FE. It used to be a fun thought experiment to ponder. Now people are so closed minded they get angry when it is mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may see some of these topics as being pushed on you like they are trying to force you to believe them. But in some cases (not all) that is only a reactionary response. Some times they just wanted to discuss the concept and the harsh response they got pushed them into being defensive and reactionary.

       How about this one:
      </p>
      <p>
       The historical Aristotle figure actually never existed in this reality, but was inserted into the historical record by a secret band of renegade Russian scientists trying to fix the Mandela Effect anomalies created by the CERN disaster.  As a test case, they used the story of the imaginary philosopher to test their method of mass mind control by seeing how many people they could get to believe in a wise ancient Greek who had most of the the really good basic ideas before anyone else.  Sadly, after an initial success, the numbers seem to be decreasing due to the general decline in human intelligence.

       This scenario ranks as least as likely as the results of the last presidential election.

       I experienced a bit of this mindset when I commented about flat earth theory.  I’m not a believer but I was interested in the subject so I watched the most popular speakers on YouTube and listened to a bunch of podcasts about it.  I made some comments about it on a post discussing it and received a ton of hate.  I got people saying that the idea is so stupid it deserves no platform.  One person called me a stupid n word.  Plenty more comments on why this should not be discussed and loads of personal attacks.  Lots of people think certain subjects are dangerous and discussion should not be allowed.

       Your strawman isn't that far off the mark, considering he thought some races were naturally fit to be slaves and that democratic governments were situational and shouldn't be too democratic. Critical thinking should be applied even to revered figures from the past.

       That might be worth looking into, considering we are all slaves now! In all seriousness, Aristotle wrote the book on pretty much everything! Formal logic was unaltered for 2,000 years after he proposed the founding principles! Natural sciences, ethics, rhetoric, dreams, animals, the soul,etc. The dude had time on his hands.

       While Aristotle undoubtedly existed, almost none of his writings survive--and a good part of what is attributed to him is, by scholars, of questionable authenticity.

       "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function." ~ F. Scott Fitzgerald

       Sure! I usually start by going back to the origin of any concept/idea/quote etc -- so, in these two cases, these are good reading starting points/origins:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fitzgerald quote comes from a really under-appreciated series of essays in Esquire:
       <a href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a4310/the-crack-up/">
        https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a4310/the-crack-up/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Keats' "negative capability" first showed up in a letter to George and Tom Keats:
       <a href="https://genius.com/John-keats-negative-capability-letter-to-george-and-tom-keats-annotated">
        https://genius.com/John-keats-negative-capability-letter-to-george-and-tom-keats-annotated
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, any reading rec would depend on what sort of literature is your "thing" -- i.e. poetry, fiction, non-fiction etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       But generally speaking, I'm a big fan of modernists like Fitzgerald (of course, "The Great Gatsby", but also lesser known works such as "The Diamond as Big as the Ritz", from "Tales of the Jazz Age").
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, regarding Keats, it's tough to read him in isolation, i.e. apart from the other romantic poets: Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here two of my favorite Keats poems, To Autumn:

       If you consider that he died at age 25, his creative output was staggering...not only did he write poetry, he also wrote prodigious "letters" (more a road map to his and his fellow romantic poets' vision than traditional letters).

       I read so much, and I'll read on any subject.
 Anything dark, poetic. Informative..

       Fitz is among the few authors I do admire. Thanks for the list! This is great. I'll be bookmarking this page, so really feel free to share any interesting pieces of writing.

       If you like dark,
       <em>
        Perfume
       </em>
       by Patrick Süskind doesn't get any darker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another excellent, dark read:
       <em>
        The Gargoyle
       </em>
       by Andrew Davidson.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you like to stretch out a bit ... have you explored magical realism, specifically works by Garcia Marquez? I adore
       <em>
        One Hundred Years of Solitude.
       </em>
       That particular novel especially combines romantic creation with dark improbabilities ...

       Shelley's
       <em>
        Prometheus Unbound
       </em>
       is amazing! I'm currently reading Frankenstein and it is unbelievable how brilliant Mary Shelley was, in spite of (perhaps due to?) her harrowing sadness over Percy and their daughter. Gotta love Coleridge's
       <em>
        Rime of the Ancient Mariner
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        The Eolian Harp,
       </em>
       Edgar Allen Poe would never have written had it not been for the Romantic era's major players. Shout out to Brit-Lit 216! Changed my life, no joke.

       and the warnings relating to hubris, technology, unchecked science etc was so incredibly prescient ... I'm not a huge fan of M. Shelley's writing style (could have perhaps benefited from a rigorous editor) itself, but I AM a fan of her vision.

       I used to think given the amount of ufo sightings and experiences, plus the fact there are 10 billion planets estimated to have life in our solar system alone there could be alien life. Now I don’t think there is.  I think there is a possibility of extra dimensional life but that is beyond my understanding.

       Look at all the huge circlejerks on all corners of the political spectrum, the pro-life/anti-choice debate, and the gay rights debate.

       It might not be 'most people', but a lot of people are unable (or unwilling) to work out why people on the other side of these debates think in the way that they do.

       I'm probably going to anger you, but I am pro choice, anti democracy (anti choice?) and quite a very strong monarch from my experiences of entertaining thoughts of different spectrums. I've come to the conclusion that democracy is inefficient and a trick to make people feel like they are free when they are not. I want a strong monarchy with semistrong parliament. I don't want democracy. Not everyone should be able to vote.

       I try to limit what I hate as much as possible. So sure, let the landed families determine the king. As for the common folks, fuck no.

      <p>
       What is landed though for America? IDK. I guess it would need to be some kind of criteria raising them above most. Maybe they have to have given sons and daughters to the army, paid at least 60% of their income in taxes, and own a business? Seems good enough to merit a say in the monarch. Being totally arbitrary here though.

       I don't see how this would be much better than a democratic mob 'rule'. Sure, the mob's smaller, but the mob consists of very similar people, so it sounds like the mob 'rule' would consist of a single circlejerk, not two opposing circlejerks.

       Two opposing circle jerks are too busy one upping each other to fuck over the common bloke. That's why even in it's current state, the UK works better than the US system. It's not a strong Monarch, but instead of a strong Monarch one upping a strong parliament and vice versa, you have several very strong personalities one uping each other. So it's functionally the same. But the key point is that the common people do not choose the prime minister. Instead they choose their local minister. And the minister has to deal with all sides, not just the one that won the vote. This counters the mob rule of democracy. The minister that is the majority (not necessarily the most popular) gets to choose the prime minister, who still also had to represent their own constituents while being prime minister.
      </p>
      <p>
       This forces all MPs to be on equal footing no matter who is the majority, and many times the majority is not the most popular, but instead a coalition between minority parties.

       That’s happened more after the 2015 title II legislation than before it, and I haven’t heard of it once since the repeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also find plenty of cases where net neutrality laws were broken (before the 2015, now repealed, law) and the FCC stepped in to protect net neutrality (as in the 2009 case where AT&amp;T blocked voip services on cell phones using their 3g). I mean good for them, but the result was actually pretty great for companies and pretty bad for consumers: the death of unlimited data caps.  For people like me, I would much prefer to have voip blocked when off WiFi and just use my phone as, well, a phone during that time if it meant I could still have unlimited data.  The title II legislation made this action (which was already handled in the way the people who cried about the repeal would want) officially illegal, but in more general terms.  Instead of having a hearing about if the action was harmful, deceitful or violated first amendment rights, it’s just plain illegal.  I’d liken it to assault cases becoming tone-deaf to self-defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once official, the ability for a smaller telecom upstart to offer faster services to rural areas for cheaper by, say, publicly not allowing Netflix (at some point over half of internet traffic) was gone.  There is nothing unlawful, harmful, or deceitful about allowing a consumer a greater range of choices.  Since the big bucks were needed to handle ALL traffic equally (which they still didn’t do before, after, or during the legislations lifespan) we are left with telecom giants that are pretty much universally hated and pushed the very hardest to keep title II in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the door is open to companies that can better tailor to specific subsets without forcing them to subsidize other customers with larger data consumption.  It doesn’t make any of the shady things that have been complained about legal, but it allows an honest path for similar arrangements to exist in broad daylight, rather than illegally in secret.  It also prevents what happened with cellular data, strict data caps, from becoming universal (which began happening during title II, though with much larger caps than cell phones)

       This brings up a good point that although there are numerous
       <em>
        theories
       </em>
       given a certain topic, we should not assert them as
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       without prerequisite, consensus, facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So often we fill in the gaps with conjecture, imagination, and bias, only to stray further from the facts. The further from the shores of reality we stray, the further into the abyss of fantasy we drift into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be skeptical, ask questions, but do not let fantasy get in the way of factual reality.

       honestly, this quote mainly applies to politics, where most people can't for a second comprehend how the other 'side' thinks what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       When applied to conspiracy theories, all the quote does is enable a normal person to understand why a person would believe conspiracy theories, so they may take pity on them. For example, the idea that there's nobody in control is scary, so people cook up ideas of scary guys behind the curtain. etc.

       I think the biggest problem this sub has is that there are far too many people who are 100% on the side of conspiracies

       There have been threads with people post about hollow Earth with zero interest in people pointing out how flawed the claim is.

       Likewise - and I can't believe I have to say this - the arc of the covenant probably not being a real thing. It certainly isn't bringing an apocalypse. But you look at the Antarctica thread

       It's funny how the threshold for evidence lowers dramatically when it comes to believing conspiracies. People here all too frequently dismiss research which spanned an entire career, or peer-reviewed research, or research from legitimate scientific institutes. Their threshold is impossibly high for a user here to consider yet lizard people exist because of photo artifacts :|

       Why do you come to this sub? Just to criticize conspiracy researchers? Very rarely do I ever see a hollow earth post and I haven't seen a lizard people post in years.  These are the strawmen you chose to ridicule people who research subjects you have no real interest in except to criticize those that do.

      </p>
      <p>
       Life on earth is extremely "dense", compared to other civilizations.  The fundamental cause of said density is debased thought.  Other beings have an extremely difficult time lowering their frequency to match said density.

       Its potentially the mark of an educated mind as it does take time and practice to gain the

       to entertain contradictory ideas without acceptance or the ability to comprehend the magic of paradox.

       I think part of the problem here is part and parcel with the mindset you get from "waking up".
      </p>
      <p>
       Suddenly the talking head on your TV may no longer be being truthful, and some "crazy" youtuber might actually be on to something. As an extension of that, any given thread or comment could just as easily be real as it could be a shill or bot on a misinformation campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only cure for this is citations. If someone is making big claims they would need to provide some kind of bold evidence. Or at least that's where I draw my line between what I can honestly discuss vs bullshit. We can entertain any idea you could come up with, but I will not be able to take it seriously without any evidence at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So be civil. Be skeptical. Check your sources. If you're going to participate in the discussion, come with an open mind and a healthy distrust.even if you don't buy the evidence presented you should still be able to entertain the idea, at least to the point of being able to debunk it with counter points.

       This quote applies to so many things.. Flat Earth theory for example.  Instead of immediately dismissing it because it sounds stupid, the smallest bit of research will inform you that many images of the Earth are composites, it's quite difficult to measure the curve of the Earth and NASA has a dark history.
       <strong>
        Doesn't mean the Earth is flat.

       Your post points to something that I find curious in conspiracy discussions.  I agree with OP.  Persons need to be able to engage with an idea / theory without thinking it true.  The curiosity is how that idea of "thinking it true" relates to this line:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And I will not be changing my life style in preparation for a green invasion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       For a significant number of conspiracies, there seem to be energetic arguments regarding the truth of the conspiracy with fervent rhetoric on both sides.  Yet nowhere in the discussion is there any mention of the practical consequences of believing, or not believing, the conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Said another way:  Flat earthers seem to not
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       anything different from oblate spheroid earthers.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a flat earther will pound on the desk to demand that others accept that theory as true, and yet there are not practical consequences to the belief...other than changing the position one argues.  Or they will adamantly refuse to engage the idea that earth is an oblate spheroid without any....well, reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like in order to engage with the oblate spheroid theory a flat earther would have to wear a different hat, or forego a particular food.  There is nothing lost or gained in switching one's view.  And yet the absolutely refuse to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that's my curiosity, the thing I kinda don't
       <em>
        get
       </em>
       with conspiracies.  Take the example I quoted:  If belief in UFOs required that one construct a bomb shelter, like you could not conceptually grasp and entertain the idea of UFOs unless you physically made a bomb shelter, then I would totally understand an unwillingness to entertain the idea.  I don't like working with my hands, so I wouldn't  conceive a belief that required me to work with my hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       But having an idea in one's mind does not require any physical labor, any significant change to the ordinary routine of one's life.  You don't have to
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       anything.  You just have to
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       some different ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing practical seems to ride on many of these conspiracies.  So why are adherents of particular theories so adamant about defending them and so obstinate in their refusal to conceive a different story?  If these beliefs do not force life style changes, why do people get so pissy about them?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is my curiosity.  And something about the way OP phrased the post poked me in a way that resulted in my typing this out.  Do with it what you will.

       TOTALLY agreed, and a quote I have been referencing myself of late!
      </p>
      <p>
       unfortunately this is a particular problem in politics... one MUST consider the alternative viewpoints if ANY sort of consensus is ever going to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not gonna touch your UFO example... that would take us WAY OT.... lets go more extreme as an example.... Chem Trails, or even the Illuminati Lizard people.... both subjects I have opted to investigate recently to see if there was any substance to claims, why people believe such things and to attempt to understand the thinking behind those who push such theories.... and in entertaining the thinking (as per Aristotle) I might learn something along the way or understand my fellow humans and their thought processes better. I apologise for the length, but think this is a good example of how something good can come out of looking at even the most extreme theories and considering other points of view.  Discoveries after all only come from  things we THOUGHT we knew and understood and are rarely expected. Challenging our notions is a good thing, as they will either alter with the new information... are be confirmed and further solidified in our minds
      </p>
      <p>
       what did I learn?????  that the Lizard thing is essentially a one man roadshow, however his Illuminati discussion introduced me to Zbigniew Brzezinski... a person I had never heard of before, but is essentially responsible for the world we live in right now (he outlined the patriot act and reduction of freedoms in the 70's, lied about funding the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan to DRAW Russia into it's 'own Vietnam' and has more blood on his hands than Henry Kissinger! Also the diving force behind the current Anti-Russia sentiment.... launching it with the first opinion piece..."Crimea, what to do about Russia", not to mention why he has a personal hard on against Russia (His Polish father was an Ambassador there during the Stalin era)  - Paradigm changing info, which I only discovered thanks to researching Lizard people... yet nothing to do with Lizards
      </p>
      <p>
       Chem Trails - there are legitimate cloud formation concerns and how extra WATER VAPOUR from CONtrails is impacting cumulus cloud formation rainfall and weather....  The NASA research had to be shut-down as it became too sensitive to the chemtrail crowd... so it is being quietly ignored.  Add to that some pretty bad science (assuming chemtrails are the sole source of heavy metals found in remote locations), and NASA doing 'worst case scenario disaster planning' involving geo engineering, without properly explaining what they are doing... and without looking at human impact factors of the chemicals they are looking at... there is easily enough ammo to get a conspiracy theory rolling.

       Funny you should bring up UFO’s.

       The big question in the field of heretical knowledge and research should be, do the “anomaly” photos from Mars and elsewhere show what they appear to be, or these shapes mere coincidence in rock.

       That's what should be taught in universities imo. Here in germany, especially in Bavaria critical thinking and the ability to discuss theories is not supported. Here you should swallow without questioning that what authorities teach and anything what is contrary to that is considered "rebellious".

       Quickly then, and under the umbrella of this thread, let me say: Jews have caused so much harm to American government/national and international politics!  Also, IQ is everything, and explains the higher violence, STD's, lack of education, lower earnings, and higher public assistance of certain groups.  And nothing can be done of the racial thing, except to accept it and govern one's own actions accordingly.  Remember too, if you feed certain animals they become dependent. Down-vote based on logic, not if you simply disagree with the suggestion.  ...remember the quote!!! ;)

       Good post. Yeah, people are quick to judge you because you think of a possibility when you are completely free to think of something and still remain skeptical.

       In other words have an open mind and actually think. Even try to put yourself in the opposing shoes and think like them. I guess I'm smart

       Really it allows civil discussion and debate of a subject's truth.  We come together here, some of use every day to discuss subjects that we are mutually interested in. Many of the subjects we discuss here have multiple perspectives at least until the facts and truths get hashed out.  In the past before the election I saw the power of this sub's community to get to the truth of just about every subject under discussion while being civil about it.  There is a lot of hashing power between us when we cooperate. Lately there has been a lot of disruption from the hyper political. I fell into it for a while myself.

       Two opposing circle jerks are too busy one upping each other to fuck over the common bloke. That's why even in it's current state, the UK works better than the US system. It's not a strong Monarch, but instead of a strong Monarch one upping a strong parliament and vice versa, you have several very strong personalities one uping each other. So it's functionally the same. But the key point is that the common people do not choose the prime minister. Instead they choose their local minister. And the minister has to deal with all sides, not just the one that won the vote. This counters the mob rule of democracy. The minister that is the majority (not necessarily the most popular) gets to choose the prime minister, who still also had to represent their own constituents while being prime minister.
      </p>
      <p>
       This forces all MPs to be on equal footing no matter who is the majority, and many times the majority is not the most popular, but instead a coalition between minority parties.
