<p>•The US will call for martial law and put the FEMA camps to use , if you want to end up dead then go with them. If you want any chance at survival don’t agree to taking any Vaccines from the US government and hide away from FEMA. If you refuse they most likely will kill you that’s why you got to hide from them. </p>

<p>•If you don’t have a gun make sure you loot a shit load of guns and ammunition. You are better off dying in a gun fight against FEMA than being put in a concentration camp to suffer and die.</p>

<p>• Don’t trust anyone but your family.</p>

<p>• Don’t give in to anyone who claims authority, especially the military who has been hiding in the bunker during the nuclear/EMP attacks awaiting to force martial law.</p>

<p>• During martial law you will be forced to give up your guns this a huge NO the government and FEMA are your enemies they are the ones who caused this.</p>

<p>• Avoid anyone from the government and work with a group of civilians who agree to this as well to increase your chances of survival.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I’m not a FEMA apologist and I’m not going to deny the fact that it’s possible FEMA is up to something sinister, however, it’s also impossible to deny the fact that the camps are designed “to keep people in” in order to keep them safe from whatever may make them unsafe outside of the camp.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think it’s okay to be forced inside a camp by your own will? If there’s something dangerous outside you design it to keep people from entering not exiting. You’ll be put with thousands of others in this camp where you will starve to death, and be riddled with diseases. Myself if I do survive I’ll be avoiding FEMA it’s completely retarded to submit yourself to something like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with your assertion of a camp being design to “hold people against their will” is that the camp is designed in such a way that it can serve its purpose for any type of national emergency, some of which may require people to remain inside for safety, such as an attack or invasion, or widespread deadly disease outbreak.</p>

<p>The other problem is that just because it’s designed “to keep people inside” doesn’t mean that it has to be USED expressly to keep people inside for any emergency, but for any that may REQUIRE people to remain inside against their will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Get what you’re saying, you’re not wrong in the given scenario.  Here’s my point: let’s say whoever designed these camps say, “we are going to design them to be functional in the event of ‘these 100 emergency scenarios’”.</p>

<p>A handful of those hundred scenarios may involve protecting people from an outside threat which may require them to be legitimately held against their will for their own good (contamination, disease, etc), so the building is designed with that In mind.</p>

<p>Maybe one of those scenarios is a threat of being bombed, but who’s to say that within that threat management scenario there is a requirement for people to be held against their will?</p>

<p>My house is designed with locks to keep people out, but that doesn’t mean my locks are locked 100% of the time and I can’t pick and choose when I allow people to come and go, as the situation dictates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another thing - think about information control and flow. There may well be a psyop that the whole world has been EMPed/nuked. No, it&#39;s just the US and Europe. But communications will be so borked (no computers, no internet, no mobile phones, no landlines) there&#39;s no way of talking to them. Newspapers will likely convince you otherwise.</p>

<p>Similarly, travel will be difficult. Even if you have an old non-electronic car/motorcycle, fuel will be nearly impossible to find. Gas stations may have fuel in their tanks but the pumps won&#39;t work - so maybe if you have a hand pump. Bicycles for hard roads, horses for general purpose. Good idea to have a paper map or road atlas, because your GPS won&#39;t be working either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we&#39;re concerned about a historical role reversal then I would look at how closely the camps are to train tracks. I&#39;m sure I read something years ago about FEMA ordering boxcars, shackels and guillotines, but it could be bullshit and it&#39;s not a rabbit hole I want to go too deep down. Sorry for my cowardice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I believe there is something sinister behind the camps too, but as a Brit I am not as clued up about it. All the role reversal predictive programming in recent entertainment is pretty alarming though and is what started waking me up to this stuff. I&#39;m talking about stuff like Far Cry 5 that is about people fighting Christian villains in America. In the trailers they emphasized the fact that the good guys in the game are getting &quot;revenge&quot; against Christians. I&#39;m paraphrasing because I can&#39;t remember the actual wording, but I also remember the adverts saying to beware of the bear which could mean Russia. This is only one example of the role reversal agenda, but it&#39;s about America specifically so that&#39;s why I brought it up. For people that are not Christian, don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be safe either, anyone with Christian values will probably be seen as a threat, and lots of Westerners hold on to Christian values regardless of whether they believe or not.</p>
