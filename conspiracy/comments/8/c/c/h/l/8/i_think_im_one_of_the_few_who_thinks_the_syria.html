Certain countries will want to become dominant powerhouses first, how they&#39;re trying to diminish US influence with the dollar (petro-yuan etc)  Syria, Russia and Iran want peace and stability in Syria, the US wants instability there and basically to try and drag out that war there. So it&#39;s a waiting game.  Nations aren&#39;t ready yet for total world war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very little was accomplished by this strike. Estimates $165 million cost. 8 out of 10 missiles intercepted. The ones that did hit didn’t do all that much damage and we warned everyone (Russia, Iran, who warned Syria) ahead of time so those places were empty buildings.</p>

<p>The US and Russia agreed ahead of time to exactly what happened. They still intercepted most of the missiles, they just didn’t attack American ships or troops.</p>

<p>So (if one believes these rumors . . . which seem to be gaining some credibility) then Trump used the Deep State&#39;s thirst for war . . . and pulled a ju-jitsu move and bombed only the Deep State&#39;s assets in the region. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife, who&#39;s a big 4chan person, was the first person who brought the allegation to my attention that Trump only bombed John McCain-connected terrorist groups. I took it with a grain of salt until I was flipping through the news online and saw that he did indeed limit the attack to certain specified targets that were associated with terrorist elements in Syria, not the official government. Which is why no one interfered with the action. Not Russia. Not Turkey. Not Iran. Not China, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends if we can stop prophecy.</p>

<p>&quot;The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from <em>being</em> a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. - Isaiah 17:1&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to argue about whether the Bible is true or not, but prophecy can definitely be self-fulfilling. Whether the destruction of Damascus will spark WW3 is another story though, their are conflicting opinions on this. I think it will eventually happen because most people are ignorant when it comes to religion these days and instead worship science, people think everything is about oil and greed, but I think it&#39;s much deeper than that in my opinion. The holy war between the Abrahamic religions has started, but the masses aren&#39;t aware of it because they&#39;re still distracted by scams like politics.</p>
