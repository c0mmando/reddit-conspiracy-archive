       Dude, before last night I thought it was already out of the headlines. Comey would occupy the next week, plus the cheated on Kardashian, etc.
 But whoa! I was wrong. No Ruskies were hit, so it really might disappear now.

       I think most people have it wrong about WW3 also. Starting WW3 and participating in it isn't as easy as most people think it is. If anything, certain countries will wanna wait until they're ready for all out war.
Certain countries will want to become dominant powerhouses first, how they're trying to diminish US influence with the dollar (petro-yuan etc)  Syria, Russia and Iran want peace and stability in Syria, the US wants instability there and basically to try and drag out that war there. So it's a waiting game.  Nations aren't ready yet for total world war.

       Toppling Assadâ€™s Government would cause a power vacuum. Iran and Hezbollah would step in and take over the country.

       Its tough to see what is gained, aside from say $60 million spent on missiles to be reordered by the MIC and damage that will be fixed in a year or to Syrian infrastructure. What did the US and Israel really gain?

       My only conclusion is that an action like this allows for billions to be stolen because war accounting is terrible, so drop a few bombs and steal a few billion out the back door.

       Very little was accomplished by this strike. Estimates $165 million cost. 8 out of 10 missiles intercepted. The ones that did hit didnâ€™t do all that much damage and we warned everyone (Russia, Iran, who warned Syria) ahead of time so those places were empty buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US and Russia agreed ahead of time to exactly what happened. They still intercepted most of the missiles, they just didnâ€™t attack American ships or troops.

       Maybe if Obama wasnâ€™t such a pu$$y.. then Trump wouldnâ€™t have to go into Syria and stop the use of chemical weapons attacks. White Hats or Syrian govt.. theyâ€™re both using chemical weapons probably.

       Reports are coming out now that Trump only bombed facilities associated with John McCain-tied terrorist groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       So (if one believes these rumors . . . which seem to be gaining some credibility) then Trump used the Deep State's thirst for war . . . and pulled a ju-jitsu move and bombed only the Deep State's assets in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       (It's why Russia didn't respond. Nor Iran. Nor any other global player. They conferred with Trump before the events.)

       My wife, who's a big 4chan person, was the first person who brought the allegation to my attention that Trump only bombed John McCain-connected terrorist groups. I took it with a grain of salt until I was flipping through the news online and saw that he did indeed limit the attack to certain specified targets that were associated with terrorist elements in Syria, not the official government. Which is why no one interfered with the action. Not Russia. Not Turkey. Not Iran. Not China, etc.

       Amazingly, it would appear to me that the US can't wait, well, by definition the attacks of 9-11 was meant so that the US could go out and attack everyone to try to stay on top in the New American Century. So they attacked/destroyed Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and now Syria. Yemen. So those are done- the US can't invade or bomb those countries again. It's hard to say.  The US doesn't want to win or want any peace and stability in Afghanistan.

       I think we're pretty much done with world wars. They've realized how much strain it puts on a society and it seems far easier to have a slow burning conflict that eventually shapes into what they want as opposed to a massive conflict that instigated change more quickly. I'd be shocked if Assad is able to stay in power for much longer but I don't think we'll see a major, boots on the ground, conflict.

       Depends if we can stop prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. - Isaiah 17:1"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not here to argue about whether the Bible is true or not, but prophecy can definitely be self-fulfilling. Whether the destruction of Damascus will spark WW3 is another story though, their are conflicting opinions on this. I think it will eventually happen because most people are ignorant when it comes to religion these days and instead worship science, people think everything is about oil and greed, but I think it's much deeper than that in my opinion. The holy war between the Abrahamic religions has started, but the masses aren't aware of it because they're still distracted by scams like politics.
