       After a certain point, I think this will transform into some kind of action. Like large mobs marching on MI5 buildings demanding pedophile politicians files be released.

       I think this is the entire mission "Q" has given themself. Not to make us think like anybody wants us to think, but to "wake up" and learn to think for ourselves, each individual independent of the next. Getting rid of the mass herd mentallity we have been massaged into thinking was best. You DO start to see things differently, and you notice things they never wanted you to see. Thank you Q,  whoever you are.

       I think, Reddit trips over themselves anytime they can throw shade at the current President and anything his administration touches.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question: Would that post be #1 if Obama did the same exact strikes? I think we all know the answer..

       So you’re probably not wrong conspiracy is braking through the minds of normie. But I believe their hatred is a far great motivation than the pursuit of truth.

       In a way yes and no. The theme is Government hypocrisy. The Government claims they can't allow Assad to use chemical weapons, but do many more heinous things themselves, such as test biological weapons on their own citizens.

       You forgot the part where it says the pathogen wasn't harmful. You're just slinging shit at the wall hoping something sticks. Even if up think Assad isn't responsible for the attacks, or the attacks never happened at all, destroying the capacity to research and deploy unsanctioned chemical weapons is a good thing.

         Lethal Weapon: FBI's Use of Tear Gas Questioned at Davidian Trial
        </strong>
       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The first dose of tear gas was shot into Mount Carmel at about 6am by a 60-ton Patton tank fitted with a huge boom and outfitted with spray canisters containing a quart of tear gas each. During that first assault, the tank inserted six canisters -- roughly a gallon and a half -- of the gas. "I saw people in the chapel who had short sleeves on trying to rub it off; they were crying," Doyle testified. "It was like battery acid on your skin."
       </p>
       <p>
        After the first tank assault came the ferret rounds. FBI agents, riding inside M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, began shooting 40mm ferret rounds containing CS tear gas into every available window at Mount Carmel.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the first tank assault came the ferret rounds. FBI agents, riding inside M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, began shooting 40mm ferret rounds containing CS tear gas into every available window at Mount Carmel. (CS gas gets its name from the two American scientists who invented it -- B.B. Corson and R.W. Stoughton.) The agents used Army-issue grenade launchers to fire the projectiles, each of which contained 3.7 grams of CS gas dissolved in 33 grams of the solvent methylene chloride. Over the next six hours, the FBI shot about 400 ferret rounds at Mount Carmel. About 375 of them made it inside. The second assault came at 7:30am. More ferret rounds were shot inside the building while the tanks shot in six more canisters filled with tear gas. Doyle recalled the panic inside as men, women, and children tried to find refuge from the gas. "There were no masks for the children," recalled Doyle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another assault came at 9am with the tanks inserting another four bottles of CS. By that time, the levels of tear gas inside the building were reaching extremely high levels.
        <strong>
         <em>
          A 1995 report prepared by Failure Analysis Associates for the National Rifle Association estimated that when the third assault ended, CS concentrations inside the building ranged from "30 to 90 times that required to deter trained soldiers." The report also found that levels of methylene chloride, a compound similar to chloroform, were reaching levels nearly two times those considered "immediately dangerous to life and health" -- IDLH, a common measure of toxicity for chemical compounds.
         </em>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        By the time of the fourth assault at 11:45, when a tank inserted another four canisters of tear gas, the FBI had run out of ferret rounds and began looking for more. According to the Failure Analysis report, in the minutes before the first fire was spotted at Mount Carmel at 12:07pm, CS concentrations ranged from five to 60 times the level needed to deter soldiers. Methylene chloride levels still exceeded IDLH standards. By the time the fire started,
        <strong>
         <em>
          the Failure Analysis report estimates that the FBI had inserted about seven gallons of tear gas weighing more than 77 pounds
         </em>
        </strong>
        . For comparison, the average canister of Mace, a common brand name for self-defense tear gas, contains about 2.5 ounces of CS.

       The US, UK, and France shouldn't bomb them until the facts are in. The gassing may have been a false flag, it however may NOT have been a false flag, No bombs should be dropped before we know.

       However,
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen it claimed a Swiss lab said something it absolutely didn't say. The Information came from Russian State Television, which makes it  very unreliable at best. The Swiss lab refuted the RT claim, saying they don't know exactly where the gas came from, but will shortly. (At the time I went to sleep this was current information)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a fan of the "Russian trolls....Russian Trolls EVERYWHERE!" narrative,  but to think a country in conflict wouldn't engage in disinformation, within this community, is unwise, to the point of stupidity.

       They are trying to protect their country, and its interests, I can't blame them for that. I would do the same thing, and likely so would you, Dear Reader.

       Remember, DIG for Truth. Information that's handed to you on a silver platter usually comes at a cost. R/Conspiracy of all places, largely already know this fact. Sometimes we all forget lessons learned.

       The problem is the only reason people are skeptical is because they don’t like Trump. I mean, a wins a win but if someone like Obama was in office they’d be defending the actions. Criticizing anything trump does is what all the cool kids do.
