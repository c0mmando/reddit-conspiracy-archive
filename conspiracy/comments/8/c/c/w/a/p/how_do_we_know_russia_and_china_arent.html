       The West is controlled by the Holy Roman Empire (Vatican), and Russia (along with the East) is controlled by The Eastern Orthodox Church (Mount Athos would be the equivalent of the Vatican). They work together, hence the two headed Eagle. Zionism is yet another shield (Red Shield) for Babylon. This will get downvoted, though.

       Why do you never explain what the Holy Roman Empires interests are and why they do the things they do?
      </p>
      <p>
       You just say oh The Holy Roman Empire controls the West and then provide no proof or logic behind your claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have explained many times on here Israeli and Jewish control of the West in detail. I’m not writing off what you say, I’m just calling for evidence. You need to make a post breaking this shit down.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes you can talk about those things. You can’t talk about the Holocaust though because that will get you thrown in prison in many ZOG nations even if you’re a 90 year old Grandma.

       What the fuck is that jargon? You literally just gave sources from sketchy websites and some shit about bloodlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       I engaged some guy who believes the same shit that you do about black nobility and the Holy Roman Empire controlling the world. I absolutely tore him apart in the debate and he was like “I’m sorry I engaged with you, I really need to take this more seriously” after he couldn’t answer the questions I gave him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving me a list of names and yelling to me that these families control the world does not suffice as an explanation for what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have yet to explain in your own words what the interests of the Holy Roman Empire are and how that ties in with current events. You just direct me to other sources and claim you left a trail of breadcrumbs oh please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I want you to see the thread of the conversation I had with this guy who believes in the black nobility stuff because he wasn’t able to answer my questions, and it was clear that I won the exchange

       Obviously I didn’t go through all of your links. To be honest it feels like a bunch of conspiracy theorists shilling for or denying the existence of Jewish power and Jewish supremacy by saying it’s just a select group of Satanists and it has nothing to do with Jews. That’s just how it feels

       Huh? I call them all out, whether it's Black Nobility or Khazar Hofjuden. Also, they don't practice "satanism". It's Luciferianism (based on Babylonian/Sumerian Mysticism). This right here, shows me, you are a n00b to this. You have not gone down the rabbit hole far enough. Dig!

       They were overtaken during the bolshevik revolution.  I'm not an expert, but I've seen nothing in the last 100 years of their history that indicates they won their country back.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've (the hidden hand) been playing U.S. and Russia against each other for a century.  Neither ever gains a real advantage, but the "conflict" is always there.  It's great for the business of warfare and murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this present time, the U.S. is the greatest source of terror in the world, but I have no doubt that if Russia ever "won", they'd be in the exact same situation within a decade or two.

       The answer to your question is yes, they do control both Russia and China. u/Awesomo3082 makes a good point that Russia was overtaken during the Bolshevik revolution and there is no indication that they won their country back. All you have to do is read the work of Antony Sutton, especially
       <a href="https://www.voltairenet.org/IMG/pdf/Sutton_Wall_Street_and_the_bolshevik_revolution-5.pdf">
        Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution
       </a>
       to get a sense of that. I also recommend reading Miles Mathis's research on
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/lenin.pdf">
        Lenin and the Russian revolution.
       </a>
       What he shows there is not only that Lenin was (crypto) Jewish, but also that Nicolas II was, indicating that the revolution was managed on both sides, which makes sense given that it was a quick and bloodless revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, as for China, they were conquered over the 19th century during the Opium wars, with the Boxer rebellion probably marking the coup de grace of their conquest. See the discussion of the Boxer rebellion on page 15 in
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/butler2.pdf">
        this paper I wrote on Smedley Butler
       </a>
       for a discussion of some the fingerprints of Zionist/Jewish influence and interference.
       <a href="https://wideawakegentile.wordpress.com/2013/12/18/jews-in-china-mao-era/">
        Here is a link with even more.
       </a>
       And then of course there is
       <a href="http://www.mygen.com/users/ufo/Mao_was_a_Yale_Man.html">
        all the evidence
       </a>
       that Mao was supported and installed by the OSS.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, the leaders of Middle Eastern countries were installed by the colonial powers in the early 20th century, and there is really no indication of a real change of power. That is true even in Iran if you look carefully. So the same that can be said of Russia and China can be said of the Middle East and frankly of the rest of the world. All of this Russia hysteria is just misdirection. All sides are controlled by the same powers. We are already living in a One World Government, but it doesn't look like what we were lead to believe it would look like. Again, classic misdirection.

       Yesterday's bombing answered your Russia collaboration ....Russia moved all its high value assets out to sea before the bombing.
Just remember one thing...

       Everything you know to be reality Is up side down and backwards...just the way TPTB want it.

      <p>
       The middle class is gone forever....  And the children growing up will never know what its like to own a home as they will be using that money to pay off their student loans for 20+ years.
They will be so worried about living paycheck to paycheck they won't have time to think about anything else.

       True. They structure reality in such a way that no matter what side you choose you’re always suckered into the same ploy. They don’t want any sort of unification to occur that isn’t controlled by their agenda.

       Zionists don't blend into the Chinese establishment as seamlessly as they do in America or Russia's elites. Besides, the Chinese media is controlled by the government, not by Zionist plutocrats like our media is.

       Well both nations did sign off on Agenda 2030 and both nations are heavily involved in the One Belt One Road infrastructure project which is being headed by Israel. Russia and Israeli trade has gone up 30% in recent years and a lot of dual nationalist Russian citizens work in the high tech sector in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Israel has a good business relationship with China as well. They sell America’s most valuable weapons technology to China like the F-35. Trump even gave a speech recently condemning China for stealing our high technology, but of course he didn’t mention that Israel sold it to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn’t be surprised at all, but I still have hope that Putin is a Russian nationalist that isn’t controlled by a ZOG
