No one died (that I&#39;ve heard), and the buildings where chemical weapons were being produced by whoever (most likely terrorists funded by the West) are now gone, preventing future allegations and escalations. </p>

<p>Shit like this makes me think Trump (and co) are actually outsmarting the Shadow Government. Very interesting times. </p>

<p>How so? No one died, the buildings (and &quot;weapons&quot;) are gone, Assad and Russia shot down a considerable amount of said missiles, and we are all no worse off (minus the terrorists producing the weapons). This strike hurt the West, more than it hurts Syria (and Russia). </p>

<p>Trump Jr.&#39;s wife hospitalized after suspicious powder scare: police</p>

<p>Trump Tower has had two suspicious deaths in the past year.</p>

<p>The “Suicide” was a message to Trump that he could be next.</p>

<p>The Fire was a message that they will burn his empire to the ground.</p>

<p>The powder sent to Don Jr. was a message saying that we will kill your fucking family too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for those links. The fire seems suspicious. So  does the toxic powdered letter, which is very recent (mid Feb this year). So where is the investigation for this? He really does seem to be against some awful mafioso; I hope those psychopaths get exposed for what they&#39;re doing. Jones says there&#39;s always the Samson option for Trump; just lay it out there to the people and take down this whole crooked cancer of our republic. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDk8Ehx2FfA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDk8Ehx2FfA</a></p>
