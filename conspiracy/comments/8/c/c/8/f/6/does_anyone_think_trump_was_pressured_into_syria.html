       There was a fire at and at the same time, Mueller raided his attorneys' office for presumably all sorts of personal (what no doubt should be confidential) info of Trump's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intuitively these events seem connected. Anyone else think so and have info or  argument supporting this?

       I think it's a bait and switch, really. Furthermore, it's actually a win for Assad. No one died (that I've heard), and the buildings where chemical weapons were being produced by whoever (most likely terrorists funded by the West) are now gone, preventing future allegations and escalations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit like this makes me think Trump (and co) are actually outsmarting the Shadow Government. Very interesting times.

       He flushed $200M down the toilet, either someone is squeezing his balls or he is just dumber than fuck and can be manipulated by the last person that he spoke with, probably both. Any remaining shreds of support I still had for him have evaporated.

       Well, I disagree, and $200 million (not sure where you got that number) is like a drop in the bucket, in the grand scheme of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even a "supporter", I'm just looking at all of this objectively and neutrally. I suggest all do that, as well. Blindly supporting or hating (any thing/one), is quite retarded, imo.

       A drop in the bucket here and there and soon you have a full bucket. He was very critical of Obama wasting money in the same manner. I call out anybody that does stupid shit, or is a hypocrite, or lies to get elected. There will be a huge reckoning someday to correct the Massive federal debt, just wait and see. Eyes wide open here.

       How so? No one died, the buildings (and "weapons") are gone, Assad and Russia shot down a considerable amount of said missiles, and we are all no worse off (minus the terrorists producing the weapons). This strike hurt the West, more than it hurts Syria (and Russia).

       Since I firmly believe russiagate is bullshit, no... I don't think the theory holds any weight whatsoever.

       Even if the charges are BS, the investigation still has potential to be used for pressure and also might create other problems.

       Trump Tower has had two suspicious deaths in the past year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The “Suicide” was a message to Trump that he could be next.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fire was a message that they will burn his empire to the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       The powder sent to Don Jr. was a message saying that we will kill your fucking family too.

       Thank you for those links. The fire seems suspicious. So  does the toxic powdered letter, which is very recent (mid Feb this year). So where is the investigation for this? He really does seem to be against some awful mafioso; I hope those psychopaths get exposed for what they're doing. Jones says there's always the Samson option for Trump; just lay it out there to the people and take down this whole crooked cancer of our republic.
