<p>Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard</p>

<p>Zuck: Just ask.</p>

<p>Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS</p>

<p>[Redacted Friend&#39;s Name]: What? How&#39;d you manage that one?</p>

<p>Zuck: People just submitted it.</p>

<p>Zuck: I don&#39;t know why.</p>

<p>Zuck: They &quot;trust me&quot;</p>

<p>Zuck: <strong>Dumb fucks.</strong></p>

<p>The exchange does reveal that <strong>Facebook&#39;s aggressive attitude toward privacy may have begun early on</strong>. </p>

<p>An instant messenger exchange (from early 2004) Zuckerberg had with a college friend shortly after launching The Facebook in his dorm room — <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5">Well, These New Zuckerberg IMs Won&#39;t Help Facebook&#39;s Privacy Problems, Business Insider, Nicholas Carlson (13 May 2010)</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I don&#39;t like Zuckerberg and don&#39;t trust him at all. I&#39;m also Jewish. What is the big deal about wearing a kippah at a Jewish wedding? Everyone does this!</p>

<p>Also, many people on here think all Jews are alike and do/celebrate everything by the book. We don&#39;t. I&#39;ve never gotten drunk on Purim. I don&#39;t even celebrate it anymore. But when my children were little, we celebrated. We took the kids to the Jewish Community Center were they had always had a little carnival set up with little games to play - like throwing darts at balloons, etc.</p>

<p>My point being not all Jews are &quot;in the club&quot; and out to control the world. Some of us are normal, everyday people.</p>

<p>From all the comments I’ve seen, you seem like a sweetheart, Mrs. Gail:)</p>

<p>The Talmud seems so weird to me... a lot of its teachings seem incompatible with the teachings of the Old Testament/Torah.  </p>

<p>Deuteronomy 12:32 King James Version (KJV)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah! I believe it.</p>

<p>I never really knew how important the Talmud was to your everyday Jewish family. That’s cool to know. </p>

<p>It’s so funny, right as I’m typing this the Borat skit about “Jew Claws” came on tv. If you haven’t seen it it’s funny- here’s <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=d5McvSpcUIA">a clip.</a> 35 seconds </p>

If even a fraction of the stories I&#39;ve read here on the sub are true, (((they))) have eyes and ears everywhere and I just want (((them))) to know...I could really use a low interest loan right about now. Also I am a huge fan of Space Balls. Also, when Moses said, &quot;OH HEAR ME! The lord Jehovah has given unto you these fifteen... (drops stone tablet) Oy. Ten! Ten commandments for all to obey!&quot; pretty sure one of those commandments was &quot;Love thy neighbors.&quot; Not sure what religion my neighbors are all about, but I could really use a low interest loan...if you catch my drift...if not, no worries pretty sure (((they))) hear me, loud and clear...if not..

Okay, good call, I can&#39;t call you racist because of that. But you&#39;re still a cunt that hates a whole group of people and you&#39;re only explanation  for your hate is that you associate them with Arabs. Which would then make you racist.

    <div class="md"><p>I am not closed minded. I looked at both sides. I looked into Judaism and what they believe, and I look at what they do, and what others say about them, and I was more convinced by the opponents. If I am wrong I would love to be disproved, but I am afraid I have not received substantial proof that Jews really are good. I sympathise with the people of Palestine, and I see how they are being committed genocide against by the Jews. I sympathise with my own country, and I know as an American-Canadian that I do not want the same thing that happened to Palestine to happen to me. I know that they want to destroy the world and would kill me if they could. I know they want to do the same thing they did to Palestine to America and Canada and the rest of the world, and if I can, I will oppose them in any little way I can. I hate how they deceive the world and even my own relatives into going with them, and how they crave blood, and their devil worshipping, and I believe that Judaism was a good religion once, but today&#39;s Jews are evil.</p>

<p>For some of us we didn&#39;t win a country in a war - we were just brought here to work.  So as some peoples only home, it&#39;s a little offensive to me to have Jews with alternative homes keep trying to make the US into Israel and causing a lot of turbulence because of it.</p>

<p>Not to mention 3 decades of Israeli aggression in the middle east.  How many American children need to die so Jews can have a home country?</p>

BTW last I knew I still have an active MySpace account despite not touching it for 8 years, I got an email from it just two years ago</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One way websites in the past have generated buzz has been making a simple hoop or two to jump through to be able to use. When gmail started you had to have an invite, and a new account gave you a limited number of invite links to share. (My reference) When facebook started for I think 2 years you had to have an email address at specific colleges, then a .edu, then they opened it to any email address. People would find ways to register emails at edus (one in california comes to mind, they gave an account for application updates without having to finish an application) so they could have accounts without being in college anymore or never having gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Myspace screwed themselves by letting people edit their own html. The simple lack of consistency from one page to the next made navigating the various pages a nightmare. Its like if everyone just had a geocities page they made themselves as a facebook page for those of you who don&#39;t recall. Towards the end most peoples pages were a garish mess of odd colors and limited functionality. You could move, remove, or add modules and change the look of modules in ways that just plain broke the page. Now this was also a time when all the not so net savvy people were primed to embrace social media and having a simple clean interface made it so granny could join too was a big deal. Once that older generation got on it kind of sealed the deal for those people that wanted to use a social platform to keep up with <em>all</em> their friends and family.             </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Myspace was all that, or maybe its me and i just missed the boat because of my age. At the time i got interested in social media. There we&#39;re a bunch of LOCAL social websites popping up. And they actually became quitte successful. I believe each country at the time, had its populair locally made social network. I saw memes of this when facebook became the next best thing to be on.  </p>

<p>I think you are right about it being a &quot;cool&quot; millennial site if they are thought how to use its creative functions. </p>

<p>Im also quitte interested in the backend operation of the brand that was Myspace. Anyone got anymore info this, sorry this is a bit off-topic. Like MAJOR sponsors and things regarding online tracking, info appreciated.</p>

<p>I think zuckerberg is right saying dumb fucks. i haven&#39;t deleted my facebook, due to social anxiety, but haven&#39;t used it in a month. However am still active on other facebook daughter apps :( i can&#39;t stop.    </p>

<p>Facebook&#39;s days are numbered-  my kids are into everything &#39;cool&#39; and facebook is something their grandparents use.  My son creates his own chat servers that he and his friends use-  been doing it since 4th grade.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t ever install a FB app on a mobile device, and that is where the problems start for me-- as they are pushing more and more functionality to the apps-- by literally blocking it on mobile web platforms-- such as chat.  As a developer, I find it abhorrent that we need an app to access a website.  This is what responsive design is for.  So if you need an app, there has to be something nasty inside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, sir, I have no level of respect for that person whatsoever. Here&#39;s why. In a position of global exposure, wielding the might of an internationally effective social media platform, the gentleman has done the effective opposite of unifying mankind. That which you deem as conditions for respect, I see as normative authoritarian conformity. </p>

<p>I understand by all measures of conventional means, his vast wealth (just for him), his mainstream media exposure, his tech &#39;brilliance&#39;, his celebrity status (he has a movie all about him), his exciting corporate success is everything. It&#39;s evident these accomplishments are also reasons for your respect. At this time I&#39;m going to step out of line and state none of these are a means for respect of anyone. </p>

<p>As a culture, the reasons for even your &quot;grudging&quot; respect are skewed. Respect the person who shares, who means the best, has good intentions, works hard and openly. Who isnt paid in excess. Mr. Zuckerberg deserves no respect. Thanks for your reply, I do wish you all the best.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your reply, and I agree. Under our traditional framework of what should garner respect, he checks off a lot of boxes. We&#39;re told time and time again the perils of underestimated and not respecting that which we do not like. As such, we learn to respect callous business practice even if we don&#39;t like them because ... capitalism. </p>

<p>I think you&#39;re right to point out that just because someone has been a pioneer in a market space does not mean we need to grudgingly respect them. This framework is what leads to us thinking Hitler garners respect for being an effective leader and turning Germany into an unprecedented industrial machine. But you&#39;re right, if accomplishment is accompanied by exploitation or worse, respect is perhaps not the right word to attribute to this accomplishments. </p>
