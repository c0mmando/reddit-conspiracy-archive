        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You would have to be living under a rock at this point, to not see the blatant divide and conquer agenda of the ruling class that has been pushed particularly in the past decade. Events such as the Trayvon Martin shooting, the MSM&#39;s focus on police brutality toward African Americans, and the fixation on &quot;social justice&quot; and gender issues on social media. This is all being done by design, they are planting the seeds of societal tension. </p>

<p>The social engineers and the ruling class hope that they can stir up enough tension in the US, (this plan is also being implemented on a global scale), to lay the groundwork for social unrest and civil war when they orchestrate the economic collapse, which is ultimately the catalyst for their global government wet dream. </p>

<p>My question to you all is, what are we able to do, to reverse the effects of this programming and provocation of social hostility?</p>

Maybe it’s important for us to identify the stories in the media (as they happen) so our friends know, that those specific stories have a purpose of dividing the people.

    <div class="md"><p>The 1 difficulty with that is, and this is why many don’t stick themselves out to say hey this is meant to divide us... is that there’s always going to be certain people to say... hey you’re a conspiracy theorist.. you’re crazy.

<p>You have definitely hit on the most important aspect of uniting the masses; keeping the message non partisan. Provoking a curiosity of doubt regarding the establishment and their two party system. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, they have created &quot;psyops&quot; like Q, the storm and other distractions to funnel truth seekers back into the left right paradigm. We need to counter this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you what, as much as I hate sending people to vote for the lesser of two evils, I want to believe the founding fathers, had a good thing going with the framework.  I feel the lobbying thing got way out of hand, and that gives corporations too much leverage over law-makers.  Another thing, we should avoid mob rule.  That in itself kind of insinuates at least a bicameral legislature, or otherwise, we&#39;ll unite into a mob.  The main thing, we need to get out of comfort zones politically and start building pathways toward negotiation, or we&#39;re gonna have a bunch of Neo-nazi homophobes battling a bunch of phone-wielding zombies, and that is not good.  I repeat, not good.  The best way I can imagine, <strong>find individuals you admire who belong to groups you dislike strongly</strong>.  I won&#39;t give an example, since these explorations should remain confidential to protect participants from frivolous litigation.   </p>

<p>Healing is a process not an event (religious fundamentalists or anyone expecting change with little or no action) Also need to get rid of this mindset that some knowledge or technology is hidden from us for our own good and realize we&#39;re the ones we&#39;re keeping higher knowledge from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose of covering police brutality in the MSM is to portray it as an issue for blacks alone, and convince white people that they have nothing to fear from the police, it&#39;s just those darkies.  To deny that there is police brutality at all would be a grotesque stretch, so the MSM racializes the matter to convince the angry, ignorant white man to support the police state.  (That the police force and ruling class policy is racist is true, and Porky loves to have ignorant racists as shock troops, but the true dividing line is class, and the big racial questions in American history have been explicitly to uphold a racialized class system of slavery, wage-slavery, or serfdom through migrant labor that are legal unpersons, depending on the time and the population in question.)</p>

<p>When you hide behind white sensitivity and fail to think about race critically, you&#39;re serving the elites, you&#39;re serving Porky.  That&#39;s what they want you do, to buy into some ready-made ideology of white pride and entitlement where you blame everything on the darkies and never criticize the wider society in which you live.  It&#39;s the same with disseminating a culture which glorifies violence in the black community, among the other things rich people (universally white or Jewish people) do to keep black people under their thumb and in their designated places in the hierarchy.  (Of course, the elites and the professional class are largely exempt from racialized policies, and both get a double bonus when dumb people blame the darkies or whitey instead of the elites or the professional class.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the Google chat with Henry Kissinger. It&#39;s an eye opening look at how those on that side of the issue talk about and think about the world. Specifically the Westfalia Treaty. </p>

<p>Essentially, back in the day European leaders banded together to quell civil unrest in their countries. It was determined that it was best to take whatever power they could, but that the stopping point was civil unrest in their countries.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty much how countries in the new world order operate, and is why so much focus in first world countries is put into quashing civil movements and slowly taking power. Effectively, they believe any power not demanded by the population through civil unrest is theirs to take and that this is the best way to govern. </p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

We ALL do it. And we cannot cooperate if every encounter we have is a head to head ego smackdown. The elites PAY people to get along, we don&#39;t have that luxury so we need to reel in our ego when it comes to working with others. The divide and conquer tactic is not just used between groups of people...it is all of us...this is biblically referenced as the WAR OF ALL AGAINST ALL and the elites know this and feed it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Identity politics and arguing over social issues keeps people from focusing on the most important matter; the wealthy and powerful screwing every one else. You can live however you want, but the majority of people waste their time and energy on BS that doesn&#39;t matter. an almost ageless strategy; divide and conquer. We argue to bring each other down while behind closed doors in the top floors of skyscrapers and beach side vacation homes they laugh. </p>
