       Just an FYI for everyone, Mr. Garner wasn't selling ciggarrettes at the time of his death. He actually had broken up a fight which drew the cops to that location, and started harassing Eric about he prior run in with regards to selling smokes.  The MSM did a really good job of trying to make Eric out as breaking the law, which he wasn't at the time of his death.

       The way of restraining should be changed as it’s very dangerous to put someone in a prone position like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it should always be noted that you should resist arrest.

       But you have to be braking the law in order to be arrested/detained, which is why the media made up the fact he was selling ciggarrettes, so it some how seemed justified.

       It's a valid point, but his death was from then trying to arrest him for selling cigarettes, which according to all witnesses, he was breaking up a fight.  If you watch the original video, that's clear as well.  So what was the reason or probably cause to escalate the situation from detaining him to arresting?  That's where the problem for this situation was, and why accusing Eric of selling smokes at the time was so important.

       ["As the officers approached, Mr. Garner, 43, shouted at them to back off, according to two witnesses. He flailed his arms. He refused to be detained or frisked. He had been arrested twice already that year near the same spot, in March and May, charged both times with circumventing state tax law.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on that sweltering day in July, the officers left him with a warning.
      </p>
      <p>
       “It was the first time I ever saw them let him go,” said John McCrae, who watched the encounter near the park. Mr. Garner took that experience to heart, Mr. McCrae said.
      </p>
      <p>
       “You figure if it stops them the first time,” he said, “it might get them to stop the second time.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The next time came later that month: July 17, a Thursday.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/nyregion/eric-garner-police-chokehold-staten-island.html">
        One of the officers, Justin Damico, returned, accompanied by a different partner, Daniel Pantaleo. As they moved in, a cellphone camera held by a friend of Mr. Garner recorded the struggle that would soon be seen by millions."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If he didn't have cigarettes on him like he did when he was arrested previously he wouldn't have acted this way.  If he wasn't doing something illegal he wouldn't have acted this way, if he didn't act this way the police wouldn't have to try to restrain him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again don't resist arrest and don't do illegal things.

       The state gov taxes cigarette sales.  It’s against the law to sell untaxed cigarettes.  I’m not sure what you are trying to claim.

      </p>
      <p>
       This was an issue of cops dealing with the same guy over and over again for the same thing, hanging at the same spot, who had just escalated a situation a couple weeks prior that involved him flailing his arms wildly, who a friend said that this was an 'eye-opening experience' for Garner as it was the first time he was left alone, who most likely did the same thing when approached this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       That action right there is an instance in the situation that was a turning point and a key step in the ladder up this crisis hill.  Without that escalation of the situation, we never hear of Eric Garner.

       I'm not saying that the same thing can't be asked of the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a situation plays out much slower and there are multiple decisions that occur from both parties that have an impact on how the situation plays out.

      <p>
       I did not feel the need to clarify that, as I assumed you would have assumed that part.

      <p>
       So back to the argument:  Were there any decisions and then actions by Eric Garner that if a different decision were made the end result of a restraint and then choke hold would not have happened?

       Yup we live in America not Anarchy. You don't like the law that made it illegal to sell loosies elect some politicians that will change it. Simple as that other than that complaining that someone got force used on them that resulted in death for breaking a law that was put in place by democratically elected leaders is as moot as a point as there will ever be.

       She didn’t have anything to charge the cops with as they followed all relevant federal case law regarding use of force and state laws on use of force. They could maybe try for a fourth amendment violation of seizure of his persons but it wouldn’t stick based on prior precedence set by graham v Connor and reasonableness at the time of arrest. The court would see it that garners actions resulted in the use of force and a carotid restraint as it is called would not be unnecessary to a reasonable officer in the same situation.

       If you really wanted to be pissed or go after someone go after the greedy New York legislatures that made it illegal to sell loosies. They have had a hard on for tobacco taxes and will sick the police or troopers on anyone that circumvents giving money to the state (see senaca nation of Indians)

       Yup we live in America not Anarchy. You don't like the law that made it illegal to sell loosies elect some politicians that will change it. Simple as that other than that complaining that someone got force used on them that resulted in death for breaking a law that was put in place by democratically elected leaders is as moot as a point as there will ever be.

       We have a huge federal agency who has a huge part of its mission to in fact stop tobacco diversion.

       The state gov taxes cigarette sales.  It’s against the law to sell untaxed cigarettes.  I’m not sure what you are trying to claim.

       But resisting arrest isn’t really the time to try to make a constitutional legality argument of the law your breaking.
