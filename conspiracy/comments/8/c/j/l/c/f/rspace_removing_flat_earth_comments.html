       Another trend I'm noticing is I get banned from certain subreddits simply for subscribing or participating to subs like r/conspiracy. Is this what it's come to...?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm wondering as I get older, were people always like this? I'm not sure they were... But maybe I just wasn't paying attention.

       R/Negareddit is definitely one that does, some other political subs that have a decidedly left leaning persuasion seem more likely to ban.

       Which is funny, because this sub has Lefties too. Being on r/conspiracy doesn't make one a Conservative. In fact, I see a lot of die hard Lefties on this board. Personally, I align more with Anarcho-syndicalism/socialism myself.

       The whole thing seems very anti internet. And it's not just mods, it's users who will go into your post history and try to frame an argument around your post history. It's weird and wormy behavior

       Yeah, it is, in my opinion, against the spirit of the internet. Personally, I welcome people to dig through my history and try and frame me for something...I always challenge these fools to do so whenever they call me a bot or a shill, but no one ever takes me up on the challenge :(

       What's stopping them from removing other opinions they don't agree with? I don't have to agree an idea or opinion to support people's right to express it. That's how freedom of expression is supposed to work. If you don't like something said, downvote and move on. That's the marketplace of ideas. Honestly, its like you either have a little goldfish brain, or this is a gag, lol.

       Why? FE is a pretty clear psyop to get people to waste effort on nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing about the FE makes any sense and anyone who spends andy mount of time researching it knows the Earth is as flat as 2+2=5

      <p>
       Its demonstrably wrong and to believe in it is to actively use double think. You have to literally ignore the things you can see with your own eyes to believe in FE&gt;

       In a science based sub, it makes no sense to dilute real content with unscientific BS.

       Pretending
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       viewpoints are equal only serves to prop up bullshit at the expense of facts. Allowing legitimate debate is one thing, giving time to idiots and pretending their viewpoint is worthy of consideration is another. There are lots of arguments that do not deserve consideration and that should be dismissed out-of-hand. All you do is legitimize a blatantly false idea.

       It also makes no sense to delete comments. If a discussion is happening, then let the discussion happen. Maybe more people on the opposing side will have their questions answered. Besides, the scientific method doesn't deem some ideas stupid or not worthy of consideration. It's only biased people who do that. Not very scientific if you ask me. Nobody is asking you to study every theory out there but if someone else wants to start a discussion about a particular theory, why should certain topics be banned?

       for example: "You can not prove to me you are a real person who experiences emotion, and not simply a figment of my imagination"

       This statement cannot be proven false, and it's certainly not worthy of discussion or consideration. It might be fun in a philosophy class, but it has no business in a pseudo-scientific subreddit, and certainly not worthy of consideration in anything outside of sophistic circlejerking.

       Not all arguments are worth discussion, some can be dismissed out of hand, and taking time to refute them simply gives them a false air of legitimacy.

       It doesn't matter if you think its worth discussing or not. Thankfully you are not the arbiter of conversation. The topic I made is about mods removing comments they don't like. I even made a post shortly after because of a similar circumstance on the same sub. Try to keep up.

       Maybe in a few years reddit will just be like 9gag or wherever the hell you can from and r/science will filled with rage comics just the way you like it. Oh wait, they dont allow jokes there, either...

       Proper scientific theory requires following the Scientific Method,which FE can't stand up to.  I don't see why we would ban it on a fun subreddit like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       , but I do see why
       <a href="/r/science">

       Not at all, but it does provide a legitimate platform from which to call out all of the fools who insist that unscientifically derived facts are as valid as those which meet the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science isn't about opinions it is about using facts derived from repeatable experiments that have a large enough scope and sample size to fully encompass a problem or a challenge.

       Flat earth theory fails that. As soon as you fly high enough above the earth...boom you see the blue marble.

       If you can't show any proof whatsoever to back up your assertion then how can it be easily disproved? Also, I'm an engineer who works with satellites on a daily basis. You're going to have to show me something extraordinary to make me question my knowledge of orbit mechanics, global positioning and navigation, SatBeams, and telecommunications

       The earth is flat and "outer space" doesn't exist.  I'm sure you can figure out how you have been deceived if you put your mind to it.  If you refuse to try to figure it out then that's your decision.  I suggested you start with the moon landing hoax.  It seems to me that you aren't willing to question your own beliefs.  I can't question your personal beliefs and biases for you.  Some things in life we have to do ourselves.

       I write simulations and mathematical models that require the earth to be round and for there to be satellites in space exactly where I expect them to be. The US military uses the software I work on to coordinate their tactical network. Who exactly do you think is deceiving me and how?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth were flat, nothing I've been doing all day today would have worked. It's not about whether I'm being "deceived", it's about the fact that I can conclusively prove that the Earth is round by sheer virtue of the fact that the things I write work and are used every day in the field. I have a list of satellites I can send data to at any given time and I can view the responses. I calculate the angle where I need to point my transmitter based on a round earth model.

       I've looked into flat earth and I have never seen a flat-earther make a single assertion backed up with any experimental evidence

       That's not why I'm challenging you here. I'm asking you why does my job exist at all? How would it even be possible for the stuff I work on to be fake? I know precisely how every piece of comms equipment I use works. I have access to schematics and data sheets that tell me exactly where each component goes and what it does. Literally none of it could work at all on a flat earth. So how and why do I have a job?

       You're not hearing me. My job exists because the US Army needs a tactical network. That tactical network uses both commercial and USG satellites to relay signals around the world. If the earth were flat none of this would be necessary. Why would the government spend billions of dollars to build a less efficient communications network than it already has?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the equipment I use is extremely specialized. It has one purpose and was custom built specifically to fulfill that purpose. At some point, someone on the chain has to know that they are building a lie. Are you saying there's a secret underground group of thousands of engineers who are solely responsible for making equipment that looks like it does one thing while actually doing another. And they have to be so good at it that other engineers can't look at their work and see that something doesn't add up? You do know that is literally impossible, right?

       Yes.  The space shuttle and the ISS are perfect examples.  My friend's old man believes he worked on the camera that was going on a satellite.  All he really knows is he worked on a camera someone told him was going to be on a satellite.  The people in the know which are part of the Masons and other secret societies are a small number.  They are happy to blow hundreds of millions on fake jobs and projects to keep the illusion going.  This way those people actually support and even vehemently defend the lies without even knowing as you are doing now.

       You're still not understanding what I'm saying, which is really not surprising. Let me break it down syllogistically for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) I know precisely what the equipment I interact with is supposed to do
      </p>
      <p>
       B) By all appearances, it is doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing
      </p>
      <p>
       C) If the Earth were flat or space didn't exist or satellites weren't real, it would not be able to do what it is supposed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) There are only two possible conclusions:
  1) Space is real and satellites are where they are supposed to be
  2) Space is fake, satellites are fake, and someone is making this equipment to be functional but to appear that it is doing something entirely different than what it is actually doing while also somehow disguising this trickery to the point that no expert in the world has ever been able to see through the illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which sounds more likely to you?

While he won't go so far as FE, and is generally accepting of technology - though he claims that it's all been invented by the Military and is just being doled out little by little.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is more of the mindset that a small cabal of a few hundred people are controlling all of geopolitics. I tried to use the "fake jobs" argument (70,000 people work for the US State Department, alone), but as you see, many people aren't interested in reason or logic.

       I did. Years ago. I argued for the flat earth in a persuasive speech in high school after picking up a book on the subject because I thought it was good for a laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I looked again recently because I noticed it had started gaining popularity again. Exactly the same material. No advancement, still no evidence. Every video I've seen on YouTube on the subject contains nothing that wasn't already being used by flat earthers more than 25 years ago. Their "evidence" can be summed up something like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Water always finds its level (without defining what "level" means or providing any evidence to back up this assertion)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The horizon is always at eye level (without bothering to do the calculations about how much of a drop should be expected at high altitudes or even confirming this observation through experimentation)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You can sometimes see things that should be obscured by the horizon (without bothering to explain why you can't ALWAYS see these things, why this only happens over bodies of water on cool days, or why atmospheric refraction isn't a good enough explanation)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pilots don't see the curvature (again, without bothering to do the calculations regarding exactly how much curvature you should be seeing at 40,000 ft. Hint: it's not much)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         something something "Bible"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         something something "NASA"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's honest super tedious and when pressed for better explanations for their crackpot theories the only answers they ever give are "you just have to look into it for yourself" or "just look around you" or some other such nonsense. Honestly, until they can present some sort of coherent argument, flat earthers should be ridiculed and ostracized mercilessly because they are basically a cult

       What bothers me is that flat earthers are being propped up as though they represent a legitimate position when they don't. Every time a flat earther gets to speak without being chastised, it empowers them and acts as confirmation bias for any other idiots in the audience. It also enables idiots who believe in this dumb shit to believe in other dumb shit, which is how you end up with things like Donald Trump as your president

       They should remove that shit here too. The vast amount of data and math one would need to get over to refute our known shape of the world is staggering. Well beyond the comprehension of any serious FE proponent. (Most are not serious)
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       believe flat earth you are gullible and misguided. And probably intelligence deprived.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe in flat earth as a method to resist convention and to actually check stuff for yourself then you're all good to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Safest bet is to keep the stuff in your own subs. There are a few that welcome garbage posts.

       Many look at the lizard people thing as a metaphor. And without cutting on open we may never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       However this world has been measured by hand. The little tricks fe'ers do are only successful in the dim witted. 
Seriously. The north south east west runway conundrum? It ain't that tricky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crepuscular rays? It probably would blow some minds to know those are actually parallel. (And ignore anticrepuscular ones!)

      <p>
       The gyroscopes on planes? Weak and ignorant.

       I could go on and on but it's such a boring waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time has come for FE to dry up and blow away, like most other shit does.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldnt doubt if Ickes income was waning he would be all over flat earth for a buck. So lizards ain't your best example. Flat earth is just wrong. Being science it is well certain that it is wrong too.
