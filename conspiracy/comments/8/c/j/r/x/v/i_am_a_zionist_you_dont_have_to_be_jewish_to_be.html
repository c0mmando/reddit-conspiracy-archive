       That's what you think based on media lies and from what you've been brainwashed to think. They're evil. Every single one of them. They would never let a person who was not establishment be president. That's something everyone needs to come to terms with. Mike Pence is zionist and Trump is close friends with Netanyahu who is of course zionist, not only that Trump's son in law Jared Kushner led a foundation which funded illegal settlements in Israel. The people have been deceived again, this is all theatre. Trump wasn't anti establishment, he is the establishment, look at his cabinet and their connection with Rothschild and Rockefellar, look at his son in law and look at Trump himself. Obama who was allegedly against Israel may not have had tea and cupcakes with him but even when they had their disagreements, funding to Israel still continued and arms deals still continued.

       I think you should gain a little perspective. Questioning in is a beautiful thing, and you should never stop, but I think the truth is a little more simple than you'd like to admit. Consider that Israel is the ONLY democracy in the middle east, and is the land of Jews, who have been murdered throughout history, and also who have strong familial and religious bonds to one another, and exist to protect each other as a family. Jews have strong belief in schooling and hard work, which is why a lot of jews end up being doctors and lawyers and in positions of wealth and power. That being said, when you have the only democracy in a part of the world that is run by evil murderous dictators, and then that democracy also is home to a type of person (jewish) that are deeply deeply HATED in that same region, then you have a country that constantly needs protection. America donates so much to Israel because their country economy or GDP isn't big enough to provide themselves with the funding they need to survive. So America gives them billions of dollars so they can protect themselves and aren't obliterated by the surrounding countries who would not only love to see Israel free of Jews, but they'd love to acquire it as their own religious homeland.

       They need protection from whom exactly?  Palestinians throwing rocks? It's actually Israel who break the ceasefire every time there is one, Iran may hate Israel however they aren't going to war with Israel anytime soon and nor is their military advanced enough to take on Israel. Israel is not a free land if you're Arab, despite what you hear in the media. Israel is hell if you're Arab or if you're Palestinian. Israel doesn't need US aid, they have a capable military, a good economy and most citizens have served in the army.

       Well, I have friends that are jewish and born and raised in Israel. I also have friends who are American jews and lived in israel for college. And though I've heard bad stuff about Israel from the people themselves, it seems like at the end of the day the problems are the warmongering Netenyahu and the surrounding countries themselves.

       I think there is no real difference between the two. The Jew will always choose to support the Zionist over a goy every time, so they are basically part of the Zionist system.

       yea see you can't separate the People of Israel as the Torah spoke vs this perverted state of Israel, which the idea of is condemned in actual Judaism. you hang around too many reforms, find the orthodox ones. You're perception is disorted by the zionists you speak of

       I say they are all interlinked. Some closely, some loosely. But, in the end, they will support another Jew over a goy. Every time.

       false lol you've never walked into a synagogue and met these people have you? there's a few that are actually aware of the horrid atrocities being committed over in the middle east by these zionists, and they in no way shape or form support them, and would rather see ISIS defeated by ANY force, whether russian, German, American or whomever

       They do not support them, but they send money to their grandson David in Israel because he wants to go to Uni. They are interlinked.

       lol learn your rights. The U.S is a corporation as defined within the U.S. statutes at large. You have the right to NOT do business with any corporation. And also you don't know that your a government official due to your status as a federal but not constitional citizen. Look into all this bud, I know this government isn't gaining anything from me and you should educate yourself so they don't from you either.

       They can be atheist or even Muslim. Islam forbids zionism and yet we have Muslim leaders who can be described as zionists. The vast majority of zionists are either Satanists or atheist.
