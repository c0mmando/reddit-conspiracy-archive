<p>That&#39;s what you think based on media lies and from what you&#39;ve been brainwashed to think. They&#39;re evil. Every single one of them. They would never let a person who was not establishment be president. That&#39;s something everyone needs to come to terms with. Mike Pence is zionist and Trump is close friends with Netanyahu who is of course zionist, not only that Trump&#39;s son in law Jared Kushner led a foundation which funded illegal settlements in Israel. The people have been deceived again, this is all theatre. Trump wasn&#39;t anti establishment, he is the establishment, look at his cabinet and their connection with Rothschild and Rockefellar, look at his son in law and look at Trump himself. Obama who was allegedly against Israel may not have had tea and cupcakes with him but even when they had their disagreements, funding to Israel still continued and arms deals still continued. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should gain a little perspective. Questioning in is a beautiful thing, and you should never stop, but I think the truth is a little more simple than you&#39;d like to admit. Consider that Israel is the ONLY democracy in the middle east, and is the land of Jews, who have been murdered throughout history, and also who have strong familial and religious bonds to one another, and exist to protect each other as a family. Jews have strong belief in schooling and hard work, which is why a lot of jews end up being doctors and lawyers and in positions of wealth and power. That being said, when you have the only democracy in a part of the world that is run by evil murderous dictators, and then that democracy also is home to a type of person (jewish) that are deeply deeply HATED in that same region, then you have a country that constantly needs protection. America donates so much to Israel because their country economy or GDP isn&#39;t big enough to provide themselves with the funding they need to survive. So America gives them billions of dollars so they can protect themselves and aren&#39;t obliterated by the surrounding countries who would not only love to see Israel free of Jews, but they&#39;d love to acquire it as their own religious homeland. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They need protection from whom exactly?  Palestinians throwing rocks? It&#39;s actually Israel who break the ceasefire every time there is one, Iran may hate Israel however they aren&#39;t going to war with Israel anytime soon and nor is their military advanced enough to take on Israel. Israel is not a free land if you&#39;re Arab, despite what you hear in the media. Israel is hell if you&#39;re Arab or if you&#39;re Palestinian. Israel doesn&#39;t need US aid, they have a capable military, a good economy and most citizens have served in the army. </p>
