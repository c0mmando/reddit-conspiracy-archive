        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-04-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/dicedtomatoes55.html">dicedtomatoes55</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I start, I just want to say that I usually post about topics in v/pizzagate or r/conspiracy that have a little more substance to their name than this one, but being as close as this is to my own family, it&#39;s certainly creeping me out a little and I&#39;d just like to get everyone else&#39;s opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>For this reason, if the mods deem this topic or inquiry unworthy for any reason, delete it and I&#39;ll someway find an answer elsewhere.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>So first of all as a foundation, obviously I think we&#39;ve all read the podesta emails by now and have seen that children are referred to as pizza.</p>

<p>Just in case: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55930">Here&#39;s one email</a>, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/35053">Here&#39;s another(this one the reference is midway through)</a>, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/22033">Here&#39;s a third</a>, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/10037">and don&#39;t forget the best know one because it has a picture</a></p>

<p>So that&#39;s pretty much covered.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read online about pedophilia symbols being cast out so much that citizens not in any sort of high ranking status can easily see them but I haven&#39;t been one myself. Except for today. My nephews came over this afternoon for the first time in a while, we live in different states so that&#39;s why. One of them (the younger one mind you) out of the blue, fresh off of playing with his star wars figures starts singing &quot;I am a pizza&quot;. So being innocent enough, I ask my sister where he got this song from and she says that he learned it in school. Without knowing anything about pizzagate. she also says in the same breath that it&#39;s part of the curriculum to learn this and a bunch of other songs. Right there, I tried my hardest not to freeze like a statue.</p>

<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1464751">Because I read about this type of thing a while ago. This is a link to a thread on v/pizzagate about NYC Mayor Bill de blasio reading a book to a bunch of kids at a Queens Library about a secret pizza party.</a></p>

<p>Just one line was enough for me to find the whole song from a search on Google. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjzvF5Nb0c4">Here&#39;s the song</a>. 
I&#39;ll admit I was going to try and be devil&#39;s advocate by saying that the lyrics weren&#39;t terrible but given a moment to really think about this, we have phrases like: <em>&quot;Please take me home!&quot;</em> and the last few lines are a bit odd when the rest of the song has a happy, go lucky ring to it.</p>

<p><em>&quot;I am a pizza, dropped on the ground. I was a pizza, I was the best. I was a pizza, now I&#39;m a mess!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Now that&#39;s all I have in actual evidence. The podesta emails have been on the internet as long as pizzagate emerged and the &quot;I Am A Pizza&quot; song has  been on youtube since 2013. The next thing I&#39;m going to do is make two leaps of faith so after reading what you have and you don&#39;t think I have a case, the following insights may make you think of me even weirder or actually see some truth in what I&#39;m saying:</p>

<p>--  We can take a small leap and say that the last few lyrics are about the child who was the pizza and is now a mess because of the physical and psychological abuse they have gone through being used and disposed of by high ranking officials and whoever else.</p>

<p>--  My second leap is an even bigger one. It doesn&#39;t help that the last picture used in the video is of a pizza with a frowny face that has red blotches all over it and (on what seems to be?) the floor in front of it. I mean the pizza does have so many toppings on it, why couldn&#39;t the drawer just add a few of those to the sauce stains on the floor as well? It looks mighty suspicious (as in similar) to something else and it just pains me to say it, so I&#39;m not, but I think you know what it could be if you&#39;ve read this far.</p>

<p>If that wasn&#39;t enough, it gets even creepier when you think about what&#39;s actually happening: A whole class of five year olds singing or you might as well, say (because it is a synonym after all) chanting: &quot;I am a pizza.&quot;  With all that we know, I don&#39;t know about you but I get a little bit of a chill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I can see why you posted this. It does seem creepy. But then again, it could be totally innocent and just a cute children&#39;s song.</p>

<p>Your last paragraph about them all singing/chanting &quot;I am a pizza&quot; kind of stuck out with me. I&#39;m a firm believer that our thoughts and words have power. So a whole group chanting the same thing really has power, in my opinion. Makes me think about this in a whole different way - like other people realize this too.</p>

<p>Then again, could be totally innocent, like the song I used to sing, &quot;I&#39;m a little teapot, short and stout.&quot;</p>
