    <div class="md"><p>So the 40k troops that put in a claim saying their lives were harmed by Agent Orange don&#39;t matter? Almost as many US troops (let alone civilians and other people) were harmed by agent orange than actually died in the vietnam war. What lives must have been saved.</p>

<em>List of 10 times US used chemical weapons. Doesn’t anyone else find this hypocrisy astounding?</em></p>

<p>Actual Article title?
<em>10 Chemical Weapons Attacks Washington Doesn&#39;t Want You to Talk About</em></p>

<p>Hmm I wonder if it actually lists ten times the US used chemical weapons? Let&#39;s see...</p>

<ol>
<li>Israel</li>
</ol>

<p>&amp;nbsp</p>

<ol>
<li>Iraq/Saddam Hussein</li>
</ol>

<p>&amp;nbsp</p>

<ol>
<li>Tear Gas (if tear gas counts then this list should be thousands of entries long)</li>
</ol>

<p>&amp;nbsp</p>

<ol>
<li>Tear Gas again for some reason. I guess the first entry for police use of tear gas wasn&#39;t supposed to stand-in for all uses ever. Maybe police have only ever used tear gas twice?</li>
</ol>

<p>&amp;nbsp</p>

<ol>
<li>Depleted Uranium, while toxic, is not deployed for it&#39;s toxic effects.</li>
</ol>

<p>&amp;nbsp</p>

<ol>
<li>Napalm isn&#39;t a chemical weapon</li>
</ol>

<p>&amp;nbsp</p>

<ol>
<li>Nuclear weapons aren&#39;t chemical weapons either</li>
</ol>

<p>&amp;nbsp</p>

<p>If you want to try to change people&#39;s minds, try engaging in a conversation in good faith. If you open by blatantly misrepresenting something, it turns off people who don&#39;t already agree with you. There&#39;s a whole host of criticisms of US foreign policy and military actions to be made that don&#39;t require lying. The US <em>actually used</em> chemical weapons in a completely unambiguous way during WWI, and whether or not that matters with regard to the rightness of her actions now is genuinely an issue that can be debated, but neither this article nor the OP even bothers to bring that up. Heck, this post doesn&#39;t even claim there&#39;s a conspiracy, it&#39;s just a critique of America without bothering to be accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re not counting depleted uranium regardless of how much was dropped? That’s interesting </p>

<p>You left out or didn’t mention Vietnam I think 
The effects of AO are still felt to this day </p>

<p>You also conveniently left out that Saddam was sold chemical weapons by the US, UK And France 
Those are the countries now ‘punishing’ Assad for using chemical weapons

    <div class="md"><p>If it makes you feel any better, you can imagine I included Agent Orange on the list because, like depleted uranium, it wasn&#39;t being used for it&#39;s toxic effects on humans. Alternately, you can imagine that I didn&#39;t include depleted uranium on the list because while it wasn&#39;t being used for it&#39;s toxic effects on humans, much like Agent Orange the devastating health effects were (or in the case of AO, should have been) known.

<p>Not sure what your assessment is here 
Do you accept that US used chemical weapons repeatedly throughout the 20th century against civilians or you don&#39;t?
Sounds like you&#39;re pivoting a between multiple grey areas. 
I don&#39;t think theres a single historian or academic alive who would or could deny the absurd hypocrisy of illegal US interventions and wars particularly when the reason given is another regimes use of chemical weapons.
Not only did the US sell chemical weapons to dictators but they also popped up these dictators when it suited them; additionally they directly fired and used chemical weapons on the battlefield themselves. Now to subsequently attempt a moral high ground on that very issue must list as the most compete and beautiful personification of successful propaganda ever attempted.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I&#39;m genuinely curious. Could you go back to my first response, and highlight for me what part of the last paragraph is confusing you? I feel like I was fairly clear in what I was saying, but to state it more plainly: The OP lied. If he wants to convince somebody of his point of view, blatantly lying is a bad way to start, because once somebody knows that you will lie to try to prove your point, they&#39;re not inclined to take you at your word about anything. If he wants to criticize US foreign policy, he should do so without lying.</p>

<p>As for the rest of what you said... I&#39;m just not interested in defending US military or foreign policy decisions that I don&#39;t agree with just so you can have someone to argue with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really sad and a little pathetic at best pedantic - You want to or would rather argue a moot point re the the literalness of OP&#39;s title rather the overarching point about the hypocrisy of US - which is after all, as everyone who sees this post understands, the actual <strong>point</strong> of the OP&#39;s post. </p>

<p>I get it the OP wasn&#39;t literal. He said the US when he should have times the US either &#39;did&#39;, &#39;enabled&#39;, &#39;supported&#39; or &#39;turned a blind to&#39; eye to. 
So lets say you are emphatically correct in your literalness. 
Agreed and accepted. </p>

<p>Now back to the point and on topic
Do you think the US are hypocrites when it comes to the use of chemical for reasons stated above? 
Do you think they have nay right to police the world given their historical record?</p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s acceptable to use chemical weapons against civilians? If not, do you believe it&#39;s acceptable to use violence to try to stop them? That&#39;s the question at the heart of this. The moral purity of an actor doesn&#39;t determine whether a present action is just. If OJ Simpson killed someone while preventing a rape, I wouldn&#39;t base my opinion of whether it was right to do so on whether I believe he killed Nicole.</p>

<p>Ok can you clarify. Who do you think should stop who?
Should the world stop the US going to war again? They&#39;ll do it anyway and illegally right? Is this who should intervene? The US?<br/>
1 million dead in Iraq. Tens of thousands dead in Libya, ditto Afghanistan (which was also an illegal war) 
I think that is what is at the core of this. Who are the west to impose their morals on the middle east considering its horrific recent record?

<p>I still don&#39;t think you&#39;ve managed to grasp the element of absurd hypocrisy as is the intention of the post - it&#39;s not that you can just dismiss it on a technicality. It is still true. We can&#39;t rewrite history. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say absolutely but the intentions of the party intervening have to effectively pure with no other motive other than justice and ultimately peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The core of this is that OP made a decent post about an important issue but tainted it by misrepresenting the article. That was the original complaint in the top comment of this thread, but somehow it got derailed into discussing the merits of the post, because somehow it was inferred that they were refuted herb they were not.</p>

<p>How hard would it have been to find a few examples of actual US chemical warfare and use those to illustrate the point rather than misrepresenting the aforementioned article?</p>

<p>Maybe I’m off base here, but that’s what I got from this thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re not off base, that was exactly my point, that OP starting the entire post by lying hurts his argument. This other guy seems like he wants to have a different argument with me but is running into the problem that I don&#39;t really disagree with him</p>

<p>Bombs kill one person. Chemicals can kill and maim people for generations. </p>

<p>It&#39;s ok to admit the US Government uses chemical warfare like dictatorship regimes also do. It makes us hypocrites, but that&#39;s it. Get over it. </p>
