       By Chris Kanthan
      </p>
      <p>
       Disneyland is the Happiest Place on Earth! Millions of families visit the theme park every year to enjoy the magical place of rides, spectacular shows and cheerful cartoon figures. Everything is clean, perfect and joyful. Unless … you realize that Cinderella might actually be homeless. That’s right, 10% of Disneyland’s employees are actually homeless, many more are on food stamps, and 75% struggle to make ends meet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this ring familiar? Think of America. Behind the façade of being the greatest country on Earth with the largest GDP and the wealthiest billionaires, there are tens of millions of Americans who are left behind just like Disney’s employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       This neo-feudalistic model isn’t isolated to Disney or Walmart, it’s systemic. For example, the bus driver at Apple – which has $280 billion in cash – is forced to sleep in a van because he can’t afford the Silicon Valley rent; Facebook’s cafeteria workers live in a garage; and thousands of American Airlines’ employees are forced to depend on food stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is being eaten alive by corporate greed; and Disneyland has been taken over by Scrooge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s look at some Disney Inc. statistics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total profit per year: $9 billion
      </p>
      <p>
       Total employees: 200,000
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that the profit reflects what’s left after all the expenses, including the salaries, have been paid. So, in a utopian world, the Disney management will do the math ($9 billion / 200,000 = $45,000) and send a check for $45K to every employee, Mickey included. That kind of profit-sharing would really make Disneyland the happiest place on Earth. Does that happen? No way!
      </p>
      <p>
       Does Cinderella get a check for perhaps $20K, $10K, $5K or even $1K? Nope, nope, nope, nope. Cinderella gets nada, zero, zilch. She should be content with the $12/hour salary and must smile happily for the kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Disneyland, Cinderella never gets to meet her prince.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disney’s CEO gets paid $46 million a year, which translates to $23,000 an hour. Imagine Disney’s CEO coming to work on Jan 2nd. He wishes a few people “happy new year,” orders coffee, sits on his desk, makes a few phone calls … and he has already made more money than what Ariel would make during the rest of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the CEO should get paid more, but does he deserve a salary that’s equivalent to 2,000 Disney employees? If the CEO doesn’t show up for work for a day, Disneyland will continue running. If 2,000 employees take a day off, the park would be shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1960s, the CEO-to-worker salary ratio was 25. Today it’s often 600 or more, sometimes even more than 1000 (for example, at Walmart). Much of the executive compensation comes in the form of stock options and bonuses based on stock performance. In a rational and unrigged world, the CEOs would increase their revenues and profits to get bonuses. Not anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the CEOs simply use a no-brainer solution to boost the stock prices – it’s called stock buybacks or share repurchases. This involves a firm using corporate profits (or even borrowed money) to buy its own stocks. BTW, this used to be illegal until the 1980s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 2007, US corporations have spent trillions of dollars on stock buybacks. In 2018 alone, they will spend$800 billion on this financial engineering tool (which has also led to a massive stock market bubble). They won’t use the billions to hire Americans, boost wages or innovate new products. Instead, the CEOs will buy yachts and tell you that Chinese or Mexicans stole your jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do the low-wage employees of Disneyland get any shares or stock options? A silly question, indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus we have a situation where American employers ruthlessly exploit American workers. This isn’t a good model for a country. China and Mexico don’t make us poor; predatory capitalism does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paying good wages to hardworking employees is not socialism or communism. Henry Ford understood this when he more than doubled the wages of his workers in 1914.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, hundred years later, maximizing profit has become a fundamentalist dogma. You can imagine a conversation among the factory-farming executives:
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy #1: Why the heck are these chickens roaming out in the farms? We would save so much money if we lock them up in cages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy #2: Brilliant idea! Let’s lock up five chickens in a cage. We will save more. More is always better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy #3: I really don’t understand why we feed them expensive salads and healthy stuff. Let’s feed them cheap GMO corn and GMO soy from my friends at Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy #4: Experts tell me that if we give them caffeine and anti-depressants, the chickens will stay awake longer, eat more, and get fatter.
      </p>
      <p>

Guy #5: And when they get sick, load them up with antibiotics and steroids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy #5: These stupid chickens are also so small. Let’s drug them with some growth hormones. I am getting a lot of pressure from the private equity funds about profits per chicken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart from being inhumane and psychopathic, this system forgets or ignores the fact that we have to eat these chickens. Sick chicken = sick people. Call it Karma or “revenge of the chickens.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, poor workers = poor country. And you can imagine a similar conversation among corporate executives regarding workers – “cut their wages and benefits”, “make them work overtime”, “hire part-time employees rather than full-time” and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can’t grow the economy if American workers don’t get paid enough, especially by profitable multi-billion dollar corporations. 2/3rd of our GDP is based on consumer spending. It’s no wonder that in the last ten years, the US economy cumulatively grew only by a dismal 35%. Compare that to China, which grew by an astounding 200% during that same period.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it’s not a coincidence that China’s average wages have more than doubled in the same period.

       Housing within 30 minutes of Google Bus Driver's job is rough.  $750/mo for a room in a house, minimum, outside weird circumstances (live-in aide, yardwork, etc).  A studio in SF or Silicon Valley is waaaaaay outside Google Bus Driver reach unless s/he has rent control (and therefore has been in place prior to getting Google Bus Driver job).
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, Google Bus Driver might be able to swing a studio, but no landlord will rent to him/her.

       Actually Disney treats their employees quite well. Many of them are college kids and Disney offers quite a lot of co-op employment during the summer, spring and winter. Not only are the co-op employees paid well, they also receive full room and board and a food allowance while employed.

       Friend 1. Cosmetology student employed for the bippityboppity boutique. Worked the entire summer, full room and board and made 15$ an hour

       Friend 2. Was a fairy godmother, worked both over spring and winter breaks, full room and board

       Friend 3. Was one of the Cinderellas, worked summer and fall for 3 years. Same deal on the room and board etc etc
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't speak to how their typical full time adult employees are treated but their internships are pretty great, which most of their employees are seasonal to some extent.

       You do know that they take portions of that our of salary, right? I've had multiple friends (college friends, mind you) that worked as characters and servers at restaurants there. Disney pays ~on par with what your average college student would make at any job above fast food/retail. But they take out money for room and board, food, transportation, etc. Then you dive into how the employees are treated by the customers AND management, combined with 12 hour days (on average) 6 days a week? C'mon guy, it's not a great place to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really don't believe me hit up GlassDoor and type in "Disney
       <em>
        any job but CEO/Upper Management
       </em>
       " almost all of them have the same exact ratings (shilled much?) of 3.7 stars, but it does fluctuate between 3.5 and 3.9 if you scroll all the way through the dozens of pages. $9-$12 MAXIMUM for general labor force.

       Interesting post but I dislike this comparison to China. It's obvious that an established, first world nation is going to have its growth taper off while China is still a growing, booming country and has far more room to grow.

       Capitalism is a Marxist word, so I generally avoid it, because of its ambiguity. If the banker who bribes government to get a license to counterfeit money is a capitalist, then I agree "capitalism" is bad (personally I call it socialism, but that's just a sound).
      </p>
      <p>
       And indeed, if a "capitalist" country has a centrally-planned economy, ubiquitous corporate welfare, lobbyists in every corner of government, a plethoric military-industrial complex, negative interest rates, more regulation than anywhere in the world, the most undecipherable laws in human history, and is ruled in secrecy by an unaccountable oligarchy, then "capitalism" is bad. But then it has nothing to do with economic freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I’ll agree with you on this: liberty leads to prosperity, prosperity produces complacency, and complacency causes tyranny. I’m not sure how to avoid this vicious cycle. Perhaps strong spiritual grounding, and placing
       <em>
        morality
       </em>
       always ahead of
       <em>
        utility

       Capitalism (or as you insist on calling it, the "free" market) necessarily means the big bad bankers can and will do what they do.  There isn't a "good capitalism" where everything is sunshine and roses, and there never was.  You don't need Marx to tell you that, nor was Marx the only social critic who pointed out the problems of the market system and political economy.
      </p>

       An ideological commitment to the market is a recent, newfangled thing, that specifically came to being as a reaction to Marxism and the socialists.  I don't know why people are religious believers in the market, or prosperity gospel, or similar nonsense, but the meme is strong despite how easy it is to demonstrate the stupidity of the market.  It's a goddamn cargo cult.

       It's not about the "market" it is about liberty, economic or otherwise. Non-coercion, or the non-initiation of violence by the State.

       The big bad banker precisely
       <em>

       on the big government to give him

       to commit his crimes. Without a plethoric government, you wouldn't have morbidly desctructive banks and corporations.

       Bankers have been doing their thing well before the New Deal, and large corporations and robber barons were rich as fuck in the few decades before the Great Depression (and those families remain rich today).  Of course the New Deal was by design a plan to save capitalism, and curtail any talk of straight up revolt from the people.  Now, Porky is taking it all back, but you'd be a fool to think they're going to stop ruling over us like kings.

       Indeed the New Deal is merely a stepping stone in the progression of morbid 20th-century collectivism.

       Bankers have always, and would always have to be, supported by kings, queens, politburos or otherwise authoritarian regimes. They would not exist if you weren’t forced by law to rely on their scripts.

       Seriously, people are so damn illiterate about what exactly happened in the late 19th and 20th centuries.  Capitalism essentially failed in the 1920s and 1930s - that it would end with state-capitalism was an inevitability, and that central banks would have the power they have today is an inevitability.  Short of abolishing capitalism outright, there is no way you retain capitalism and not have something like the Fed appear, and the state pouring huge amounts of money, resources, R&amp;D, etc. for the corporations' profit is the backbone of the current economic regime.

There are many, many companies that are worth millions and even billions of dollars but still have a major portion of their employees rely on Gov assistance to make ends meet and get healthcare because 30 hours of minimum wage per week doesn't cut it.

       An issue would be all of corporations are owned by people outside the US. Anybody else notice massive holding companies just buying up everything? That "capital" they're using is what the Fed printed to shit during the heaviest of QE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't take a genius to realize, "hey wait. There are just paper notes. They have no real intrinsic value." Then bang all that fake money is flying back to the US buying up assets from the small businesses that used to turn out gears. It's terrifying realizing the US is becoming forgiven owned. We are becoming a third world service economy.

       Incorrect.  There's an absolutely massive conspiracy going on because the corporate-ran MSM has made sure to subtly and sometimes not so subtly make people believe the very inaccuracy you just parroted here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many believe "poor people are the cause of all the country's problems" not because that's just something that somehow comes naturally to citizens, but because the fucking MSM is absolutely responsible for purposefully putting inaccurate thoughts and ideas in their heads - thoughts and ideas that benefit the corporate bosses at the expense of the 99% plebs.

       Is it the media’s fault people buy what they’re selling? Is it a politicians fault people hang on to, and believe every word/lie they speak? I place the blame on the uninformed citizen who picks a political team and follows them blindly, like a fan of a sports team. Anytime I’ve made a comment about both political sides being out to fuck the public on behalf of business or the wealthy, I’m the asshole. Does that make me to blame for the country’s problems? Will you be to blame because nobody listens to you when you point out the obvious? The people are to blame for allowing this to snowball. I have no inside information, I hear the same news as everyone else, but I also look for opposing opinions, and I understand that CNBC, CNN, Fox News, are all entertainment and not journalistic news outlets. I don’t think it’s the media’s fault that people buy into their entertainment like it’s news, it’s like blaming The Onion if someone is stupid enough to believe one of their articles.

       Absolutely not, that was put forth by the same political parties we have now. That’s how the parties convince people that they’re attempting to make real change. They put forth bills that are either meaningless or they sponsor legislation that they know looks good but will never pass. It’s like both parties screaming about campaign finance reform and getting money out of politics, then they all go out to dinner together and laugh at the people who believe them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, the only real fix for the issues we have, is for the people to get angry, and vote for some sort of third party or fourth party. It’s going to be long after I’m dead and gone though, because as long as the democratic and republican parties are the ones in charge of the electoral process, we’re going to be stuck with the same group.

       I agree with everything you just said, 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problem with laying the responsibility solely on every single average working joe and his kids is completely ignoring the role that media plays in this country. Brainwashing is real. Stockholm syndrome is a real thing. One of the crucial components is indoctrination.

       Do you blame a 10 year old for being obese? Not if literally every single person in his l ife is obese themselves and he's never been exposed to the concept of nutrition and healthy diet.

       Has it occurred to you that maybe, just maybe, the average human is so naturally stupid that there always has been and always will be, a guiding force at the top of the hierarchy pulling strings?
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to buy into the meme that humans are naturally intelligent creatures. Over time, the evidence to the contrary mounted. Eventually I had to accept reality for what it is.

       People can and have to make their own choices.  This is true.  However, those choices are
       <em>
        heavily

       influenced by the world around you; by your peers and by what the MSM tells you is and is not “socially acceptable”.  A good portion if not the majority of
       <em>
        your own life
       </em>
       and the decisions you’ve made in it are influenced and a result of what the MSM and your significant others told you to do and not to do.  This is the case whether you realize it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s the case for all of us.

       In part at least? Absolutely.  Certainly not completely.  Again, people have to use their own noggin for sure.  However, what I just said above here absolutely applies and cannot be underestimated.

      <p>
       You are putting far too much weight on one thing when the fact of the matter is that the reality is a result of multiple influences.  Again, the individual is not completely faultless.  Of course not.  Gotta make your own choices - absolutely.  However, the surrounding environment has a great deal to do with what you chose and why you chose it.

       That’s because many individuals are still unfortunately brainwashed by TPTB and the controlled MSM.

      <p>
       Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t seem to understand that fact - and ultimately they can’t be entirely blamed because these fake news outlets have dressed themselves in the faux cloth of “actual real news”.  They’ve convinced the nation that they should be trusted with bringing truth to the masses.  It’s a two way street really.  It’s good to wake up.  Yes.  Of course.  However, I can also see how and why various people are still unfortunately very much asleep.

      <p>
       That’s like saying you don’t think it’s the dealer’s fault that so many people get hooked on crap substances.  On one level, yeah.  You’re totally right.  I wouldn’t disagree with that in the least.  On another level, however, it’s foolish for anyone to think that there aren’t any influences or reasons outside of their own efforts that cause people to fall asunder.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        it’s like blaming The Onion if someone is stupid enough to believe one of their articles.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That’s not really a valid analogy.  The Onion is
       <em>
        advertised
       </em>
       as being a funny parody of news and I don’t know anyone who
       <em>
        doesn’t
       </em>
       know this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would happen if The Onion not only presented itself as being 100% entirely genuine and truthful, but it also got a massive, multi-billion dollar industry behind it that pushed it as being 100% entirely genuine as well?  What if the entire MSM machine got behind The Onion and pushed it as real news for decades and decades?  What would happen then?  What would happen is that after about a generation or two, the public wouldn’t even question whether The Onion is actual, real news or not.  It would simply be taken as an absolute matter of fact by many that The Onion
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       real, authentic news -
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the way things really are.
      </p>
      <p>
       There might be a few people that come out and say “What the fuck, people?  Seriously?  This shit is FAKE!  Y’all don’t understand we’re being fed super fake news?”
      </p>
      <p>
       And a few others might wake up and realize that it is in fact fake news…but the vast majority will continue to follow along like they had been and keep believing The Onion.  Why?  Because they’ve simply been indoctrinated to believe The Onion is all true.

       I agree that corporate greed is crazy and making problems but I am tired of these crybaby posts. Why in the fuck should someone who wears a princess costume get a massive salary? That is their fucking choice to work there and it is their own fault that they aren't working somewhere else making more money. This is the USA, where it is up to you what life you lead, no one else's. Stop whining about it.

       They shouldn't get a massive salary, but in my opinion, if you work full-time, that should guarantee you shelter, food, and transportation. And no, don't twist that into me saying it means a luxury loft, a Ferrari, and shopping at Whole Foods. Why should someone have to work 80 hours a week at 2 jobs just to surivive? That's not even being human at that point.

       The jobs at Disney should be jobs that are for people who are looking for something to do til they get a real job, same thing as working a fast food job. My brother in law did that exact same thing. Worked there for a year, trying to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. After a year of partying, working for shit pay, he decided what the wanted to do and gave it a shot. Everyone lives off of ramen and hot dogs at some point in their life. The difference is some people choose not to live that way forever, some people do.

       Your point is valid. Disney’s full time workers get benefits and some have pensions and 401k matches and all the perks that come with being employed by Disney (other than free tickets, I don’t know what that is but for me that would be enough!).

       You don’t want to have the luxury conversation but you know what?  It’s probably the problem for 75% of the people who complain about not having enough money. Most people don’t save money to buy houses, they eat out every night. They don’t save to go to college, they take out student loans and are surprised when they have to pay hem back. They buy the nice car and the nice clothes and the nice iPhone and the avocado toast...

       The lack of financial education in the US school system is the real conspiracy here.

       Dude, nobody I know has ever even bought avocado toast. Here's the problem, when they know that the cost of a house is going to be impossible to achieve, then they spend on the frivolous stuff, at least from what I've seen. It's like trying to cut coupons to afford a Ferrari, it won't get you anywhere.

       I had some over the weekend; it’s delicious. But, I also have paid off my grad school loan, bought my house and car, saved for retirement and my kids’ education by sacrificing a shitload throughout my 20s to get here from absolutely nothing in a state that didn’t subsidize shit for education. I worked full time and sometimes also worked as a barback between semesters.

      <p>
       It’s the victim mentality where people say they aren’t being treated fairly and “deserve” more but aren’t willing to give more that put the current asshole in the White House.  The Occupy jackholes camping out and destroying the city parks, doing drugs and shitting all over in the name of “protest” made Middle America voters think, “Yeah, those libs are screwing up my nice town.  Why do I work hard so they can fuck it up? The crazy idiot who makes promises he can’t keep sounds like a much better idea!”  Now look where we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The equation is simple:  if you’re putting more into something than you’re getting out of it, you need to move on and find something different.  I moved 2 states away to find an opportunity so don’t tell me it can’t be done.

       That is the vast majority of big box retailers as well. It's only gotten worse since Universal healthcare went into effect. They expect people to get two part-time jobs &amp; pay for their own benefits even though many corporations are making record-breaking profits rn. Greed has no end.

       Some people are limited in options. If you need to put food on the table you would maybe have to suck it up but surely we shouldn't be getting to that stage anyway? The money should trickle down more, at the moment it's staying at the top.

       You can apply for unemployment but in order to be eligible you have to have worked at a company for longer than six months and you don't qualify if you quit or got fired due to insubordination. And even if you DO qualify then the employer can fight it by saying some bullshit reason.

       Sadly, yes. I hope the youth are waking up. They need to band together and not tolerate this behavior. There’s plenty of money for the CEOs. How about sharing enough of that with the employees so they can make a living wage?

       THANK YOU for saying this. It amazes me how many people roll their eyes and say “Melinneals” and assume that the cycle of low wages and welfare dependency is a sign of the times.

       Parents can’t sit by and do nothing then bitch because their kid has the same shitty career path as they do.  As well parents can’t shield their child from any negativity (helicopter parents) and expect that they will succeed in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both paths lead to a victim mentality and the feeling that one deserves $18/hour as a cashier with a bachelor’s degree from a state school in a discipline that didn’t have any job prospects when they started college and still doesn’t today.

       I agree with you. But why wait for the government to make this illegal? With the current state of affairs you can probably wait untill hell freezes over. What Disney and a dozens of others companies are doing is immoral. If you agree with the above statements, simply boycott everything Disney is involved in. Share this information and  if you convince a person and he/she convinces another person and that trend continuous on a daily basis, Disney would be forced within a week  to change this policy if they don't want to go bankrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with the attitude, one that is quite pervasive, that we the people need to wait untill government acts upon social problems. Dictate what's illegal. Use common sense, evaluete your norms and standards and vote with your pocket.

       There's a company in the UK I used to work for where head office heavily suggested that managers hire people on 0 hour contracts. Then, when said staff didn't do well enough, they could threaten to cut all their hours.

       Walmart does this. But I had a really awesome manager. He'd schedule me full time for 11 weeks, than give me 32 hours for the last week, thus I'd be considered 'part-time' but get full time hours.

       Isn't it obvious that the 16 year old running the churro stand should make as much as the CEO running the entire company? Also Disney should not reinvest any of its profits into new, better attractions and instead invest every penny into paying everyone equally no matter their contribution to the overall profit.

       Cinderella doesn’t go to school, and thinks that she deserves more than minimum wage because she stays with the same employer for too many years and doesn’t have any other transferable skills or has she worked to better herself with her own company to get promoted?  Meanwhile, the CEO is out purchasing Pixar, Marvel, Lucas, and Fox, building a new theme park in Shanghai, and developing new strategies to keep ESPN and the movie studios relevant while combating Netflix and Amazon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disneyland isn’t the only or even the best  employer in Orange County or even Southern California.  Why does Cinderella expect to get more when she doesn’t give more?  Also, why is she so upset with Disney when she is working under a union agreement that didn’t negotiate a better deal for her?
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I believe Disney should choose to pay their people more in order to be THE employer of choice in Orange County.

      <p>
       Just because a Cinderella works at Disney, doesn't mean that Cinderella is not educated or lacks skills. What if Cinderella has a degree but is unable to find work? What if she has debt and is forced to take any job she can get her hands on?
      </p>
      <p>
       May I remind you that those underpaid employees do all of the work, without them, CEO wouldn't be able to do anything. They create wealth, not the higher management. CEO is not a vital position, there are profitable companies that operate efficiently without CEO taking unnecessary risks and getting overpaid for that.

       Anyway, the real reason why the wages in the "western world/ "developed" world" are taking a dive is because the fucknut owners of said countries decided they want to make people in NA and Europe ready to compete with Chinese labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the stupid part is, you can't compete with Chinese slave- and childlabor in a legal way, but they found a solution and that is...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...to make people poor enough so they cant rebel against the over-powered police states and take about any, progressively shittier becoming jobs just to make ends meet. The US. lower class can't get it's ass out of the slump it's currently in and that's by design.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile big corps are selectively maximizing revenue e.g. costumers buy overall less but individually more expensive products to compensate for all the lost costumers due to overall higher prices and declining quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple equation: Instead of selling 10x bread for 1$ each, you just sell 9x bread for 1.10$ each...or even more to keep shareholders happy...
      </p>
      <p>
       In the food industry products are getting "stretched" using more of less expensive components e.g. more sugar in your apple juice instead of fruit concentrate/"syrup".
      </p>
      <p>
       This system is sustainable until the last costumer bails on the too expensive products and services. I'm waiting for the day when the Swiss Nestle Nazis sell you bottled air, because they ran out of water.

       <p>
        Disneyland is a perfect model of all the entangled orders of simulation. To begin with it is a play of illusions and phantasms: pirates, the frontier, future world, etc. This imaginary world is supposed to be what makes the operation successful. But, what draws the crowds is undoubtedly much more the social microcosm, the miniaturized and religious revelling in real America, in its delights and drawbacks. You park outside, queue up inside, and are totally abandoned at the exit. In this imaginary world the only phantasmagoria is in the inherent warmth and affection of the crowd, and in that aufficiently excessive number of gadgets used there to specifically maintain the multitudinous affect. The contrast with the absolute solitude of the parking lot - a veritable concentration camp - is total. Or rather: inside, a whole range of gadgets magnetize the crowd into direct flows; outside, solitude is directed onto a single gadget: the automobile. By an extraordinary coincidence (one that undoubtedly belongs to the peculiar enchantment of this universe), this deep-frozen infantile world happens to have been conceived and realized by a man who is 1himself now cryogenized; Walt Disney, who awaits his resurrection at minus 180 degrees centigrade.
       </p>
       <p>
        The objective profile of the United States, then, may be traced throughout Disneyland, even down to the morphology of individuals and the crowd. All its values are exalted here, in miniature and comic-strip form. Embalmed and pactfied. Whence the possibility of an ideological analysis of Disneyland (L. Marin does it well in
        <em>
         Utopies, jeux d'espaces
        </em>
        ): digest of the American way of life, panegyric to American values, idealized transposition of a contradictory reality. To be sure. But this conceals something else, and that "ideological" blanket exactly serves to cover over a third-order simulation: Disneyland is there to conceal the fact that it is the "real" country, all of "real" America, which is Disneyland (just as prisons are there to conceal the fact that it is the social in its entirety, in its banal omnipresence, which is carceral). Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation. It is no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology), but of concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Disneyland imaginary is neither true nor false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It's meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the "real" world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness.

       Excellent passage. It was of course the very same treatise, Simulacra and Simulations, which Neo is shown using as his secret hiding place for his illegal discs, at the beginning of The Matrix.

       Baudrillard also wrote about how the Gulf War is/was a hoax. Even here on r/conspiracy, precious few are ready to even entertain the notion that

       Two years ago I bought a brand new home for $400k in Northern California.

       4 bed, 3 bath

      <p>
       Small neighborhood with a couple stores and a homeless problem.

      <p>
       Average crime rates.

       Local elementary school is 50% refugees that cannot speak English and require additional resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than 50% of the student body is on food stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
       We sold the house. Broke even or maybe lost a little money. I don't give a fuck. 2k a month mortgage and insurance for such a shit neighborhood was too much.

       Housing within 30 minutes of Google Bus Driver's job is rough.  $750/mo for a room in a house, minimum, outside weird circumstances (live-in aide, yardwork, etc).  A studio in SF or Silicon Valley is waaaaaay outside Google Bus Driver reach unless s/he has rent control (and therefore has been in place prior to getting Google Bus Driver job).
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, Google Bus Driver might be able to swing a studio, but no landlord will rent to him/her.
