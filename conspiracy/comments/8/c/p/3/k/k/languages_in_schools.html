    <div class="md"><p>You live in California? No? Then you wouldn&#39;t know what is like to have them take over your cities and demand they have everything that you, a legal citizen, has. It would be the same for any people immigrating en mass to a new place and overwhelming that population worth their demands. Everything is in Spanish,  schools are teaching Spanish instead of English to everyone, overcrowding of our schools, free food, housing, college,  the list keeps going. How would you feel if this happened in your community and felt like your government cared for them more than you? Riding around in Escalades, dropping hundreds of dollars on food and paying with food stamps, taking college seats that could have gone to a LEGAL deserving citizen,  the list goes on and on. It&#39;s just too much to take and it wears on you. You have to live it to feel it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was born, raised and live in a CALIFORNIA border town where Mexican citizens literally cross the border on a daily basis. You’d be surprised at how many of those Cadillac driving scoundrels are actually second, third generation AMERICANS, yes Americans (Anglo, Hispanic, Black, etc) who leech off of the government rather than work their ass off like the rest of us. The average illegal can hardly afford a car, much less an Escalade, Not once has an illegal immigrant taken my job, demanded to have the same rights as I have nor marginalized me to the point where I feel like they threaten my qualifications or livelihood. I work in public education and that is a lie, English is and always will be our primary language and I have never experienced or witnessed Spanish being taught in order to accommodate to non English speakers, I do however, speak Spanish by choice, and it has helped me in all of my career opportunities and simply being able to communicate with individuals of other Latin based languages (ex. Italian, French, Portugués, Catalan) to learn more about them (who knew there was a world outside of ours) More students=more $$ this happened at the school I work at, not one illegal immigrant kid. I’m not an open border guy, but I also don’t buy into the exaggerated points you made that many other fellow Americans believe mostly because I’ve witnessed and experienced the contrary. If you’re worried about overcrowding and having people demanding rights check out the mass crowd of people coming in from the Middle East, my city is literally packed with men ages 18-40 just chilling in front of their low income apartments or houses, speaking their language, what’s the difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I think it might be very rare in many areas of the US today - a second Language <em>used</em> to be a requirement for graduation. Spanish was pushed heavily, certainly in Idaho. </p>

<p>Other languages, perhaps were based on population and demographics = interest or needs? Areas heavy in religious <em>missions</em> come to mind.</p>

<p>Oak Ridge, TN at one point had more PHD&#39;s per square mile than any other US State. A huge drive to be within the City Limits with the added Bonus being a plethora of Languages offered. </p>

<p>by the time I got there, they still required a second language for graduation but only offered Spanish taught by a lady that had been to and was obsessed with Spain, so not as directly useful to a state that had a million population and an estimated million undocumented peeps working at the farms.
