        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I used to use the handle Knight_of_Cups and deleted the account. I’ve been coming to this sub for 5 years now; 5 years ago I think the sub count was only around 65,000. Quite the difference from today. </p>

<p>From my perspective this sub has become very partisan. Maybe thats to be expected when a fringe sub like this becomes popular. I think it got popular at the wrong time though. Yes there are still posts that tackle 9-11, JFK, Snowden, UFO’s, etc. But the core ideas behind these conspiracies are not discussed the way they used to be. Everything is being scrutinized, which it should be, but scrutinized to the degree of subs such as r/politics; I read a thread about the lack of airplane debris from 9-11 and the comments referring to people being “nutters” where highly upvoted as opposed to the users claiming there should have been more debris. That is just a small example. </p>

<p>The Trump bashing is another thing that has caught my eye. Pre election, regular users here called bullshit on the Russia narrative. As it has played out the last two years, they are still calling bullshit but now they are being met with accusations of being Trump supporters, Nazi’s, Russian bots. Like I said, very partisan viewpoints in a sub that championed itself on being non partisan as the two party system is systemically divisive and keeps us at the status quo. </p>

<p>I totally think Trump should be scrutinized as every person of power should be, but people forget quickly why we are doing it in the first place. </p>

<p>The point of my post is that no matter what changes the Mods have introduced, this sub is beyond repair. Long time users see it. New users love it. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you really make this whole post just to throw in the tired old “Trump bashing” line? People aren’t bashing him, they’re scrutinizing him like you said they should. When they do they’re accused of Trump bashing. Agreed with everything else you said and sort of even that, since there is Trump bashing here, but legitimate scrutiny is often dismissed as bashing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this transformation has been entirely intentional. I think forums like this actually have a much bigger impact than many people realize, and many of the ideas we discuss here and on the Chans, on Voat, etc. end up reaching and influencing many normal people.</p>

<p>Even Google was messing with this sub&#39;s search listing, dropping it way down the list and labeling it a &quot;controversial&quot; subreddit. To me that is a sign that TPTB are threatened. And then you have well organized subs like r/TopMindsofReddit who brigade constantly and make discussion difficult, and group-mock people in an effort to silence them. I think most of the people there are normies just looking to inflate their egos via mocking others, but I&#39;ll bet the organizers of the sub have other goals.</p>

<p>Anyway, there seems to be a deliberate and concerted effort to make productive discussion more difficult in forums like this all over the internet. I think that is entirely intentional, and tells us that some of the things were are discussing threaten those with power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about?  The Russia narrative was clearly Hillary Clinton throwing a hissy fit and demanding the world go along with her temper tantrum.  Trump is still a piece of shit and anyone who believes in Trumpism (fascism) is a damned fool.  I suppose no one can stop the incoming tide though... it&#39;s going to make Hitler look like a girl scout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why there are a ton of posts every day from people who still believe (for some bizarre reason) that Trump is being subverted by the deep state, as if this is somehow a revelation.  Trump was always going to screw you guys over.</p>

<p>Most everyone who criticizes the Trump support is not supporting Clinton or the Democrats.  I sure as hell am not, anyway.  The rare Hillshill post is easy to spot, it&#39;s like they&#39;re not even trying any more.  Most of us are trying to get Trump supporters to wake up, and to call out the obvious t_d/fascist astroturfing on this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>O.o I think it is possible that everyone has been deceived. Then again this is the conspiracy sub. I would think that such minds that gather here would have some class and civility. I think that it is highly apparent that reddit has been awash in political angst, distraction, disinformation and a lack in ability to admit to being wrong when presented with evedance. 
There are a lot of people here that have been researching for ages, and I believe they are being surpressed and pushed out. Shills,bots, algorithms,cash and we just keep playing against each other. </p>
