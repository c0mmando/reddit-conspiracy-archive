       Although that being said... a PJ party at a mattress store does sound like a lot of fun as a kid actually. Just so long as no one is abusing anyone, either mentally or physically.

       Not sure how relevant this is, but a foster kid started the company that was acquired by/merged with Mattress Firm.  He was all over AM radio ads with his personal story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he wants to help kids from his background, maybe he was abused and the cycle continues, maybe totally unrelated.

       The multiple locations came from the merger/acquisition, imho, and will be unwound.

       Very interesting, thanks for the perspective!

       I see both cases being totally and completely plausible. Let's all hope it's the uplifting/good angle, and not the dark/evil angle.

       Normally I'm not one to believe in coincidences, but I could see this being a case for that.

       Mattresses have huge profit margins, and they never go bad, they just take a lot of room when displayed. Mattress Firm opens up a ton of locations in a given city as a hostile takeover and to force out competition. They spend say, a million dollars to open up a new location. Build a building, stock with mattresses, allocate operation expenses and youâ€™re in business; making an incredible rate of return if you sell even 2 mattresses a day.
      </p>

       There may be some big conspiracy but really mattresses are just big.

       This has been happening since at least last year. I heard about this on the radio all last summer during literally every commercial break on the station that my work makes us listen too. Itâ€™s interesting because the ad made it sound like a local fundraiser but I realized it was on one of those stations owned by iheartradio so it was probably a national campaign.

       Does anyone have any evidence to this conspiracy theory or is it solely based on the fact that there are so many matters firm locations (which were a result of mergers)?

       Nope, and whatâ€™s weird is that I actually first saw this commercial on Friday, but didnâ€™t post it til today. Had no idea it was on the Simpsons last night until another user mentioned it. Strange.

       I love the Mattress Firm conspiracy. Definetely could be something shady/money laundering type thing going on there. They operate 3500 stores in the US, while Wal Mart has about 6500. So many people go to wal mart every day (groceries, electronics, clothes, pharmacies, toiletries) I myself go to wal mart probably over a dozen times a year. I've never been in a mattress store though. People buy a mattress every, what, 10 years? If that? Most people have one for most of their lives. Why does there need to be so many stores? It doesn't make sense

       One visit to Mattress Firm = a minimum of 10 to Wal-Mart. The only way to really justify, however, is pay for market analytics and see their market share. I know of a particular scientific equipmeny company that has a lion share of the market, but you woukdnt kniw it without paying for that intel. Or, maybe being a chain its easier to pimp to an investor in nearly every midsize and up city,

       Has everyone considered that hotels, hospitals, campers, etc. go through a lot of mattresses?  We seem to have a mattress store near every hospital in my state.  Also most households have 2- 3 sets of mattresses. It all adds up. I think I just talked myself into opening a store. lol

       I don't think this is it.  This is for a third party organization started by a foster child who in an interview said he wanted to give back to those in his spot because he didn't have many of the opportunities that people who look at foster care seem to assume comes with it.  Not all foster parents are glowing pillars of humanity, and he wants to help.
