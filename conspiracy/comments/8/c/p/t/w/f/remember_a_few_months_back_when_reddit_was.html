<p>Maybe he wants to help kids from his background, maybe he was abused and the cycle continues, maybe totally unrelated.</p>

<p>I see both cases being totally and completely plausible. Let&#39;s all hope it&#39;s the uplifting/good angle, and not the dark/evil angle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mattresses have huge profit margins, and they never go bad, they just take a lot of room when displayed. Mattress Firm opens up a ton of locations in a given city as a hostile takeover and to force out competition. They spend say, a million dollars to open up a new location. Build a building, stock with mattresses, allocate operation expenses and youâ€™re in business; making an incredible rate of return if you sell even 2 mattresses a day.</p>

<p>There may be some big conspiracy but really mattresses are just big. </p>

I heard about this on the radio all last summer during literally every commercial break on the station that my work makes us listen too. Itâ€™s interesting because the ad made it sound like a local fundraiser but I realized it was on one of those stations owned by iheartradio so it was probably a national campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love the Mattress Firm conspiracy. Definetely could be something shady/money laundering type thing going on there. They operate 3500 stores in the US, while Wal Mart has about 6500. So many people go to wal mart every day (groceries, electronics, clothes, pharmacies, toiletries) I myself go to wal mart probably over a dozen times a year. I&#39;ve never been in a mattress store though. People buy a mattress every, what, 10 years? If that? Most people have one for most of their lives. Why does there need to be so many stores? It doesn&#39;t make sense </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One visit to Mattress Firm = a minimum of 10 to Wal-Mart. The only way to really justify, however, is pay for market analytics and see their market share. I know of a particular scientific equipmeny company that has a lion share of the market, but you woukdnt kniw it without paying for that intel. Or, maybe being a chain its easier to pimp to an investor in nearly every midsize and up city, </p>
