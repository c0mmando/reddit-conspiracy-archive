       Yep. the internet is a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many hours do you sit typing away instead or learning, reading, running or enjoying life?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop getting into internet troll arguments and go learn a skill, meet up with a friend of an afternoon, go lay in a park.

       TV was designed to waste your time. The internet is designed to waste your time (not track you, they only track you so they can get better at targeting you with shit that wastes your time). Mobile phones/cellphones are designed to keep your attention focused to something close to you. When you stare so long at something so close you get literal tunnel vision. That means your brain rewires itself to be used to tunnel vision. Which means your thought processes suffer from tunnel vision. In turn this makes it harder to see the big picture and easier to distracted and pulled into time wasting shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       INB4 well this thread...YES this thread IS a waste of time and you're good to recognise that but if you recognise this thread is a waste of time, you must know the other threads, internet forums and 'news' sites are a waste of time as well.

       Fuck the rest of the world. You'll be lucky to see it, experience it or suffer from it.

       Many people are finally waking up to the horrors caused by wealthy elites thanks to the sharing of information via Reddit, YouTube etc. When Chomsky started protesting the Vietnam war he claims he could barely get a dozen people out to listen to him speak. Now, there is a giant community forming that fights tptb with research, information, and online arguments. It will be increasingly more difficult for tptb to stage false flags and lead us into unnecessary wars because we communicate. The solution is to keep resisting, not falling back to sleep.

       I agree with the sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what exactly has the internet achieved? We make it easier for marketing companies, we make it easier for the government to track and control us, it makes silencing us or creating a narrative out of thin air really fucking easy and worst of all it gives us the delusion that we are making a difference.

       I agree with your sentiments as well. The same could have been said, and often is, with any new technological breakthrough. Overall, at this stage, I would say the internet has been a negative for the most part, however, the speed at which news can travel and the capability the internet and mass communication could have in shaping the world is enormous. That's why governments are scared but that doesn't mean their tired old tactics will continue to work. This recent Syrian hoax is a good example of all of this. So the western media flood us with disinformation, propaganda, sad photos and chilling video of a chemical attack. Some people buy it, but a ton do not based on previous experience as well as WikiLeaks and other sources that tell us to be skeptical. That did not happen with Vietnam. No one knew Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag, nor did they question it. I would go one step further. What is needed is an education of the masses to understand how to read. Or more specifically, how to understand propaganda. Once you recognize it it is hard for it or impossible to take control. I hope we will get there as a whole, but for now you are correct in how overwhealming negative the internet is for us. I suppose I'm just optimistic that new voices and generations will see through the bs.

       Good post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't say that it's an education people need, that's too broad ranging. Just the basics of how to ask questions and what to ask about.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, we had a thread on here the other day that was something along the lines of : " [msm rag] says Russian trolls have increased by 2000%"
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people jumped on one side of the fence or the other, but I saw nobody asking "what were the original numbers of Russian trolls?" "How do we know this is a 2000% increase?" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Click bait headlines and newstories do not stand up to critical thinking or questioning. They rely on the knee-jerk emotional reaction aka clicks of the reader or observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking questions how our race got to where we are. We need to constantly ask questions of everything and everyone. Otherwise life will become really pointless.

       Great points all. And I especially agree that our race got here thanks to questions. Though it's a bit of a stretch - Socrates fundamentally was just asking questions. Unfortunately that got him killed. So maybe this was a warning to us all from 2500 years ago as well as an encouragement to keep fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, a lot of these clickbait articles are garbage, but that's the point indeed. I like checking out articles posted here as it's a good opportunity to find a collection of different opinions that I don't have to scour the web for.

       We should also consider something a little deeper. The internet is still in its infancy. We haven't quite been able to utilize it for much - except for capitalizing on human addiction. Pornography, social media scrolling - dopamine hits. When Martin Luther helped kickstart the Reformation it was aided by the internet of its time - the printing press to spread information. By 1516 the printing press had been out for decades and not that many people could read but Luther nonetheless shattered Western Europe. It was a totally different era, and there is much more to that story, but there are similarities today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm saying is, we are not at the end of time. Yet millions of people are waking up to how hollow and immoral our world is. That it's run by greedy oligarchs who kill masses of people to test weapons, and invade countries to control resources. Theres a little more to it, but not much. I'm hopeful that it won't be much longer until there won't be incentives for killing and invading but that may not come until a major calamity - human made or natural. Nonetheless, if the profit motive was removed the game is over. It seems impossible now, but that's because we live now and can't see much beyond a few months or maybe years. But our world is so much different than a century ago. Some things better, some things worse, but still much different. The internet may very well be the printing press, but I personally believe having instantaneous translation for all languages to be the next breakthrough. That way we can all express ourselves as well as realize that 99% of humans - at least - have similar dreams and desires and can achieve those goals through communication. But we can't be complacent as we have been for the past 50 years.

       From what I understand, all great civilisations rise and fall. What goes up, must come down is the basic gist of Newton's theories. So I believe that the immoral and greedy nature of our society will collapse under its' own weight. This will lead us to a renaissance of reconnecting with the Earth and Nature in general. Looking back through history we can see that art and culture renaissance always followed periods of stifling depression or force societal conformity. With us now in the technological age, which keeps us physically isolated and dependant on technology more than any other period, I believe a great reconnecting will happen. Large cities will become dispersed and broken up, forming smaller self-sufficient communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, with the advancement of 'free' energy from the sun, our own Earth and Nature herself, we have the ability to grow limitless amounts of food for next to nothing. But here we are, wage slaves Monday-Friday and coerced into spending our money on frivolous trinkets on a weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will all come to a grinding halt when we realise that we are stronger as many individual communities, than we are as a mass city, divided by race, gender, creeds etc.

       Very well put. The difficulty facing us over the coming decades will be how to break those chains and keep them broken. Technology may be able to assist, but what is worrying is if it overtakes us and our chains are replaced by something worse. If our mundane tasks are taken care of - I think a positive - we still need to find purpose and a way to treat with one another not based on sex or race or nationhood but on capability and necessity. It sounds simple but it may be the greatest leap forward for human beings in 100,000 years. Don't disparage. It's going to be an interesting time to come.

       Fundamentally not true. Learning, reading, as well as enjoying life are all possibilities on the internet. In fact they are probabilities. The issue lies in misinformation and activities that are not "conducive" to ones own interpretation of progress or advancement. Fact is, the average person has more knowledge of things they otherwise wouldn't before the internet existed. Instead of limiting your scope to what you see on r/conspiracy, visit sub Reddit like mathematics, science, or DIY. Simply because you don't know how to use the internet for your benefit, does not mean it is a negative for all people who use the internet. Additionally, your argument is entirely subjective.

       Thank you for a very good reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct in a lot of what you say and I should reword my OP to reflect your points. I'm not going to though, because I am too lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more information on the internet but there is also more misinformation, as you point out. Why learn on the internet if I could learn with people IRL? Social interaction with learning is more beneficial psychologically than sat in a room talking to a TV, is it not?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to see the age demographic of those who learn on the internet vs those who use it for non-educational activities. I'm not saying there is or isn't a link, but I would be interested to see if there is.

       Social interaction is important sure, but that is still subjective. What it really boils down to is efficiency, and that's is the true foundation of the internet. I can learn more faster on the internet, than if I took the time to seek out the information i am looking for via non-internet use. I think you are also underestimating the difficulty in social interaction towards gaining ANY information. The dangers in that is that you revert to people who are like minded and share your viewpoints with others in your community, not gaining an alternative view which has it's own perceived dangers in that you do not, or cannot understand the viewpoint of a community outside of your own. Of course, what I am espousing is entirely subjective, but history and data shows that it is likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking for myself as a black male, I believe that without the internet it would have been alot harder for me to relate and understand other communities and thus stunt my intellectual growth (although the fortune that I had in institutional education would have rectified some of that). Think about social interaction. Firstly, it is hard enough to start a substantive conversation with someone regardless of the situation. Outside of the typical greetings, there is hardly any precedent in beginning a conversation in being able to learn; being that risk offending or leading an individual into a conversation they would rather not have. Such as simply not wanting to talk to you. (Understand that I am not saying it's impossible). Secondly, I would know nothing that is of any import to you or your community. The internet has given platforms in various forms for people to express said opinions. As such, I am able to grasp and mull over those ideas and now communicate eddectively with them over said medium. I understand the argument that it is not  a substitute for in person interaction. But ironically, it is effectively better.  We are able to discuss more openly and freely because of the electronic wall between us. In person we would not have even gotten this far in the conversation because you may have been wary that should you offend me, given the stereotypes of physically imposing black males, I would punch or shoot you. Same goes for me if you were a redneck. I also understand that it can also be viewed as a detriment because I fear no retaliation and can behave anyway I choose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, while the internet has it drawbacks, there are far more positive possibilities than not having it.

       Hey, Littletowe, just a quick heads-up:
       <br/>
       <strong>
        alot
       </strong>
       is actually spelled
       <strong>
        a lot
       </strong>
       . You can remember it by
       <strong>
        it is one lot, 'a lot'

       I get what you're saying. Some of it is, well, probably correct but it's subjective.

       Would race relations be as bad as they are without the internet? I don't think so. (Not saying they would be all sunshines and smiles, but the mainstream internet puts racism to the forefront of peoples minds)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also that free discussion is rapidly closing down all around us. The speech on the internet is so highly censored and people just don't understand it.

       Id say there is astronomically more detrimental, false, time wasting information fed to you in school than on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the internet as it has existed, there is a ton of uncensored learning material. I hag gigabytes of technical papers about everything from supercomputers to turbopump design. You can literally teach yourself rocket science, chemistry, quantum physics, and lots of other useful things
       <em>
        for free
       </em>
       if you are autodidactic(as i am) and have the inclination to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook, social media where you are the product being monitizedis definitely a time waster, but thats just regression to the mean laziness on the user's part.

       Would love for you to see your overall outlook on life and how you look for a reason for things to be bad. Even when someone like this commenter provides you with information, good information, your response is to find a negative in it and reason why X is bad for you.

       Let me tell you a story all about how, my life got turned upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a shy, introvert, under-confident kind of guy, amazing I got laid like wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy more than what I should have, but there we go. I used to spend all of my time on the internet, I still spend a few hours a day, which will be cut to 0 soon enough. I spent my time ignoring human interaction and believe learnin' stopped after school.
      </p>
      <p>
       But something clicked in my head. I have learned nothing about human interaction, but positive and negative. It held me back in my job, I had learned no new skills in 5+ years and was rapidly forgetting what little skills I had.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to change things around and mix things up, it failed spectacularly so I tried making a 'new' life. Shortly into this 'new' life I realised that my past, the people I missed, the person I was that I missed and all my adventures were still tied to the past through the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's when I realised, the internet has wasted my time for the past 5 or so years. Now, the olden days of the internet were freaking golden. It's not like that nowadays with the political agendas, social media and muted speech. The internet has been turned into another

      </p>
      <p>
       90% of the internet is fluff and filler.
      </p>
      <p>
       People and real life interactions is where the real growth and development is and the rewards are FAR greater than any reward the internet could give me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;DR I was shy, preferred my PC over people. Now I see the beauty in all people and it is deeper than any text on a screen could ever be

       in person too, that's hardly an internet thing. Or people only know how to react in meme form anymore, every reaction to everything is "boy that escalated quickly" or "i see what you did there"
      </p>
      <p>
       I get much more enjoyment by seeking out quality media, be it books, movies or shows that actually had real effort and originality put into them, than by going and sitting at a bar with people

       Me and you are alike. A good TV show, film or book makes us reflect on ourselves.

       Completely agreed. I'm not rare in this regard but the internet raised me - rather it allowed me to raise myself. I am constantly learning something on the internet and I have formed the habit of taking action with my curiosity. If I am curious of any little fact - I google it and research it.

       Like the Christians used the roads of Rome, built by the military, to spread the ideology to befall Rome - the internet, created by the military, is the groundwork to spread a new era.

       As internet use has gone up, voting has gone down and suicide has gone up.  I think we can all agree that, at least so far, the internet has been a 'net' negative for society.  Kids don't even get into trouble anymore - teenage sex and drug use is WAY down - all they do is sit on their phones.  People are divorcing themselves from reality at an increasing rate, and reality is getting worse and worse - so people are pulled towards the shiny graphics and fake thigh gaps of the internet.

       You don't read anything not on the internet because it has been filtered by a company, but you read stuff on the internet because it hasn't been filtered by a company?

       I read everything. But I find more value in writing that hasn't been approved by corporate interests. I enjoy meta analysis. Like why does graham Hancock keep getting huge book deals if what he's saying is remotely controversial ? Well I can read miles Mathis's essay on why he thinks that is.

       The internet is a double edged sword. All of your arguments are partially valid. Not everything on the internet is fallacious or counter productive to read. Cross cultural empathy, online skill sharing, all dem quality educational youtube channels, grammarly, politifact, the countless websites of debating and primary sources as well as reputable articles and literature, cinematic analysis, the benefits are endless - the trolls just ruined a lot of it and our own market feedback has led to a disgusting amount of ads and sexualized content. The internet reflects both the good and bad of us. Not just the bad. If it weren't for internet you'd be muttering those words with your social network at best. Thanks to the internet we all get to hear your opinion, debate, agree, disagree, and learn and correct each other to reach a multi-perspective view of things.

       Good post.

       For clarification for myself, the internet is how computers connect and the World Wide Web is reddit, google etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ads and sexualised content were always on the internet. It's the disgusting amount of gore porn that I see that really turns my stomach. The hypocrisy fucks me off as well. The FPS game franchise "Soldier of Fortune" was banned/dumbed down back in the day because people feared that kids could play this ultraviolent game (even though it was 18 and people were strict about that shit back in the day)
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays little kids can go on facebook and watch Mexicans get chain-sawed in half. Nothing gets said. I'm not ultra-conservative by any means but jesus Christ, Facebook was aimed at kids!

       And YouTube and twitch and imge and 4chan and even reddit. Just look at the quarantined posts on Reddit. You're right. Humanity has always been ugly. Pedophilia, rape, gore, snuff, traffiking, sheer sociopathic outrage and even cannibalism. You name it. It has always been there. The only thing the internet did was raise awareness of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm the type of person who'd rather be depressed and disturbed confronting and staring at the ugly truth so we can grow mature as a species and recognize our own flaws and deal with them rather than hide in our private spaces and choose* to be ignorant of the disturbing truths of our own nature and the consequences of our actions. As I said, as votting reflects the electorate, and the product reflects the market, the netizens reflect the internet - and it only helps us develop and evolve our way of thinking. Watch black mirror - we are clearly in an age of moral evolution and widespread awareness of the dark sides of humanity. We need this in order to fix them. We get rid of the internet, and the world will stay the same, more kids will end up sexually abused again.. and again.. and again. More people will be kidnapped and killed again.. and again.. and again. More people will be executed again .. and again.. and again. Facelessly, namelessly, endlessly. And nobody will know of it. Everybody's lives and worlds will be as big as they have went and seen.

       Our handlers have perfected it, though.  Not only are we entertained, we are kept fed with unhealthy food made of heavily subsidized ingredients (corn syrup) and have access to a retail market of very inexpensive goods (flat screen tvs), allowing the lower earners to be overweight, sedentary and indoctrinated.  This lower class population will never revolt.

       You have a mature view of things. I was never interested in reading. Then when I was 11, someone gave me the Guinness book of records. I was the start for me. This was before the Internet. Another way, is audio books. They make you realize how much you learn from one book.

       I was referring to your mastering of audio book benefits on such a large scale. Currently, I've discovered Classical Stretch by Miranda Esmonde-White. It's an easy to medium work-out 20 to 30 minutes in the morning and I feel 20 years younger. No cost, no equipment, just you a little space and her video.

       Well, my next phase of learning is to get back to my best physical shape, and then go further to get in the best shape of my life. So I will definitely download this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I used to use torrents to download films and TV shows. Then I figured, "wait a minute, why don't I just get educational material from torrent sites? If I can get tv shows and movies before the public see them, what kind of treasure trove of information is the internet hiding?" (Yes that thought process led me to understand that most of the things we see on the internet are fluff and filler!)

       I think that the "turn inward" idea is apolitical nonsense and maybe even a distraction technique. Even if we were all buddha, we'd still have to go stand in front of a tank or burn ourselves or start a PAC to get noticed.

       I'm sure listening to a joke in a park could lower it even more, with fresh air filling the lungs, sunlight providing vitamin D, yknow, something medically proven to lower stress. How many memes have you looked at to believe it can replace basic human needs?

       Totally agree regarding playing sports. They can be used as a way to train the body and mind. But they can veer into unhealthy, ultimately pointless obsession too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's interesting to consider professional sports, politically. Take some of the most capable, strong-willed men and women and teach them to chase a ball in return for slips of paper. Imagine if all that potential was instead harnessed to effect political change!

       90% of the internet is designed to waste time. Unless you can focus in on the 10% with laser accuracy, there will be some time wasting in there.

       I'm not talking personally on me. If i waste my time then i waste my time, i'm consciously aware of it.

       I'm glad I'm a musician because it builds social and artistic time into my life and gives me reasons not to just watch TV or be online.

       I think it goes further than just time.  I think it's to keep peoples' brains from focusing on certain things. This Neo-flat Earth movement, for instance, packs just enough interesting and compelling arguments to keep a curious and semi-intellectual person hunting snipe down a rabbit hole for a number of months or more.  Without such a distraction, the same person may use their intellect on something more real and more threatening to the powers that be.

       I think life is entirely pointless. Why not kill myself? Why would I? Life doesn't need a purpose to exist, it just ur. There's no reason to just die before you have to. If you don't want to live, then ok go kill yourself. But you can still live and enjoy life even if there is no point. Maybe just living it is the point of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       My larger point is that everything in life wastes your time. Literally everything you do is a waste of time. Still, if you're enjoying it who cares if you're wasting time?
      </p>
      <p>
       My job is a huge waste of time, but I do it for the money. Cleaning my bathroom is a waste of time, but I want a clean bathroom. Its as useful as spending an hour playing spades on my phone for fake money, but I get just as much enjoyment from it. So in my mind there's no difference. It's just about transactions and the benefit you're personally getting from those transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just do what you do. It doesn't matter, but that's ok.
