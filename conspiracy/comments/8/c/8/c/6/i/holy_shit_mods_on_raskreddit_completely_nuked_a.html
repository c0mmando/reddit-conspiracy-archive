       The thread is still up, entitled
       <strong>
        [Serious]What are some of the creepiest declassified documents made available to the public?
       </strong>
       , which I won't link to because of rules. But I've never seen anything like this happen on
       <a href="/r/askreddit">
        /r/askreddit
       </a>
       . When I mean the content was only about conspiracies, I mean it had virtually no political or social implications. It had no cussing, it had no nudity, it had nothing but content on conspiracies. They completely nuked the top comments from orbit.

       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LopaUoo.png">
        Here's an example
       </a>
       . The only reason you can see how many upvotes it had is because I saved it due to how interesting it was. This particular comment was about the Soviet assassination program, but there were other absolutely amazing comments that were removed about the CIA mind-control experiments, Northwoods, MK Ultra, et cetera. I mean the content was amazing, it was all sourced and reasonably skeptical and all of that.

       They removed it all! They replaced ALL of the top comments with other stuff. Wtf?

       You can also use it on a whole subreddit to see what posts the mods removed. Click into a sub you want to check, then do the same thing. Replace the R with a C.

       I feel like a solution would be to have a browser add-on that automatically saves the text of each comment and pushes them to such a site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I think, maybe it should be peer to peer, instead of relying on a central site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I think it could let users write the comments directly instead of scraping, at which point, do you really need Reddit anymore?

       If a user deletes their own comment then ceddit will reflect that as per Reddit's policy that folks are able to delete their own stuff.

       As mentioned, removeddit.com does a poor job of this and comments will end up visible there more often in my experience.

       The way I see it, there are 3 possible scenarios here:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Knowing Reddit is under close watch by the government and advertisers already following the 2016 election, the mods are trying to proactively avoid stirring the shit and are purging the most controversial material independently. (IMHO: likely, especially given the commericalist neutrality Reddit keeps pushing towards achieve)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         These comments were planted and exploited to the top by Russian/ RU allied trolls as part of their anti-US propaganda campaign, and the mods suspected or somehow determined this abuse and reacted accordingly. (IMHO: plausible, but hinges on several caveats, namely that the mods were contacted by the admins and the admins had a way to identify this abuse without a way to stop it from happening)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The US government is not only creating content to steer public opinion, but actively suppressing content to do the same, and have enough pull on the mods to require the removal of content unfavorable to their own propaganda campaign, a violation of the first amendment. (IMHO: entirely possible, not entirely likely. Suppressing information by deleting it strikes me as too blatantly a 1A violation. I'd assume the NSA's modus operandi is more along the lines of creating and promoting their own content to distract from this information, which is more legally defensible.)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Regardless of which explanation is most accurate, what we're seeing here is alarming.

       Wasn't there a study that most Wikipedia edits come from one military base? Is there any similar data on Reddit? There has been a lot of evidence of govt tampering, taking over as mods, etc. IMO scenario three is much more likely than Russia.

       I am looking at it now and did what u/MKULTRAserialkillers suggested.  It is a shitshow of red markup.  Moderators removed a comment with 1,034 likes because the person commented that since they had seen the CIA was involved in many of the conspiracies they wondered what else the CIA was up too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't spend much time in ask reddit, but I don't think it is like Ask Historians with extremely strict posting guidelines.  Just looking at some of the front page, however, it doesn't seem so.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an NSFW query about What's the Weirdest thing you've seen in porn.  I am all for people doing whatever they want, if porn is ones thing that is fine, but in terms of censorship I think deleting any reference to the CIA in the threafd you mentioned but allowing a response to the porn question along the lines of  " a woman riding a car gear shift while listening to ABBA songs" strikes me as somewhat selective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if reddit hired outside "content caretakers" similar to youtube?  This is the third or fourth mention of censorship I have seen in the past five days and it seems like the censored content strikes me as odd.

       That site is so frustrating because the minimize buttons don’t work (at least not on my phone) so I can’t collapse a comment thread to see the next parent comment. I have to scroll through 30 days of Jeffrey Dahmer comments and end up giving up because I probably passed several parent comments because I started scrolling so fast just trying to get past one thread.

       Every time I open the app I think to my self "Boooooooooost" as I press the button. 
It's kinda sad that I NEED a third party app, as I think the mobile site if great. At least it would be if it wasn't for that self-hating "our mobile site succs, plz use the dedicated Reddit app" popping up all the time.

       I use Apollo because it’s the closest I could find to Alien Blue and I’ve grown to like it. I don’t want to download a separate app in order to collapse comments on a non-reddit site.

       For reddit comments, on the app I use I can just tap a comment to collapse it but the ceddit link opens in desktop mode and swiping left just moves the screen. The minimize buttons to the left of the comments are inactive so there’s no way to collapse a comment along with all of its replies.

       We must really be close to actual war. I'm still sort of seeing all this happen all at once in a haze. The think we've been shouting about like supposed lunatics for so long is like... actually happening. I wish I could feel happy and vindicated.

       If you want to get into Syria by any means and suddenly there’s a really popular thread showing many shady ways the government conducts business, especially when it wants war like op Northwood it’s not helping the cause. Do I agree with the opinion, I find it doubtful that a mod in askreddit is a government plant. But that’s the logic at least.

       It seems creepy at first but 99% now, whenever a thread like that is removed it's just because that it's becoming extremely common for mods to act like dogshit and powertrip and lock/delete threads for barely any reason at all.

       This is the one I was most interested in.  The other thing was it seemed if the letter CIA were in the post it was shitcanned, but I really liked the Kamera post and saw nothing subversive about it.

       Interesting you wonder that. I’ve seen the same increase in censorship the past several weeks, whether from YouTube and Reddit, or the increase in shitposting on certain Chan boards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hate to sound like one of those “happening” people but, is something happening or are the powers at be gearing up for something where it’s their best interest to NOT have people organizing info?

       I completely agree with you on these. I don't know if it has anything to do with something that we missed or not but it is definitely strange. I'll go ahead and say it,  I think something is happening that we are not aware of or are being shielded from.

       When the media obsesses over one issue it’s usually because they’re deflecting another’s coverage. In this case I believe it’s Syria and all the usual Trump stuff. While I don’t know EXACTLY what it is that could be being covered up, I have some ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could be that “world currency” thing that’s appeared on this sub several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could actually be events setting the stage for a large military confrontation. A lot of people online are saying “much WWIII”, which, I don’t know, seems like it would need a lot more than Syria to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d be a little hesitant to dive into any of the popular media topics at the moment, and instead try and get a better idea of the bigger picture. Times like these remind me of the saying “Nothing in politics happens by accident”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess we’ll see.

       About the WWIII,  I have actually pondered this myself as of late. I'm worried our government/president are going to cause it simply because they can't help but stick their noses where it doesn't belong and make themselves part of it. What's even worse is we are the ones who suffer while they sit in their cushy jobs/homes ect, and watch it all from the sidelines like it's some gladiator movie. Not trying to be anti patriotic here,  I'm just tired of we the people getting shit on everytime things start to get better for everyone. But that's just my opinion on things.

       To much heat over unarmed Palestinians shot dead AGAINST international law! Nothing like a bomb show to draw away the attention! Why would Syria chemical attack? So Americans have some moral high ground to attack? Why not just drop bombs? Since the only problem is a "chemical" attack? Look at the map of U.S. backed rebels, Kurds, ISIS, all together  fighting against Syrian government,  U.S. backed rebels share territory with ISIS, Israel tells the world Israel and ISIS have the same goals and are unofficial allies!  So I think we all know what is going on here, the information the world received on 911 was from Israel.

       Something is happening. It's a kind of digital project Blue Book as far as it looks at this moment. It's like the jaw is finally closing while they can still do it. It will get done while they have both Clinton and Trump against the floor, boots to their necks.

       The question is, are we that much in danger? Is it really this touch and go, that people are willing to just say 'screw the first ammendment at my watch.'

       We've said 'this is 1984' a lot-- kind of like a boy who cried wolf scenerio.

       But there are a convergence of technologies and cultures and dynamics that are taking us to some kind of huge decision point.

       What you say does line up with the haste to take down Facebook and its reputation. Its the biggest online arena that people air their opinions and theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's not me saying Facebook shouldn't be exposed, along with all the other sites harvesting information. I just wonder why suddenly they were so willing to let Facebook take a hit like that, at this time.

       Everytime I post in that sub about things and speak my opinions about things I'm called a sheeple,  idiot, ect. Didn't know that people must share the same views on things over there.  Guess opinions dont matter and god forbid if you miss anything they consider crucial evidence and make a wrong opinionated viewpoint on something. I tend to just stay away from over there and just read what I see.

       I can literally feel the madness pushing in when all I am (sometimes? often?) trying to do is lead opposing sides to understanding that if they perceive the other side hypocrites and worthy of being completely ignored and shut down, it is likely they are missing something huge.

      <p>
       Yep, and you'll see much, much more unless reddit fixes it. Sadly, it's not even a conspiracy. What it actually is is that reddit mods are given terrible, limited tools for moderation, and when something is on the front page, the overload is absurd. The only way to even kind of keep up is to carpet bomb everything with deletions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's reddit that is broken, and it's only getting worse because it's a scaling issue, unless better mod tools and auto moderation tools for high volume threads are added.
      </p>
      <p>
       But,
       <em>
        and this is critical
       </em>
       , reddit needs better transparency and accountability for mods. The anonymity and non-accountability of mod actions is just as crippling as lack of mod tools.

       This particular thread appears to be a repost from last year, almost exactly 360 days to be exact and many of the removed comments were also reposts. There's something more going on here and I think it's Reddit cracking down on bot accounts in this instance, but it appears that they don't want to talk about it.

       Yeah that's what I don't get. It's like they don't want to admit they have that bad of a bot problem. They might not want to admit that some of their content is literally just reposts by bots.

       It's funny because it's hypocritical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The_donald's mod constantly remove all dissenting options.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now it's especially hilarious. 2 days ago, the accepted narrative was that the chemical attacks in Syria either didn't happen or were a false flag and dissenting opinions were crushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's exactly 180 degrees from that and Trump is the greatest for punishing Assad for his chemical attacks. The old threads pushing the former narrative are getting deleted.

       And a lot of people here think reddit is some kind of free open forum that is there just to serve It's users... Seriously, we gotta raise awareness about they pushing the narratives they want because there has been an agenda about destroying the level of discussion on reddit. It all started with eliminating being able to see the upvote and downvote rate in order to encourage circle jerking and hide brigades.

       google "hillary clinton racist" notice anything? every single result mentions trump. now google "hillary clinton racist" but add -trump (which removes trump-related results). not a single result from after june 2016. almost like all mentions were wiped for the election...

       Ceddit is run on Snew, a "parody" client using open source, managed by users to fight against reddit censorship.

       It's probably seeing a huge spike in traffic because of this nuking and isn't handling it well.

       Usually, yes. This is one of several sites that caches Reddit comments.  A way to try and circumvent this is to manually edit your comment before you delete it. Doesn't work 100%. There are programs people have written to do this but I haven't tried any of them yet.

       Replace the reddit.com with ceddit.com on any comments page URL and it will uncensored the removed comments to allow you to see what was removed. Very handy tool in the recent months.

       Not the first reddit link today to be 'unresponsive', and not a thing I've been bothered with previously either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been suspicious of my reddit feed the last few days. I'm not getting links to r/news or r/worldnews on my frontpage
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       the frontpage of r/all, I've been having to open those subs from my drop-down menu.

       Perfectly fine with making the US seem as evil as possible but showcase how other countries are just as bad if not worse than suddenly it doesn't fit the narrative they are trying to push so it must be removed. Just propaganda to further bring down the US nationalism spirit in an attempt to destroy the nation.

       Suppress . Deflect. Redirect. They try as them might. IMO: it's a loosing battle. To much content to cover. The truth will come, sad part is, history will repeat itself (many are and will fall, as past before them). And what they thought was in their favor, will be took in a blink of a eye. Their Subversions they perpetuated over. What's the main reward at the end?

       But what's the motivation of pulling out the the nuke button for the top comments that they removed? Reddit admins almost never delete entire threads without reason -- I mean they delete entire threads often, but it's always because it is politically inconvenient or discredits something they don't want discredited.

       Try asking them and see what they say? If they don't have one or have an unreasonable one that would help demonstrate your argument. The majority of this thread is basically just people saying I knew it! Case closed! The confirmation bias is off the charts.

       So the top post at the time I saw involved how Russia almost nuked us because the US and Norway we're studying Aurora Boreallis via some rocket. So not many people realize the serious tag applies to
       <em>
        all comments
       </em>
       so if any Steamed Hams jokes that such a story would inevitably spawn would get removed. That's all I meant by that.

       Can confirm there was a comment about Aurora Borealis and a close-call with Russia. Many of the responses to that comment were pointing out how many close-calls with nukes there have been.

       CIA?  Are they even around anymore? I mean, it's all "Russian bots this and Russian
Bots that."  One would think our CIA would be interested in media manipulation too.   Someone should tell them about it.

       It is imperative that we take control and own our own discourse channels.  Anything like Reddit which is paid for by advertisers are likely to include the DoD.  We have to build and own our own network that does not track us or censor us.  Decentralized.  It should of course also be aimed at finding truth and facilitating discussion not aimed at "just getting two cents in" or "getting upvotes" and sure as shit no memes.

       That thread isn't nuked. It's still visible on the front page of the subreddit and the vast majority of comments are still there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the deleted top-level comments seem to just be complaining about the initial deletions, which were because they didn't answer the question at hand (specifically declassified documents).

       Commenting super late to the game, but I saw this thread yesterday and it was
       <em>
        amazing
       </em>
       . Lots of really good, clear info. Including stuff I hadn’t heard of before. That it’s been censored to this degree is highly disturbing and
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       suspect. In fact it’s actually damning and the last benefit of the doubt I’d give Reddit is now gone.

       Might be a good idea for those that are copy/pasting blurbs to take heed of this, and add in a couple various edited versions, as they may actually be flagged as some sort of bot for doing so.

       Its a very sad thread TBH.  Theres people in there calling ANY type of 9/11 truther fucking retards...even one as simple as the government let it happen.  I mentioned operation northwoods, and planes hitting targets to get us into war with cuba etc etc--and then bring up the correlation with 9/11, and people immediately rolled up on me talking massive shit, and how retarded people are who dont trust the government to have our best interests at heart.

       I'm looking at it now and there are tons of comments about CIA stuff, including the top comment thread, about the Phoenix program, and lower down is Northwoods.  I'd like to know how they're deciding what to delete, but it doesn't seem like a blanket deletion of CIA comments.

       Well when you think about it you can leave pretty much anything that can be found on the CIA controversy or the Regime change CIA wiki pages.

       Gatekeeping the more obscure documents, stuff like the Police report after the search of Jeff Epstein's Florida mansion. There were cameras found, as well as a kid's report card. Creepy stuff considering Trump and Bill Clinton's connections.

       What you used as an example isn’t even a conspiracy it’s apart of history that is well known a lot of our technology back then came from the nazis they are the reason we got a huge jump in rocket science, space and aerospace technologies. The V2 rocket was genius and laid the foundation for what we have today.

       Luckily read the top comments when it only had top comments with 200+ upvotes and that top one was where one person literally shared a bunch of conspiracies with detail and evidence to back up (links and all that). It was quite interesting and informative. Then I saw this and was like no way!

       Internet censorship at its finest. Forget complex algorithms and AIs. Moderators are the future. Salty ass biased moderators. I spent a good few hours reading that thread the other day. Always annoying to see comments with 10,000 upvotes be removed. Like what did they say? Bugs me to all hell.

       But what's the motivation of pulling out the the nuke button for the top comments that they removed? Reddit admins almost never delete entire threads without reason -- I mean they delete entire threads often, but it's always because it is politically inconvenient or discredits something they don't want discredited.
