       This is just my personal opinion. Looking for the illuminati is like looking for a straw in a haystack. You'll find it if you're looking for it and it was right in front of us the whole time. Which makes the search redundant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the illuminati are so illuminated, then why are they secret? It's arguable that the world would be much more illuminated if there were less secrets. Let's say they think not. They stay secret because they don't trust the public with dangerous ideas. Even if that's true, it's just ego thinking it's better than another. That's pretty dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is messy and chaotic, with order on the mind it can be easy to manipulate the chaos into your own ideals without directly pushing an agenda. So are they the becoming world order there to manipulate the chaos for their whim? Well if it's a group of sociopaths maybe. This is the first time I say maybe because it's plausible. But still doesn't make sense. Being a small secret group is an embodiment of lack of trust to believe we're all in this together, and that there is hope. We live in a society where trust isn't abundant especially towards authority, common people live antisocial lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we created the illuminati all on our own, in our heads. What would make sense is if they actually are real now, because the idea was made for them. If that's true then it's a group of delusional wackos that think control is the only way to face life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or I just haven't done my research and that there's much irrefutable evidence throughout.

       Illuminati means the enlightened and the enlightened know the secrets of the cosmos. The the military industrial complex has all the keys to the occult.

       thanks for actually discussing something and not just downvoting and moving on lol

       Im not going to claim enlightened for myself, but ive had enlightening experiences. Those of which Ive found were about togetherness and being connected. The very idea of this group pushes against that. Thats why I came to the point that we made them up. If theyre so enlightened how could they not see this? They probably already did and looked at it like its primitive; betraying the very instincts of what it is to be human

       You’re kind of on the right track but your not thinking big enough. There’s a reason they push against togetherness/harmony. They use the vibrations of negative energy as a form of control. Give this video a watch and it’ll start you down the rabbit hole.

       im 20 minutes into the first video.

       I grew up more right brained, I didnt put things into boxes. The more negative things that happened around me the more I compartmentalized. The more I saw duality. Now that I think about it, it seems that I was introduced to more left brain thinking. lol I remember around high school when I learned about left/right brain thinking and I took off with it. I saw the failings of logic, but not creativeness. I became more idealistic. When I tried to express this to others I got strikingly low amount of energy from it. Thats when I got more arrogant in my thought process. I had given up some creativity to try and control others to listen. People didnt like that. I got nowhere with it. Only when I integrated the idea that I cant know these things for sure that it started to humble me. But it turned into discouragement. I was ignorant of how my ego controlled me. I wouldnt let go. My creativity became more hidden, even though I always knew it was there, I hid it. But I couldnt ignore it no matter how hard I tried. If I tried really hard I became chaos. As if something in me was trying to reach out and I wouldnt let it. The battle of duality ensued in me. Recently Ive started to see logic not as a guide but a tool. A way ive used it is to tell myself to take a stance of opinion even if Im wrong. Logic as a guide would tell me to not jump unless I Know Im Right. This battle of duality of mine probably would have continued being twisted by my ego had I not tried lsd. I believe I had a kundalini experience my first time. It changed everything for me. I felt spiritually filled for about 3 months without changing much at all about my daily habits. Which was of course, created before my experience. Still dont quite know how to not listen to my arrogance, its taken time.

       This guy talking about atlantis and martians; idk about all that, but it sure as hell fits the narrative. I always loved the story of atlantis in all its forms. I even made my own atlantis in minecraft. Anyways theres my life story lol. Funny how 20 minutes of this had me pull all that together.

       Havnt tried lsd but I dabble with some psilocybin every once in awhile. Also you wanted to understand the Illuminati so I wanted to show you a simple video explaining there is a great amount of history we’ve never been told because of the indoctrination of public schools. As for mars I know it’s super abstract but It’s confirmed they are pyramids on mars and they’ve found xenon 129 which proves there was a nuclear war. If you keep digging deeper you’ll realize everything we’ve learned is a lie.

       Yeah I was searching for something I didnt know I would find. I like abstract, with skepticism it makes it harder to see and would take much longer to reach the same conclusion. With credulity it writes itself. Its like if you let yourself believe the seemingly absurd, it becomes worth investigating. Making it not really matter what is investigated. Like flat earthers. Seems absurd, but is insisted, so we must learn from it. Someone could find a deep truth about ourselves. Or like president trump; seems absurd

       Approach everything with an open mind. Someone with a lot of knowledge is simply someone who wants to learn. You said yourself logic is a tool so I guess if things make sense logically it’s justified in a way. Remember only small minds bring up politics. Politics is just a system to blind us from what’s really happening.

       I can't help but think the Illuminati is more like the so-called "cloud" in that most people see it as a single entity but truly it is an interconnected network of different parts. Think Game of Thrones and the seven ruling houses fighting for the throne.

       I think there are groups within vying for control and we simply are not part of the club.

       yeah, I had a thought that was misdirected. Now that Ive given it some time, the point I was trying to make is that if we view them as insiders looking out and we as outsiders looking in, thats just what we will be. In a matter of perspective, theyre just like us. Or in better words; just like us. As us is us. We all have the consciousness capability to see the big picture, only governed by choices within and around us.

       If you don't believe in all the occult shit people attribute to them, just know that these individuals are a part of an oligarchy. That part is very much real and is a symptom of all democratic societies. This same oligarchy could in fact behave in the same ways that people attribute to the illuminati short of sacrificing and spirit cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean let's be honest. If any of us were rich as all hell we would do things that affect our surroundings in the way we like. It's a fact. People like to say "Oh I'd travel the world! Live comfortably!". While true, you will also clean your doorstep. Or if you don't like Mexicans you'll stop them from getting into your country. If you don't like blacks you'd suppress them since they are already in your society. So on so forth. If you have the ability to change things the way you see fit, you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe all of these people are inherently evil. There is no such thing as good and evil. People do things based on what they believe to be right, based on their own philosophies. And if you are apart of a group of all also wealthy individuals, you'd probably subscribe to the same agendas in most cases. It's just a fact. Whatever the end goal, you'd trudge to that point. Every. Single. Person. Here. Would do the same.

       But yeah, its too much power for one person unearned. Not that any one person shouldnt have that much power, its how they got it. Theres too much weight of power given to money regardless of how incredibly useful it is. The nature of the system

       I won't post a comment I made some time ago in its entirety, but socialism is the natural end goal of humanity whether we like it not. With the rapid growth of humanity and the separation of economic classes, a serious decision will need to be made. Those decisions have been discussed all over the place so I won't reiterate them here; you imagination and intelligence should lead you to what I'm implying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I see it as natural progression, just as much as human evolution. Communism leads into capitalism. Capitalism will lead to socialism ONLY in a society of
       <em>
        continued
       </em>
       growth, such that technology is one of those growth factors. As we increase automation, this will lead into socialism and then our final human evolution, utopia. If we don't choose socialism with our increased automation we face: slavery/serfs, mass subjugation, or finally, mass extermination.

       True socialism isn't really be though. If there is one thing you should know, growth through history is exponential. Sure people won't subscribe to "sharing" with freeloaders, but know that rights are just man made projections to protect our individual persons. You don't have a "right" to what you "earned" because someone or something can just take it from you. Laws in capitalism protected us up to this point. But the fact is, everything we have as individuals was built on a system to which we all agreed to that would prevent "chaos" (think wild west). My point is that a period of socialism shouldn't last more than a generation before we rely solely on automation. You won't be sharing anything of your own because you won't own anything, and every person would be beholden to themselves and their own desires. Ideally none of those desires will infringe upon another person's life in a negative way.
      </p>

       Tldr: share for a few years and then never have to share again.

       freeloading, ideally, wouldnt be much of a problem because people would not feel the need to be afraid of government. Without a reason the cycle sort of stops. Suddenly people who had a part in this fear have nothing to do for the time they invested regularly in it. Boredom is challenging to create something to do. You did yadayada quite a bit of time id bet though. Beautiful dream. Very idealistic I like it. In my mind I see people floating around for some reason in a city like setting. idk

       So your saying my computer that is very cherished wouldnt be necessary to keep because the machines would be pumping out the tight ass monitors and gpus that I just say fuck this old shit. It would then be put into some sort of recycling system that is around 99% efficient. Then from the newly found arbitrary feeling of wanting a computer would have me not caring as much with or without it. To later incentivize better wholesome interactions.

       Hmm... ok. It's not a dream, it's a fact. There are 2 choices we are coming to. Either freeload as you call it, which doesn't take in the argument of altruism, or die. It's really as simple as that. If this idealistic dream is the option to prevent a culling of the population, so be it. Simple fact is, as we are going, there won't be room on this planet for you, or me, or the majority of the population.

       I dont think you can call future fact. Yeah theres a natural order to things in which its predictable. Its just things typically dont turn out they way we think it will. But its a great goal to keep in mind until once we get there. Help us aim right
