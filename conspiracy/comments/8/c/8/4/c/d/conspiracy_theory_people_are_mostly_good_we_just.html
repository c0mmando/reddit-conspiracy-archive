<p>Ordinary people get up, go to work, have an uneventful day and then go home to eat &amp; sleep.</p>

<p>That&#39;s MOST people&#39;s lives. It&#39;s my life.
The media knows this.
People don&#39;t want to read about what they already know, that&#39;s boring... They want something different, they want excitement.
Murderers, wars, criminals... They&#39;re all &#39;exciting&#39; because it&#39;s completely different to our normal, boring life.
That&#39;s why we hear so much bad stuff in the news.</p>

It proves that people will not simply stand up and say, &quot;I will not hurt another person.&quot;  No one does in the initial experiment.

The experiment is shocking, so is the other one I mentioned, and both prove human beings only care about themselves. </p>

<p>Edit: what if you were afraid harm could come to you if you didn’t comply?</p>

<p>The harm was only going to the person supposedly needing to get the words right, in the next room.  The person administering it, was only told &quot;you must go on&quot;.   In other words, no harm was going to come to them.  They would often go until the shock was at maximum, and no sound came from the individual, as if you had shocked them to death or passing out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That book is a lot of nonsense. Diagnosed phycopaths are mostly from the prison population. Many actually work for the police and are soldiers as well. Sociopath next door is better read as narcissist next door. It’s fear porn what ever what you look at it, most people are decent people. Sociopathy and phycopathy doesn’t make you not a decent person it’s just a crappy label. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I’m no psychiatrist that’s for sure. I looked into it cos I suspected an ex of being psychopathic until I learnt more about it. She has BPD by the sounds of it. But still I realised what a misunderstood label it was and the marketing it gets probably not justified. So I wonder if it’s too a simplistic label. </p>

<p>Whether they are or are not I think we can all agree power corrupts. When we work together as a society again, then we have the power. And we can be the ones to get corrupted (I like the sound of that : ) ) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet, we need a kind of psychopathy for large scale leadership. This is not meant to validate any specific person or behavior, but consider for a moment that our species evolved these traits and <em>needs</em> them in a controlled proportion and balance.</p>

<p>Imagine a CEO who is able to empathize directly with each of his employees. All 100,000 of them.</p>

<p>Now, the economy crashes and he has to lay of 15,000 workers. Can you imagine the human toll having to let 15 THOUSAND people go--to put them out of a job. What about their families, their children? That CEO is ruining lives whether he likes it or not.</p>

<p>Even ethical, good leaders need some psychopathy so they can keep going when the going gets really hard.. If you believe there are such a thing as &#39;Good&#39; generals, they must certainly fall in this category.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get caught up on the numbers. People are mostly good. We are caught in an algorithm that is poorly fashioned, cobbled together, and older than the computers we have created to run them at lightning speed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s plenty that a CEO could do. The former CEO of Nintendo took a 50% pay cut for the next several months along with members of the board so that a shit ton of his workers wouldn’t get laid off. And clearly it worked for the better. Nintendo to this day still has real good stock and they have since rebounded many times over thanks to successful switch sales.They’re a pretty big company too but not as big as others. So imagine what the bigger companies could do to help all their other workers if they really wanted to(walmart/target/mcdonalds/etc). An empathetic leader with common sense would explain to the people they’re laying off that somethings fucky is going on at the top and would encourage their employees to educate and take action on matters that are affecting them. It just seems like a true Leader/CEO would put their money before letting their employees go so if an employer isn’t directly having their funds reduced to help stabilize the company then that person can’t say shit about how he/she feels bad to let people go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. One does not offeset the other. A bit of a straw man here. There are good CEOs. But there are also hard choices for the good of a company. There is a lag between what is possible/what works best, and implementation of change.</p>

<p>Simply the moral equation of how to pay someone what the market says their worth vs. an equal standard of living for employees is constantly in flux.</p>

<p>Though the absurdity of cutting corporate income tax rate ad nauseum and continuing to squeeze the bottom end for profitability is absurd, there truly is value for the whole in employees who generate more revenue than others.</p>

<p>Balancing these things is very difficult. </p>

<p>One can still have a measure of psychopathy and make morally sound decisions. Hence &#39;the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.&#39;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a logical, cold way of looking at morality, rather than emotional/empathy driven. That&#39;s my only point, here.</p>

<p>It is illogical to treat people badly in a way that either looks like or is selfishly motivated--you will pay that debt in one way or the other--unhappy workers, decreased productivity.. long term self sabotage, really.  The best CEOs understand this, and it doesn&#39;t really matter if it comes from a moral direction or a long term outlook on employee happiness.</p>

<p>Personally, I stopped seeking jobs that I had that paid 50-60% more than I make now, because the stress was too high--it took such a toll on me personally and emotionally.</p>

<p>That said, when I was paid that much, i was much more responsible for acquiring new work, managing projects successfully that provided income to those involved, etc, etc.</p>

<p>One does truly wear the burden of leadership. In my industry (as a creative) the dysfunction between the money side and the creative side is often unintentionally abusive towards the creatives, and incredibly frustrating for the accounts, due to unpredictability.</p>

<p>I was caught in the middle, because I am a person who &#39;sees both sides&#39; But it was also hell.</p>

<p>People on the lower end, who never step into management love to complain about how the bosses don&#39;t &#39;get it&#39; but also don&#39;t exactly step up to the plate to lead instead of gripe, I&#39;ve found.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a griper and I&#39;ve been a manager. Now I&#39;m trying to limit my griping, or step forward with responsibility, but that too is difficult.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the responsibility of both the management and the employees to work together, and good leadership and good management do not come together. The best organizations require both.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not just about killing though. everyone makes bad decisions. however small they add up to keep the world in a balanced state. Things that bring us comfort in the western world devastate people across the globe. we dont actively contribute to evil but we most definitely keep it a float. We know this but for the sake of comfort we dont challenge our way of life. 10% percent of the couldnt do so much evil without the consent of the 90%.</p>

<p>but its my opinion i see what you mean it does seem like most people are good most of the time but our view of good is kinda relative outside of extreme circumstances</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What questions are you asking? How are you coming at them? Do you know them?</p>

<p>More importantly- are you trying to change that person?</p>

<p>People don&#39;t like to be changed. They think their views are a part of their being and therefore, they&#39;re not about to change just because you&#39;re skeptical about something. </p>

<p>People change and go through developments through (usually) rituals.</p>

<p>I used to not like that, when people would just glaze over and say something along the lines of &quot;That&#39;s just how it is,&quot; but the truth is- sometimes, <em>that&#39;s just how it is.</em> You can talk about what may be going on the world- but the reality is, what are you going to do about it, and what do you expect that other person to do about it?</p>

<p>Ok, this is happening- and?</p>

<p>They&#39;re worried about their 9 to 5, their kid, the things they need to do just to ensure their own survival- and you&#39;re asking them to add something else to their list of worries?</p>

<p>Not to sound rude, but it&#39;s like- I got this reality check a while ago; that people are just not going to see things the same way you do. You&#39;ve been initiated into these forums where you openly analyze these situations- a lot of people haven&#39;t. You didn&#39;t just find yourself here one day, or maybe you did. What are your <em>core</em> beliefs. What do you think about human beings? Take that into consideration.</p>

<p>TL;DR: This is not pie in the sky--it&#39;s just complicated, and I gotta figure out where the good Avengers are, and join up, because the zombies far outnumber the not-zombies, and we have not yet found the anti-zombie vaccine. And those anti-vax space cadets wouldn&#39;t use it anyway, cause they think autism comes from them, when autism really comes from epigenetic evolution of our species in a time where decreasing human contact and increasing relationships with media are altering basic human connectivity, generation over generation.</p>

<p>And of course you&#39;d see a correlation between kids who are vaccinated, because they&#39;re more likely to go into public schools or schools in general earlier, and therefore experience less 1-on-1 human guidence than the hippie cosleeping moms.</p>

<p>But you&#39;ll never catch parents of Autistic kids even considering that it might be nurture over external &#39;disease.&#39;</p>

<p>Same with mental health. People would rather think I&#39;m crazy rather than consider that their inability to consider that I&#39;m not might be the thing that&#39;s making me seem crazy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all- I just wanna be honest and say, after reading that whole thing... you seem crazy as hell. Let me just get my judgment out of the way so you can see where I&#39;m coming from.</p>

<p>Listen, I hate to be the one to say this, but you don&#39;t know me. I know a little bit about you from what I&#39;ve read, but I barely know you either.</p>

<p>You&#39;re asking me to help- but what can I even do? You don&#39;t know a damn thing about me.</p>

<p>You might say you&#39;re grown and you&#39;ve been through shit but you might just be a bored twenty-year old looking for time to kill.</p>

<p>Listen, you might be smart, but I&#39;m smart enough to know who to give my time to. When you actually have a goal and direction- please, ask anyone, including me, for as much help as you need. But right now, as smart as you say you are, you&#39;re putting a whole lot of energy into asking for attention, and not actually asking for help. Help would mean you can <em>show</em> me you&#39;re trying to do something, and you&#39;d like me to use my energy and time to participate as well. If you can give me a reason, or even show me your own efforts to make come about this &quot;global awakening&quot; (or let me clarify, this &quot;Western world awakening&quot;), then hit me up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate your reading it.</p>

<p>I am &#39;functionally bipolar.&#39; You are sticking me in the loop.. I understand your frustration and desire. &quot;Tell me what you want from me, tell me in a concise way what you are doing/what it is you are saying&quot;</p>

<p>What I am doing is trying to find people who can see it and help shape the message. Because of where I&#39;ve gone, I can no longer triangulate myself. I mean, I am aware what I must look like to certain people, but if I &#39;pretend&#39; to be more human, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d look something like Zuck.</p>

<p>Accepting that I want attention, I ask you to consider that there is a decade or more of anti-attention-grabbing protection--a mechanism developed to avoid being gamed by advertisers, catfish etc. We have become experts at instinctively sensatizing ourselves to what amounts to promotion--be it a need for attention personally or economically.</p>

<p>I work in advertising. It&#39;s that.</p>

<p>Ironically, I&#39;m an editor, but I am awful at editing myself. It is the chicken or the egg, because when I pick one direction, and create something that has to be, by it&#39;s very nature, incomplete, inevitably it&#39;s dismissed as not-having the perfect messaging. Can you imagine how difficult this would be to do over and over again in a vacuum while trying to maintain the rest of my life?</p>

<p>The &#39;help&#39; I need is first and foremost a partner-- one that is good with face to face, unafraid of the pitfalls I discussed, and understands that my &#39;ability&#39; is to leverage all the things I discussed in what you perceive to be a bid for attention.</p>

<p>1) yes, I want to be heard, but god, I don&#39;t want to be famous at all. I don&#39;t want to start a content stream--that&#39;s why I don&#39;t. It&#39;s a trap. </p>

<p>We are repeating the cycle even now. Of course, I am working on other things at the same time, but when I come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I seem even more unhinged, because this is one of the few places that can follow that stuff, and go deep down a rabbit hole.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that I don&#39;t think in a million years that my stuff is any weirder than most of the conspiracy stuff that comes through here, but I am the one who &#39;seems crazy.&#39;</p>

<p>But, I have also come to accept that I&#39;m a space alien. Take that however you will. Thanks for reading, though.</p>

<p>Is that what&#39;s running through my mind? I&#39;ll be honest- yeah.</p>

<p>Hey... I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing- but you&#39;re going to need to find a way to articulate at least change you expect to do before you ask anyone to give you their word that they&#39;ll work with you.</p>

<p>Sincerely, without the intention to provoke you, it sounds like you&#39;re communicating this:</p>

<p>&quot;I need help to do something that has to do with making a change in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s like... what change do you even want? What are you trying to do?</p>

<p>There&#39;s no cycle, you just keep writing a lot but <em>you&#39;re actually not saying anything.</em> I can&#39;t say &quot;that sounds interesting, I&#39;d like to start researching that,&quot; or &quot;no, leave me alone,&quot; because there&#39;s no subject at hand. There&#39;s no foundation to what you&#39;re saying. It&#39;s a wonder I&#39;m even replying now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience most people are well intentioned, kind, and unselfish. But they also easily manipulated by fear, group think, and mass media. They will go along with the crowd, no matter what the crowd is doing. They lack faith in themselves and their own beliefs, so when someone else says with strong conviction &quot;this is what is just and right&quot; people will agree with it even if deep down, they actually don&#39;t. But they aren&#39;t actually conscious of that deep down feeling, they suppress it because &quot;if everyone else is doing it, they must be right.&quot;</p>

<p>I think most people are afraid to truly listen to what is in their heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adding to this, I firmly believe that racism and anti-Semitism are red herrings designed to throw off people who are inclined to investigate conspiracies, but also want an easy tangible enemy to blame.</p>

<p>The power lies solely with the people with the most money and heads of massive corporations. That&#39;s barely even a conspiracy, people who call the shots obviously have power over those below them. Conflicts of race, religion and creed are all designed to keep us fighting with our neighbors instead of realizing that there&#39;s an incredibly privileged and powerful world out there that 99% of people will never even get close to experiencing.</p>

<p>That thought (sort of) is what got me over my depression the first time, I need to get back on track.</p>

<p>It was more a mixture of thoughts, but this thought has been on it&#39;s last leg...hell it downright fell over, and I have been attributing it to all people instead of the person it belongs to, and worse...I forgave the specific person, but let the toxic waste leftover from them poison my thoughts on all other people. </p>

<p>I need to go back to OP&#39;s thought - but god damn if this doesn&#39;t give me a small high, it&#39;s exactly what I needed to see, and it led to the exact topic I needed to confront mentally and the effect it was having on my views of others...so I can get back to the right mindset</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know- people are free to do what they want. And most of the time it may have nothing to do with you, &amp; that&#39;s the sad part.</p>

<p>People who use you for sex, initiate you into their stoner groups so they don&#39;t feel alone while they&#39;re getting high, encourage you to bully others with them so they can reaffirm their own position...</p>

<p>It&#39;s like, what are good intentions. Some people&#39;s only intention is to make themselves feel better, whatever that may mean in the moment. But if you know better then you&#39;ll do better. Be the smart one.</p>

<p>People are not mostly good. Because what does that even mean- you have a comment section full of people who probably have different ideas of what it means to be good.</p>

<p>And while a lot of you may say, &quot;good&quot; means to &quot;not be selfish,&quot; well then how are you doing in that department? Ain&#39;t nobody here can say they&#39;ve never hurt someone or acted out in selfishness. Not a single person.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to judge other people. That&#39;s exhausting. I <em>been</em> judged my whole life. If you&#39;re reading this- you&#39;re judging me right now from the inside of your own head with no way of even knowing what I look like. Is that good? When you tear someone else&#39;s character down on an online forum because you misunderstood something they were saying- is that good? When you decide to hurt someone because you feel hurt- is that good?</p>

<p>So, consider these questions- what&#39;s good? And are you? Can a good deed be measured? Can an evil act be weighed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both can be weighed by observing the receiving person’s emotional reaction to each situation. doing something good means you brought the livelihood of someone up or you encouraged a positive reaction from their emotions or they’re feeling/value of who they are as a human being for the better. That is what it means to do good. An evil person isn’t going to teach you respect and fairness about your fellow human beings and that there is good example on how to weed out someone who would be an evil person. Most people are just sadly uneducated about things they buy and what products hurt certain people based on resource exploitation, slavery, etc. it’s sad that the daily 9 to 5 or usual grind of every day life tasks keep people from having the time to just take a step back and realize what’s going on and what they’re feeding into. There’s no stopping the ride once you’re on. And that’s the exhausting part. I think everywhere people are just tired.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really have to challenge you on the response you gave to one of my points- <em>can a good act be weighed.</em></p>

<p>Bear with me, but imagine... you admire a girl and would like to court her, however, all you can afford to give her is a rose that you grew in a little dirt patch. In the back of your mind, you feel the rose is a symbol of your faith and devotion.</p>

<p>However, another suitor is also competing for her attention, and has given her a house and a the carcass of a deer, a symbol to ensure her livelihood.</p>

<p>Which act is better? Which &quot;good deed&quot; outweighs the other? </p>

<p>When a Westerner goes a to foreign village and introduces money into their systems because they believe they will &quot;develop&quot; this way, only for such an act to result in the complete destabilization of their way of life- one which they were much happier with- is that a good deed?</p>

<p>If a mother catches her son using drugs, and she scolds him and disposes of the substances- to which he cries out and rebukes her in response- is that a good act?</p>

<p>If, because of her actions today that bring to him the pain of letting go of drugs and the shame of being caught, to which he regains focus out of his sobriety and becomes happier in the future and lives long- are her actions good?</p>

<p>If he rebels and flees from his family out of shame, and continues to do drugs which results in his early demise- was that mother&#39;s actions still good?</p>

<p>Can I ask you something, out of curiosity. Not related to the discussion at hand. Would you rather be pretty, ignorant and easily amused, or ugly, intelligent and hard to please?</p>

<p><a href="https://pastebin.com/ZBZaSk8T">https://pastebin.com/ZBZaSk8T</a></p>

<p>TL;DR: This is not pie in the sky--it&#39;s just complicated, and I gotta figure out where the good Avengers are, and join up, because the zombies far outnumber the not-zombies, and we have not yet found the anti-zombie vaccine. And those anti-vax space cadets wouldn&#39;t use it anyway, cause they think autism comes from them, when autism really comes from epigenetic evolution of our species in a time where decreasing human contact and increasing relationships with media are altering basic human connectivity, generation over generation.</p>

<p>And of course you&#39;d see a correlation between kids who are vaccinated, because they&#39;re more likely to go into public schools or schools in general earlier, and therefore experience less 1-on-1 human guidence than the hippie cosleeping moms.</p>

<p>But you&#39;ll never catch parents of Autistic kids even considering that it might be nurture over external &#39;disease.&#39;</p>

<p>Same with mental health. People would rather think I&#39;m crazy rather than consider that their inability to consider that I&#39;m not might be the thing that&#39;s making me seem crazy.</p>

<p>...you know.. stuff like that.</p>
