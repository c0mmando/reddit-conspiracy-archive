        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The subject of john oliver came up when a colleague (fellow psychologist) and l were discussing politics a few months ago. Although we were both in agreement regarding the general liberal insanity of the HBO show, my friend was surprised when I explained that the real insidiousness of it is its unmistakably hypnotic structure and pacing.</p>

<p>I ended up pulling up an episode or two off of youtube to show her what I meant. All of the segments I&#39;ve ever seen from this show follow the same repetitive format: present some &quot;argumentation&quot; and &quot;facts&quot; for about 10 seconds, then quickly follow these up with a snarky quip (which themselves overwhelmingly take the form of complete non-sequitur or otherwise absurd metaphor) before any rational processing of the preceding argument can take place in the mind of the viewer. Further telling is that the only &#39;beats&#39; or mental pauses in the show&#39;s pacing exist solely to highlight the approving laughter or applause of the studio audience. Repeat this basic formula without variation 20-40 times in a row and you have one of the 12-20 minute segments&#39; that form the backbone of the show.</p>

<p>The end effect is (obviously) not to deliver information, but rather to literally teach the viewers - on a subconscious level - to mentally associate derisive laughter with any person or opinion that is at odds with the narrative&#39;s take on the chosen issue. And it accomplishes this by maintaining a strict adherence to a roughly 20-second cycle in which a stimulus is presented, and a response is cued. This is the sense in which the show is fundamentally hypnotic in effect - even moreso than its precursors in the genre (Daily Show, Colbert, etc).</p>

<p>To my mind, oliver&#39;s show is representative of the media&#39;s increasing mastery of the methodologies of mass conditioning; in fact it is almost such a perfect technical accomplishment that I would almost have to admire it on technical grounds, which moreover is in the hands of the entirely wrong people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its true that Oliver does point out some issues but overall he punches down. That is, watch his smears of the 3rd party candidates. To attack Jill Stein in favor of Hillary Clinton is gross. Most of the segments he performs don&#39;t really push buttons or rattle cages they just plavate the viewer (young,educated, liberal, coastal) with  the weak arguments they  are programmed to believe from their upbringing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your observations are interesting.  I&#39;m not agreeing with what you are saying, nor do I disagree.  I will add something else kind of interesting...  <a href="http://time.com/3674807/john-oliver-net-neutrality-civil-forfeiture-miss-america/">http://time.com/3674807/john-oliver-net-neutrality-civil-forfeiture-miss-america/</a>  </p>

<p>Another interesting effect not listed above, was when he ran a segment on the corruption of FIFA officials.  Very shortly after the show aired, the hammer came down on FIFA, if you recall, and the Chair or CEO or whatever the head guy of FIFA stepped down.   When these &quot;effects&quot; were happening, as they were happening, it was pretty crazy, and you couldn&#39;t help but like the guy more.  Sometimes it would feel like he was somewhat responsible for it happening, by shining a bright light on the injustices of the world, which made you like him even more. </p>

<p>What does this mean, and how does it connect to your theory?  Well, after having taken a step back when he was off season, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if John Oliver/producers knowingly or unknowingly, might have been given details before things were happening anyway, by people in very high places.  I&#39;ll let you decide who that might be and to what end I&#39;m not sure, other than to exalt John Oliver to some degree, or to give massive credence to his show very early on, which then they could implement your plan you stated in your original theory.</p>

<p>I do like John Oliver, he&#39;s funny most of the time and watch the show every week, so take that for what it&#39;s worth. </p>
