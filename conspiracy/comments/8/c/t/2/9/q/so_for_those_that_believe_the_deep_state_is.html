       yeah it's funny how this terrorist army of ISIS invaded Iraq and was fighting Syria, the same countries the US is fighting.  ISIS even attacked Iran's parliament a few months ago. the perception is that the US is also fighting against ISIS (that's what the US why they're still in Syria), perception to dumb sheeple.

       Their goal is overthrow Assad to topple the nation. Mainly so they can install an oil pipeline from Qatar. Going by their past conquests, like in Libya, they will probably rape and pillage the whole nation of all it's resources as well.

       Many reasons can be garnered from this situation. The war happening in Syria not only benefits them financially but also geopolitically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Destabilizing the middle-east has been on their agenda for decades. They do this by raiding countries and doing strategic regime changes in the name of "democracy." They come like a thief in the night, only dressed as white knights coming to "save" the oppressed arab civilians. They do their public bidding on the front-end, but on the back-end they financially support/create fanatic terrorist groups, hire paid mercenaries for their secret operations, take control of the country's resources, topple over the country's leader and replace them w/ a Western puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the ancient strategy of Divide and Conquer. They aim to disintegrate these countries into even smaller countries, with no law or government. Just chaos. This will of course be great news for Israel, which would use those circumstances as an excuse to keep expanding. As they would be seen as the only stable and democratic country in the region, the international community wouldn't mind if Israel expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final mission for these people is one thing and one thing only: Manifest Destiny. They have an obsessive and sickly need to be in power and to control everything. They aim to expand their power eventually onto the entire world, but it all has to start with taking control of the middle-east and the rest will follow.

       Yeh. That's pretty much what worries me. The storms keep getting bigger. This last one stretched from Cuba to Labrador. Meanwhile over an inch of rain fell per hour in Hawaii for over 24 hours. The Great Lakes are sloshing around. Grand Solar Minimum is upon us.

       I suspect the Eastern reaponse to the strike against syria will be assymetric. I don't think it'll be cyber-warfare as the british tabloids are saying. I think it'll be a weather weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they trigger a TDAT scenario, then West Europe, Canada and the USA would get fucked. How would that affect weather in Russia? Well, I mean, could they really make it that much worse?

       america and china both have the technology to manipulate weather; so they could in theory counteract. Fact is though, weather manipulation can not be used in war; this treaty got signed in 1977.

       OP, do you not think there's a deep state or a higher power than the POTUS, that calls the shots?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I ask you a question, I give you an answer.  Yes, I believe there is a deep state.  When you start looking at our foriegn policy and look at what come out of groups like the CFR, Bildeberge, Trillateral Commission and so on.  It's hard believe they done have say over our nation.  Shit, they even admit it in magazines like the Economist.

       He's asking because, generally,  people who feel the need to use quotes around the phrase don't believe in a Deep State.

       Your use of quotes makes it appear that you are mocking the reality of it.

       I'm very skeptical, but giving the current president the benefit of the doubt at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many traps, tricks, and complications.  Determining if a representative is doing what's in your best interests is a full time job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's face it, evil fuckers will make a good president look bad and a bad president look good.  Determining the truth is nearly impossible for the average Joe who has a day job.

       I think there are multiple levels of this. For the war in the middle east in general, I think it's just so they can justify more military spending, thus lining the pockets of the military industrial complex with our tax money. As for specific things in the news, such as the chemical weapons attacks, is largely for publicity. Something comes out people weren't supposed to know about, so they create a distraction by getting people talking about WWIII doomsday scenarios instead. Imo mass shootings are for the same reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically the war in the middle east is to take money from the average American and give it to the people who really run our country under the guise of military spending. But if they need something to come up in the news to distract from whatever may have leaked, they can make up something related to the war pretty easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the reason for war in general. We're currently in Syria because of Isreal, because Israel wants to protect itself against a nuclear Iran. I read this from a declassified military document, so I'm pretty sure this part is 100% legit. I can try to find the doc if you want. But anyway, Israel is worried about a nuclear Iran, and want to isolate them. Syria is then a big concern because they could allow Iranian soldiers through to Israel, unopposed. So they want to install a puppet dictator who won't be friendly to Iran. So then we do our thing of creating ISIS and whatnot to weaken Assad, while also providing us a new enemy that they can put in the news cutting people's heads off or setting people on fire any time they need a distraction.

       The "Deep State" is not behind the Syria situation except tangentially. The "Deep State" concerns itself with the continuity of US policy (feeding money to the wealthy through government programs) regardless of left/right political power. Syria is much more of a middle management situation.
