Many of our law makers hold dual-citizenship with Israel and are committed to Israel-first policies over America-first. Our central bank is owned by the Rothschilds who are Jewish, so money doesn&#39;t belong to us ultimately, it&#39;s on loan from Jews. So let&#39;s see, money/labor is not our own, our laws not our own, our military is not our own, nothing belongs to us but a bunch of Jewish-owned debt. It&#39;s time for the USA to secede from Israel and stand on its own two legs. That is all.</p>

The people?
The Rothchilds have done everything from killing for superconductor patents, to poking the King of England in the chest,. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re light side Jedi, but who&#39;s better to control the money?
Not number two.

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s <em>bullshit</em>. Seriously, how did you decide to trust Dean Henderson of globalresearch.ca? In your experience is globalresearch.ca a reliable source? Dean Henderson is citing J. W. McCallister, Thomas Schauf, and Eustace Mullins. Do you know who they are?</p>

<p>It turns out that J.W. McCallister isn&#39;t even a person. Henderson says &quot;J. W. McCallister, an oil industry insider with House of Saud connections, wrote in The Grim Reaper ...&quot; But it was <a href="https://www.remcmaster.com/newsletter/">R. E. McMaster</a> who published the newsletter called <em>The Reaper</em>. So Henderson got both the name of the person and the name of the publication wrong. What else did he get wrong? Is the information correct?</p>

<p>Henderson says that &quot;CPA Thomas D. Schauf corroborates McCallister’s claims&quot;, but if you look at what Schauf wrote, he is just citing the same source, R.E. McMaster. <a href="http://www.apfn.org/apfn/fed_reserve.htm">Schauf</a> references <a href="https://archive.org/stream/EnRouteToGlobalOccupation/EnRouteToGlobal#page/n8/mode/1up">Gary H. Kah, <em>En Route to Global Occupation</em>, p. 13</a> which references <a href="http://www.crowhealingnetwork.net/pdf/Roberts%20-%20The%20Most%20Secret%20Science%20%28how%20control%20of%20wealth%20controls%20people%29%20%281987%29.pdf#page=46">Archibal E. Roberts, <em>The Most Secret Science</em> (Fort Collins: Betsy Ross Press, 1984), 56.</a> (PDF warning)</p>

<p>In testimony to an Idaho Senate committee in 1983, author Archibald Roberts says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now to identify the real owners of the Federal Reserve which is your question sir, . . . Mr. Chairman, I would like to quote from sources from Switzerland and Saudi Arabia who were queried on the real owners of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Chairman and sir, we do not mean the managers of the twelve Federal Reserve banks who merely run the banks for the owners, the real owners. Nor do we mean the members of the Federal Reserve Board who merely make decisions in line and in consonance with the directions they receive from the real owners of the Federal Reserve. We certainly don&#39;t mean those who sit on the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve which we mentioned earlier in this presentation. We mean the real owners of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Chairman, this has been the best kept secret of this century. And it is the best kept secret because of a proviso on passage of the Federal Reserve Act. It was agreed that no information would be released on the Class A stockholders of the Federal Reserve. But, a Mr. R.E. McMaster, publisher of a newsletter, The Reaper, asked his Swiss and Saudi Arabian contacts which banks hold controlling interest in the Federal Reserve System. This was the answer received, and I quote, &quot;Owner number one, Rothschild Banks of London and Berlin; Owner number two, Lazard Brothers Banks of Paris; Owner number three, Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy; Owner number four, Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam; Owner number five, Lehman Brothers Bank of New York; Owner number six, Kuhn, Loeb Bank of New York; Owner number seven. Chase Manhattan Bank of New York.&quot; Mr. Chairman, it is the Chase Manhattan Bank which controls all of the other eleven Federal Reserve Banks. Finally, &quot;Owner number eight, Goldman, Sachs Bank of New York.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it&#39;s from anonymous foreign sources and we&#39;re given no information on who they are and how they know this and why we should assume they&#39;re telling the truth.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t matter because this information is <em>provably wrong</em>. And provably wrong in <em>two different ways</em>.</p>

<p>(1) The ownership of Federal Reserve Bank stock is not secret at all. There are no individuals or families who own stock. The stock of each of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks is owned by all the member banks in that district. (There are <a href="https://pastebin.com/j5ZdCUJF">more than 1,700 Federal Reserve member banks</a> in the country.) There&#39;s a formula that tells each member bank how much stock it must own based on the bank&#39;s balance sheet. The stock cannot be traded. No matter how many shares it owns, each member bank gets two votes for directors of the regional FRB. The small banks in each region pick two directors, the medium-size banks pick two and the large banks pick two. Three directors are chosen by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board of Governors is a federal agency). So, even if all the big banks in a district colluded, they could pick only 2 out of 9 directors. And that would be in just one out of the twelve districts. This is all written into the law which created the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>(2) The list is bogus. The Rothschild Bank of <em>Berlin</em>? <em>Berlin</em>? The Rothschilds <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/25/business/company-news-german-return-for-rothschilds.html">left Germany in 1901</a>, before the Federal Reserve was founded, and didn&#39;t open a new office in Germany until 1988, after this testimony. And, when they were in Germany, they were based in Frankfurt. There never was a Rothschild Bank of Berlin.</p>

<p>And &quot;Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy&quot;? Who? Nobody has heard of him. There was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Sieff,_Baron_Sieff">Israel Moses Sieff</a> who was a British businessman (Marks &amp; Spencer department store), but no one knows about an Italian banker named Israel Moses Seif.</p>

<p>So, by trusting R.E. McMaster&#39;s supposed anonymous sources, you&#39;ve been led to believe in imaginary banks and imaginary bankers.</p>

<p>Whoever put this list together did not have special knowledge of banks. They didn&#39;t even know that the Rothschilds hadn&#39;t been in Germany for decades and they didn&#39;t know how the Federal Reserve is really organized.</p>

<p>I hope you take this opportunity to contemplate that some of the things you read on conspiracy web sites might just be false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits behind 9/11. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. Even in Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?</p>

<p>The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.</p>

<p>Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.</p>

<p>This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.</p>

<p>The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.</p>

<p>Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?</p>

<p>What does all this say about the American mind?</p>

<p>It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.</p>

<p>Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.</p>

<p>But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.</p>

<p>In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:</p>

<p>De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?</p>

<p>Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That&#39;s $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don&#39;t believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle.&quot;</p>

<p>He went on to say:</p>

<p>&quot;In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks.&quot;</p>

<p>He further goes on to state:</p>

<p>&quot;I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word.&quot;</p>

<p>You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.</p>

<p>Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don&#39;t know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don&#39;t have the courage to do it, because you&#39;re a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don&#39;t have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it&#39;s too big to stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem I see with this... It&#39;s a religious thing, I suppose, depends on your views on the book of Revelations, but..</p>

<p>The end of times comes, when the whole world turns on Israel and I their time of desperation, they turn back to God and accept Jesus as their savior. And that&#39;s when everything goes to Hell and all that.</p>

<p>That said, I just read almost all of Revelations, and I can&#39;t find anything that alludes to any of that directly, or indirectly. I&#39;ll have to do more research ...  Hmm. But I also have had a tiny epiphany of another sort. I&#39;ll have to read and research before I commit to the idea.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about most people, but there&#39;s a lot of speculation as to who/what Mystery Babylon is and the Beast and the Mark of the Beast that&#39;s talked about there in Revelations. Traditionally, I was taught that it&#39;s anything from Catholicism to Islam, that they&#39;ll lead everyone against Israel and Christianity. But, considering how money works and how the Zionist movement itself is presented in a very non-christian manner, perhaps they are the Beast, and the money involved is ... I don&#39;t know. Have fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s <em>bullshit</em>. Seriously, how did you decide to trust Dean Henderson of globalresearch.ca? In your experience is globalresearch.ca a reliable source? Dean Henderson is citing J. W. McCallister, Thomas Schauf, and Eustace Mullins. Do you know who they are?</p>

<p>It turns out that J.W. McCallister isn&#39;t even a person. Henderson says &quot;J. W. McCallister, an oil industry insider with House of Saud connections, wrote in The Grim Reaper ...&quot; But it was <a href="https://www.remcmaster.com/newsletter/">R. E. McMaster</a> who published the newsletter called <em>The Reaper</em>. So Henderson got both the name of the person and the name of the publication wrong. What else did he get wrong? Is the information correct?</p>

<p>Henderson says that &quot;CPA Thomas D. Schauf corroborates McCallister’s claims&quot;, but if you look at what Schauf wrote, he is just citing the same source, R.E. McMaster. <a href="http://www.apfn.org/apfn/fed_reserve.htm">Schauf</a> references <a href="https://archive.org/stream/EnRouteToGlobalOccupation/EnRouteToGlobal#page/n8/mode/1up">Gary H.

<p>In testimony to an Idaho Senate committee in 1983, author Archibald Roberts says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now to identify the real owners of the Federal Reserve which is your question sir, . . . Mr. Chairman, I would like to quote from sources from Switzerland and Saudi Arabia who were queried on the real owners of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Chairman and sir, we do not mean the managers of the twelve Federal Reserve banks who merely run the banks for the owners, the real owners. Nor do we mean the members of the Federal Reserve Board who merely make decisions in line and in consonance with the directions they receive from the real owners of the Federal Reserve. We certainly don&#39;t mean those who sit on the Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve which we mentioned earlier in this presentation. We mean the real owners of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Chairman, this has been the best kept secret of this century. And it is the best kept secret because of a proviso on passage of the Federal Reserve Act. It was agreed that no information would be released on the Class A stockholders of the Federal Reserve. But, a Mr. R.E. McMaster, publisher of a newsletter, The Reaper, asked his Swiss and Saudi Arabian contacts which banks hold controlling interest in the Federal Reserve System. This was the answer received, and I quote, &quot;Owner number one, Rothschild Banks of London and Berlin; Owner number two, Lazard Brothers Banks of Paris; Owner number three, Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy; Owner number four, Warburg Bank of Hamburg and Amsterdam; Owner number five, Lehman Brothers Bank of New York; Owner number six, Kuhn, Loeb Bank of New York; Owner number seven. Chase Manhattan Bank of New York.&quot; Mr. Chairman, it is the Chase Manhattan Bank which controls all of the other eleven Federal Reserve Banks. Finally, &quot;Owner number eight, Goldman, Sachs Bank of New York.&quot; </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s from anonymous foreign sources and we&#39;re given no information on who they are and how they know this and why we should assume they&#39;re telling the truth.</p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t matter because this information is <em>provably wrong</em>. And provably wrong in <em>two different ways</em>.</p>

<p>(1) The ownership of Federal Reserve Bank stock is not secret at all. There are no individuals or families who own stock. The stock of each of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks is owned by all the member banks in that district. (There are <a href="https://pastebin.com/j5ZdCUJF">more than 1,700 Federal Reserve member banks</a> in the country.) There&#39;s a formula that tells each member bank how much stock it must own based on the bank&#39;s balance sheet. The stock cannot be traded. No matter how many shares it owns, each member bank gets two votes for directors of the regional FRB. The small banks in each region pick two directors, the medium-size banks pick two and the large banks pick two. Three directors are chosen by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board of Governors is a federal agency). So, even if all the big banks in a district colluded, they could pick only 2 out of 9 directors. And that would be in just one out of the twelve districts. This is all written into the law which created the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>(2) The list is bogus. The Rothschild Bank of <em>Berlin</em>? <em>Berlin</em>? The Rothschilds <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/25/business/company-news-german-return-for-rothschilds.html">left Germany in 1901</a>, before the Federal Reserve was founded, and didn&#39;t open a new office in Germany until 1988, after this testimony. And, when they were in Germany, they were based in Frankfurt. There never was a Rothschild Bank of Berlin.</p>

<p>And &quot;Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy&quot;? Who? Nobody has heard of him. There was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Sieff,_Baron_Sieff">Israel Moses Sieff</a> who was a British businessman (Marks &amp; Spencer department store), but no one knows about an Italian banker named Israel Moses Seif.</p>

<p>So, by trusting R.E. McMaster&#39;s supposed anonymous sources, you&#39;ve been led to believe in imaginary banks and imaginary bankers.</p>

<p>Whoever put this list together did not have special knowledge of banks. They didn&#39;t even know that the Rothschilds hadn&#39;t been in Germany for decades and they didn&#39;t know how the Federal Reserve is really organized.</p>

<p>I hope you take this opportunity to contemplate that some of the things you read on conspiracy web sites might just be false.</p>
