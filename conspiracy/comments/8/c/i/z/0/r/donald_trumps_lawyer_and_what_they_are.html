<p>not when it&#39;s a PR payoff for silence in order to protect a politician&#39;s image. That&#39;s what makes it an <strong><em>unregistered</em></strong> campaign contribution and not a tortured definition of a campaign contribution</p>

I live in Chicago and there have been a number of local journalists writing stories about taxi cab medallions and the lawyer, and something to do with a position as the Secretary of the Army in a quid pro quo deal with a lender in Chicago.  This is Chicago specific coverage, I am not sure what else there is, but I don&#39;t think it is related to the non-disclosure from what I read. </p>
