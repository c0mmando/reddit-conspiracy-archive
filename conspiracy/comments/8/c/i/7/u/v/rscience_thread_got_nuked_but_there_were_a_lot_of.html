       I read through a lot of comments, and they were all thought provoking. No childish ridicule, no tin foil hat bullshit, just honest discussion.

       It wasn't like that just a few years ago. The hivemind would have hamster'd its way around in circles to not acknowledged this possibility....

       The concept of a stargate only popped up relatively recently in human history and is due to pop culture. Research for yourself but I wouldn't put much time into the whole stargate idea. Obviously you're free to believe what you want though.

       People want to know. There is so much that is being hidden. Like the fact that women were leaders back then and it was only within the last 3,000 or 4,000 years that men led. For probably 25,000 years, women have led and even led in advanced civilizations like Atlantis and Ancient Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the fact that so much is appearing from underwater sites. It's part of us and we need to not only demand more information, but we need to go out and find it. I believe once we do, we can end this lie of a hell hole we live in where everything is extreme. We need balance in this world and to bring in that new age, to save us all from the next fucking comet that comes our way, we need to learn the truth of our past. The Denisovans, the women leaders, the ancient records, all of it.

       Many of the main deities in Ancient Egypt were women

       <p>
        According to ancient Egyptian texts, the representation of truth, morality, balance, law and justice was a goddess named Maat or Ma’at, which means “truth,” in Egyptian. She helped balance the universe, end chaos and manage both humans and gods.

       <p>
        Following a recent dig, archaeologists found that New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon was home to a matrilineal society -- one that saw power descend through maternal family lines -- between the 9th to mid-12th centuries.

       Although research into this is very limited, there is emerging text on it, especially in Ancient Egypt.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the matrilineal nature of the ancient Egyptian family and social organization provides us with the key to understanding why and how ancient Egyptian women were able to rise to power, study medicine, and enjoy basic freedoms that did not emerge in Western Civilization until the twentieth century.

       So to be clear, you are not actually claiming that Egyptian civilization dates back 25,000 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Matrilineal societies existed, yes.

       There are no credible archaeologists who have found "Atlantean" artifacts, especially not from tens of thousands of years ago.

       No I included Atlantis in there specifically in the 4th sentence of my original comment. Egypt, maybe 15,000 years ago. It's dependent on how old the Sphinx is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did research on Pavlovians and their ability to travel and so forth and the r1a1 gene and I believe they were Denisovan hybrids that founded Atlantis, built around the world and after the comet, settled in Egypt then spread out into places like Turkey. That's where the 'giants' of lore myths probably came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not much evidence on Denisovans, but they believe they were large, probably 8-11 feet tall.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, if you saw the video I provided you with, there are artifacts dated to be over 10,000 years old in Turkey and they took actual pictures of these artifacts and it is believed to be Atlantean origin, but in Egypt because the theory is Atlanteans moved to Egypt after the comet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information is purposely being suppressed with giant skeletons being destroyed and finds like the one in Turkey, not even being allowed to make it into mainstream media. This is a very real attempt at blocking information from reaching the masses.

       No, the age of Egyptian civilization does not hinge on alluvial weathering on the Sphinx. It hinges on the mountains of archaeological and historical data which establish Egypt as a Bronze Age civilization like all of its contemporaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Atlantis never existed. Atlantis was a made-up place in a parable told by Plato.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no giant human skeletons and there is no conspiracy to suppress archaeological evidence. Arguments from ignorance are not valid arguments.

       Those are not Atlantean. They were forged by Kinich Ahau, the Maya sun god, during his second tenure (around 500 AD).

       There's a difference between saying (a) women should be in power because they're women and (b) women should be allowed to be in power if they are best qualified.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last 5,000 years or so of human history provides evidence for active social resistance against (b). I am not aware of any society which has implemented (a).

       Again its a crap. Plenty of woman voted for hillary clinton only because she was a woman and yet when she lost she blamed white men for it. Your post is no different from it. A lot of woman think emotionally rather than logically and thats why we dont have lot of woman in power directly.

       This isn't feminist crap. This is the truth. Hopefully more information comes out and more artifacts and evidence to support it. I don't understand why it would be hard to imagine a matrilineal advanced society.

       Why are you even in this thread lol. If we live in a proper and balanced society you wouldn’t be here looking for any truth. do you just spend your time coming here and making people feel dumb? We live in a perfect society guys! Also, spelling out the word “you” would help you out a little when attempting to shame someone.

       <li>
        <p>
         Creation of the heavens, including the sun, moon, and stars (Gen. 1:1; Col. 1:15-18; Ps. 8:3; 90:2; 95:5; 102:25; Isa. 40:12, 26; 45:12; 48:13).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Creation of the spirit-world before the earth was created. (Job 38:4-7; Cor 1:15.-1 )
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is when the spirit world was created including demons. There are many kinds of demon spirits, fallen angels and other spirit beings mentioned in scripture. It is certain they were not created wicked. They were originally created perfect and sinless and became fallen and unclean. Even the prince of demons is spoken of as being “perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, TILL iniquity was found in thee” (Ezek 28:11-17). God could not and did not created anything sinful. Everything in the spirit and human realms that is wicked and rebellious has become this way because of sin and because of free choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fallen angels, demons and other beings are all rebels in connection with the planet Earth. They have sinned with the ORIGINAL rebellion on Earth under Lucifer, or they would not be confined in prisons under the Earth or be operating on the Earth now against God. That those below have sinned in connection with the Earth is clear from the fact that they are confined in the abyss underneath the Earth.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Creation of the Earth. The Earth made perfect the first time, not creating it in vein. (Gen. 1:1; Job 38:4-7; Isa. 45:18; Heb. 11:3).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The sons of God shouted for joy and all the stars sang when God created earth. (Job 38:4-7) So this means they were made before hand. So I would assume logically that God created heaven…and then all its inhabitant and then God created Earth and all its in habitants in that order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything God created was created perfect THE FIRST TIME. God does not create anything void waste and empty and in chaos. So earth was not created void and without form.

      <ol>
       <li>

       2 Peter 3:6 is not talking about Noah's flood because that world did not "Perish" for Noah and his family survived. It is talking about 3 worlds. The world that then was, the world that is now and the world that is to come.

         The Kingdom of God universal; God the Supreme moral governor of the universe, and all in harmony with Him (Job 38; Dan. 4:17, 25, 32, 35) Length of the rule of the universal harmonious kingdom, before Lucifer started his rebellion is unknown.

         Lucifer carries out his plans and through pride falls and foments rebellion by slander and accusations against the Almighty. He causes his own earth-kingdom subjects and over one-third of God's angels (Rev. 12:7-12) to rebel against Him. The Earth enters its first sinful career (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; 1 Tim. 3:6). The length of the uprising is unknown.

         Lucifer instigates rebellion and persuades everyone possible to rebel. He openly breaks relations with God and His government, and leads his rebels from the appointed place of mobilization on Earth into Heaven to dethrone God; but he is met by Michael and the faithful angels, and is defeated and cast as lightning back to the Earth (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; Luke 10:18).

         God completely destroys Lucifer's kingdom on Earth, judges the earth with Darkness, just as Darkness is used for judgment or evil throughout almost every other place in the bible (why would Gen 1:2 be any different) and curses the Earth by destroying every bird, animal, fish, city, inhabitant, and all vegetation. He then turns the Earth upside down and by means of a great flood makes it empty and a waste (Gen. 1:2; Ps. 104:5-9; Isa. 14:12-14; Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:11-17; 2 Pet. 3:5-9). The length of the pre-Adamite flood on the Earth is unknown.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Jesus, Peter, Paul and John all teach the overthrow of the pre-Adamite world. I can prove this through the study of the greek or katabol in the new testament.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here is Jeremiah
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeremiah 4:23-26
      </p>
      <p>
       I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
      </p>
      <p>
       24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       25 I beheld, and, lo,
       <em>
        there was no man
       </em>
       , and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
      </p>
      <p>
       26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.
      </p>
      <p>
       He saw Genesis 1:2 and what else did he see there? He saw broken down cities, a wilderness, birds that were fled and
       <em>
        no man
       </em>
       . Which implies there was something inhabited on the earth at this time as well as animals and some kind of being that that built cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       These had to be earthly subjects because God created the earth to be inhabited. They also built cities that could be broken down. These were not Human but man. Just like when someone take the mark they will no longer be human. The redemption period or trial period must have been like the angels. Nobody knows how long it lasted. They were made perfect and without sin though. God only makes perfect things. Just like in Noah's day they were destroyed after God's long suffering ran out. (Isa 45:18) It will always be inhabited with earthly subjects. Even after the Millennium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earth was in a state of judgment (Darkness) and broken down and destroyed by God's fierce anger. Darkness everywhere in the bible is referred to has judgment or evil. Just as in Gen 1:2 Because God is light and in Him there is no darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you see Lucifer weekend these nations and tried to invade heaven ALREADY way before the war in revelations. This is why he fell and was in the garden when Adam was there.

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       Now go to Ezekiel 28:13-15: “Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold; the workmanship of they tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou are the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lucifer was made perfect he was the most powerful being next to God and walked in a garden of eden on earth before Adams garden. UNTIL iniquity was found in him and he got filled with pride and went and trafficked all the land with his earthly subjects and deceived them. Then when he invaded Heaven his tail drew a third of the angels (rev 12:4) Which basically means he deceived them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when they "ascended to heaven", it really makes you wonder if they had some incredible technology or if it was only the angels. Why would Satan need to deceive everyone on earth if they were not going to join him in a war? "
       <em>
        just like he is doing again
       </em>
       "  History repeats itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this verse is talking about two things as well as the antichrist if you read all the context. So you really have to connect Isaiah and Ezek together. And then just use some logic. His kingdom had to be on earth if he was going to ascend above the clouds and stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 12:4 is talking about the war in heaven from the dateless past. As we already understand that 1/3 of the angels are ruling the earth now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hebrews 2:5 we read this:
      </p>
      <p>
       ''For unto the angels hath God not put in subjection the world to come of which we
      </p>
      <p>
       speak." In other words, The World Tomorrow, the Kingdom of God, will not be under
      </p>
      <p>
       subjection to angels. The present one is under subjection of fallen angels. The
      </p>
      <p>
       demons, and the devil who is their head, rule this present earth and sway its
      </p>
      <p>
       inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>
       but verse rev 12:15 is talking about the future war in heaven (rev 12:7 and 20:1-10)
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Thessalonians 2:4 is only talking about the antichrist, not Satan. It is only a man, the son of perdition that exalts himself above all that is called God. But he is really just a man.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we get to the war in heaven in Revelation 12 So the proper verses to link these to are Danial 11:45-12:1; Isaiah 24:21-22; 25:7-8 and 27:1
      </p>
      <p>
       This war in heaven will be the last actual struggle between Satan and God over the possession of the heavenlies where Satan reigns as stated in EPH 2:2 and 6:12
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan does not live in heaven but still has access to accuse but after this casting out he will never have access again has stated in Job:1:6 2:1 and also in Rev 12:7-12 and it also says it in Zech 3:6-9
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the war predicted here in revelation that takes place in future could not have been the same war in heaven that took place in Isaiah 14:12-14 because it would not make any sense. Luke 10:18 clarifies this. For Satan cannot cast out Satan. This war was in the dateless past before the recreation of Genesis 1:3 started. The only thing in Rev that references the war in heaven in the past is Rev 12:4 which is symbolic for of the third of God’s angels that rebelled with Lucifer and showing how many will be with him in the future war in heaven under the 7th trumpet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This war in heaven is in the future because ALL events from revelations 4:1-22:5 must be after the churches And the war in Isaiah was talking about when Satan Fell in the past and how he would be defeated in the future. (God’s grand plan)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting because if you read all of Psalms chapter 2 it is clearly a conversation with 3 people (The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.) I just don't know which one is talking when but they are describing how people fight against God and how they are scoffing at the evil world that is so foolish
      </p>
      <p>
       The Antichrist is going to get a lot of the earthly inhabitants to actually wage war against God like he did in the kingdom he ruled over in the dateless past. History repeats itself. This is what transhumanism will probably do. Create Satan's army to wage war with Christ when he returns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battle of Armageddon will not be an ordinary battle between two sets of earthly nations. It will be a battle between the armies of heaven under Christ and the armies of the Earth under the dragon, the beat and the false prophet. On the side of Christ will be earthly Israel (Zech 14:1-15), the angels of God (Matt 25:31-45;  2 Thess 1 :7-10) and the resurrected saints of ages (Zech 14:1-5; Jude 14; Rev 19:11-21). On the side of Antichrist there will be the devil and his angels and demons (Rev 12:7-12; 16:13-16; Rev 20:1-3) the ten kingdoms who will have been recently conquered by Antichrist (Dan 11:44; Ezek 38, 39; Rev 16:12) and many other nations that will co-operate with the Antichrist through the ministry of the three unclean frogs (Rev 16:13-16; Zech 14:1-5, 16; Ezek 38, 39)
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Spirit of God begins to move upon the flooded Earth and in the darkness which covered the waters to restore the Earth to a habitable state, and to create new land animals, fish, fowls, vegetation, and Adam as the new ruler of the Earth (Gen. 1:2; Ps. 104:6-9). Length of the re-creation is six days (Gen. 1:3-2:25; Ex. 20:8-11; 31:15).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Earth is made perfect a second time and all things in the universe are again in harmony with God as before Lucifer's rebellion; except Lucifer and his spirit rebels are still at large in the heavenlies to further God's plan in the probationary periods of the human race should man fall (Gen. 1:3-2:25; Eph. 2:1-3; 6:10-18; Job 1:6; 2:1; Rev. 12:7-12) .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         THE FIRST PROBATIONARY PERIOD-The Dispensation of Innocence. The length of this period was about six days. (Gen. 2:17-3:24).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lucifer (now the devil or adversary of God and man called Satan) enters the restored Earth, using an intelligent creature of God that as a will of its own, that could apparently already communicate (when have you ever heard of Satan using a creature of God to talk to a human after this incident?) with man before the curse, willingly lets Satan use him as a tool to tempts man and causes his fall, thus regaining dominion of the Earth and all things therein (Gen. 3; Luke 4; John 12:31; 2 Cor 4:4; Rev. 11: 15 ; 20:1-10).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rebellion starts again on the Earth by the second ruler of Earth. Man is judged, the Earth is again cursed, the serpent is punished for life and enters its second sinful career, and all creatures are brought under the bondage of sin and corruption (Gen. 3; Rom. 5:12-21; 8: 19-23)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "The heavens and the earth which are now" since the restoration work of the six days, and since the new curse on the Earth await the time of the second renovation and third perfect state of Earth. Called the New Heavens and New Earth (2 Peter 3:5-13; Rom 8:19-23; Heb 1:10-12; 12:24-28; Rev 21-22)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         THE SECOND PROBATIONARY PERIOD—The Dispensation of Conscience (Gen. 3:1-8:14). The length of this period was 1,656 years (Gen. 5:1-29; 7:11)

       I’m skeptical of David Ickes lizard people theory, but if you believe in evolution and consider maybe some Dino’s evolved into intelligent humanoid forms, lived up until maybe the Younger Dryas, and they didn’t all die off, then we might have a jealous tangent spiece working against humanity with a vendenta.
