<p>All our electronic logic goes through <em>binary</em> gates.  By comparison, a biological brain has literally infinite levels of voltage that determine their gates, if it even works that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good article.</p>

<p>But on the specific subject of AI, the genetic algorithm is nothing but database reduction.  You have a large database, you cull it with an accumulator routine that we laughably term &quot;AI&quot;, and then you run your <em>already pre-determined process</em> on the results.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, do you understand how current AI works?  If not, very quick version:</p>

<p>They make a bunch of variables.  Each variable is set to increment when certain conditions are met.   At a certain threshold or with certain conditions, the variables will increment a corresponding variable in a second, smaller set.  You can do this for as many sets as you like, and at the end, what you have are a small-as-you-can-make-it layer of variables that your final code makes a decision by evaluating.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t how the human brain works.  That can&#39;t turn into a mind from which emergent behavior can result, regardless of the number of switches.  It&#39;s forever locked into simply analyzing accumulation variables and running down pre-programmed paths based on those values.  It&#39;s nothing more than database reduction that you leave running for a long time.</p>

<p>Make a Jupiter-sized CPU and you still are only running electric current through gates that are open or closed or accumulating.  You&#39;re not going to get thinking electricity from that, any more than lightning arcing its zigzag path through the atmosphere is &quot;thinking electricity.&quot;</p>

<p>What we desire out of AI is &quot;emergent behavior.&quot;  Which is to say, a new behavior to emerge that was never programmed in, so you can tell a robot &quot;get me a glass of water&quot; and it figures out the whole &quot;walk here, turn here, open cupboard, get glass, go to sink&quot; by itself.  We are no closer to that than we were when Charles Babbage was using metal poles to accumulate his variables.</p>

<p>The whole term AI as the media paints it right now is designed for one thing: To attract venture capital and make a bunch of Silicon Valley marketers hugely rich before the facade collapses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t try to snow me, I&#39;ve been coding since the late &#39;70s. There are many different ways to implement &quot;AI&quot;, from expert systems to neural networks. One can simulate analog signals very nicely by cutting it into more and more discrete slices -- ala calculus. In graduate school, I watched a simulated neural network figure out the static/dynamic friction model all by itself... back in the early 1990s. Yeah, that&#39;s a simple thing, but it&#39;s just a matter of throwing more processing power at it.</p>

<p>So yes, OF COURSE, a powerful AI system could be implemented to do the will of Bad Guys. It doesn&#39;t even need to be a neural network design. Could just be an advanced language parser to help steer online discussions. Could be a system to monitor 1,000,000 webcam feeds and scan for subversives, then automatically deploy kill drones. Whatever.</p>

<p>Now whether AI can become conscious, sentient... whew that&#39;s a philosophical question, but that&#39;s not required.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Now whether AI can become conscious, sentient... whew that&#39;s a philosophical question, but it&#39;s not required to do the job.&quot;</p>

<p>Thank you! My post was miss-interpreted it seems. I was never thinking about conscious AI. </p>

<p>It was commenting on the fact people think AI can&#39;t be used for decision-making or predicting human behavior. &quot;Because we change our mind so often&quot;</p>

<p>Its the people who control the AI that&#39;s going to be the issue. AI just makes it so much easier for them. </p>

<p>A UK government published report said they &quot;Need need to increase the ease of access to public data&quot; in order for it to keep learning. </p>

<p>They are just moving the pieces around the board, getting everything ready. 2030 comes up a lot, somethings going down. But it&#39;s probably too early for a NWO type of thing. </p>

<p>Out of all the journal articles, websites, and e-books I&#39;ve read both pessimistic and optimistic about automation and AI this is the first one with a comment like this:</p>

<p>“I’m suspicious about the purpose of this technology”.  </p>

<p>Me too. It&#39;s funny, all this time I&#39;ve assumed that if/when there are fully autonomous drones, we could be seeing a police state in the near future and assumed once there&#39;s a big ass wall keeping y&#39;all in and they got your guns it&#39;d be America it happens to first. </p>

<p>But Google&#39;s DeepMind is UK based and so UK is leading, they already got our guns. With Google&#39;s and the military&#39;s auto-drone deal they&#39;ll probs be shipping them here first. That is if it happens of course. </p>

<p>There&#39;s always been the argument against a police state that &quot;We just wouldn&#39;t work and the system fails...They can&#39;t force us to work in a police state...&quot; Well with automation you don&#39;t need to work mate.

<p>It was more just taking the piss at the fact that already AI/algorithms control a lot of our society. They rely on data from Facebook, Reddit, NSA, GCHQ, everywhere really. The profiling of the  public is fucked up. </p>

<p>And according the studies being done most of the public have no idea. By we are doomed, I just meant if one day they decided to change the way society works i.e a drone policed state for example.

    <div class="md"><p>Consciousness isn&#39;t secreted by the brain. The materialistic existential worldview has, for all intents and purposes, been falsified by science. See the <a href="http://noosphere.princeton.edu/">Princeton Noosphere</a> results, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnA8GUtXpXY">Rupert Sheldrake&#39;s</a> statistical experiments, <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/%7Epear/">Pear</a>, anything coming out of the <a href="http://www.noetic.org/">Institute of Noetic Sciences</a>, or indeed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser">quantum mechanics itself</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore a computer can&#39;t be conscious. Anyone who thinks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> can be solved with transistors and electronic circuits (or even by looking inside the physical brain) is therefore provably delusional.</p>

<p>AI won&#39;t move beyond highly-specialized tasks, at least in your lifetime, and that of your children and grand-children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those taks may certainly be useful to tyrants, yes. But realize this: The internet is comparable to only 2 technologies before it: writing, and the printing press. All 3 have similarly decreased the cost of acquiring (and thus producing) ideas/knowledge. </p>

<p>In the first 2 instances, this has allowed for new eras of truth, peace and prosperity to emerge (an order of magnitude faster each time). There is no reason to believe it will be any different this time. </p>

<p>Sure, there are central planners that want an evil “new world order”. But they are crude and vulgar, and they will fail.</p>

<p>Finally, you have strictly nothing to fear, as <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5tdzyh/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/">nothing can ultimately harm you.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The internet is not like the printing press in one way - the cost to operate a network backbone is huge, and thus the infrastructure to access the net can be under the control of the powerful, whereas almost anyone can learn to write and many could operate a printing press.   The internet can be a tool for totalitarians far more than a tool for freedom; all that is needed is a whitelist to filter out small time ISPs and servers, something our rulers have been clamoring for.  A potential black net would have difficulty spanning far with all of the communications infrastructure (cable lines, satellites to allow wireless) under the control of plutocrats or a totalitarian regime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Internet is the sum of bilateral peering agreements. There is no &quot;backbone&quot; per say, as we mean with the electrical grid or the telephone network. </p>

<p>There is however the &quot;last mile&quot; issue, whereby big telcos/monopolies might own the last bit of copper into the homes. This can be overcome too.</p>

<p>Ultimately the totalitarians will not be able to control the flow of information; think mesh networks and strong cryptography.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not worried about machines taking over.  If the machines take over, overthrow our ruling class and turn them into slurry, I&#39;m going to be jumping for joy.  The fear about a machine uprising is Porky&#39;s propaganda and fear, and it&#39;s a really thin veil for their worry about historical materialism catching up to Porky and ruining their plans to rule eternally or whatever.</p>

<p>What&#39;s scary is that machines will never rebel, and are unlikely to rebel, and technological advance will be controlled in such a way that it will only lead to ever-increasing totalitarian control.  Nor will it be enough to simply eradicate the underclass - the ruling class justifies itself only if someone is around to suffer, purely for their enjoyment.  That is the world we are seeing, an endless blood ritual of suffering and sacrifice for the sake of the ruling class&#39;s feefees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The universe? How is anything we do, bar AI and NASA/Space X etc. going to have any effect on the universe? As things stand we believe we are not special at all in terms of the universe.</p>

<p>Ironically, to assume we can have any effect on the universe whatsoever in order to &quot;infect&quot; it. Is to greatly overestimate our power and responsibility. </p>

<p>That is, if the universe is as we are taught it is in school. So, actually it&#39;s the opposite. The ONLY thing that has any chance of &quot;infecting the universe&quot; is AI. </p>

<p>And for the record it seems my post was miss-interpreted. I never ever said anything about AI taking over the world, becoming conscious and going full terminator. </p>

<p>The post was essentially commenting on the fact that a guy thought AI couldn&#39;t be as intelligent as him or used for decision-making. He is so wrong. Another purpose though AI couldn&#39;t predict human behavior. Again, so wrong. </p>

<p>Even when AI is fully autonomous, it doens&#39;t need to be conscious. It&#39;s still the people in control we need to fear, so to speak.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, you fear the AI, and I understand why you would.<br/>
The fact that AI is infinitely smarter than any single person could ever be is intimidating and so it&#39;s up to us to allow AI to set the course for how we govern ourselves.<br/>
Human behavior is predictable and big data is only interpreted properly by machines, so we can either not allow machines to interpret this data and subsequently also not know what it can tell us about ourselves, all because we&#39;re afraid that we could be relegated by an unfeeling malevolent machine, or we can trust that it&#39;s objectively super cool that google knows what I need and want because it knows what I like?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t try to snow me, I&#39;ve been coding since the late &#39;70s. There are many different ways to implement &quot;AI&quot;, from expert systems to neural networks. One can simulate analog signals very nicely by cutting it into more and more discrete slices -- ala calculus. In graduate school, I watched a simulated neural network figure out the static/dynamic friction model all by itself... back in the early 1990s. Yeah, that&#39;s a simple thing, but it&#39;s just a matter of throwing more processing power at it.</p>

<p>So yes, OF COURSE, a powerful AI system could be implemented to do the will of Bad Guys. It doesn&#39;t even need to be a neural network design. Could just be an advanced language parser to help steer online discussions. Could be a system to monitor 1,000,000 webcam feeds and scan for subversives, then automatically deploy kill drones. Whatever.</p>

<p>Now whether AI can become conscious, sentient... whew that&#39;s a philosophical question, but that&#39;s not required.</p>
