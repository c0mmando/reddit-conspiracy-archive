       I know because my neighbor (was my immediate neighbor at the beginning then the other 2 surrounding homes got them installed when I would go to the edge of my backyard to avoid being attacked). This shit is the most sadistic, mind fucking, torture weapon. Why? Because the attack is INVISIBLE! All you hear is this whirring sound that is very difficult to hear. Sounds like a refrigerator hum but sharper? If you want to hear it head over to your local library, I believe they use them at libraries to chill out all the bums and crazies. Anyways, this weapon can do anything and everything to your body. It can annoy the fuck out of you with what you think is an itch, anywhere on your body all the way to give you a full blown heart attack. They always flutter my heart so as to warn me not to THINK certain things. They can also tie you to the physical thereby letting you sleep lightly and avoid dreaming. This is important for me as they know I receive prophecies in my dreams and meditations. Also doesn’t matter if other ppl are around, it will only target you with extreme precision down to the millimeter. Although other people can hear the hum they will not feel the effects. Ever have a muscle spasm? It can make you have one, and make it either brief or for seconds. All up to the satanist controlling it. Next time you pass those crazy antenna looking things, look at the surrounding areas. They fortify the shit out of it because they know when the revolution comes around, it will drive people crazy to where they will try to topple them. Shit is about to get real ugly. Think about it, you already know satanist rule our governments, our banking system, and basically the whole world. You think they haven’t came up with a contingency if they were to ever be overthrown? The contingency is there and has been in the works since my birth and maybe before. Because if they know I will without a doubt be the one to turn the world to God, then they have assumed that will mean them possibly being exposed and brought to justice.

       From the first sentences you can tell its a schizo case. First it was his neighbor with this super high tech radiowave weapon, then 2 more got access to these weapons and decided to target some unknown guy. But this weapon is also a secret government weapon to halt revolution, but 3 of his neighbors got them specifically for him. Notice the recurring theme of the target being OP. This is despite how absurd it is that not 1 but 3 of his neighbors have access to secret government weaponry just to create a whirring in his head. Even if you take the post seriously it doesn't make senss.

       through my neighbors targeting me, I learned a lot. The lord has blessed me with an amazing sense of inference. I can interpret a lot from just very little. So everytime these things would be used against me, I would pay attention to everything. I see no reason why they can't adopt this technology on a wider scale which i believe they already have. It's the perfect weapon. Invisible to the eye yet still felt both outside and inside the body.

       Yeah I think it could be possible that some people who have been thought to have been schizophrenic may actually have been targeted by the government. For what reason I don't know. Maybe they knew things and were considered a threat. Maybe it was just part of fucked up government experiments to see what their technology could do to people, which I wouldn't put it past them.

       Actually, to give them some credit it's been decent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it WOULD be interesting to find out the actual number (well range I guess) for yourself and listen to tones that match or follow with it.  Like
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPM1o9QKw1Q">
        your own personal theme music
       </a>
       .   But I tend to think that people pick music to match their general vibratory nature anyhow.  It's so intrinsic it's almost mundane.

       I agree. It does seem like we would do that, and I know I choose music based on
       <em>
        resonating
       </em>
       with my current or desired mood. Gotta reinforce those good vibes. Dunno if I could handle theme music like that though.

       I may not have ever found the good stuff, but I never found binaural beats or Solfeggio to be at all as mind? altering as others have made them out to be. I keep to my tried and true playlists when I want to utterly exude feelings/frequencies lol

       Absolutely.  And who knows, maybe binaural beats and such only work well for specific people.  I'd much rather hear it incorporated into full musical works than listening to a dry tone.

       Also, maybe it's just me, but Youtube's sorting algorithm after they have a lot of info on you is creepy.  It's not bad...just creepy.

       No accostment intended, but if you don't believe in this stuff, that's fine. That doesn't mean OP or anyone else who believes in remote viewing, prophetic dreaming or visions, or any concepts of the like are wrong. Sure, their prophecy may not be 100%, and sure, more than likely "they" don't know or care if OP specifically has these prophecies. But also, you cannot offer any evidence that whatever it is they experience isn't real, especially if you haven't experienced any of it for yourself. The US military has done extensive research into just remote viewing alone.

       Signals going into our brain at a certain Hz level will cause our body to react a certain way. Knowing these reactions means you chain stimuli in order to intensify the reaction.

       Well, considering that propaganda was very successful during WW2 and the Cold war and subliminal messaging in theatres was banned in the 60's/70's. I would guess that this tech has been around since the 80's. Or, one could argue that the tech has always been here, but it is now Propaganda mk2 or mk3

       Possible answers I could find involve varying parts of the body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The heart is generally at 1.2 Hz or something, but depending on actual BPM 2 or more Hz would not be unheard of. Clearly, the brain "oscillates" at varying Hz depending on the state thereof, such as alpha, beta, delta, or theta. Suffice it to say it can vary widely for each individual and further to specific organs and yet further depending on their "brain state."
      </p>
      <p>
       Far from it to simply acknowledge that we know all things have a specific frequency, as most certainly all states of matter vibrate at a certain rate. There was a man who developed a medically applied "resonance/frequency gun" in the late 1920s. Raymond Rife, who found success in using it to treat specific viruses and cancers by tuning the frequency generator to a resonant frequency and simply aiming. From what there is to read about it on these tubes, the AMA went after him. There was a lab, not sure if it was actually Dr. Rife's, devoted to energy medicine in New Jersey which was burned down mysteriously in the mid to late 1930s.

       <em>
        will
       </em>
       are, any number of outcomes could occur from the unleashing of this technology’s true purpose. It certainly makes our situation much more dire, which who knows, may help overflow our ranks. Time is

       I would advise a harmonizing field. This is done by a fractal vortex field effect which steps down incoming energy into useable cellular locomotion. Imagine the incoming radiation beaming from the tower. Imagine that interacting with your toroidal EM field. Imagine your field spinning in time with the frequency of the incoming radiation, harmonizing the two energy fields. Imagine channeling the incoming energy into useable work. This can be channeled into the Earth, into organs for healing, etc.

       In the show Brooklyn 99 they casually show a Homeland Security weapon that tortures by sound. On season 1 episode 19 "Tactical Village", Rosa Diaz uses it on Charles Boyle. Oddly I cannot find that scene on youtube (Ive tried alot) from that episode.
