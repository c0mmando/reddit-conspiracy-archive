       Title says most of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just out of LOGIC alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       We say: Syria used chemical weapons (which we have) on civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we bomb the production facilities/factories etc.  Would that not release said chemical weapons on the local population?
      </p>
      <p>
       OR...
      </p>
      <p>
       Did we really bomb chemical weapons facilities?
      </p>
      <p>
       IF we did bomb chemical weapons facilities. How much did chemical weapons release?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was anyone killed through the release of said chemical weapons. Because I am SURE I would be hearing of it if we did.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Is the MSM hiding civilian deaths? Do not think so. Russia would be using civilian deaths as a stick with which to beat the west.
      </p>
      <p>
       So... Either Russia and the west are complicit in hiding civilian deaths. We did not bomb chemical weapons facilities. Or Russia is also complicit in this "game". Because would they not be pointing out the lack of civilian deaths?
      </p>
      <p>
       Come to that... If I was Russia? I would have put a bunch of chemical weapons in the places to BE bombed and then I could blame the west for them releasing the chemicals on civilians.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       My understanding is that Russia knew of places to be bombed.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they went along with it.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Somehow. This DOES smack of they same old war drums that were uses on Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know. Iraq that country that had chemical weapons that we did not find.

       CW are often stored as what are known as precursors which alone may be toxic but aren't as dangerous as the  completed CW.

       The temperatures induced in a missile strike are general enough to vaporise the chemical and render it inert.

       vaporizing a chemical doesn't necessarily make it inert.  And you are assuming a direct hit, not every part of the blast is at the same temperature.  A blast could potentially spread chemicals around and contaminate the area.

       Not if they are precursors as he said. Most if not all chem weapons are stored unmixed or inactive. This was supposedly a binary chem weapon so it would be stored separately.

       This whole thing is still almost certainly fake, even allowing that possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       If NATO had wanted to determine the truth about these facilities, they had the opportunity to request OPCW investigators go there and inspect the facilities.  Instead they simply bombed them.  Quite suspicious, and reminiscent of Clinton's attack on an aspirin factory in Suda.

       Surely an explosion creates heat, but the idea to completely "heat up" the whole chemical weapon facility and render all stored dangerous chemicals as inert by shooting over 100 missiles at it, seems ridiculous.

       I would really like to know how this is supposed to look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the chemicals were not surrounded by walls, this doesn't seem to make sense. How could they ensure all of it ignites hot enough to render it inert and nothing gets blown away from a shockwave?
      </p>
      <p>
       They shot over 100 rockets at this facility. Even if they knew exactly where every single barrel was stored, it sounds near impossible, to ignite the chemical agents so completely tha nothing gets blown away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe with something that blows up as hot, big and quickly like a nuke, but not with 100 Tomahawk-like missiles, that hit over a timespan of several hours .

       100 tomahawks is 100,000 pounds of high explosive. Thats quite a bit. Imagine if you packed a building with 100,000 pounds of explosive. Do you think it would explode and destroy everything around it?

       Hmm. Really? Please, go on. You obviously have evidence to support this statement.

       So.. You put some poison on a car door handle (in the rain) and an entire western town is shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you bomb a few chemical weapons storage facilities in a brown country and it is no problem, because they can handle it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh. OK.  Thanks for that clarification. We use "special" missiles nowadays that "are general enough to vaporise the chemical and render it inert"
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh. Ok then that makes sense now. Silly me.

       I am questioning the western narrative.

       He has chemical weapons and is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       We blew up his chemical weapons which makes us good.
      </p>
      <p>
       We did not hurt anyone with our bombs. They are special bombs that do not hurt people. Our bombs can neutralise chemical weapons!

      <p>
       Really?

        The first one, known as BLU-119/B CrashPAD, was fielded during 2003 to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. This 2,000-pound Mk84 bomb comes loaded with a mix of high explosive and white phosphorus. The explosive ruptures drums or other containers while the phosphorus burns at high temperature, neutralizing the chemical agent. This was later joined by Shredder, a similar design based on a hardened bomb casing which can reach stockpiles stashed in reinforced, concrete-hardened bunkers.

        HEAF’s biggest hurdle was turning thermite powder into a toothpaste-like texture. But the team succeeded in finding a suitable binder to create the first ever plasticized thermite.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because thermite does not self-ignite, the mixture is spread and detonated by a high-explosive inner core. The result is a ‘persistent thermitic cloud’ to rapidly destroy chemical agents. As of 2017, the HEAF team were working on scaling up to produce and use the thermite in large quantities to be used in a successor to Shredder known as Penetrating Agent Defeat.

       Harm reduction. MSM and military speak for: Yeah but we did not kill as many people as we could have!
      </p>
      <p>
       I am saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       We accuse them of using chemical weapons on civilians. So we blow up the "stockpiles" . And kill civilians doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have zero moral ground. Nothing to beat our armchair-warrior chests for.
      </p>
      <p>
       We either killed civilians to protect civilians from being killed (which is bullshit). Or, we did not bomb what we said we did. Or if we did bomb (what our press call) chemical weapons storage facilities, and there was nothing there. Then why are we bombing them?
      </p>

       Cough, cough, bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) You do not need planes to drop chemical weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Huh? That just seems to be a line thrown in there to fill space? Did you kill all the planes? Because you know they could, possibly, use other planes.... Or helicopters, or cars or.....
      </p>
      <p>
       C) Our tech is so almightily wonderful that we did in fact track and trace ever single plane used to use chemical weapons. Each plane that was used, was taken out individually. THAT I would say was impressive. And if we did that? THAT Would send a message. But it seems that we did not. So there goes that idea....

       No way to know for sure if all was consumed.. depending on if it was windy.. if there was an inversion for temperature.. but most chemical agents being used are considered non persistent which means they don’t linger around because they are light assuming the normal air has a weight of 1, but they dissipate into the air most of the time. The initial areas that are targeted by chemical munitions usually get affected by bystanders that can breathe in the chemicals. But most of this would be consumed while the building is burning and the rest of it probably aired out. It doesn’t linger around an area.. just like when you blow smoke into the air.. the molecules move and turn into different things like normal air once they lose their chemical bonds.. chemistry..

       Your ignorance of science or a subject you know nothing about or have has experience with means nothing but that just ignorance. It’s not negative to not know something.. gather information then state your claims.. but don’t act childish without research.

       They do.. it’s been primary means of military demilitarizing our own US chemical weapons for as long as I can read. It’s simple science really.. you do some research and when or if you’d like to discuss anything further let me know ? I’ve wrote some other comments if you care to scroll down and see.. explaining other ways things happen.. and again.. idk if there was or wasn’t anything in these facilities

       I think the big picture is being missed here..... The whole scenario was faked to keep America involved in the Syria shithole. Unfortunately, I think Trump is in on this one also. Maybe part of a tactical, politically correct dradual removal set up with Putin. Would make sense when the word is that Putin was notified (even maybe directed) where and when the strikes would happen days in advance. Also explains why the Russian anti missle defenses did not shoot any down if they happened to be shut off during that time.

       If you guys speak with an actual Syrian from Syria they will give you an explanation of what's going on over there MUCH MUCH different than what you believe here on r/conspiracy or on the MSM, or even alternative sources. It's a hodgepodge of religious fervor, political jostling for power, and oil/territory control. In other words, the situation happening over there is so COMPLEX, that the solution to problems over there aren't black and white and will be very difficult to bring peace or stabilization to the region. Normally I would say continue with the theories, but when it comes to Syria I think MOST of the conspiracy theories are incorrect and unsubstantiated.

       There was a long and brutal drought that preceded the war that saw mass migrations to the cities as people tried to survive. The limited employment was divvied among the ruling party's religion and not the Muslims or Christians. This was the backdrop to the revolution. People like to think Jews wave a magic wand and everyone just does what they want because reasons, but its always local conditions. All politics is local, as they say.

       True and fair enough, but sometimes weapons are enough to make a group become brazen enough to go from protesting to violent, or religiously fundamental to radical. I mean the logic behind gun control is that less guns means the less likely they're used incorrectly right?

       I didn't say a decent % of people don't want something. Plenty of countries have major disagreements amongst their citizens. I don't know where the fuck the US gets the nerve to add fuel to the fire and help enable uprisings.

       Partly: chemical weapons are stored as two part materials to reduce danger.  They are mixed directly prior to being used.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't a missile do a pretty good job of mixing chemicals by, you know, exploding?  Yes.  That's why missiles destined to be used on chemical weapons facilities also come with a payload of white phosphorus, which burns hot enough to completely destroy chemical weapons.  So the US uses chemical weapons to neutralize chemical weapons.

       No, no, no, you don't get it. While chemical weapons are often stored as 2 inert components which become toxic when mixed, everybody knows US weapons are so smart they keep those components separated when they explode.

       You literally start out your thread with a false assumption that you could've cleared up with google and basic chemistry. No, bombing a chemical facility isn't enough to "release the chemicals and kill civilians", it doesn't work that way.

       Those seem like government speculation.. not facts everyone can determine themselves understanding science. Again I don’t support any claims of any chemical agents or any bombings.. and don’t know what was wear.. all of it is speculation as to reasons we bombed and if there was chemical weapons..

       Just like if you can dilute chemicals it becomes less hazardous.. and I am sure this wasn’t an entire depot storing chemical agents.. possibly just a lab where most are created.. the amount of actual hazardous chemicals in large quantities is probably low in this situation.. but the pre cursors to creating volatile chemicals more then likely were destroyed which individually probably are harmless until produced together like making food. So say it takes water, sodium chloride and bleach to make a nerve agent.. individual these are harmless unless cooked or mixed properly. If this makes sense. I think people are looking at it like chemical agents in containers stacked to the ceiling which probably wasn’t the case.

       You see that word there.... Probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a problem with that word.

       The west probably should not have bombed Syria.

       I say probably.. because probability says most people don’t stockpile chemicals in such ways in open facilities.. usually use bunkers or protected areas for such..

       IF my chemical weapons facility was about to be bombed by the western war mongers. I would not be separating my weapons into contingent parts and storing then safely in bunkers. I would be storing the shit on the roof, ready made and ready to go.

      <p>

       The missiles were accurate to within one meter and the specific ordinance was chosen to neutralize chemical agents according the intelligence which has been gathered since the last chemical attack in 2017.

       These are facts.. and I’m not saying there was anything there at all.. just manipulating facts is what government does best.. and please don’t let ignorance of a topic make you lose your mind and stance for a decent argument. But again these are facts..
