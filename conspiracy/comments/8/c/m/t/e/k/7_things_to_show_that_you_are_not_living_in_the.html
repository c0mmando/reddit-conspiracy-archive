        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>by Paul A. Philips</p>

<p>Alternative media followers know that there are numerous citizens sleeping away with their eyes wide open, falsely believing they’re living in the ‘land of the free.’ They still think that their government ‘cares’ for them….</p>

<p>Taking the case of America as an example, many American citizens have no idea about the nature of their Washington, D.C Judas-despotic leaders and how they are covertly screwing them all over. How they are nothing more than henchmen for the ruling elite’s corporate/banker oppressive control system…</p>

<p>In reflection of this here are just 7 things to show that you’re not living in the ‘land of the free’ and what needs to be done.</p>

<p>“Your livingroom is a factory. The product being manufactured is you.” -Anonymous</p>

<ol>
<li>You’re chained to a 40-hour working week</li>
</ol>

<p>The 40-hour working week is automatically accepted. Economically speaking, you may be living comfortably, but your request for fewer hours to pursue things outside of the workplace would be declined.</p>

<p>In other words you’re given an ultimatum: Do a 40-hour working week or you won’t get any work.</p>

<ol>
<li>Wage slavery</li>
</ol>

<p>Following on from 2, there are indeed many people having to do the 40-hour working week plus overtime on a skimpy hourly rate just to survive: Wage slavery refers to those having to be completely dependent on their next paycheck to make ends meet. Debt, consumerism and inflation are major factors linked to wage slavery (economic slavery) and automatically accepting the 40-hour working week.</p>

<ol>
<li>You’re up to your eyeballs in rules and regulations</li>
</ol>

<p>Increasing in number, these days, there are so many authoritarian ordinances, rules and regulations restricting freedom. There’s very little you can do without permission from your control freak government. Here are just some examples.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do you own a property? If so, then having to forever pay property taxes brings into question the idea of ‘ownership.’ For example, having lived there for some 20 years, you may well have paid the same money in property taxes as the cost of your home.</p></li>
<li><p>For home renovations, you have to let your government know what you’ll be doing to get their permission. Then, on completion, you must make sure that you’ve complied with their regulations.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to sell your homemade produce, no matter how small the cost, you’ll have to pay for a license from the government.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you want to grow your own vegetables for supplementing your food budget? If so, then be careful. You could be criminally charged, then fined. One man was fined for growing vegetables that prevented people from seeing grass! If you go fishing for supplementing your food budget then you’ll need to have a license.</p></li>
<li><p>Your car is one of the many eternal taxes you will have to pay to your government. Indeed, it’s as if the only thing that isn’t taxed is the air you breathe, but who knows, maybe one day there’ll be a levy on that! Consider the shed loads of money the government makes from exponentially increasing ordinances, rules, regulations and taxes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Having not paid the necessary fees or taxes, or not obtained a license or permit from the mafia government you could find yourself in big trouble, not matter how petty or small the non-compliance. Like, for instance, the children outlawed for selling lemonade at a charity.</p>

<p>Then there’s the case of the woman who had her home seized for missing a $6.30 interest charge!</p>

<ol>
<li>Mass surveillance – Your life is not your own</li>
</ol>

<p>Mass surveillance is yet another way in which your freedom has been sabotaged by the government and related departments. In spite of the increasing surveillance and a more and more militarized police state, crime rates have not decreased.</p>

<p>Indeed, a number of us know that surveillance cameras here, there and everywhere go way beyond the purpose of crime detection. So do drone hunters monitoring applications such as your mobile phone activity, spying electronic mosquitoes, body micro-chipping, facial recognition and car number plate detection technology … There are plans for a black box to be installed in every car to monitor drivers. Then there’s a plan for a biometric DNA database on all citizens…</p>

<p>These are just some of the surveillance technologies for a Big Brother control-obsessed government.</p>

<ol>
<li>Can’t say what you want</li>
</ol>

<p>The government’s tyranny of free speech suppression just keeps on growing, everywhere. So-called intolerable speech categorizations such as a ‘trigger-1,’ ‘micro-aggression‘ or ‘red light‘ is encouraged by authorities to be reported, hence, the encouraging of a snitch community. Weasel-brained political correctness, word prohibitions, social media censorship… all contribute to limiting free speech.</p>

<p>When free speech is limited it leads to a nation of citizens who are:</p>

<p>Unable to encompass critical thought
Greatly limited when making choices
Dogmatic and unhealthily skeptical
Extremist and intolerant
Easier to be manipulated and controlled by authorities
More likely to accept authoritative views, no matter how untrue they may be
Likely in numbers to react with violent outbursts due to the ‘bottling up effect’ caused by the suppression
The “Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act”
Over Christmas, like a thief in the night, Obama sneakily passed a bill called the “Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.” It gives the government the powers to label truthful and accurate information that they don’t want you to know about, such as that from alternative media sources, as “propaganda” or “fake news.”</p>

<p>In effect, this new law will be used to block free speech, threatening the existence of alternative/independent media or any other information source deemed anti-government.</p>

<p>This globalist propaganda and the censoring of free speech in America must be stopped by:</p>

<p>Accelerating all efforts to spread the word about this unconstitutional, undemocratic, inhumane, Anti-American and treasonous act and defy…
Encourage leakers such as the governmental whistleblowers and those in the corporate mainstream media to expose the truth.
Lobby the new President-elect Trump and associates to reiterate the 1st Amendment and disparage attempts to brand anti-government information as treasonous.
This act is a desperate attempt (one of many) to stop the rising mass awakening of the people and the consequences of them finding out the truth. But the more governmental tyranny, the more the people wake up…</p>

<ol>
<li>Your alternative views are demonized</li>
</ol>

<p>Following on from 5, as a dissenter, not having the same opinion as the establishment or the masses, you may find yourself demonized for your views or actions, which could even lead you into dire straits through being outlawed. Thus demonizing dissension, especially because an anti-government stance is becoming less tolerated.</p>

<ol>
<li>Criminalizing your goodwill</li>
</ol>

<p>Criminalizing goodwill gestures is part of the war on humanity and your freedom of self-expression. Here are just several examples.</p>

<p>*Taking the case of the homeless. In many American states it is now illegal to donate food to the homeless. If caught, pending your involvement, you could be heavily fined. Those in a church at Dundalk, Maryland found this out the hard way. The church was fined a whopping $12,000 for letting the homeless sleep overnight at its outside grounds.
Another Good Samaritan criminalized for his compassion, trying to make a difference to the plight of the homeless, was Jay Hamberger. Because of helping the homeless for some 27 years in Houston he became an outlaw.</p>

<p>Further, it is now illegal to be homeless. How do authorities expect these impoverished people to pay the fines?? Even their meager possessions: bedclothes, clothes, tents, papers, medications … are confiscated. How could any policeman confiscating these possessions not consider this action to be inhumane?</p>

<p>Will these outrageous prohibitions find their way across the entire country? According to researcher Michael Snyder they will as part of the war on the homeless.</p>

<p>*Not too long ago an awful flooding occurred in Louisiana. Because of a delayed response from the government-backed rescue team, locals decided to take the situation into their own hands. However, before they could deal with the rising waters and rescue their neighbors from the terrible consequences of the flooding, government officials blocked off the area with police barriers because the rescuers didn’t have the demanded permits. – Aw c’mon!</p>

<p>*Even the smallest acts of goodwill now demand that laws and regulations be followed: Do you want to exchange your home-grown goodies with someone else? You could be outlawed if you haven’t paid your government for a permit and taxes on the exchange.</p>

<p>That concludes just 7 of many things to show that you’re not living in the ‘land of the free.’</p>

<p>Final thoughts – what needs to be done?
Clearly, the government wants complete control. They want you to be dependent on them for everything. However, the more control freak they become – the more enforced prohibitions, restrictions, taxes, police violence, sophisticated surveillance and tracking technologies etc. – the more the people will object. Having reached breaking point, the people will then decide they’ve had enough, while realizing that their government is (and has been) obsolete. The government knows this and is desperately afraid of losing its grip on an overwhelming number of awakened citizens ready to take action.</p>

<p>More and more people are realizing the illegitimacy of Big Government. The truth is we don’t have ANY contract with them. We don’t need their permission to do anything. Taking the case of taxes, taxation is theft (see video).</p>

<p>The solution is to stop giving your power away. Stop cooperating with the control system. We are the imagination of ourselves and anything’s possible. So, let’s create a new paradigm experience, a new humanity out of what is possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok...but this is the nature of becoming a &#39;citizen&#39;.  It means that you have given up your right to self governance and agree to slavery under the ideology of citizenship.  You voluntarily sign up to be a slave and slaughtered on the whim of another human being, or subjugated and destroyed.  This is the very root and core of &#39;civilization&#39; a horrific nightmare of perpetual enslavement and parasitic predation by the few against the &#39;many&#39;.  Humanity was far better off without &#39;civilization&#39; and the parasitic subjugation of all of us...if there were skirmishes they were small and localized, if their was starvation it too was minimized as people simply migrated.  If there was oppression, the &#39;leadership&#39; was simply killed.  People were not forced to follow a leader that they didn&#39;t want.  </p>

<p>If they didn&#39;t want someone leading them (and right now you HAVE NO CHIOCE AT ALL ABOUT ANY LEADERS; the &#39;appearance of choice&#39; backed by the force of the state, is not choice...don&#39;t be retards).  Now with &#39;civilization&#39; you MUST follow where incompetent, vicious psychopaths lead wether you want to or not...you will be killed for not following someone that you don&#39;t believe in, who is psychotic or is incompetent or criminal.</p>

<p>This &#39;civilization&#39; is totally EVIL top to bottom there is nothing uncorrupted about it.  It is the worst thing that has ever happened to human beings...the &#39;breeding&#39; of a pathetic slave class with no backbone or ability to even withstand the most basic parasitic evil is an abomination on earth as you are eugenically purged of everyone brave, decent and honest to make way for shitty, weak willed, incompetent, psychopaths, disgustingly immoral and confused &#39;host&#39; or cattle for the parasites in the general population.   People are so pathetic that they can&#39;t even form their own beliefs any longer without the &#39;state/religion&#39; to guide them in their beliefs.</p>

<p>Domestication (the long term plan of having a retarded and weak slave class of humanity that is ruled by a parasitic psychopathic class of &#39;overlords&#39;) is working out well as people are voluntarily mating with the most violent low IQ races and the most intelligent and thoughtful races are being flooded by &#39;willing rapists&#39; in the hope of corrupting the DNA of those with even the slightest potential to fight back.  Humanity is physically, morally, culturally and ideologically controlled and &#39;told what to think&#39; by someone who is not themselves...always searching for &#39;the truth&#39; you are run around in ever increasing circles searching for something that can not be provided by an &#39;outside source&#39;.</p>

<p>You are told that &#39;things are going to get better&#39; BUT NOT FOR YOU...they are going to get better for the parasitic class because YOU are on a trajectory to HELL...as your DNA and minds are subverted and destroyed, not enriched or free.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a whole lot of hope that people will see and understand that THE WHOLE THING IS UTTERLY CORRUPTED and that there isn&#39;t a SINGLE THING IN THE WHOLE OF IT THAT IS &#39;WORTH SAVING&#39;.  The entire mess is a shit coated pill of your own destruction.  There is no &#39;red pill&#39; and no &#39;blue pill&#39; just a SHIT PILL that you will be forced to swallow or be killed for bucking.  There are, after all, plenty of &#39;other humans&#39; to fill your place in their shitty psychopathic and disgusting &#39;breeding program&#39; of the domestication and destruction of humanity if you don&#39;t like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to desperate society from government unless you want to make a larger point that government coerces society and give examples of that. For example “Can’t say what you want” and “alternative views” are complaints dealing with people using their free speech to criticize other people free speech. You’re allowed to say whatever you want but not everyone has to agree with you. It wasn’t too long ago that poem like Howl or books like Junkie or comics like Carlin and Lenny Bruce or musicians like The Doors were literally arrested for their expression. That’s not happening now. If it is please point to the examples so i can join in your outrage. </p>

<p>&quot;But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.&quot;</p>

<p>I know this quote tends to be over used, but the solution may well be throwing off this government and establishing a new one. It won&#39;t be easy, but I like to believe it would be worth it.</p>

<p>Yea, but who establishes the new one? With all the crazy levels of anti-Trump hate I see pushed by the media these days, it sounds very much to me like they are trying to push some kind of uprising. You trust the anti-Trump crowd to create the new government? Because that&#39;s a far more terrifying world to live in IMO.</p>

<p>Why does advocating the creation a new government mean I <em>must</em> trust some outside group to do it for me? If we were to found a new government why would we allow <strong>any</strong> old paradigm (anti-Trump, pro-Trump, Republican, Democrat, etc) dictate and control such a creation?</p>

<p>To truly found a new government we must let go of all the divisions pushed on us that are used to distract and separate us. And to answer your question <strong>we the People</strong> must step up to create this and not make the mistake of leaving it to a hand full of elites again. Just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sounds totally good to me! I just don&#39;t know if I trust the mass public right now to just throw away all of their previous conditioning and brainwashing from the MSM/education system/etc. and do it properly. </p>

<p>we the People must step up to create this and not make the mistake of leaving it to a hand full of elites again. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you refering to the Founding Fathers? Because they DID forsee all of this and try to prevent against it. Government intervention has caused a large majority of the problems that we face today, mainly by them trying to fix other problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With the exception of mass surveillance, this is a bunch of overblown hooey. There are a ton of easy answers to your &quot;dilemmas&quot; but it sounds like you think everything should be free.</p>

<p>Pick and choose some events, like Dundalk homeless people. That church was surrounded by businesses. If I had a business there, I wouldn&#39;t be wanting a bunch of homeless people around either. The city had to do something to protect the businesses so they fined them the $12k but they didn&#39;t make them pay and then worked with the church to figure it out how to help. Or the person who lost their home for $6.30, I guarantee, 100%, that they got a certified notice, by a sheriff, in person, that it needed to be paid. That is their own fault for being a dumbass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right, I don&#39;t subscribe to every conspiracy theory. But so what if I have dissenting views? And there are really only 2 of them, pizzagate and when they minge about how awful their life is because of what the govt does. I think they need to grow a pair of balls on that. But I guess that discredits me from this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I welcome dissent. Thanks for bringing alternative views. I think your tone is a bit combative, but that&#39;s just a personal style choice. It&#39;s funny how some people will talk about &#39;free speech&#39; and then attack it when confronted by opposing views. Personally, I believe there is too much government and corporate over-reach, and personal autonomy is being curtailed, but anyone can disagree (especially when they give evidence to a view). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree this is ridiculous, the free speech thing is the worst part about his whole rant.  In the US I am not afraid to say anything ever basically, I know that I’m not gonna get thrown in prison or attacked or anything like for speaking my mind.  I’d call that free speech </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is something that has bothered me my entire life.
Since my earliest age I knew this place was really fucked on a deep fundamental level.
In 2015 I finally gave it a name, <strong>the program</strong>, I noticed the same words used in that post/article.
Here is the thing, we are at the peak of the end of our current civilization, we all sense this, something else will come to take its place and at the moment it seems the leftist technocratic globalists are looking to take over and enslave humanity, really that is just another face of our current world order, same shit new faces.
We need a peer-to-peer system for society and civilization, we need to rethink how our society functions, how cities and villages should function, how we interact with one and another.
I would like to see an absolute end to government and monetary systems.</p>
