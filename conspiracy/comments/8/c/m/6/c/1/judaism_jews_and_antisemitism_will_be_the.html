<p>I don&#39;t know if people are racist, stupid or purposely prodding the hornest nest, but the anti-Semitism can damage this whole sub. We saw how coontown, fatpeoplehate and neofag were all banned for race hate. There is nothing stopping the Reddit owners from shutting this place down due to anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>Questioning the morals and ethics of any country, including Israel, isn&#39;t a problem. Linking posts to how people were born Jewish, even though they weren&#39;t born in Israel, is plain stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of neo-nazis recruiting around here.  Nazis are going to Nazi.  There isn&#39;t much you can do about them, unfortunately, because they cling together like the rats they are and know how to infiltrate forums too well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying criticism of Israel, Zionism, or the Jewish race as a whole is out of bounds, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s quite obvious there are people here trying to recruit for Nazism and spread Nazi ideology, in the disingenuous way Nazis always act.  Attacking the Jews (who many people dislike) is a means to the end to introduce Nazi-followers to a wider ideology of eugenics, asinine race-science, and Nazi mysticism.  Fascism needs an Other to create the necessary mentality in the people in order to function.  The funny thing is that Nazis and their ilk are the perfect tool of elites for controlling the population - nothing is better for them then a paramilitary of dumb shock troops who terrorize anyone who questions the ruling ideology.  That&#39;s why American big business are European aristocracy backed the Nazis, and made sure Nazism became a big thing, and spent great effort spreading Nazi ideas both during the Nazi era and after (thinly disguising them in various forms, many of which remain popular today).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth is that there is no way Nazis would have done anything other than the Final Solution.  When they say &quot;kill all the Jews&quot; repeatedly, it should surprise no one that they kill lots of Jews, just as they killed the disabled, communists, and other political enemies.  Pretending anything else is fucking ridiculous.</p>

<p>The point of holocaust denial isn&#39;t to be right, it&#39;s to shout an absurdity as loud as possible and use intimidation to cow everyone else into silence.  It should be no surprise that Zionists use the same tactics to crush dissent against the Jewish state and deny what is happening to the native Arabs - that&#39;s what fascists do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking out of your ass. No Nazi ever said &#39;kill all the jews&#39;. The final solution was always to be the enforced relocation of the jewish people into their own jewish state. Read Theodor Herzls &#39;Judenstaat&#39; in which the term &#39;final solution to the jewish question&#39; is first used in 1912. Stop getting your history from facebook soundbites and kids discovery channel shows. </p>

<p>When it was the holocaust that gave us such absurdities as the now largely disproven but back then fiercely enforced claim of shrunken heads, jew fat soap, jew meat sausages, jew skin canvases etc.</p>

HATRED.

    <div class="md"><p>If you are referring to the religious story behind Judaism, that&#39;s a religion. You can join God&#39;s chosen people by converting to the Jewish faith. &quot;God&#39;s chosen people&quot; is an idea that arises from the pseudohistorical narrative of Jewish scripture. The guys that travelled around with Moses and friends being (hopefully) monotheistic and faithful to the Jewish God - those were the &#39;chosen people&#39;. </p>

<p>There is no implicit biological/ethnic component to Judaism, which in fact serves as the main inspiration for Christians and Muslims as well. Islam for example very clearly rejects the idea of ethnic superiority of the Arabs over the non-Arabs, which can be seen as this same concept as observed in Judaism - sure, Mohammad is chosen by God to be the prophet and the first people he taught God&#39;s calling to happened to be Arabs, but that doesn&#39;t give them special rights within the religious community, which Islam refers to as the Ummah.</p>

<p>Same story with Judaism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if Judaism is a religion why is antisemitism comparable to race-hate? Or hate at all? You know who is obsessed with the idea of &#39;hate&#39; ? Jews. Objecting to Israels genocide of Palestinians means you hate jews. Objecting to the ridiculous absurd claim of Germans turning jews into sausages and soap means you hate jews. Stating facts about powerful people in finance being jewish means you hate jews. Stating facts about historical figures having been jewish means you hate jews. It&#39;s almost as if pointing out any uncomfortable truth that the jews would rather you don&#39;t point out, is hatred of jews. Funny how that goes huh? We&#39;re already at a stage where objecting to your own demographic genocide (Kalergi plan) as a white person is immediately equated with hating jews, and hating everyone who&#39;s not like you. How the fuck do they justify that insane of a jumping to conclusions? Asking that question is obviously hate too. Who brought us &#39;hatecrimes&#39; ? Yes, jews. Who brought us &#39;hatespeech&#39; laws? Yes, jews. Jews are absolutely obsessed with the idea that any resistance to their agenda is driven by hate. They need this disgusting racist canard because they cannot win were things to be debated openly and fairly. Because it is they who hate, and their actions prove it beyond any shadow of doubt. &#39;Antisemites&#39; do not need to resort to shallow infantile accusations of hate, because the facts are on their side.</p>

<p>And things are only going to get worse, and all the more so if we let ourselves be silenced and intimidated by agenda-driven and ignorant people.</p>

<p>Also you can think of jews whatever you like. Religion, cult, sports club, whatever. They think of themselves as a tribe, a people. NOT as a religion. That&#39;s why you have marranos and dönmeh. </p>

<p>That&#39;s brilliant. You just solved the Palestinian Crisis.</p>

<p>All the Palestinians have to do is convert to Judaism - en masse - and they can all live happily ever after with their Jewish brothers and sisters in the Jewish State.</p>
