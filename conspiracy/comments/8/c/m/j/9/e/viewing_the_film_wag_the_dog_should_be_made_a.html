       Despite being a dark comedy, it is the most accurate depiction of how the forces of government, public relations, and the media influence and direct public opinion by using fake terror attacks, prefabricated narratives, patriotic emotionalism, and special effects, in addition to bizarrely predicting real world events that would take place within a few short years after the film's release.

       Missiles are not a hoax. This is a problem with not understanding physics.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Missiles are flown angled slightly upward, so the thrust opposes gravity, not just lift.
       </li>
       <li>
        Body lift exists. A brick will fly if you give it enough thrust.
       </li>
       <li>
        Small wings generate greater lift at greater airspeeds. Many cruise missiles use this. The primary purpose of fins on most missiles, though, is for control.
       </li>
       <li>
        Some missiles follow a ballistic trajectory: no flight necessary.

       My understanding of missiles and aerodynamics and bait n switch etc leads me to dismiss his claims(my Accord). Why portray it in a way where he shouldn't be allowed to present at all? In this world, it makes me question the self appointed arbiters more than the 'free speaking individual.'

       Oh, he can present it and we can discredit it, Fibe. But he dines here to exclusively shill his content... ok... but worse than that uses it to promote his paid website.

        How?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Guidance fins at the rear increase drag and/or angle-of-attack on a particular axis, relative to the fins that stay straight and level. As long as the missile is moving
       <em>
        through
       </em>
       the air, it can adjust its aspect with the guidance fins. Internal gyroscopes tell the missile which way is “up” so it always knows which fins to move to create the effect it needs to change directional aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re still not convinced, consider a boat crossing a flowing river to the opposite riverbank, with the current pulling it downstream. The rudder (at the rear) allows the boat to orient itself slightly upstream, so that the means of propulsion (the rower, the outboard motor) can counteract the current enough to move straight across.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gravity is the river pushing downstream. The missile’s fins are the rudder, pointing the nose up. Air is the fluid instead of water. Gyroscopes direct the fins to provide “buoyancy” that keeps the missile upright on the horizontal plane, instead of rotating. The thrust from the missile’s rocket motor acts like the rower’s paddles, or the outboard motor. All the same principles apply.

       I played with pretty large model aeroplanes and rockets as a kid thanks to a rich uncle. They use the same kind of guidance fins. The radio control operator can then adjust the flight path or it can be pre-programmed.

       Prove it to yourself that control surfaces work the same way. Make a paper airplane and cut some slits into it like
       <a href="http://www.funpaperairplanes.com/img/PageArt/elevator.png">
        this
       </a>
       . Bend the flaps of paper between the slits up and throw it. Bend them down and throw it again. Bend one up and one down, and throw it. Swap which one is up and which one is down and throw it again. Observe what happens. It works the same way as how they say fins on missiles work. It's how planes work (with the exception of wing-warping control on very old or very light aircraft). This isn't some secret esoteric knowledge.

       It's not faith; there are mountains of evidence. Like the other commenter who replied, I have personally flown model rockets with fins and model planes. I have seen the rockets that other people flew with gyroscope control of the fins at the college I attended. I have flown in planes and seen the control surfaces on the wings out the window. They work just like they say missiles do. I don't know why this is so hard for you to believe; it's not an outrageous claim. I saw the final space shuttle launch (they use thrust vectoring rather than guidance fins) and as it ascends you can see the trail of exhaust arc over horizontally as it heads into orbit.

       Don’t bother, I sent him articles and chapters on missile crises break theory, examples of different control systems on missiles from fins to vanes, to thrust vectoring. Explained ballistic trajectories. Explained computer flight controls. Sent video of missiles in flight. He disregards and brushes away everything. He will only believe it if strapped to a missile and fired and even then he would find a reason to call it fakery.

       That question depends on your definition and my definition. Are we talking about the same thing, in general enough terms? I’m using an analogy to explain the principles involved, which I’ve seen tested on scale models that operate just fine at a similar scale of claimed real-life missile performance. The scaling fits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any generalised description where you can accept that A is similar enough to B to be a representative model? Or is the objective to nitpick the definitions until the two things inevitably appear non-equivocal, when examined closely?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could do that with any two apparently similar things too, if I drilled down far enough. But that is t the point I’m making.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general concept of how guidance fins work applies to a scale model, so why would the same concept
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       apply to a full-scale guided middle? Of course there will be differences in capabilities, in material strength and weight, in reliability, and in cost, but the fundamental design principles are the same for both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       otherwise, that is.

       Stick your hand out the window of a car while driving down the road. Angle it up and down and feel how the air applies force to it. The car is providing the "thrust". You could try this holding a brick or block of wood out of the window (just don't drop it).

       You have been explained many times how missile control systems such as vectored thrust, fins, vanes, lifting bodies, thrust tonweight ratio, speed vs surface area required for lift etc... but you ignore those and keep promoting this drivel.

       You have been sent videos and explanations and testimony and yet still hawk your poorly conceived video. Even for specific missiles and flight profiles.

       I could only imagine kids in school getting hurt by words in today's society. I am a "millennial" that grew up on the old 'sticks &amp; stones...' saying. I was bullied all through HS for not being a 'cool kid' but I never went and whined about it. I just knew that in the future they would be the one in a trailer park juggling child support bills, not me. Kids are such pussies anymore.

       It's funny... We had to read all manner of "classics" in High School --
       <em>
        1984

       ,
       <em>
        Brave New World

       <em>
        Animal Farm

       , etc., etc. -- that are directly relevant to the mess we find ourselves in now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not one student in my classes (including myself) ever said, "Hey, this is exactly what's happening today!" I wonder if they would have been disappeared if they had. Or maybe this was intended to help those more conscious folks figure out the game and GTFO before it's too late.

       If you enjoy the Kubrick/Apollo theory, the Dustin Hoffman character here represents Kubrick. His inability to not expose the fabricated event leads to his hushed up murder. Hell, he's even called Stanley in the film.

       I saw that coming. I loved reading 1984 in junior high. Really opened my eyes and made me ask questions. I was also required to read "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest".

       Imo we gotta look back around mass shootings and other big things in the news and find small news stories that never really gained traction. That's where we'll find what they're hiding.

       He is shilling his own content which drives people to his paid $20 per month subscription site. He thinks he is clever in trung to recruit subscrubers here.

       He is literally engaged in disseminating false and misguided information for profit.

      <p>
       Countless people have explained basic physics and engineering to him.

       Check his history. He doesn’t believe in all history, all war, dinosaurs, missiles, space, gravity, the moon, a round earth, the stars, evolution, etc etc.

       He is either a con artist or the Kruger Dunning effect in the flesh but the motivation is simple, to get paid.
