        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Who is Jesus?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s likely Jesus was the son of the devil. A very bad man, who  Jesus decided he wanted to be nothing like from an early age. So Jesus became the polar opposite a very good man, but a bit two dimensional because of his innate inability to be bad.</p>

<p>So my theory of Jesus early years is he did lowly labor for his first thirty years and as his body starts to wear and his life starts to dwindle he looks for other avenues.</p>

<p>Then John meets Jesus, and sees this Jesus guy who is nothing but good, but meek, and quiet, essentially a guy who can be praised endlessly but does not speak much. </p>

<p>I think at this point the universe sends John a divine message that Jesus is the Son of God or John sees this Jesus is the person most incapable of evil he has ever met.</p>

<p>So Jesus now starts meeting people, and becomes a somebody where as before he was a low life laborer. Slowly he starts coming more and more to life. They can see his is very unique in his energy shining warm and bright like the sun. So they follow him in the desert for 40 days and get thirsty as hell.</p>

<p>Then he meets Mary Magdalene, who was also kinda dead from being a whore. She gives him some sex magic and now he comes completely alive.</p>

<p>Then his followers see this new Jesus coming to life, and reborn from sex magic are happy for him and Jesus shows them the way to get some of their own sex magic. </p>

<p>These priests and losers who only had water(masturbation) finally get some wine(sex) and now everyone is happy. Except for some of them betrayed Jesus by taking Mary, but REMEMBER Jesus is such a good guy that he doesn&#39;t confront them.</p>

<p>But Jesus can sense something is up and so he says that these people will betray him. </p>

<p>Judas, the evilest. Wants Jesus completely out of the picture, and their is some crime some rich person commit, and they say to Judas, say you saw Jesus commit this crime and we will pay you 30 silver.</p>

<p>So Judas outright lies and says he saw Jesus commit this crime.</p>

<p>Then as Jesus is on his way to Crucifixion, no one speaks up for him. Perhaps they don&#39;t like Jesus as much as they like talking about Jesus, and think it&#39;s best he&#39;s out of the picture so more of the attention can be on them.</p>

<p>So Jesus was a savior to his friends, at the cost of his life. So the story of Jesus is really a cautionary tale on being too good and oblivious of the group.</p>

<p>TLDR - Jesus was a low life, good, loser, who was identified as the best person he had ever seen by John(most incapable of evil), then he starts preaching, gets bigger, gets women for himself and friends, is TOO good and willing to sacrifice himself for his friends.</p>

<p>Some betray Jesus slightly, and then Judas betrays him completely.</p>
