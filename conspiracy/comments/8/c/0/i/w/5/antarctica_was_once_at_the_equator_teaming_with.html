       What about Antarctica has kept it somewhat off limits to any conflict. Essentially every world power has or had some sort of presence there, Russia, the US, Nazi Germany, even through their many conflicts with eachother over the decades, Antarctica has never been a continent to ever have a battle in documented history despite it being rich in resources that are supposedly sought after elsewhere. The Rockefellers and Rothschilds funded many of the first expeditions to Antarctica and continue to have a presence there. Are they suddenly interested in preserving the environment in Antarctica when otherwise elsewhere they couldn't give two fucks?

       ...Please don't respond if you don't even know that under antarctica is actually land which was at the equator and full of plant life. Oil is just organic material placed through a process of pressure and time. They've already discovered a wealth of oil but there is an agreement to not drill for oil. There is a bit of exploratory drilling going on.

       Also the presence of ancient civilizations architecture, that could or could not be there, would confront so hard the main history timeline narrative that we all learn in schools hard. So the global elites that tried so hard to hide this mass ancient knwoledge from the people, will lose their power if that kind of stuff come to surface.

       I'm a bit sceptical, since the last time Antarctica was near the equator was during the Cambrian period, more than 100 million years

        before
       </em>
       the dinosaurs.

       Fell months ago I would be even more sceptical them today about this subject. But once you start to dig around the possibility of advanced cultures dating 12.000 years, and their proposed technology, it is not a far way concept. 
I'm not saying that they were there in the cambriam period, but that they where there before their cataclysm

       So if those in power have it all to themselves. Isn't it strange that those same people have had so many wars and conflicts around the planet, but agree to be hands off Antarctica? It makes you wonder who is really pulling the strings and really makes me question the legitimacy of many wars since this agreement.

       Antartica Treaty. Prevents military presence or resource extraction. Ratified by all the big players. Plus it's freakin cold and unprofitable to extract resources. It's oil reserves are unproven and estimates vary widely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes good things happen like the Antartica Treaty. It's also good for another 3 decades and ratified by Congress so a President can't just ignore it and start drilling without a 2/3 majority in both Congress.

       Great response, was hoping someone would go into the treaty. So all the big players are there and have been there awhile. With global warming happening, its not very long before much of Antarctica is exposed and dare I say livable. Isn't that convenient for those who know the wealth of resources and possibly knowledge that lies beneath?

       Oil is an almost inexhaustible resource, old previously dry oil wells are known to fill up and contain even more than they did before. Starting wars to get oil is just distractions on top of distractions. Talking about oil shortages is all about creating artificial shortage and revving up prices and pushing the "green" movement.

       This is the responce i was looking for. If only isnt as scarce or valuable as we are led to believe on a daily basis, why are the elites gaze so fixed on this worthless hunk of ice?

       I came across a post on here the other day that basically said that overpopulation wasn't as big an issue they make it to be... and now you're saying that oil is almost an inexhaustible resource? MIND BLOWN

       That's not proof that oil is "almost inexhaustible" at all.

       I imagine all the energy to keep equipment and workers warm, and to ship the oil north, might come close to canceling out the energy extracted from the oil.

       I agree, so if its pointless to drill there for oil. Why are so many entities who otherwise have never shown a single regard for the environment, still so interested? Why are so many CEO's and Rockefeller stooges sent there? Even Jimmy Carter?

       Assuming they're going there to look at oil prospects, it's probably for the very, very long term. As more reserves are depleted and oil becomes scarcer and thus commands a higher price, stuff like the Antarctic will become economically viable.

       So if those in power have it all to themselves. Isn't it strange that those same people have had so many wars and conflicts around the planet, but agree to be hands off Antarctica? It makes you wonder who is really pulling the strings and really makes me question the legitimacy of many wars since this agreement.
