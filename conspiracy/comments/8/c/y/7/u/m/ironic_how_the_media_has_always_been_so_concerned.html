    <div class="md"><p>I think Russia is a huge issue because the cold war made <em>a lot</em> of people <em>a lot</em> of money, and re-igniting the cold war would ramp up weapons production far beyond the trifling increase 20 years of battling &quot;terror&quot; did. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a dangerous game because a successful cold-war means keeping tension high and the constant fear of nuclear annihilation means a lot of bank accounts will start overflowing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The U.S. isn&#39;t afraid of countries because they have nukes. They are afraid of countries with nukes that realistically might use them. The fear of North Korean is directly related to the instability of their leader.</p>

<p>Also, in the comments your premise breaks down into relying on the assumption that Russia is innocent and it is the U.S. poking them unprovoked. The idea that both countries haven&#39;t been poking eachother with proxy conflicts/espionage etc. for pretty much the last 80 years at least is absurd. Russia has been &quot;biting back&quot; for longer than any of us have been alive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wasn&#39;t the topic of conversation though. You might as well say fish like water. So what? He asked why people are more concerned about NK using nukes than Russia. The answer is the perceived likelihood of their respective leaders actually using the weapon.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re conflating saying what a narrative is and claiming the narrative is factually correct. I did the first, not the second. And your own post seemed to agree that&#39;s the narrative so...? Kim Jong Un has very famously threatened to launch missiles at the U.S. and called them evil pretty much every year since he took office. Here&#39;s a short list just as of 2013. A five second google search will find you more since then. The google search will also show you abunch of missile tests occurring and then being used to to add credibility to the threats. Is that what you&#39;re asking for?...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The OP question is why people are more concerned about nuclear war from Russia or NK. I was careless in my phrasing and should have said &quot;perceived instability&quot;  instead of just saying instability in your bolded quote I admit. And I have admitted and clarified that to you already. The point I was trying to make in response to the OP is not that people are blindly concerned about nuclear countries like Britain for instance, but are concerned based on nukes+ concern over how likely it is that nukes actually be used.  </p>

<p>As far as objectively defending the basis for that perception, that is not what I was trying to do. Though if I had to say why people perceive that again it would be because of missile tests from NK coinciding with threats to Nuke the U.S., coinciding with reports that people want to force regime change in NK which could be another likely triggering event I suppose. I haven&#39;t had lunch with Kim Jong Un, I am not privy to anything classified, I don&#39;t know what inside information you expect me or anyone short of Dennis Rodman to have on how much is bluster vs. real. Though then again there was a lot of reporting that Un had his brother killed so China didn&#39;t have a handy replacement available which would suggest Kim has some non zero level of concern about the regime change threat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The O.P. states his argument as fact without addressing the obvious counter argument to his point. What I have been saying is his position has a large hole, that counter argument, that needs to be addressed in order to have a sound position. That doesn&#39;t mean it could not be addressed theoretically, but that there is a problem when it is not.  If you want me to create a summary/facsimile of the argument that would need to be addressed I think, projecting my own understanding, it would look something like the below. </p>

<p>The U.S. killed a ton of Russian Mercenaries in Syria already whom presumably could not be there without Putin&#39;s blessing. Russia&#39;s position is simply to pretend it didn&#39;t happen because they are as disinterested in open war with the U.S. as we are. Syria is a proxy war being used for political points in the same vein the U.S. and Russia have been sniping each through and after the cold war. While this is horrific as a human rights/ethical issue, neither country has any interest in direct military war nor has there been a whisper of such in my lifetime. Nobody other than a few fringe crazies in either country wants any part of a direct war and every person in both countries is aware of the MAD concept. I don&#39;t think of them as a threat to nuke/attack the U.S. militarily outside of these type of proxy skirmishes whatsoever.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if someone attempted regime change in North Korea (internally or externally) which has been seriously debated the last two+ decades and Un thought he was losing I wouldn&#39;t be surprised in the least for him to launch anything and everything he could prior to going out. There isn&#39;t  MAD to prevent the attempt from other countries and Kim has threatened to do just this while practicing launching missiles in our direction for years.  He has also demonstrated a concern for his own allies to attempt it. (by removing his brother) </p>

<p>You can disagree with this analysis/narrative but it is not reasonable for to make his statement and claim truth without so much as addressing the way his argument would be responded to by the people he is claiming are wrong.</p>

I mean that Russia understands that nuclear war with us will cripple their own economy.. NKs economy is terrible already.. so therefore they aren’t reasonable or up for negotiation.. make sense ?

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. So when he launches the first nuke he can kiss his ass goodbye. I don&#39;t think you quite get the disparity of power between the US and Russia. US will be badly broken, but Russia will cease to fucking exist, now and forever, if they ever get into a direct conflict with the US. Russia has nukes as a deterrent and plays chickenshit games on the Internet and like women. Russia is weak, and Putin knows it. Why do you think he acts like such a macho man?</p>

<p>If you are only talking in a world where total nuclear war is the first and only option. </p>

<p>But in that world Russia can and will obliterate the person who nuked them.  </p>

<p>Retribution nukes would be used even if their owners country is totally gone.</p>

<p>Israel said they would do the same if they got invaded. </p>

<p>Russia has less cities so easier to take them all out. But it also has more empty space they could live in that won&#39;t be nuked. Siberia would probably come out ok but scarred more then continental USA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wasn&#39;t the topic of conversation though. You might as well say fish like water. So what? He asked why people are more concerned about NK using nukes than Russia. The answer is the perceived likelihood of their respective leaders actually using the weapon. By completely failing to address that point his argument has a major hole that invalidates the rest of it. If it is addressed then that would be a different argument.</p>
