        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This video received over 3 million views on Facebook:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPzJjNQaYEA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPzJjNQaYEA</a></p>

<p>The video shows how DMT can remind you that you ARE the force that birthed time-space. You are the Universe experiencing itself. The rest of Creation is waiting patiently for us to &quot;get our shit together&quot; and reach Universal Consciousness.</p>

<p>There is nothing to fear but fear itself. Humanity is shedding its egoic layers and remembering its connection to Nature and the Natural Laws that government all of life.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid. I understand the situation on Earth seems hopeless from a 3rd dimensional perspective. Expand your perspective. Your awareness can extend beyond 3-dimensionality. Just relax the monkey mind, let the higher perspective dawn on you, begin to release your own DMT through your own endocrine system.</p>

<p>There are many advanced souls here now, and still incarnating to help everyone through this embodiment process.</p>

<p>All the distractions, even many conspiracies, are geared to keep your awareness feeding 3-dimensional-based Consciousness programs, an unconscious and fear-based attempt to slow down the embodiment of 5th dimensional awareness. Don&#39;t even give them your attention.</p>

<p>You can discern those who have been &quot;programmed&quot; (victimized) with doubt pertaining to their own sovereignty, and those who are consciously slowing down the expansion due to their own greed and fear of Self. Help the ones who are subconsciously asking to be re-programmed into a higher awareness of our existence, ignore the ones who bicker, insult, and attempt to degrade/suppress the Truth that is unavoidable. &quot;We&quot; are One Being experiencing itself through different avatars and &quot;We&quot; are remembering this at an incredible rate.</p>

<p>Empathy is now taking the stage, competition and greed are being wiped away. Those aligned with greed and self-obsession are feeling the pressure and are attempting to derail and confuse the momentum of enlightened/compassionate Consciousness being embodied on this planet.</p>

<p>Ignore them. They will understand The Way sooner or later. After enough people demonstrate the joy of existing in a higher light, it will be the new focus of our Collective. It already is. The &quot;Hundredth Monkey&quot; has been attained.</p>

<p>You either learn to enjoy the Ride or get dragged into heaven kicking and screaming (I&#39;ve been there, just let go, you&#39;re much better off being &quot;nothing&quot; mentally than a made up character that is sustained through unceasing thought: The ego)</p>

<p>Surrender your ego. It gets easier. Just breathe and let all thoughts pass through you. You are not your thoughts. You are the force that beats your heart.</p>

<p>You are the &quot;One&quot;, We are the &quot;One&quot;</p>

<p>If this is too much for you give it time before you react with monkey thoughts rooted in fear.</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot solve problems on the level they were created&quot; - Albert Einstein.</p>

<p>Seems like humanity is faced with evolution or extinction. My sentience has chosen evolution. Which timeline will you choose?</p>

<p>Love you all no matter what you choose. We all meet up eventually anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After a certain point, these words are meaningless. They come from a place of insecurity and lack, so why not just transcend the insecurity and lack-based perspectives that even ask such questions? Why keep pandering to the fear within by answering its questions? Just drop it and choose joyful Beingness. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll get sick of your own mind swirl soon enough. As I am with my own. The Heart takes over soon enough. The Heart knows without questions or words. The Heart just Is Itself. God incarnate. Christ Consciousness. The Avatar State.</p>

<p>When the Soul retakes command over its body and mind.</p>

<p>So yeah you&#39;re correct. the only thing &quot;i&quot; decide is to surrender my faculties to the higher consciousness that beats the Heart. Or when people say &quot;Let Jesus take the wheel&quot; . Christ (Crystalline) Consciousness resumes control over its creation. </p>

<p>Its all a word game until Bliss dawns and dominates the Ego. </p>

<p>Thanks for humbling my shindig and reminding &quot;me&quot; that I am only adding words and concepts to an already-perfect creation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmmm</p>

<p>I wish I could recall a good quote that sums up what I believe about this kind of hardcore (and I&#39;m pretty sure heretical to Christian thinking but you&#39;d have to ask a Christian for that) Monism but can&#39;t right now</p>

<p>what I can say is that - unsurprisingly - the Greeks went down these paths long ago. The idea or principle of Methexis explains how a particular being can participate in the form of Being (or the supreme Being to put it another way) with no loss of its own identity.</p>

<p>Drop the religion and watch it unfold in front of your eyes. Jesus never said &quot; Follow a religion and worship books&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no fear or shame on my end. You’re not allowed because you’re claiming to be God, no one is God. That’s what the devil did to get cast down. You’re literally being deceived by the devil for thinking that way. Which in your eyes means you’re deceiving yourself. We were made in the Lords image. That doesn’t mean we know everything. I believe in a Holy War, might be in my lifetime might not. It’s God’s Plan not mine. In my opinion the Lord is taking to long, but the devil wouldn’t say that. If everyone on earth thought they were God that would be the end of Life. It would be cool if I could walk on water or change it to wine but I can’t no one can. You have to perceive the signs as they are put in front of you. Just be careful.   </p>

<p>I think I am just trying to explain my newfound level of Self-worthiness and had to cut through all the shame/self doubt/fear/shameful programming ect. </p>

<p>But yeah what you&#39;re saying makes sense. I like the Native American proverb:</p>

<pre><code>An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. “A fight is going on inside me,” he said to the boy.

“It is a terrible fight and it is between two wolves. One is evil – he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.” He continued, “The other is good – he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you – and inside every other person, too.”

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, “Which wolf will win?”

The old Cherokee simply replied, “The one you feed.”

<p>Boom. A life lived based on fear. You know there&#39;s a way to grow into this in a joyful, expanding way right? You may have been opened up too soon which &quot;shook&quot; your personality-self.</p>

<p>To each their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no fear or shame on my end. You’re not allowed because you’re claiming to be God, no one is God. That’s what the devil did to get cast down. You’re literally being deceived by the devil for thinking that way. Which in your eyes means you’re deceiving yourself. We were made in the Lords image. That doesn’t mean we know everything. I believe in a Holy War, might be in my lifetime might not. It’s God’s Plan not mine. In my opinion the Lord is taking to long, but the devil wouldn’t say that. If everyone on earth thought they were God that would be the end of Life. It would be cool if I could walk on water or change it to wine but I can’t no one can. You have to perceive the signs as they are put in front of you. Just be careful.   </p>
