       First, Assad was not responsible for the chemical attack. He had already essentially beaten ISIS, with one town left to go, and the US said they were pulling out of Syria. Him using chemicals now makes absolutely no strategic sense. Quite the exact opposite. It would literally be the dumbest thing he could possibly do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, Russia is saying they have evidence which proves it was not Assad. I'm going to take a guess that some top military brass in the US likely made a phone call and asked about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what are these strikes? I think they might be two fold. One, they're taking out chem plants and likely high profile targets. Look wherte they're striking. It isn't Assad. And two, they've flushed out ISIS, who are likely being slaughtered by Russian forces right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Trump did tweet "Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And right after that, he tweeted "Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?"
      </p>
      <p>
       So was Trump REALLY threatening a war? If he was, why did he literally say right after that he wanted to stop the arms race and help with the economy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing: no missiles have been shot down by Russian forces. There haven't been any reports of attempts made either. The Russian airforce was deployed, but no reports of conflict between them and US forces. Likely they're just roasting ISIS. And maybe, just maybe, they're actually working WITH the US forces. Maybe this strike is about taking out the bad actors who were ACTUALLY responsible for the chemical attack. And maybe it's about removing all possibility for any future chemical attacks. That way, Assad could take his nation back, and the US could pull out of Syria like it said it was already intending on doing, and we wouldn't have any further "chemical attacks" being made and being blamed on Assad (if you'll remember also happened a year ago almost to the day).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now sleep tight, don't worry about World War 3, because this is most likely an effort to ensure Assad can wipeout the rebels and not be blamed for "chemical attacks" any more. Which will be good for Assad, the US, AND for Russia.

       , and great post! People are getting so worked up about this shit, and only seeing black and white. This sub used to take a step back and think about this shit. Now? Nope... it's either black and white. I swear, people get a major dopamine rush from this shit. Either that, or it's mass schizophrenia and/or bi-polarism.

       Partisanship broke this sub. Watched it happen. Most of it isn't even organic. Pretty obvious too. I just wish more people would take a step back and try to determine what they are seeing, instead of letting themselves be told what they are seeing. I'm not a Trump supporter, nor a Trump hater. I don't even vote. I just look as closely as I can to what's happening around me, and try to figure things out.

       Off topic though, do you think that Putin ACTUALLY likes cats? I've never seen him with one before. I think the real conspiracy here is you claiming that he has a feline fascination. ;)

       The strike is a repeat of the strike last year, except with more missiles.  It is purely demonstrative and has no strategy behind it. It seems to be only used to show Russia that the US can bomb when it pleases and when it pleases, and it can't be stopped.   This is of course based on pride and arrogance, and I think Russians and Syrians will simply continue doing, what they were doing before. Undermine US efforts to overthrow the government by proxy forces.

       Can't be stopped? Perhaps they can't be stopped trying, since out of 100 missles less than 10 reached targets, others were shot down by syrian air defense, which is tbh, not nearly as good as russians.
