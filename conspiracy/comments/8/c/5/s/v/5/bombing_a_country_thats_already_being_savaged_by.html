    <div class="md"><p>Why would a Syrian want to seek shelter in the US?  Leave your family and your home and come across the ocean to the US for shelter?  Did the US prevent them from seeking shelter elsewhere?  Nope.  This airstrike is a win for all the anti-Trumps, but to put further malicious intent than is already there is just needy.     </p>

<p>And no one, not a single person really gives a damn about Stormy Daniels. People want to hear about it, but no one really thinks it matters in the grand scheme of things. The people who keep bringing it up are envious that Trump laid a porn star or they just really want to see Melania divorce him so they can celebrate Barron&#39;s life being screwed over to make themselves feel better about their failures.  It&#39;s pathetic.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is really good propaganda.  First of all, it over looks the fact that Syria&#39;s main problem hasn&#39;t been Assad, but the fake civil war the US has been fueling since 2012.  Our foreign policy is what has caused the syrian refugee crisis.  They US doesn&#39;t give a shit about people, they are literally helping Saudi Arabia commit genicide in Yemen, have turned a blind eye to not only the way Saudi Arabia treats their own people, but their involvement in 9/11.... The US supports disctators all over the world who commit horrible crimes against humanity, and we turn a blind eye.  This whole thing is joke, but the part that pisses me off most is when they plaster dead children all over the news to pull at the heart strings of the American people, while at the same time bombing a school and killing 50 or 100 children, and it barely get&#39;s a mention in the news.  Fuck this shit... Pisses me off.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t.   It was savaged by Barack Obama&#39;s &quot;moderate rebels.&quot;  What business did the United States have attempting to topple the sovereign government of a foreign nation?</p>

<p>Oh, that&#39;s right.   You watched, &quot;The White Helmets,&quot; and got all emotional, so it&#39;s totally ok.  Right?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People like yourself really need to learn what a refugee is and is not.  When a person leaves their home country due to war and they settle in the <strong>nearest</strong> peaceful country, then they are &quot;refugees.&quot; </p>

<p>When they fail to stop and settle in the nearest nation, but rather choose to trek, sail or fly many nations away in &quot;search of a better life,&quot; they are no longer &quot;refugees,&quot; but rather &quot;migrants.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done nothing of the sort, but to be fair this is not an issue over a &quot;cunt hair&quot; of difference.  Quick question though, which chapter of &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People,&quot; can I find reference to employing needless vulgarities?</p>

<p>The irony here is that I&#39;m thinking the very same way of you.</p>
