       As I read the titles of the news just now, I died inside a little. I won't lie, it hit me right in the heart. They wanted their war and now they have it. The coordinated efforts and nodding heads on all sides make this whole ordeal even worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are in Syria. Real people. People like you and me. Those people are in the middle of this war. They will be killed, tortured, their towns bombed, their country ravaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look at the thread on r/worldnews. I see people making jokes, others nod their heads in agreement. Assad had it coming, right? We need to avenge the children being gassed, right? It's all fair and just, the US and its European allies are doing it in the name of the people, of the Syrians, in the name of freedom......right? And those that disagree are Russian trolls, bots from the Kremlin, Assad's lackeys, child murderers and rapists.
      </p>
      <p>
       One commenters says: "Do people here actually believe the reason for the strike is because of moral outrage and wanting to protect the poor civilians? Get real." another replies, seemingly completely unironically: "What is it for then?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone now, anyone that has looked, truly looked at what's going on, anyone that hasn't been born yesterday, isn't here to push an agenda, troll or provoke and has been witness to the US and their allies' conflicts for the past decades - does any one of those still believe that the US and its allies are doing this in order to save the children? I am genuinely curious - does anyone truly unironically believe that this war is being fucking fought to protect the fucking children from Assad's fucking chemical weapons?!
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had enough of this shit. Truly, I've had enough. For some reason, for some reason totally beyond me, I thought this wasn't going to happen - not yet at least. But here we are, at the brink of a new major conflict, yet again.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can we do? What can you do? Why don't we ask ourselves these questions? It's not like we are helpless, it's not like YOU are helpless. If you live in a country that is in this war, you can protest, you can speak out in any way you know how to, you can call your congressman, your representative, you can make your voice heard. Now is not the time to be silent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we going to just mind our own business and let this shit keep going on? Are we going to just keep looking the fucking other way as the entirety of the Middle East gets bombed to kingdom come? When is it going to dawn on people that this is not going to stop with Syria? Do you realize that Iran is likely next? Do you realize what massive casualties a war with Iran would entail? How many trillions more would be spent on those wars? Do you realize that everyone would be affected by extreme fluctuations of oil prices as a result of that war, which could destabilize the economy in its totality?
      </p>
      <p>
       But ultimately, ultimately - do you really think it will stop with Iran? Do you really think that, if we don't cry out for peace, if we don't make our lives a symbol, an example of peace and empathy and if we don't demand peace on a global scale - do you really think that you, wherever you are, will be safe from the consequences of more and more conflicts? Conflicts with Russia? With China? With anyone labelled an enemy of "freedom"?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not every man for himself anymore. That time has passed if we want to survive as a species. It's time humanity stood its ground and it's time we stand our grand together, not separately anymore. It's time for this shit to stop. People will say it's complicated. No it's not. There is no complication in this. The US and its allies are not the world's police force, they are not here to judge how countries should be governed. If that is the case, shouldn't the US be bombing North Korea first? Shouldn't they be bombing Saudi Arabia for the genocide in Yemen, instead of actually SELLING THEM FUCKING WEAPONS?
      </p>
      <p>
       I want peace. Not only for the world, for myself as well. For me and the world are not separate. I pledge that I will make deeper and deeper peace in my own life, with those I interact with and those closest to me. That I will move towards deeper peace with all those that I encounter in my life. I will move to become a beacon, an example of this peace, this empathy. I ask you, all of you to do the same. Become peace in your own life and in your interactions with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as you do so, do not forget about the world. If we cry out for peace, if we demand peace, if we CHOOSE peace, things will change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divided we are weak, yet united we are strong. If we cry out for peace in one voice that voice will be stronger than anything else. That voice can win and change the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you all well in this time of insanity and may you all hug those you love the most today and tell them you love them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are in any way spiritually inclined, pray for the Syrians, pray for the world. At this point, no positive energy is wasted. If that prayer moves you towards any action that may seem of help, so much the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love you all.

       Yeah I guess the tables have turned a bit now too. Our enemies also have big boomies and have spent decades of testing them since that whole Japan ordeal.

       Well.. I guess we are portrayed as being democratic via our media and unaltered totally legitimate and trustworthy 2 party voting/polling systems and super reliable and honest politicians. Freedom to speak privately amongst our peers etc. Just don't open your mouth in public please. It's not nice to speak against currently elected officials. That shit will just get you straight up assassinated.

       That's just justifying war crimes, it was really about showing Russia their big nuclear dicks. Both countries were in an arms race because they both got Nazi scientists from ww2. Everything I've seen talking about the state of japan later in the war says they were in shambles and that it would be nothing to move in and start annexing the country, but it was held off until the eggheads like Oppenheimer finished development of the atomic weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, what if Russia got better Nazis or developed nukes before the US then immediately used it on Mexico? The war would've been over with or without nuclear weapons, arguments about zealotry to the empire are cop-outs.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was a message heard around the world.

       The only thing missing is examples from the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       ""There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, 'Fool me once, shame on...shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again.'" – President George W Bush, Nashville, Tennessee; September 17, 2002
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a reminder that there are documented examples of false flags used as justification for military intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Lavon affair refers to a failed Israeli covert operation, code named Operation Susannah, conducted in Egypt in the Summer of 1954. As part of the false flag operation, a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American, and British-owned civilian targets, cinemas, libraries and American educational centers. The bombs were timed to detonate several hours after closing time. The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Communists, "unspecified malcontents" or "local nationalists" with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt's Suez Canal zone.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On 4 April 1953, the CIA was ordered to undermine the government of Iran over a four-month period, as a precursor to overthrowing Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. One tactic used to undermine Mosaddegh was to carry out false flag attacks "on mosques and key public figures", to be blamed on Iranian communists loyal to the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CIA project was code-named TP-Ajax, and the tactic of a "directed campaign of bombings by Iranians posing as members of the Communist party", involved the bombing of "at least one" well known Muslim's house by CIA agents posing as Communists. The CIA determined that the tactic of false flag attacks added to the "positive outcome" of Project TPAJAX.
       </p>

       This one wasn't carried out, but it's pretty interesting:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the early 1960s, America's top military leaders reportedly drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities to create public support for a war against Cuba.
       </p>
       <p>
        Code named Operation Northwoods, the plans reportedly included the possible assassination of Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees on the high seas, hijacking planes, blowing up a U.S. ship, and even orchestrating violent terrorism in U.S. cities. The plans were developed as ways to trick the American public and the international community into supporting a war to oust Cuba's then new leader, communist Fidel Castro.
       </p>

      <p>
       Also planned, but not carried out, on the topic of Syria:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nearly 50 years before the war in Iraq, Britain and America sought a secretive "regime change" in another Arab country they accused of spreading terror and threatening the west's oil supplies, by planning the invasion of Syria and the assassination of leading figures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Newly discovered documents show how in 1957 Harold Macmillan and President Dwight Eisenhower approved a CIA-MI6 plan to stage fake border incidents as an excuse for an invasion by Syria's pro-western neighbours, and then to "eliminate" the most influential triumvirate in Damascus.

       USS Maine, Gulf of Tonkin, 9/11 and many more as well, and that's not even getting into non US ones like the Reichstag fire used by Hitler to suspend civil liberties and propel Germany towards WWII.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your write up of Operation Northwoods sort of brushes on it, but the part of the plan dealing with hijacked planes was the playbook they ended up using ~40 years later, on 9/11.

       Are you actually trying to say that the MSM

       Have you never watched the MSM pump up the call for war?  Do you not remember (or weren’t alive) when the MSM mercilessly pushes us into the war in Iraq because of WMDs that didn’t exist?  This isn’t even a conspiracy man, this is how corporate owned media aligned with its warmongering government counterparts pushes their agenda that almost always ends in wars.

       Same thing with terrorism and this new russiaphobia. You hear nothing about either then over night at one point that’s all they start talking about. You can see it all over reddit people have been brainwashed this way to hate Russia with no proof or reason. Its almost terrifying to see it happen in real time watching people slide into manufactured hate and fear.

       Trump has no conscience and could be controlled. Bernie was another jfk that wouldn’t toe their line I feel. Either way the president was never going to change anything. Tbtp must be forcfully stopped by the people.

       Completely agree.  I don’t believe that TPTB have enough juice to stop Bernie from winning in 2020, they might kill him, but if they do, they will lose everything.

       You cry and cry that everybody is against you but given the chance you stab people in the back. Your entire culture is two-faced, where I'm from that's unacceptable. men are supposed to act with honor and speak with truth. I mean, have some dignity.

       I don't have any problems with Judaism as a religion in and of itself, besides the bloody baby cock-sucking, that shit ain't right. But it's controlled from the inside by a group of evil individuals that will stop at nothing to commit genocide and call it "self defense".
      </p>
      <p>
       They've been nomads historically since the beginning of time, everything they ever had they had to take. Now, farmers working a field to feed their family only to have it mowed down by a pack of wanderers aren't going to like that. But you don't understand, you think yourself to be above others just because an old book justifying this gives you the "warm and fuzzies". If you stopped pretending to be better than everyone for a minute, they might not hate you.

       Who the hell really knows what's going on. We apparently have soldiers in Niger. And black ops in dozens of countries. How many of those are on clandestine missions for the CIA, how many are PMC running illegal operations for drug cartels that lobby to US politicians, etc. According to some, we've been battling Russia in the Arctic Circle for a couple years now.

       If no war evolves from this, I concede I am wrong in my prognosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The war like rhetoric, the appointment of war criminal John Bolton, the incredible itch the US and its allies seem to have for more conflict, including the insane amount of pro-conflict propaganda,...all point to the very real possibility this will be more than a one off strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also be that they are testing the ground to see the public's response to the initial strike - and if nobody protests, if people agree with this, further strikes and attacks will be pushed.

       Bro they didn’t do it for fun. If it doesn’t work they will do another strike. And another. The goal is the continuation of the war. These strikes are to tip the scale in the terrorist favour so they can beat Assad.

       This post at least makes me feel better knowing others think as i do and aren’t lunatics. My entire life its been non stop murder and genocide from America the UK , Israel and their allies, it legit tears me up inside see how many people act like other people in other countries that are less advantaged than them are treated as though they do not have value and don’t deserve to live .... because the MSM told them so. The majority of the Western world has lost their fucking minds and are the worst terrorist there are on this planet today.

       Accepting refugees while creating more refugees is not a sustainable solution. Add false flag terrorist attacks to a multicultural society and all rights will be taken away for the sake of protection. If they care about the Syrians  or people in the middle east, they would either withdraw entirely from the middle east or use their power and wealth to build schools and hospitals not just drop bombs that just kill people and not do anything.

       Obama arguably had authorization under the AUMF. Syrian government forces are in no way arguably covered under such authorization. Obama stopped short of what he wanted because he acknowledged his lack of congressional authorization. Trump didn't seek any authorization because he is thinks he supreme authority, and his base loves it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump had already killed more people with drones in one years than Obama did in 8.

       It’s not war. Putin just has to save face now so there will be a Russian response on  pre determined and agreed targets (like the allied strike was) and will do as much damage as the allied attack, ie some empty warehouses, Where the only gas emissions are from a flatulent mouse.

       I find that believing in
       <em>
        peace
       </em>
       is one of the toughest and yet most resilient positions to be in. it is a stance I was asked to take as child, and I still believe in peace today.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is not human nature to be so cruel and greedy as this evil force (wherever it has come from) has led us to believe. people lived together in peace long ago, it's not an impossibility, but it gets closer to becoming one as people submit to such ideas -- that humans are violent by nature, self-interested to the point of self destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate posts like this when I see them because they remind me I am not alone in seeing the possibility of a better world, shaped through effort and solidarity. thank you.

       When you say people lived together in peace long ago, what are you referencing? From what I have read and seen I believe we are in the most peaceful world that has been. Of course dropping bombs on civilians is far from peaceful but there has been much worse done even in recent history.

Human Rights Watch has collated and analyzed evidence of chemical weapons attacks in Syria between August 21, 2013, the day of the deadliest chemical weapon attack in Syria to date, and February 25, 2018, when the Syrian government used chlorine in the besieged enclave of Eastern Ghouta.
       </p>
       <p>
        The information, based on data from seven sources, shows that the

         Syrian government is responsible for the majority of 85 confirmed chemical weapon attacks.
        </a>
        The data also show that the Syrian government has been largely undeterred by the efforts of the United Nations Security Council, the international Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), and unilateral action by individual countries to enforce the prohibition on Syria’s use of chemical weapons.

       Do you only get the "feels" when the big bad USA, UK and France team up for limited strikes on chemical weapon manufacturing? Maybe you have been tore up since the 2013 attack on Khan Sheikhoun? I highly doubt it

       The Syrian government was found not guilty of that attack. The question to be asked is, why are you proliferating known lies

       Same guy. 9/11 ultimately brought me to Reddit to share what I had learned with a wider audience. Makes me happy to hear it was not in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump slamming and threatening Jeb over 9/11 earned him my immediate support. I do not have a problem with taking out chemical weapons facilities and wiping ISIS off the map. Overthrowing a democratically elected Assad was never Trumps goal and not something I would ever support. I wish he would take out Israel and North Korean chemical weapon facilities but I am not holding my breath on those.
      </p>
      <p>
       My support is not blind. For example, I hoped his talk about bringing back torture was just inexperience and it seems it was. I detest torture and this sub I created proves it. r/AbuGhraib

       Saddam was a bloodthirsty psychopath who would not hesitate to use  whatever he deemed necessary to maintain power in Iraq.  This included, but was not limited to, chemical weapons, death squads, rape, torture and all kind of fucked up shit his demented mind could dream up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gaddafi was a terrorist supporter who was behind the Lockarbie bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.  All 243 passengers were killed in the explosion along with 11 people on the ground who were hit by the aircraft debris.

       Yeah... Obviously it was MK-Ultra mind control that made him take the actions he did.  No free will whatsoever on Saddam or Uday's part.  The rapes, the murders, the chemical weapons and campaign of terror he waged on his own country...   All of it simply the result of American Imperialism.  It would have happened no matter who was running Iraq, right?

       Kingdom Come was a great game. Sorry I saw that and it was all I could think of. I agree with you, we need to stop or we will drive ourselves to extinction. We need to work together on issues that matter like world hunger, disease, mental and physical disabilities, etc. Or the wide variety of threats the earth faces like climate change, astroid impacts, the magnetic field pole flip (which we are overdue for. It is also very interesting I recommend researching it), a super volcano eruption (which we are overdue for), a solar flare storm (I can’t remember if we are also overdue for one), etc. We already have specific organizations working on some of these issues but imagine what we could accomplish if we all worked together. What happens if we do end up facing a worldwide epidemic or (it might seem far fetched to you) but an extraterrestrial threat? We can’t be fighting each other while we all get killed. We are also much easier to control in groups fighting each other. That’s why certain “higher up” people push the ideas of racism, sexism, political parties, geographical hatred, etc. Its true, there is strength in numbers. Enough with this constant conflict, do we really want to rebuild society again? If we even get the chance. No one wants war except for the people who don’t have to participate and/or profit off of it; i.e the bank. Did you know they are known to fund both sides of wars? They don’t care about anyone, they only care about money. I’m not particularly religious but my thoughts and sympathies go out to Syrians. Let’s hope this can be stopped.

       The people in power remain in power regardless of who is elected to office. Those elected to office seem to have no ability to remove these deep state individuals from power. Until the American people learn that their elected officials are powerless, and identify the deep state NeoCons pulling the strings (and executing them for treason) these kind of things will continue.

       All I wanted was one, single scrap of evidence proving that Assad actually did it. But we were never given it. We’re just supposed to go along with whatever the West tells us.
      </p>
      <p>
       To question the West is now considered paranoid and stupid. To be considered sane in our society now, you are supposed to believe whatever conspiracy theories the West invents, and never ask any questions. Even if they use those theories to justify war.

       Not only is there no evidence that Assad did it, all signs indicate he didn't do it. And we've already been through this twice before with Syria.

       Because chemical weapons usually require containment facilities for preparation and delivery. These facilities require electrical power, and people with degrees in chemistry related fields to manage them.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it isn't impossible for a terrorist group to have these resources, the chance of them being exposed to the chemical before deploying it or deploying it incorrectly are both quite high.

      <p>
       Thankyou for being reasonable. If I may expand on what you are saying in reference to ISIS
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between an oil refinery and a facility for the production and storage of chemical weapons is quite large. One of the reasons is that ISIS would be able to recognise oil facility buildings at a distance and avoid causing great amounts of damage (with the aim of taking over)
      </p>
      <p>
       Facilities containing nerve agents would usually have most of their facility underground, so it would be quite easy to bomb the initial building to rubble, and not even discover its true purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that the issue is even if they could get access to a sarin nerve agent (what the UN has identified was used in the past in Syria) it is one of the most volatile nerve agents around. This means it transforms from a liquid to a gaseous state very very easily. Without someone with a degree in chemistry with a focus on containment and control of nerve agents (and people like that are both rare, and very employable internationally, so they don't tend to stick around when a country descends into civil war) the chances of them
      </p>
      <p>
       A removing it from containment in a secure facility  - lets call it 80%
B transporting it to a staging area in a ongoing warzone - lets call that 60 %
C transferring the agent from its initial storage container to a delivery method - lets call that 50/50 
D The delivery method being effective at both keeping the sarin pre-delivery - this is where things get very dicey, since unless they have a tool designed for chemical delivery, exposure and a chemical leak could be very very likely - so lets say 25%
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue here is not just how unlikely they could pull something like this off successfully, but also the risk reward involved for the terrorists. One leak and some of ISIS best engineers and scientists are dead, along with hundreds of soldiers in the staging area. All for a single attack that kills not much more then five or ten suicide bombings or IEDS could achieve in the same time frame, with a much lower risk threshold.

       First step in applying Occam's razor is to consider how many assumptions must be made for each competing answer.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Assad did it: must assume they did this nonsensically while winning and thus idiotically courting response, must assume they retained access to facilities, must assume retained access to qualified personnel, must assume some undisclosed advantage/reasoning behind the act
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         terrorists did it: must assume access to facilities, must assume access to qualified personnel
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         US did it: must assume wanted conflict
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       That's me applying the razor. How did yours go?

       That doesn’t prove in any way that Assad was behind the alleged attack. A state sponsor such as Israel or Saudi Arabia could have supplied the personal and logistics for the attack, motivated to keep the US in the region doing their dirty deeds.

       Is a plant that produces chlorine considered a chemical weapons plant?   I mean there are a lot of other uses for chlorine, so it seems like a tricky definition what would move a regular chemical facility into the realm of weapons facility I wonder.

       ISIS is a buzzword. Let's just say 'Islamic fundamentalists'. Assad is a moderate that has kept the militants under control, until the US started arming them. Same with Saddam Hussein and Muammar Qaddafi. Israhell wants Syria totally subdued, as they believe they have a right to the region.

       Let's have you do some work to justify your position that others didn't do it for you.

      <p>
       What kind of evidence
       <em>
        that you could reasonably be expected to see
       </em>
       would you accept? Give me a scenario. Because if you can't think that up, you aren't looking for truth but just wanting to believe what you want to believe.

       This is like asking someone to explain why they are skeptical of a liar that has fabricated evidence countless times to fulfill their motives. The West has blatantly fabricated evidence countless times to justify removing someone they don't like from power. This is basic US history. Why do I need to explain something so basic to you?

       Now you are moving the goal posts. First, you said you wanted an investigation, presumably one that could be expected to satisfy you. But now you reveal the truth, which is that there is no investigation that can satisfy you. Why not say that instead? Its far more honest.

       There was an attack already, without an investigation. How credible would an investigation be at this point when we have had a conflict of interest established already? Or do you not understand the concept of conflicting interests? When someone establishes the fact that they want to do something at any cost, they cannot be trusted at all.

       How do you know there was no investigation? How do you know the sources and methods? You don't. The truth is that there is nothing you could reasonably expect to read, see or here that you would believe, because you don't believe anyone in a position to provide it to you, even if they did. That's the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't like is when people dress up their skepticism as a lack of evidence. They just won't believe it. So just be honest and say that. Don't play this bullshit evidence game. Be honest.

       You don't understand the concept of conflicting interests at all. What do you propose we do with someone caught fabricating evidence in the past, who is in such a rush to fulfill their motive that they go ahead with it and tell you to just take their word on it? Are you dense?

       <li>

        Ignore the fact that his accusation doesn't even have any logical basis to it (Assad would never gas innocent civilians in a war he is winning right after the US announced they were leaving)

       Nah, you just aren't being honest. Its fine to distrust the government and doubt everything the governments that bombed say. I'm not criticizing that. I'm criticizing the dog and pony show of being unsatisfied with a lack of evidence, when there is no one in a position to provide it that you would believe. And we've gone back and forth a lot and you've presented no scenario that suggests you will. Nothing. Be honest. Stop with the bullshit.

       Yeah I agree, from what I've seen the evidence seems to be that it wasn't Assad, but the US wanted a reason to go to war so that's exactly what they got...and who cares if that reason is real or not right? They only start the wars, they don't have to fight in them.

       How should the evidence come? Honest question here. It will always come in the form of news media. Images. Quotes. Interviews.  Various other forms of proof.  Through the same vehicle we know lies to us.

      <p>
       So either it’s all fake or it’s sometimes true but we always never really know.  They like it that way.

       What form would you consider good enough to make you believe? I’m curious. I wish sometimes I could play doubting Thomas and stick my fingers into the metaphorical “wound” and prove it with my own eyes. But that’s impossible.

       I feel like the biggest unanswered question is, "why would Assad do this once he has taken a position to win the war against the rebels?" Because he's an evil man? Come on. It seriously makes no sense that he would now pick this point in time to gas his own people. This is only going to hurt him within his own country and region, even if the West turned it's head and did nothing about it. I feel like in this day and age of news media and fake and truth being thrown around so much, we need to analyze what were given, think on it for a day or so, and then go with our gut feeling on the topic. It's hard to deciefer real from fake now. The powers that be realized we started waking up and doing our own research,, so now they're using the scatter information and disinformation tactic. Confuse the masses with a larger amount of propaganda.

       I think the question of how he could gas his own people is deeper than “clearly not because they’re his own people.” I think that there exists a very real vein of “eye for an eye” punishments in that nature and portion of the world, from a historical and cultural standpoint and the idea that he could punish his own people for allowing any dissection - is not so far fetched as to have never been done before.

       I didn’t say that wasn’t a good idea.  But I asked more to the point - what would make you feel you were fed the truth.  Maybe they DID stay more than two days. You just got told a lie.  Maybe they stayed two and got all they needed; they are inspectors / scientists after all.  My point is meta, nothing to do with real black and white facts.

       This is a good question, and ultimately very hard to answer. But I think for everyone there is a point at which where they accept something as being the truth. For me, that means a full, convincing explanation of why they think Assad did it, and the methodology behind how they came to the conclusion. A fully detailed explanation usually takes a very complex web of lies to fake, a web of lies that will mostly likely have flaws, and therefore quickly falls apart.

       I don’t disagree but I have to add in terms of disaster, I think often the simplest is the probably truth and we, as plebs, really “crave” the entertainment value a web of lies brings with it - we have decades of purpose built tv shows to make us think that it’s
       <em>
        got

       to be an issue when it might really not be.

       This is a good point. I think Pulse and Sandy Hook are different though. Both of them are actually quite simple situations, so any logical person will lean towards the simplest explanations. These kinds of things have happened all over the world and are always pretty similar: someone becomes pent up with extreme amounts of rage which is due to deep seated psychological issues, but which they justify with an ideology or some kind of narrative, and then they snap and plan a mass murder. There are so many precedents that all point to the same thing.

       Anything happening in Syria right now is usually very complicated. This gas attack is especially complex. So many different groups could have done it, and working out who did it is incredibly difficult. The reasons for why different groups could have done it are numerous and varied, as are the reasons for why they wouldn't have done it. Even then, the recent history is murky and told differently by people with different agendas. No matter which angle you take, there must be a web of complexities involved in your explanation.

       I think what makes the Syria stuff so “dense” is that it’s got so much muddled history that one can “cherry pick” the nuggets of detail that can make one actor look worse than the other, and visa versa.  What really hurts though is that there are families in war torn areas that are just going about their days trying to work, clean house, get laid, and there exists bullshit nobody can live in peace.  It doesn’t really matter who is the baddest bad guy, in this picture, imho.

       Absolutely. I've met a few Syrian refugees and each one I met was extremely friendly, but also filled with sadness. They all have awful stories to tell. It was pretty heartbreaking, especially meeting kids who have seen things that I can't even imagine. Every Syrian I met just wanted their country to be peaceful again.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sickens me that there are clearly a number of very powerful forces pushing the conflict, forces that obviously don't give a fuck about the people caught up in-between. Ordinary people buckle under the rumble of the war drums, with nowhere to turn to and nothing to protect them. There are very few precedents that would seem to inform a belief that the West is interested in the Syrian people's safety. I can't help feeling that the plight of the Syrian people is just collateral in a proxy struggle between various world powers.

       I've just watched a Q&amp;A on BBC News 24 of a US Military General and a White House rep. A question was asked about why they did not wait for a currently on going investigation into whether Assad actually was behind the chemical weapons and whether there is actually any chemical weapons in relation to this report at all anyway. They both said they believed the reports - completely disregarding the lack of official evidence of the attack - and quickly moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later in the Q&amp;A, the White House rep made a statement about the US/UK/France missile launch being aimed at a "known" chemical weapons plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, first there's an incomplete investigation, then you're bombing a "known" chemical plant?!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is rhetoric politics being used to cover up a provocative attack on a regime that has only ever been reported as attacking Israel, and yet all we see is Syria retaliating on Israel after their cease fire is broken, BY ISRAEL!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is some deep seated Bullshit game of Risk, where Israel is somehow pulling every string, apart from Russia's. Now, whether Russia has it's only seedy plan for Syria is a different story. But every element of this now very real global conflict is fucking fishy.

       And that's the saddest thing. As a Middle Eastern who still hasn't had their country bombed, I always wonder when we're going to be next. I don't want to die now. I still haven't done anything worthwhile in my life. I just want to have a happy life. To wake up early every day to water my plants. To fall in love and have an adorable family. I don't want that taken away from me. We're just normal people who have dreams like yours. It's depressing how people can be brainwashed into thinking otherwise.

       A book called Enemy Combatant, by Mozzam Begg really made me think about the conflicts in the Middle East from the other perspective. He was detained for 3 years in bagram and Guantanamo. 
What’s fucking crazy is that I know for a fact that many people do not even think about middle easterners as human beings with intricate lives, having hopes, dreams, feelings, and fears just like the rest of us. A lack of experience and empathy coupled with a blind trust of those in power is dangerous.

       Another mind blowing thing is that they're still thing to bother with a team to "verify" it was Assad behind the chemical weapons, as though they could find any other results now that these three countries have decided that he's behind it.

       I will say in defense of the simpleton who asks "What is for then?" that it is really difficult to understand what the war is for. Pipelines? Israel? Anti-Russia proxy war? US control of the ME? Dole for the defense industry?

       Israel wants Syria destabilized and weak. This much is easily understood.

       "puts on my tin foil hat"I think it may have to do with,I believe it was Qatar and the Saudis wanting to run a gas pipeline thru syria to compete better in europe and cut out russia, but since assad and putin are pals, he told them to fuck off. Hillary gets loads of money from both on what was likely pitched as a can't lose presidential race and "shockingly" pushes for heavy military intervention in Syria to get assad out and someone who will make a deal in. That fails and Trump seems to not want to get involved so plan B emerges to make all these "atrocities" happen that pulls at the heartstrings of every red blooded amercian to get public pressure for the war.

       This country was taken over by a group of people with a policy coup, Wolfowitz and Cheney and Rumsfeld and you could name a half dozen other collaborators from the Project for a New American Century. They wanted at us to destabilize the Middle East, turn it upside down, make it under our control. It went back to those comments in 1991. Now did anybody tell you that? Was there a national dialogue on this? Did senators and congressman stand up and denounce this plan? Was there a full fledged American debate on it? Absolutely not; and there are still isn’t, and that’s why we are failing in Iraq, because Iran and Syria know about the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do is read the the Weekly Standard and Bill Kristol and he blabber mouthed it out all over the world…. They could hardly wait to finish Iraq, so they could move in to Syria. It was like a lay down, oh our legions are going to go in there. This wasn’t what the American people voted George Bush in to office, well they didn’t actually vote him to office, but it wasn’t… what he campaigned on. He campaigned on a humble foreign policy, the most arrogant foreign policy in American history. He campaigned on no peace keeping, no nation building and here he is with Afghanistan and Iraqis; astonishing.

       Lol why young Asians? The US has always been a melting pot. People get caught up with the present news cycle &amp; the patriot act and it’s indefinite detention of immigrants, but we’ve had Asians here since we needed “legal slaves” to build our railroads. This was after the Civil War, you see. If you want more immigration history go read a book.

       It is incredibly sick.

       I think right now we need to study and learn how the globalists pushed this civil war from day one in 2011.

      <p>
       Remember this all started because a few elites kids painted anti assad grafitti. I could see something like this happen in the future America.

       Let's be very, very clear: those people are in the middle of a war zone and have been for
       <strong>
        <em>
         years
        </em>
       </strong>
       . Many of them have already been killed, tortured, their towns bombed and their country ravaged.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        does any one of those still believe that the US and its allies are doing this in order to save the children?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think that that would be an absurdly reductionist view, so no. I believe that this is being done because the lack of a military response would have sent a clear signal to regimes around the world who are headed by madmen, held back from chemical weapon use only by the fear that it would bring international reprisals. Now, is it an effective deterrent? Maybe in part. The reality is that such madmen find plenty of conventional ways to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, ultimately, this isn't about projecting any kind of control over the region (which the invasion of Iraq clearly was, and I said exactly so at the time). This is a targeted and specific attack, as I think you will see over the coming days.

      <p>
       Well, if it's not, then I think opposing the use of chemical weapons is a pretty high priority. I would have desired a different, more nuanced approach, but when you tell someone that they are on  notice for their use of chemical weapons and then they go ahead and use them, either you respond in
       <em>
        some way
       </em>
       , or you lose all credibility.

       Not only is there no evidence that Assad did it, all signs indicate he didn't do it. And we've already been through this twice before with Syria.

       They shouldn't have chemical weapons in the first place. Even if this most recent chemical attack had nothing to do with Assad, hes used it multiple times before and we warned them not to do this during Obama's presidency. Too bad we looked like a bunch of pussies when they did use chemical weapons and we did nothing.

       Even if they weren't used by him, we're bombing the plants where they were made so they cannot be used again. If Assad has an issue with that, I think his stance on the use of chemical weapons will be clear.

       The first step is awareness and spreading truths and ideas. There can be no solution if nobody acknowledges there's a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in a way OP did offer something of a solution. Be peaceful, to yourself, and to others. It's cliche and it won't fix all the problems we have, but little things have the power to eventually change the world. Shit starts from the ground up. Start local, and it will spread.

       I mentioned a solution - speak out against the war, speak for peace, speak loud and don't be afraid to speak. Protest, gather, make your voices heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not live in the US or in a country that is involved in this conflict, if I were, trust me, I'd make my voice heard, no question about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even this, spreading awareness, talking about it here, has an impact. Every post that is for peace is a step in the right direction. Every voice, even online, means something. It shows people we all want peace, we are in this together, it sends ripples through anyone that may be following orders to give it a second thought, especially those in the military. It encourages debate and through debate, solutions are found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, find peace within and be an example of peace in your own community, family and life.
      </p>
      <p>
       May I ask, what are your proposed solutions?

       I would suggest you take a break from the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have an enormous superiority complex, and you write like a lit student.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your blog is a graveyard of inane spiritual expression drivel.
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't do anything, and you don't know anything. You've already admitted as much in previous comments, even setting up a cushion for an outcome in which you are completely incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're an ego-maniacal self imposed distraction to real life, and the response you are receiving here is only due to the forum you chose. Reddit is a backwards thinking group assuming they are fighting for progressive thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wasting just as much time responding to you as you did writing this pompous trash initially.
      </p>

       Pat yourself on the back, and wipe away your pointless tears as you sit there in self-approbation.

       and while we're at it, let's just speak plainly. there is no war. will there be one? most likely not, but there's always a chance. is there one now? no. the residents of the area have stated it was just a display, that they weren't phased at all, and that they slept through the 'bombing'.
      </p>
      <p>
       regardless of any war talk, you're not interested in what i say, you're just interested in being upset.
      </p>
      <p>
       peace and love to you and i hope you have a beautiful life a bloo bloo bloo

       I think your main issue here is that he said a lot of things that you feel are more sentimental than raitonal. But at the end of the day, boiling it down to what you would consider the rational parts of it, it has a point that you have severely missed in favour of mocking people for having emotions when thinking about the people who will end up dying in a continued war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh what pathetic people, having emotions regarding war, they should just be stoic and uncaring about these things, like you, right?

       i only ever criticised OP and his ridiculous monologue, coupled with the absurd response it has received.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no point to it. its an essay on a hypothetical presented as fact, consisting of nothing but faux heartfelt sentiments about non existent wars, and the typical carry on of a new world filled with peace and love without any suggestion of how to achieve it outside of 'let's just be nice to each other!'.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's empty! it's drivel! it's someone who thinks they are enlightened (if you haven't read his blog for the love god take a look at the man you are defending) and thinks they operate on a higher level than others, stroking their ego while an entire group of people agree, and for what reason? for peace, and love, and bleurgh.. it's pointless self approbation. it's just grotesque to see so many people say 'you're great' with the expected reply of 'you're great too' so you can all feel like you're on a higher plane.

       Poeple who support peace try to vote for people who will keep the peace. If they don't, then that's a fault with the system.

       In addition, having an opinion on the stance to convince others to join your pacifistic opinions is arguably the BEST thing you can do for the cause to perpetuate ideas. Second best is writing a letter to your local rep. But in this situation, fucking none of those would have helped, because it was a decision made by one man. So I ask again, what SHOULD we do?

       Yes they are. Ever heard of Mutual Aid theory? Humanity is only special BECAUSE of it's bonds and tribal nature, we are social creatures, which is fucking EXACTLY what makes us successful as a species, and moving closer towards that idea only makes us stronger. That's why we're living in a relatively peaceful period of time relative to all of human history, that's why the internet was invented to conect people across the goddamn globe.

       You consider him "grotesque" because he expresses sympathy and love for everyone. It's ironic. You are symbolic of humanities flaws, things we seek to remove.I recommend you reconsider your own midnset, not just to make yourself more positive but to improve the world in some small fraction.

       expressing opinions, talking to people, etc. this has no impact on the events you are discussing whatsoever. this is just discussion. ive got nothing against discussion, but it will not prevent a missile strike.

      <p>
       telling each other you are great and correct is the reason for the problems you complain about. you call me symbolic of flaws. this is again stroking your own ego, reaffirming to yourself that you are correct. that you are 'great'. pretty sure this is freud's actual definition of 'love'; that you say to a person that you think they are great with the expected response to be 'you are also great'.

       On the contrary, Mutual Aid theory is more relevant than ever. Our technological advancement is continually built off everybodies work in the field. We do not live in a society where one person can invent something entirely by himself. In many ways, we never did, but even more so today.

       You can see it, the AIs being developed today, self-driving cars, robotics, drones, medical advancements. None of it exists in a vacuum, none of it is being developed in a vacuum, in fact our scientific community is now more connected to the world than ever, and we tend to share most of our research.

       So do you consider any philosopher who writes long, wordy books, or scientist who writes long articles, to be a narcissist in the same way then?

       look, think what you want. if you want to reply to a post about love and harmony with 'i love you too', then go ahead. if you dont see any issues with it, or what it says about an individual, then its fighting a losing battle. im falling into the same category as all of you by even making points in my favor. discussing it isnt doing anything about it.

       I agree with the notion that this has been this way for many years, but the fact that there is a public agreement of every part involved, makes me wonder what part does media play here, and why do the governments involved are making public these attacks. 
And that is why I think this time is different. It seems like they wanted everyone to know how effective and powerful they are towards something completely ‘ruthless’, obviously coming from some government they have been (for a long time too) condemnating in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this a time for being actively discussing and questioning everything that comes to us; discussing its purpose, intentions, and meaning.

       No more collectivism! Divided we are strong. United we are evil, obviously. What can we do then? Advocate for government at the lowest possible level. Advocate for state secession from the federal government. Advocate against legal tender laws. These are real ways to stop it. Decentralized swarm of people who are not going to take it anymore.

       I agree with you that we have no place in the middle east but i disagree that there's anything we can do to change it. The powers that be, the global elite and the U.S. government have more power than every single American combined. No amount of "speak your mind" or "tell them what we think" will change the fact that war is a trillion dollar business and peace is a non-existant, unrealistic dream. I commend your post and I agree with it but with the people who call the shots, the money that is made and the blatant ignorance of what the majority of the citizens want, no change is going to happen. Reminds me of a joke:

       If our government has to lie to create a reason for the American people to go along with going to war, then yes, the position of the people carries some weight. Otherwise they would not be trying so hard to sell false narratives and just go to war.

       Thanks OP!! This has been planned by the Prince of Evil for a very long time. This is just the beginning of a total world war to ultimately end in a One World Govt/Religion/ bank. Prayer is all we have left😇🙏

       We are all powerless though. We are beyond the point of any action - it is too late, their grip on the world is too strong. If we weren't, then literally all the information we have would be censored and not get to us. The reason it isn't is because as is the case right now, we can't do anything with the information we have, right now we are all wage slaves who won't be able to do anything more - that's their tool to disempower the public.

       This is a waste of time.  Your congressman doesn't give a fuck what you think no matter which side of the aisle you are on.  Until you start costing them money, you can shove your phone calls right up your ass for all they care.

       You seem like a nice person with your heart in the right place. But love and peace aren't going to save the world at this point.  Love and peace are gentle, passive powers that are disrupted easily and take great effort to maintain.  The powers that be, they operate off the shit that is deeply ingrained in us, the little screws they can turn on any individual who's voice for peace grows too loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hierarchical power is like a Tower of Babel, built by slaves, inhabited by psychopaths who think they can buy their way into Heaven, and will only fall by blood and fire.  If you want things to really change, you are going to have to be ready to bleed and die for it.  Revolutions are slow and violent, and the people who start them are not the people who see them finished.

       Otherwise, quiet, secret, organized subversion is probably more effective at getting the weeds off the lawn(we are in a conspiracy sub after all) but the roots are deeper and we don't even know who the players are at that level.

It's all fair and just, the US and its European allies are doing it in the name of the people, of the Syrians, in the name of freedom......right?

       They’re doing this for one reason: Greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call it money, power, fame, or recognition...... those who think they rule this world want more or it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to say, “No more!” with our actions. We must not be complacent. We must not ever, ever give up Hope.
      </p>
      <p>
       The furious anger of the Masses has the power to move the freedom in this world to the next level, if we would only face our truths and FORGIVE those who do this. That doesn’t mean excuse them from punishment. But if we are to move forward we must excuse these tumors of men with Truth and Love. Fuck Hate. Anger can be righteous and focused and a POWERFUL force of change if we ACT on it with proper contemplation.

       Within Japan's ancient animistic thought known as Shinnto, there is a powerful War God named Hachiman.   Why would someone pray for peace to a war God?     Because no one can bring about peace except the war God.

       Because two wrongs make a right and if our foes are doing something that's all the reason we need to do it as well.  The US fucks with other governments just like the Russians do.  So we should fuck with more governments or less?

       I don't think any of us truly know what's going to happen next. It could be just a few targeted airstrikes and nothing moee or it could very well escalate into another costly conflict. Assad is winning and the West doesn't like that. Either way, these attacks are very worrying to me.

       The civil war in Syria has been going on for quite since the Arab spring back in 2010, your dramatic hyperbole about a new war is ill informed or misleading.  I doubt very much your heart broke because this war torn land is getting a new round of attacks given this gas attack was on the small pocket of resistance that Assad and the Russians have not ended yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes the US and other western nations have supported rebels against Assad, and Russia has supported Assad making this another in a long list of fronts where western and Russia forces conduct proxy wars.  However we cannot forget this is also the result of the long and terribly bloody civil war Sunni and Shiite have been conducting in this region.  I do not actually support this action but your post is a blatant appeal to emotion without facts or knowledge.

       I'm really impressed too what a great post. I've definitely been trying to police myself of how I've been talking to people lately especially on the internet so making micro peace as a push for macro peace is a cool idea. Honestly I thought this post was going to be full of Trump shills yelling I'm impressed.

       r/conspiracy is arguably one of the most anti-war subs. The whole point of r/conspiracy is to point out the crimes of those who rule us which usually entails them going to war for bullshit reasons (or fucking and eating kids but whatever same thing basically (legit they probs use a similar mentality))

       Couple that with a burning desire to question everything and boom you get posts like this.

       Great post. So sick of these bloodthirsty governments. I would be pissed if I was a Trump supporter, he was supposed to be the anti war candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
       People dont seem to think about all the innocents that will die as a result of this unnecessary war. As long as we get rid of "the bad guys" its totally Ok though! Who cares if 100s of innocents die if big bad Assad who totally had a good reason to gas his own fucking people when he was
       <em>
        winning
       </em>
       the war is killed??
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very clear this is about the US not wanting Russia to get that pipeline, not about avenging any children. But the masses will believe anything they are told.
      </p>
      <p>
       This particular strike may not amount to much but its clear that the US wants to eventually have a large scale intervention with Syria.

       There's a pretty stark difference in how these operations are handled, if you don't see it you're choosing not to, and that's your choice to have that opinion instead of living in the reality we share, you've created your own version that makes sense to you, and I can't stop you, I can just say good luck, it's you that has to live with your mind, not me, so I feel bad for you.

       I bet you think I’m a Trump supporter too. So who’s lost now? I supported neither but it’s a verifiable fact that Hillary ran on a platform that included no fly zones over Syria, which would have immediately led to a conflict.

       You say it's a verifiable fact that Clinton would have done something, we're in 2018 and you're talking about Clinton, what the fuck can I say to someone like you, you have your mind made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so over trying to reason with this kind of mentality, you're lost if you go straight to using Clinton to defend something he did, it's fucking pathetic to say "Both sides are the same" when they aren't, and that's a verifiable fact when you look at voting records.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatevs man, you got your mind made up, and I do too, however I made my mind up watching 30 years of politics and seeing the republicans being warhungry and the democrats cleaning up their mess, but what do I know, that's just been the case for 30 years now and you have some cases where dems also engaged in military activity during democratic admins, so that's a great what about to have so you never have to answer for your own personal responsiblity, as long as someone else has made a mistake at one point in time, you can make as many mistakes as you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       What counterproof would you like to see?  That she isn't president, because she isn't fucking president, so get over her loss and deal with the dude that's publicly bragging about throwing away your money on bombing something to look like a strongman.

       The current death toll in Iraq, whose invasion began with "surgical bombing strikes" under Bush I, stands at about 500,000. This doesn't include the 500,000 children killed by the Bush I sanctions executed by Clinton I.

       Does anyone now, anyone that has looked, truly looked at what's going on
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem. No one looks at these events because people just don't care. Maybe it's voluntary because they don't want to burden themselves or involuntarily because they don't have time to do it. Doesn't matter what the reason it, if they don't inform themselves they'll be manipulated by lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all swallow what the daily newspapers deliver them and they never question the content. If those who don't care were more critical, they'd be motivated to search deeper. But somehow they are content with the narratives we're told.

       “Are we going to just mind our own business and let this shit keep going on?” That question alone is why a lot of people support attacking Syria. Now I’m not very informed on how precise our methods of doing so are, but I could assume that we are doing it with the least amount of civilian and American troop deaths.

       I agree with all of this but every time I think about world peace, one problem cames to my mind; people. High number of population only brings problem, life standart per person keeps dropping, people get unhappy, their pshycology  gets worse, crime rate rises etc... I think this by itself will be enough to create a war anyway. If you have 1m dollars, 5 dollars is nothing but if you have 100$?

       Through technology and a different mentality, even a high level of people could live together in peace. But either way, in first world countries the population boom is already starting to slow down and the same will happen in the third world soon enough.

       If we start treating nature with respect, if we treat each other with respect, things can be different.  I have seen people change and I have seen myself change - the majority of people have an incredibe ability for cooperation and empathy, but it is being pulled out of us and destroyed by the crazy society we live in. To me meditation,  intospection....were key to invoking my own empathy, I know similar ways of mindfull engagement can help others as well.

       It is almost if this society was designed in a way to destroy our sense of compassion and cooperation. ..,

       Honestly, I care. Needless suffering never helps anyone. Supporting the reckless use of force by our leadership is at best counter-productive.

       It's not like we are bombing France or Belgium, who have no problems. This is Syria, a country killing it's own people for 7 years. Obama warned them in 2012 and they are still doing it. I don't get the surprise factor people have

       Well lets define Islamic values. Genital mutilation, stoning, honor killings, halal meat (animal torture). Towns with Sharia law has this going on but since it's the "law" it tends to fly under the radar. Women don't have any choices on primarily Islamic countries (ESPECIALLY Syria)

       Maybe not dubai. Saudi Arabia? Yes. Mosque - maybe. There's leaked footage of a mosque in the UK teaching kids that they should kill non-muslims. Radicalizing them. I'm sure if a gay walked into a mosque wearing neon and had a pride pin, it wouldn't go down well...

       You mean that cult? No correlation. Sure, for example the Catholic church has too many pedos. But there are far many more pedophiles in Islamic culture. Google "Rotherham pedo ring" - there are many more like it throughout Europe. Btw, Christianity reformed. And yes, Catholicism, a sect, has a pedo problem. Pretty fucked up

       I understand your feelings, very depressing, but I ask you, what could the Roman people do when their rulers decided another conquest was necessary? The people who wrote the U.S.constitution knew history, law, and a little about sociology. They made a system that was totally dominated by an oligarchy and it's needs. They have learned from history and have engineered the populace to their specifications. This is a global system at this point and soon the establishment will not need huge populations (they are actually counterproductive), and need to begin to cull the-"useless eaters" to fully achieve their goals. I wish I could offer words of comfort or hope, but I don't foresee the masses suddenly rising up and demanding they be taken seriously. Since you can't really do anything, maybe disengage a little and focus on other things that mean something to you. Good Luck!

       No offence, but the moment we think we are defeated is the moment we lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you've already given up and given in to our "fate", where the "useless eaters" will be culled by the elite's robot armies of the future, a path we are heading towards, then we are already lost.

       I will fight for this shit till the day I die, I will fight to spread awareness, peace, encourage people that it's not over until it's over, that they are only slaves as long as they believe they are. That as impossible as it may be, things CAN still be turned around as long as enough people notice what's happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can have it your way, but for me, as long as there is a glimmer of hope left, I won't give up on peace.

       Their mistake is that they are being destroyed one by one, so they need to do something and sadly, a peaceful way is not on the table, since it will not work.

       Very well said. Maybe a collective consciousness is the best weapon we have against the cabal?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with half a brain knows we aren’t there to protect children from being gassed, nor do we give a shit about war crimes. This is just laughable. My question is, what strategic benefit do we have destabilizing Syria? By all accounts Assad is winning this conflict. Without further intervention from outside forces this seven year disaster, which has killed more than 500,000, could be over very soon.  Why is the west doing this?  Is it to destabilize the region further so Israel can finally have their second coming?  Is it something as simple as to restock some armaments for the military industrial complex?  I don’t see any other strategic reason to do this. Any insight would be appreciated.

       Sorry if I seem a bit all over the place here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This war, to me, is just another big blot of darkness that need be purified from our subconscious so that we can evolve. I think a large part of our collective remains incredibly insensitive. Might the universe believe we need a war in order to make our insensitivities known? Might we need to, on a collective scale, recognize how far from connected we've been from the world, for decades? Might a disgusting, illogical, unfair, evil war be the universe's mechanism to awaken us? We seem
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       aware right now, relatively speaking (comparing now to the past), thanks to the internet. And all of our eyes are on this war.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Now
       </em>
       , for the first time, a
       <em>
        large
       </em>
       portion of us will watch this war. We won't look away. We're too aware of it. What will happen when we
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       see what goes on? How will the world respond?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it is silly talk to say "This is what the universe wants", as we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the universe, making things on Earth happen as we so choose and believe and feel is right. But, sometimes it's effective to look at the world as sort of a symbol. Look out at the world, see what's happening, and ask, "Why?" Why is this happening? What could this be trying to show us? What do we need to do? How do we respond?
      </p>
      <p>
       This war is, truthfully, way more complicated than we can fathom. There are so many factors, so many agendas, so many different colored hats, all trying to get what they want out of the world. So, in my opinion, the best thing to do is to just be your true self. Let go of your attachment to the world, because it is out of our control. Live your life here, now, in your community. Be the best version of yourself, so that others can see you and learn from you. Others, especially children, will recognize how detached you are from the war, and they too will not worry about it. They too will grow up to become detached from these bizarre, insane stories that our world leaders are desperately trying to write for their own psychopathic enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone just needs to let go. The world's political stage has proven itself to be uncontrollable and insane. Every time we try to control it, we get fucked over by someone we trust. So, I think, by now, many of us can recognize that the best response might be to just let go, completely, of any sort of attachment to this war. Maybe that's what this war is calling for.

       When I saw about the U.S. attack, the first thing I thought was: I bet "they" will let up on Trump a bit now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an entire military industrial complex that makes billions of dollars from global wars. I think while Trump was NOT playing ball, they were leaning on him pretty hard. ALL media outlets attack him all day, DOJ is on a witch Hunt until they find something to charge ANYBODY with, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wonder if since he caved and gave them a war, if they'll let up a bit on him? That's how it reads to me.

       There are legitimate reasons why North Korea still exists largely unmolested by US/US Allies. A preemptive strike cannot ensure the obliteration of NK's missile silos, not to mention conventional artillery. With Seoul so close to the border, once the bombs drop on Pyongyang, and Kim retaliates a lot of south koreans will die. Any prior evacuation attempt could tip off Kim to an incoming strike, so it is implausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, while I think it is only right to doubt every 'fact' from these mainstream news outlets, it's still important to keep realistic. Attacking Iran benefits the corrupt higher-ups how, exactly? If the global economy collapses, as you say, wouldn't that be a bad thing for these multinational company-owning magnates? Where does it say that Iran will be next?

       Campaigns like this one happen every day.  The reason why this one feels more real is because the TV (and internet) have shoved it down your throat, and then televised it. The President is still on good terms with Assad and Russia. This is all a move to shut the war-mongers up about Syria. They now can never, ever claim Assad gasses his own people (Which Syrians will tell you he never, ever has). This was a chess move.

       I sort of see it like pack animals. Not to say I support what's going on, but it boils down to mutually assured destruction. What's next? I think what's next is knock some smaller countries around, join us or die. Give us your wealth and resources. At the end it will be like the big 3, or the big 5 in a game of UN roulette. Only the strong survive? I Think it's the lucky and the spineless that will survive. I used to see that as a sign of weakness in people, not being accountable for things, dishonesty, etc. But now I'm not sure. So people have to start acting like cock roaches if you want to live comfortably. Have a nice day ✌️

       So once again we are jumping into a possible war without all the information.  Is Mr. D launching missiles as a show of force like last year or is he serious about starting a war he said he wouldn't.  I am generally curious about wtf is going through his head when following this course of action.  Is he trying to weed out all the war hawks in Congress?  I hope within the coming days some speck of  truth finds its way to the forefront ahead of all the propaganda being spread by the major news corps and everyone else not in it.

       The strategy is to bomb targets that are a high probability that it will make the biggest impact on chemical weapons with the minimum amount of casuaties.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is step 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reaction to step 1 will be a message from assad. This could go two ways...really 1 way. Assad will say "I did it, I chem'd my own people, I'm sorry, here is the locations to the rest of them. I surrender." If he says that, I would watch out for Deepfake conspiracies to be suppressed and, of course, make the people who suggest that look loony toons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Assad will say "It wan't me" and we will be told he is lying based on evidence that is "top secret" and can't be "displayed publicly for national security reason". And if we suggest that he didn't actually do it, we will be labeled conspiracy nuts and buried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step two: Ramp up bombing efforts to tier 2:  Bombing structures that have major impact with less regard to loss of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step 3 and 4 area about like what you would think. 3 being having increased disregard for casualties and of course 4 having zero regard. And of course the further degradation of the middle east leaving anyone (
       <em>
        cough
       </em>
       Israel
       <em>
        cough
       </em>
       ). Further throwing trust between Russia, Iran, NK, China, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And around and around we go. All based on Section 2 of Article 2 saying the "President has the power to do whatever the fuck he wants as long as it pertains to "National Interests"" and since Presidential overreach is not defined by this in the Constitution it leaves a lot to interpretation. Secretary Mattis agreed with the use of this executive power and off they went.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want a question to ask your Representatives I might make it, "What evidence do we have that Assad ordered the use of chemical weapons on his own people knowing the blowback?"

       You need to have more faith. Donald Trump knows he's not 'fully' in power, as in, there are Deep State/NWO still in power. Putin has told Trump this when he first became president. He said that your enemy will be the NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, the US has taken down COUNTRIES in the matter of HOURS/DAYS with its military might. You honestly think a large, coordinated military campaign such as this one would cause 'no damage'?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump tweeted that there might be an attack. Who does that? No one.. at least, not anyone that wants to spoil the element of surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       He knows what he's doing. He knows that a world war in Syria isn't going to help anyone and he's honestly most likely a closet isolationist; which is smart right now for America.

       Trump is doing the best he can while trying to prevent WW3.

       Well, it's certainly not anything definitive, but Trump's tweet makes it seem like he's trying to make this bombing (which was only chemical weapons facilities that had been evacuated already) a one-and-done, at least until the next staged atrocity forced him to do something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still holding onto hope that Trump is doing what he can to stop the system's madness, but none of us really know.

       one thing that i cant wrap my mind around is, why would assad or any other dictator would bother developing chemical weapons?
Knowing the hostility and disgust these weapons cause around the globe why would he do it?
-are they easer to make than conventional weapons? are they a lot more effective in combat? dont they require a high level of sophistication and extreme precaution when handling?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people (including me) even dont know what a chemical weapon look like and how they are launched or used. do you drop them from a plane or throw them with a catapult?
      </p>
      <p>
       and what difference does it make how civilians die at war? how is dying by a chemical weapon makes it more important than a dying by a car bomb etc. hundreds of civilians die everyday in wars around the globe. USA's dear ally saudi arabia killed thousands in yemen for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       well as the saying goes :“If it looks like shit, smells like shit, and feels like shit, you don't have to actually eat it to know it's shit.”

       I think it would be very interesting to see what would happen if every single citizen in the United States were to boycott tax season. I mean, the government works for us, right? We pay their salaries. What services are we paying for, exactly? Infrastructure, education, healthcare, and welfare programs are all fucked. They are not providing the services for which we are paying them. They're using our money to bomb Syrian civilians. So why are we paying them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it would only work if
       <em>
        everybody
       </em>
       did it, including the wealthy. One can dream.

       Good post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your writing is... different. The repeating words really through me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I have to ask, as a non-supporter. What is the other option? Could we really do nothing or just humanitarian shit, and basically solidify that these heinous acts are acceptable?
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly do not have anything against Syrians or muslims, but fuck religion and fuck Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just fucking sad that the millions spent on missiles could almost not be redirected to humanitarian efforts, become someone's greed always comes into the equation. I almost think bombing them is the only option, it's not like any other major countries are going to suddenly defend them. I hate that I feel this way.

       Hey, thanks for the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a difficult question, I'm not going to lie. I think the worst part is seeing how totally fake the moral outrage is and how obvious it is that the bombing is not due to the children, especially with the insane amounts of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which is killing its own people and bombing Yemen (undoubtedly filled with suffering children as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the whole thing strongly feels like a false flag event designed to wisk us all into new wars. Why would Assad do this now, at the end? He might be an evil dictator, but he isn't a total moron, he knows events like this would be used against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even more so, it's the whole spectrum of insanity going on on the Middle East, the bombing of Iraq, the drones killing innocents. ...if this was a one off attack and truly an act of virtue to help the Syrians, this would be a different story altogether. But at least in my mind, the trust in these conflicts is eroding, people see the vast majority of them (or more likely, all of them) are not due to compassion and are not actually spreading freedom and peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that attacking a country like that should be the last resort, when all else fails, all negotiations, diplomacy, humanitarian aid... and even then should only be done by a country that actually has the good of those people in mind. I strongly doubt the US and its allies do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before any of that though, the US has plenty of domestic problems where it can funnel its money, instead of spending it all on the military and engaging in these endless wars...

       I just had this conversation yesterday with my sister, to try and get an honest answer. As to "why avoid talking about real issues" For my sisters early 30 something peer group it boils down to fear from lack of understanding and a normalcy bias. So, they avoid learning the important information purposefully so as to not violate their own normalcy bias. I called that willful ignorance! She said it was overwhelming... I'm personally always trying to change my approach in just bringing up conversation and  general awareness. Appreciate the post.

       No one actually believes Assad did the chemical attack, no one thinks the US and NATO wants to get into Syria for any good reason. Even on T_D people are shaking their heads at this.

       It's truly shameful that Christianity has been associated with war.  Too many so-called Christians are eager to go out and "defend their country", never stopping to contemplate the fact that the people they're going to go kill probably also pray to God for protection. They never seem to look deep into the motivations for these wars, never realizing that they are all, including this one with Syria, deeply immoral.

       Your message resonated, Jacob. They may say you're a dreamer, but you're not the only one. I love you too. We need to get away from the fear of that word - of the symbol of the highest and most evolved state of mind a human can experience. There is a spectrum to love, but the meaning has been hijacked by greeting card companies, fast food, pop culture, you name it. We need to get comfortable being kind, being empathetic, and telling people we value and cherish what is good in them; that we love them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not alone, Jacob. Let us hope this enlightened understanding continues to grow.

       You think what happened last night has any bearing whatsoever on the current conflict? Syria was completely decimated as a country by 2015. We are way beyond the point of avoiding war and we’ve gotten to the point of Russian intervention in the Middle East on behalf of an authoritarian regime, which is unhealthy for the state of humanity. Despite what you may think the West has the moral high ground and has a code of ethics it justifiably enforces on the world when it can. Western long term objectives are righteous and since 2009 American methods have fallen within the realm of morality.

       The mass "culturally created" are so dumbed down and so consumed with everything else and especially themselves.. They literally question nothing or see nothing but themselves. If you told them grass was really purple in color.. And if its on the news, in hollywood, a celebrity says it to be true.. It's "truth"! Now they don't even have to take time to fabricate these news stories or false stories because the majority will only see (the color purple). And those that see green are quacks or possibly have a chemical imbalance ;p

       It breaks my fucking heart to think of all the people who  will suffer in this conflict. It breaks my heart to think of all the American citizens who will be left behind while the government spends trillions on an endless war.

       Thank you. You stole the words right out of my mouth. What is happening to Syria is deeply sickening. And I too was somehow hopeful that this war they have blatantly and recklessly trying to get started might possibly be thwarted somehow. I guess I was hoping trump somehow knew better (and to me that was the only good part of him being in office. I never believed he would “drain the swamp” and never agreed with the large majority of his platform, and the two party system is a scam). It’s clear our govt has never cared for the truth when it came to Syria. My heart breaks for the people of Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       All we can do is make our voices heard. Thank you for your call to action there.

       Each tomahawk is $1.87 million. So we just dropped way over $125 million in one strike. That is a lot of profit going in the war machine's pocket, but to them it's just that drop of blood that gets the sharks into a feeding frenzy.

       We're not bombing Assad for killing his own civilians. That's the BS Fake News narrative. Syria, like N. Korea and Iran is a gov't overtaken by the Deep State and under the control of the CIA. The targets, chemical weapon facilities, were CIA assets. Trump is KILLING THE DEEP STATE wherever the black ops are in control. He, Putin, Rocket Man and Assad could even be working together to cut out the cancer. DON'T DESPAIR! Trump can't come right out and tweet that he is at war with agencies and forces within our government so he has to repeat the stupid script about Assad gassing his people.

       That’s not today that no war is justified, but rather the bar is often lowered by leaders looking to satiate the bloodlust of their people.

       Excellent post, brother. I missed it when you wrote it but found my way back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever read Richard Bach? I think you'd like him, or would have at one point in your life. He wrote a book called
       <em>
        One
       </em>
       , and in it the main character, an American pilot, and his wife meet a Russian pilot and his wife (I think this was end of the cold war time period, but could be wrong). I forget which, but one of the pilots told this story to the others.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My great grandfather and your great grandfather had their houses across a field from each other. At one point a feud between them started. No one remembers how it started or why, but the feud continues to this day. Over time, our families each stockpiles weapons, and pointed them at each other's house. You and I are supposed to hate each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I have no quarrel with you. You have never done me wrong, and anything you may have done to my family you did because of a feud that both our families continued. You and I can make peace, because I recognize this war is no good for my family, and you recognize this war is no good for yours.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       I think I butchered that a bit, and probably added some of my own thinking, but that story has always stuck with me. That and the image of Christmas between the trenches in WWI. It shows that we the people do not want war, and that war is never for our own benefit, or out of our own hatred, but out the fears our misleaders have fed us.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I know they're lies, and you know they're lies, than you and I have no quarrel, no reason to fight each other, nor have a war fought on our behalf or in our name. And if we know this, and more of us start to know this, they can't have war. I think protests can be important, but more important than that, and the reason we really have protests, is passing this knowledge and understanding from one individual to another. Anyway we can do that is a good way.

       Thanks- I was truly pissed and emotional after the missile strikes and was pretty convinced another war was about to start (I'm kind of surprised it hasn't, honestly), so the post really just wrote itself after that.

       I've read Jonathan Livingston Seagull, which might have been the shortest book I've ever read haha :D but it was awesome and I totally enjoyed his writing style, not to mention his deep insight into the nature of our reality, interwoven into such a simple tale. I also bought another one of his short books (are they all so tiny?),
       <em>
        Illusions
       </em>
       , a few years back, but for some reason I've never read it in full.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember borrowing his autobiography recently from the library, but couldn't find the time to read it (I often go to the library and get tons of books, then only read the ones I feel drawn to, which means I always have tons of borrowed books at home, many of which I never have the time to read lol).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never heard of the book you mentioned (One), but I'll check it out if it's good :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I fully agree with your final premise. What we need, as corny as it may sound, is indeed simply more awareness. Humans are sleepwalking and they are like sheep being led to slaughter - they have no awareness of what it means that wars are happening on the other side of the world, they sometimes don't  even think wars should be stopped, as to some, violence is somehow simply "human nature".
      </p>
      <p>
       But deep inside, people don't want more war, they don't want more conflict, more violence, more pain, more suffering. The fact that my post was so well received and the comments were so overwhelmingly supportive of this peace, shows that. Deep inside, people want peace.  They crave it, they need it. But they are led to war, because they have been devilishly tricked that more war will some day lead to peace! Can you imagine that!  But people believe this, because they have been taught that way. This is also how they work in the microcosm of their own life,where they then assume that more anger will resolve anger, that more self hate will resolve self hate, that harsher punishments will stop crime, that their own emotions need to be repressed, controlled,
       <em>
        destroyed
       </em>
       ....they don't see how peace, compassion, love, calmness defeats the fear, the pain. They were taught differently.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's changing, people are waking up. What we can do is make people more and more aware of the peace they already want, of the truth they already know. That's it. The transformation always comes when you point people to their own truth, to their own wisdom and compassion.  You know it's there, because you've seen it in yourself, now you help the others see it in themselves. We shouldn't tell people what to do or how to act, we should just point them to their own wisdom on how to act, their own compassion, their own truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the true catalyst for change from my perspective.

       I think I've only read
       <em>
        One
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Illusions
       </em>
       , which I think I picked up in a flea market or similar place. IIRC,
       <em>
        One

       is a bit longer than
       <em>
        Illusion

       .  If you've read him, and just from reading your writing, there's probably nothing jaw-dropping in it for you, but I think it would be an enjoyable read if you need a dose of hope now or at some point in the future.

       Something Brap told me years ago and has stuck with me: when you preface something with a disclaimer like that, it means you're not really committed to it. (Again, sure I butchered his words, but I think I got the gist). It's not corny — it's truth — our society has just perverted our values to the point where we feel embarrassed to even express it. Just one of the many mind games we have to work past, both individually and collectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say it's crazy that people are so caught up in their own drama to not realize the consequence of action, but I really only need to take a look in the mirror to understand it. The line between good and evil truly does cut through each human heart. The hatred and anger
       <em>
        out there
       </em>
       is a reflection of the hatred and anger I still harbor
       <em>
        in here
       </em>
       . It's a daily struggle but worth the price of admission.

       No fucking more. If its a global war against the people they want. Then a global war against the people is what they will get. I kinda like the idea of a global milita willing to fight for the safety of everyone.

       I don't think any of us truly know what's going to happen next. It could be just a few targeted airstrikes and nothing moee or it could very well escalate into another costly conflict. Assad is winning and the West doesn't like that. Either way, these attacks are very worrying to me.

       Because chemical weapons usually require containment facilities for preparation and delivery. These facilities require electrical power, and people with degrees in chemistry related fields to manage them.
      </p>
      <p>
       While it isn't impossible for a terrorist group to have these resources, the chance of them being exposed to the chemical before deploying it or deploying it incorrectly are both quite high.

      <p>
       I'm so over trying to reason with this kind of mentality, you're lost if you go straight to using Clinton to defend something he did, it's fucking pathetic to say "Both sides are the same" when they aren't, and that's a verifiable fact when you look at voting records.

       So whatevs man, you got your mind made up, and I do too, however I made my mind up watching 30 years of politics and seeing the republicans being warhungry and the democrats cleaning up their mess, but what do I know, that's just been the case for 30 years now and you have some cases where dems also engaged in military activity during democratic admins, so that's a great what about to have so you never have to answer for your own personal responsiblity, as long as someone else has made a mistake at one point in time, you can make as many mistakes as you want.

       Is a plant that produces chlorine considered a chemical weapons plant?   I mean there are a lot of other uses for chlorine, so it seems like a tricky definition what would move a regular chemical facility into the realm of weapons facility I wonder.

       You cannot prove the chemical weapons used last week against Syrian civilians were created in those plants. Nor can you even prove those attacks even happened, but that’s another conversation.

       of course you can write about your ideas. that is not a solution to the problem, which was your question. 'what can we do?'.

       yes, he very much is in it for the 'karma' aka the need to affirm his worth and intelligence. you are all stroking his inflated ego for him.

       there is no way mutual aid theory applies to the modern world. it's not practical and completely eliminates technological progression on the scale it is currently.

       expressing opinions, talking to people, etc. this has no impact on the events you are discussing whatsoever. this is just discussion. ive got nothing against discussion, but it will not prevent a missile strike.

       telling each other you are great and correct is the reason for the problems you complain about. you call me symbolic of flaws. this is again stroking your own ego, reaffirming to yourself that you are correct. that you are 'great'. pretty sure this is freud's actual definition of 'love'; that you say to a person that you think they are great with the expected response to be 'you are also great'.

       OP is a narcissist. this, i think i would go as far as to say, is undeniable. to write a blog and an opinion piece such as this post, you have to be. to think that you are enlightened to this degree when the content is theoretical, emotional, subversion of reality.

       here is all i have said, seeing as youre so enthusiastic about twisting every god damn thing i write:

       OP is an egomaniac. Everyone responding (in the case of this sub) has a desire to feel validated.
