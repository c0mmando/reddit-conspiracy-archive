       I’ve seen a huge influx in antisemitism on this subreddit. In the past, the sub has usually known the line between antizionism and antisemitism. Now the latter seems to be thriving, and it seems to have come out of nowhere. Holocaust denial is common, as is the idea that all Jews are involved in some global conspiracy to turn us away from Christian values.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just beware that racism will only further isolate this subreddit and could be potentially be very dangerous for it. I even wonder whether shills are coming here to spread antisemitic rhetoric to discredit the sub and even get it banned. This growth in antisemitism seems to have come at a time when the sub has grown a lot. Perhaps this is shills trying to find a way to kill its popularity.

       Is much more complex than people imagine, especially when you consider that most modern Israeli’s are actually eastern-European khazars and ashkanazi. In fact the Palestinians are more Semitic than most Israeli’s.

       Usually means that a language has elements that can be traced back to semitic languages. Why does it matter? Do you think all roots of words should reflect what they mean currently? You do realise words can evolve hugely? Why are you still arguing about the meaning of words to the Oxford dictionary?

       you can't admit it relates to favoritism of Jews and Arabs, why is that?
You prefer to exclude arabs from the definition of Semite or is it more about using a falsehood to manipulate discussion for the sheer joy of trickery it gives you?  Blind obedience is fascinating to watch, but I do have other things to do so I'm afraid I must leave you to stew in unrelenting hate for non-zionist jews.

       I'm not excluding arabs from the definition of semites. They are semites. It is simply that the dictionary definition of antisemitism regards prejudice and hostility towards Jews. The root of the word is unimportant and has little relation to the phenomena that antisemitism describes.

       Since there are roughly 60 times more Arab Semites than Jewish Semites, somebody somewhere is definitely being sneaky and devious with the definition.

       "English" came from "Angles", the name of the one of the Germanic groups that came to England, supposedly because the area they inhabited was called "Angul". However, English now means all people belonging to England.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just how language has evolved. Arguing over the semantics of it really is pointless, because people understand what you mean when you say "English", and that's what matters.

       Everyone should understand the meaning of "semitic". It describes a demographic of people that is not defined by religion, but by race and  languages. This is common knowledge, and can be found in most dictionaries and encyclopaedias,
       <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/semitic">
        such as the Cambridge Dictionary
       </a>
       .  "Antisemitism" however describes the phenomena of prejudice and hostility against Jews. That is just how the word "antisemitism" evolved.

       That's a poor description of opposition to Zionism, and as a populace Americans should argue to rectify that definition, because that is not how anti-Zionism is universally understood, and dictionaries should reflect what words are universally understood to mean, just as they do with "antisemitism".

       So what about the latest Chambers' edition (1988) which states
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “a hater of Semites, esp. Jews, or of their influence”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The use of
       <strong>
        esp
       </strong>
       being hugely important and justification for the use in terms of non-Jewish Semites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, rather than quoting dictionaries all day, my point is that UOP are not the purveyors of language. They only document it. And as you can see from my examples, the big 3 dictionary publishers all document it in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that says they all have their own agenda attached. In those cases it is safest to revert back to the true meaning of the word, meaing that the all Semites (or children of Shem/Sam) are considered.

       But "antisemitism" is very rarely contested in general discourse.  Everyone understands what people mean by it, because everyone uses it these days to describe prejudice against Jews. I've never seen it used to describe prejudice against all semitic people. Thus I think the Oxford dictionary definition is perfectly adequate. Anti-Zionism is slightly harder to define, and more contested.

       As I've already shown, others have a very different experience to your own.

       (As an aside, I noticed you mention in a reply to someone else that you like to use correct language. That is to be applauded in a time when so many are willing to throw words about, with little regard for their actual meaning... and precisely why I'm trying to be as detailed as i can in our discussion.)

       "

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        New antisemitism is the concept that a new form of antisemitism has developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, emanating simultaneously from the far left, Islamism, and the far right, and that it tends to manifest itself as opposition to Zionism and the State of Israel. The concept generally posits that much of what is purported to be criticism of Israel by various individuals and world bodies, is, in fact, tantamount to demonization, and that, together with an alleged international resurgence of attacks on Jews and Jewish symbols, and an increased acceptance of antisemitic beliefs in public discourse, such demonization represents an evolution in the appearance of antisemitic beliefs.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Proponents of the concept argue that anti-Zionism, anti-Americanism, anti-globalization, third worldism, and demonization of Israel, or double standards applied to its conduct, may be linked to antisemitism, or constitute disguised antisemitism.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Critics of the concept argue that it conflates anti-Zionism with antisemitism, defines legitimate criticism of Israel too narrowly and demonization too broadly, trivializes the meaning of antisemitism, and exploits antisemitism in order to silence political debate.

       Should be interesting to watch. As of this comment this post has been alive for 2 hrs and the discussion has been cordial. That doesn't fit into concern trolling patterns that OP is lamenting. One way it could go is for some astroturfing anti-jewish comments to spill forth to change that.

       I see a lot of people criticizing Israel. I've also seen instances of Israleis calling those people antisemitism for criticizing Israel, when those people said nothing about Jews. It seems to me that it is very hard to find any sympathy to this thread when people act like that.

       The antisemites on this subreddit usually believe that the Jews run the deep state for the ideological purpose of creating a world that is entirely under their thumb, because Jews actually hate everyone who isn't Jewish and don't have "our interests in mind".

       jesuits run both the zionists and the sabattean-frankists and these false, 'synagogue of satan' jews generate all the hatred against traditional, orthodox jews with their deliberately reckless and sinful behaviour we witness today.  this is by design, to mark the jews a scapegoat and in preparation for another pogrom.

       The issue with the ant-semite canard is that its meaning has been severely diluted from overusage by- dare I say, Jews.

       </a>
       marking and tagging the alt-right as ant-semites with some cheap shot neurolinguistic programming gibberish concerning the doubts about the authencity of the chemical attack in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       This over-usage creates a natural doth protest too loudly Streisand effect, whereby the curious start checking what the fuss is all about. Then it doesn't take much to see a pattern- namely that the "anti-semite" accusation is weaponized language designed to game people.

       I agree with this. The antisemitism label is bandied around far too much. Most things labelled antisemitism aren't antisemitism. Sometimes, as in the case of criticising the US/FR/UK bombings of Syria, it's not even anti-Zionist (not that anti-Zionism is a problem anyway). But there is definitely some very real antisemitism on this subreddit.

       In terms of current events there is a renewal of attention on the neocons and neoliberals (basically the same). Jews don't have a monopoly on these threats, but they are very overrepresented versus their numbers (2%) in the population. These are people who identify as Jews and use their in-group think tanks, and media contacts to warmonger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then if other Jews (or gentiles) stand for peace, they are gamed, trashed and diminshed. You won't see their columns in Wapo or the NYT.  Why did Haaratz feel compelled to slur the alt-right about the issue of war in Syria?  Why is that a story? What is Israel's agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       True Jews aren't a monolith, but there bad dynamic here where bad actors who are Judiacs are amplified. And who amplifies them? Can you debate that question without resorting to the one trick pony anti-semite tagging? Does that make me an anti-semite to say this? If so -did my view come out of a vaccum?

       I think Jewish families have a lot of old money, and that has lead them to getting lots of elite positions in government and business. Jews are far more likely to be Zionists than other demographics, so you see this filtering into politics. This essentially is because for Jews, Israel holds a very special place in their hearts. However, when push comes to shove, this love for Israel will fail in the face of money. If you want to look at a demographic with far more power than the Jews, you should look at the Arab ultra-elite. The Arabs aren't powerful because of some ideological reason, it's simply because they happen, as a result of simple geography, to control a lot of the oil industry, through which America gets huge amounts of money. If you want a solid example that the Arab ultra-elite are more powerful than Israel, you need to look no further than the Yom Kippur War, when the KSA forced the US to stop supporting Israel by enacting an oil embargo against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that there are lots of powerful groups in the world. But the idea that Jews are some kind of united cabal that have perfectly designed the trajectory of history to spurn the other races and give themselves supremacy is clearly just an attempt to simplify things so that there is only one true enemy, that enemy being the Jews. This is clearly antisemitic and clearly completely clueless.

       OK, so 3 and 4 are the same.  You were in a hurry and screwed up.  But the important thing is that you offer no support at all for generalization which is your title and that you have attempted a fraud as proof of your general statement.  As anyone who compares the titles you have written to the titles of the submissions in the links themselves can see, there is absolutely no support for your claim at all.

       Antisemitism has been a near meaningless catch-all knee jerk defense when accountability is demanded for those who feel no need to account for their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some very bad and powerful people hide behind their religious affiliations and feel morbidly entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Global conspiracies exist and sometimes people who identify as Jews undertake them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So do lots of other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know whenever events cause people to consider Israeli influence and manipulation in America these squeamish posts about "antisemitism" inevitably follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a post goes too far and the identity politics become too rancorous and hateful, call that shit out, but your vague appeal to stop criticizing power and influence being used for solely "Jewish State" interests rings hollow.

       Do you (anyone) believe there is a correlation between where a person is from when it comes to antisemitism? I'm especially curious about people in the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised in the Deep South, U.S. and I have never in my life personally witnessed (seen or heard) any sort of prejudice or even dislike towards Jewish people.

      <p>
       Now there's
       <strong>
        plenty
       </strong>
       of other prejudices that freely abound, no doubt. So please don't think I'm singing the praises of Southern morality!

       literally their own fault. Jews started actively abandoning europe in the 1970s to move to Israel/the united states then decided that they would 'get back' at europe for it's 'history of antisemetism' by encouraging muslim immigration to destroy european nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews complaining about the rise of antisemetism in europe while actively engaging in activities literally designed to increase it is the biggest joke of the 21st century.

       In the north the jews are everywhere. Did you know in NYC that section 8 housing is filled with jews through corruption? And yet welfare fraud from other minorities is the problem. They steal from the city and buy up all the property for themselves. Guns are legal in the south so this shit wouldn't fly.

       Obviously false, obviously racist posts are easy to down vote and move on. If you don't want to move on, you can always debate these racists fucks to point out how ignorant and dumb they are.

       I absolutely agree with you. Folks who believe in this stuff, OK, great, terrific. What if this very unpopular idea is the undoing of this sub? THINK. Use your brains. If this was 'white supremacy' you were talking about, this sub would be banned forever. You think the sub can't fall apart over perceived antisemitism? Yes, there has been a

       I don't care to defend this sub or rebbit. I shouldn't care about debating bots. "You" claiming the genuine /u/ of this sub are exhibiting double standards is just plain fraud. Message the mods....they are the retards you seek to repair your world for you

       How the fuck do the submission titles justify the comments? Also how did I "screw up" by linking two comments from the same thread? The comments stand on their own as separate examples of antisemitism. Do you also think that this submission which states "
