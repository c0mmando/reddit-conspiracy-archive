<p>A perplexed European asked me a question: Why, she asked, have there been no general strikes in America to end its aggression in the Middle East? Why, she asked, are Americans so unwilling to force their government do what must be done? </p>

<p>These are not new questions. Everyone with an inkling of history and a modest awareness of international news realizes that Americans, completely contrary to the foundation myth of the American Revolution, are incredibly docile. It stings, however, when someone from the outside points out an obvious weakness. </p>

<p>Citizens of other industrialized countries are able to organize national actions to achieve common goals. Americans at the university, labor, middle class and working class levels, however, seem to be utterly impotent and thoroughly disorganized in any long-term, coordinated endeavor that extends beyond electoral politics. We literally struggle to organize coordinated national events. </p>

<p>A general strike is one of the most powerful tools of non-violent civil disobedience. In a general strike all work stops, businesses shut down, consumers do not spend money, teachers and students stay away from school, employees call in sick, lawyers do not try cases, assembly line workers do not assemble, teamsters park their rigs, pilots do not fly, doctors practice only emergency medicine, and commerce grinds to a halt. General strikes are not violent, but they cause tremendous economic hurt. When properly coordinated and prepared, they are very persuasive. General strikes have toppled governments, such as in Argentina, and they have prevented the implementation of anti-labor legislation, most notably in France and in Italy.  </p>

<p>Some argue that Americans are simply too economically comfortable to participate in any political action more strenuous that penciling an X on a ballot. That cannot be the answer. Indeed, the notion that Americans live better than everyone else is part of our national mythology. Although many Americans reside in spacious (and heavily mortgaged) houses and, by incurring massive debt, own lots of &quot;stuff&quot;, citizens of several European industrialized nations live, on average, healthier, more secure lives and work far fewer hours than most Americans. Certain Asian countries are not far behind. Notwithstanding their better living conditions, Germans, French, Italians and Spaniards, for example, are still more willing to take concerted political action than are Americans. </p>

<p>There are several reasons for Americans&#39; complacency and Europeans&#39; engagement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think the last decade was spent incrementally detailing to Americans the extent of the Surveillance State in which they now exist?</p>

<p>The knowledge of full spectrum monitoring has a chilling effect right down to the subconscious of the public.</p>

<p>A government cannot just announce that they record your thoughts and movements, that would be tyranny.</p>

<p>It must be leaked out slowly by &quot;heroes&quot; blowing the whistle on the rogue government in which they participated with thousands of other careerist &quot;good Americans&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a certain confirmed hopelessness in America where the government is corrupt and the interests of the people at the bottom of the pyramid bear no resemblance to those running the system.</p>

<p>Learned helplessness should never make people abandon their responsibility as individuals. </p>
