    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you need to think about the incentive to do work. If it requires human attention, payment is probably required to maintain it. Then it comes at the expense of the users. When government collects taxes it merely is a form of payment for these things that makes life more convenient. Tolls are not convenient. Have you imagined paying tools on every road you drive? How long the lines might be, and the delays.</p>

<p>If you think private enterprise is immune from corruption, you don&#39;t understand private enterprise. Corruption is profitable. Private enterprise is the main corruptor of government too. </p>

<p>We were out and another friend from Canada joined us. He works in the oil business and makes about 200k a year.</p>

<p>As we were talking the Canadian said that he paid a lot in taxes last year, about 80k federal and province. His bring home amount was 120k. He then said that he is fine with it because he has &quot;free&quot; healthcare. </p>

<p>The friend that lives in Costa Rica told him that he has a great insurance policy, and goes to world class hospitals, which costs him $150/ month.</p>

<p>$1800 a year is what his health care costs him..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because most people don&#39;t make that much money. In a taxation system based on income, the ones with more income pay more in taxes. I know that money being taken from oneself feels awful, but think of the other side of it. </p>

<p>What about the people who make little money? They pay less than the actual cost of the service. If the government didn&#39;t offer it, they wouldn&#39;t have it. It would be like the USA, with our high priced, high deductible and low coverage plans. So they&#39;d go without insurance or have terrible insurance. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t care about them, fine, but I do. Not everyone can be rich or upper class or we&#39;d just shift what it means to be rich or upper class. Healthcare should not a luxury for the rich, but a right for human beings, at least at some minimum level. It&#39;s a measure of society how well the poor, weak and sick are treated. </p>

<p>I am aware of the social Darwin mentality and I feel the same back to all who have it when they hit hard times. Suck it up sucker. It&#39;s what you will for others. Change your mind or I can&#39;t care about you. It&#39;s like someone who is helped up with a rope ladder and then proceeds to pull it up for the others after them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>

<p>If you read your Adam Smith, then apply that to real life, you will see that the ONLY thing that has ever improved the lives of humans if free market capitalism. People are greedy, that is why they make better bread than the other guy, or do a better job as a plumber, or whatever, because they want more money. That makes goods and services get better and cheaper over time.... which makes us all better off.</p>

<p>Since 1965 the US has taken $25 TRILLION from people who are productive, and handed it to people who are not in what amounts to direct cash transfers. The poverty rate is basically the same today as it was in 1965.</p>

<p>There was no income tax in the US from 1776-1913. But there were plenty of roads, schools and armies..... We don&#39;t need it to function. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because most people don&#39;t make that much money. In a taxation system based on income, the ones with more income pay more in taxes. I know that money being taken from oneself feels awful, but think of the other side of it. </p>

<p>What about the people who make little money? They pay less than the actual cost of the service. If the government didn&#39;t offer it, they wouldn&#39;t have it. It would be like the USA, with our high priced, high deductible and low coverage plans. So they&#39;d go without insurance or have terrible insurance. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t care about them, fine, but I do. Not everyone can be rich or upper class or we&#39;d just shift what it means to be rich or upper class. Healthcare should not a luxury for the rich, but a right for human beings, at least at some minimum level. It&#39;s a measure of society how well the poor, weak and sick are treated. </p>

<p>I am aware of the social Darwin mentality and I feel the same back to all who have it when they hit hard times. Suck it up sucker. It&#39;s what you will for others. Change your mind or I can&#39;t care about you. It&#39;s like someone who is helped up with a rope ladder and then proceeds to pull it up for the others after them. </p>
