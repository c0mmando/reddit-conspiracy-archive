<p>And I read about one county or town (can&#39;t remember) that is heavily anti-gun, and constitution be damned is requiring all citizens to turn in their weapons.</p>

<p>Add in the MSM campaign, David hogg, and the ignorance of the triggers of what is actually causing these unfortunate loss of life (hind: mental illness, lax or ineffective checks when purchasing, mkultra j/k kinda) and I&#39;d say there is a political push when CNN starts using kids as props, and they start having speeches and airtime but are not able to be criticized in any way (because they are kids)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is that what I said?  No.  What I said is that Americans are not being disarmed.  Is there a push for stricter gun control legislation?  Yes.  But if you understand anything about the law, you would know that constitutional protection of gun ownership is currently at a historic high and has been since at least the Heller decision.  We have to remain vigilant to prevent disarmament, but it is categorically false to say that Americans are being disarmed at the present time.</p>

I&#39;m listening to the Russian Foreign Minister give a press conference right now who is basically saying the UK is responsible for the chemical attack.

<p>we shake our heads sadly at savagery&#39;s acts

not to remind ourselves of the unpleasant fact

and if you&#39;re a despot in desperate need of sarin or shells,

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t kid yourself about Israel. They would throw each and everyone of us to the lions if it guaranteed their territory. I use3d to think Israel was our very best ally and we could count on them to the bitter end. Then I found what they did to the USS Liberty back in the sixties. That was supposed to be a false flag to draw the USA into a war with Egypt which of course would have been a very good thing for Israel. I just see those Egyptian painted jets just ripping away at those poor bastards stuck in that boat. They killed something like 36 Americans that day. Their orders had been to sink it and make sure there was not one survivor. I know the Liberty to be the truth. It really makes me wonder about 911. There are just way too much evidence pointing at Israel and at some of our wicked inner circle. What really pisses me off is that these assholes are going to get away with it. We lose what 5000  in Iraq and Afghan, not to mention the over a million Arab&#39;s that most likely had nothing at all to do with it. I have always heard that &quot;Ignorance is Bliss&quot; and I think it&#39;s true. have you ever tried to convince family or friends about any of this kind of stuff. They are just convinced I&#39;m crazy. Maybe their right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all? Muslims were also celebrating the 9/11 attack. I have also suspected Israel may have been involved in 9/11, but essentially that&#39;s the only evidence. The attackers weren&#39;t Israeli, most were from Saudi Arabia. The Saudis were definitely involved.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no slam dunk for proving &quot;Israel did 9/11&quot; it&#39;s more like &quot;Isrsel, US, and Saudi Arabia longtime partners in terror did 9/11.</p>

<p>But if you believe Israel controls US foreign policy, then it&#39;s only a small stretch to get to &quot;Israel did 9/11&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have read in more than one source one of the first things that came up was &quot;THE DANCING ISRAELIS&quot; which was a van load of Israeli &quot;art&quot; students who were reported by some woman during the 911 as it was happening. They were filming the Towers and were seemed very elated. They were picked up by the police. The first report said there were demolition odds and ends in the van. They were arrested and held-turned out to be mossad and were released. Second thing was the new owner of the Towers complex was a Jew who had paid some hundreds of millions for the complex and it was considered a very bad deal because the Towers were coming up on a deadline for needing asbestos removal form all buildings-was going to cost close to a billion dollars. Two weeks after buying them the new owner took out a previously absent terrorism clause on the insurance. He ended up making 4 1/2 billion dollqars. He also mentioned before the collapse of Tower 7 that due to extensive damage to tower 7 that they were going to have to PULL IT. This is an expression used in the demolition business that meant to professionally detonate it. Where did he learn that expression. Also it takes weeks of preparation to ready a building to be PULLED. This is the only way a building will go straight down in it&#39;s own footprint. So far all of this is confirmed facts. There was a big story going around that all the Jews that worked in the Towers were warned not to go to work that day and supposedly only something like 18 Jews ended up dying that day (there were supposed to be several thousands of Jews working at the Towers. There are pictures on the Internet showing several of the &quot;ART&quot; students at the Towers with huge amounts of demolition gear in the background. They had supposedly rented an entire floor at one of the Towers. There is a lot more, if you search, but it is all mostly here say. When you think about who might have a reason for having done this and then made sure that BIN Laden and the Arab Jihadists were immediately made the only suspect, how about Israel. What better way to get the USA involved in a huge war in the Mideast and utter devastation to many Arab countries. The USA destroyed more of Israels&#39; enemies than they would have ever been able to do.  I really don&#39;t know if Israel was really involved in all this shit but somebody did it and what could they gain from it?</p>
