       Putin just released a statement on Syria &amp; it seems he wrote it by putting together liberal talking points he found in comments on threads he found on the front page of this sub.  US libs now stand with Russia.  What a wild night.  How quickly the brainwashed mind can change.

       I used to be a libtard.  I also didnt use the word libtard.  The other user did.  My life is fabulous now.  Zero debt.  Make more than i need with minimal expenses.  I dont have to worry about being gassed by Assad when i wake up each day.

       You are comparing apples &amp; oranges.  When we invaded iraq we drove in on Hummers &amp; it was televised.  No boots on the ground last night.  We are not moving in &amp; staying.  At least not yet - we will see what happens.

       Probably is the key world there.  I could say that Assad was probably gassing his own people.  His family has been in charge for a long time.  Maybe it is time to let someone else run the show.  The middle east has major problems.  Do you run these countries with an iron fist(like Hussein &amp; Assad) &amp; does the world let them do whatever they want by anymeans necessary or is it ok for global leaders like us/france/uk to make targeted strikes when they go to far?  Trump said when he announced this last night that maybe we can one day work with Iran... but maybe not.  These situations do not typically have a right/wrong answer - regardless of what choice is made bad shit is going to happen.

       So am I, but I'm by no means a liberal. I'm (usually) a fan of Trump, but if you have the eyes to see, you could spot this scenario coming from miles away. I was hoping Trump was going to stand in opposition to the powers that be, but perhaps the script was written that way to divide our nation... We're all getting jerked around. The "chemical" attack in Syria was an obvious false flag, but we've taken action against them anyway. This is bad news for everyone if this is how the story continues. Predetermined outcomes will come to fruition regardless of a relative foundation, and foundations will be invented to support the structure of lies from which our assaults will be launched.
