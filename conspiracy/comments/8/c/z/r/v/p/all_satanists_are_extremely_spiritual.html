        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I didn&#39;t expect so many people to believe me at the very beginning, but I guess you cannot fool all the people all the time. I&#39;m getting many messages asking me many different things. I really didn&#39;t expect this type of response, I assumed I would be instantly called crazy and brushed off. Instead, I&#39;m getting messages connecting dots I hadn&#39;t even connected. Okay so I wanted to write this to address a question a couple people asked, and it&#39;s a good question. They wanted to know how THEY knew, I am who I am. Like I said earlier, I believe they knew I would be the one even before I was born. But there is also a physical/ethereal indication of my status.</p>

<p>You see all these satanists are extremely adept spiritually. They can not only read your energy as it currently is, but the more advanced ones can even access a hall of records that God holds. This hall of records reveals each and every souls past/current life and purpose. They access this hall through outer body experience. You basically have to strongly imagine accessing the hall of soul records. I say strongly because if it was easy, everyone would know how to do it. It takes a lot of focus and repetition to fall into a trance/dream state yet still remember your purpose and the name of the persons records you are searching. You also have to do this while ignoring all the other distractions the spiritual world likes to throw (test) at you. Now this hall, it&#39;s literally like a physical library, even looks like a library and even has a way for you to search query all the records, like you would google. This is how adept sages/shamans are able to locate recently passed relatives and/or past/future lives. This way is a more exact way, as you actually get exact words stating the persons past life and their purpose. This is one way, another way which I confirm daily myself and many other adepts see in me is your aura/chakra system.</p>

<p>People are so used their physical bodies and the physical world that they forget the stage that preceded this was actually spiritual/ethereal and in the heavens. God and his angels were light beings, they did not have edges/limitations. Therefore, your physical body is also composed of a light body which is like the motherboard of the physical body. The light body is what determines everything about you as dictated by God. It determines your level of every possible thing you can and cannot imagine. Weather you will be tall/short, moody, etc all perfectly adjusted so that you can quickly reach your ultimate destiny. This light body is like a river stream, constantly flowing around your body being powered by certain centers or wheels which spin out this river. An easy/beginniner way to spot this is to dim the lights so that they&#39;re almost completely dark but not, and gaze at a mirror while squinting/blurring your eyes as you would gazing at those 3D pictures they used to sell at the mall. Pay attention to the area 3 inches slightly above your head. Another easy way I came up with in any light environment is to use those little babyblue cloths they sell to clean your computer monitor/HDTV. Hold it stretched out behind your head so that it is the background to your whole head, and stare in the mirror 3 inches about your head. Beginners will only see a faint image of an orb while more advanced will actually be able to see the river flowing with different colors mixing together forming a shade of one color indicative of your current state. When I do this, its bright white, like a crown. You almost don&#39;t have to squint to see it it&#39;s so bright. When I first saw it, I immediately understood why they would depict Jesus and other saintly beings in photos with white halos, because that is EXACTLY how it looks.</p>

<p>So I believe they knew my messianic identity by both checking the hall of records and confirming it after my birth by scanning my physical body&#39;s aura/chakra system. There may also have been another way they knew, when dealing with satanists, you never really know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>funny thing is real satanists actually know God intimately because they are constantly victimizing non-satanists and receiving karmic blowback. So they slyly modify their ways as to avoid the Lords wrath. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. I always say people claiming &#39;satanist&#39; are those who don&#39;t believe in God. Even if that was the case, why would they want to associate themselves with the term &#39;satanist&#39; then? Why not call themselves &#39;atheist&#39;? I feel like this is just to throw people off and get more people on board of &#39;satanism&#39;. I&#39;m not even a very religious person, I&#39;m more of a skeptic, but I&#39;ve seen such a huge rise in satanism that it makes me feel more close to God, somehow. Even if He isn&#39;t real. Regardless if I believe in God or not, I certainly don&#39;t want to be associated with a group that worships the Devil or whatever. A group that has to do with rituals and sacrifices and blood and all kinds of fucked up imagery. Nah ah. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have halos and this is what you are seeing OP.  A halo is nothing more than your connection to the divine and God.  An opening.  Many old historical pieces of art and religions show/talk about the halo.</p>

<p>Everyone is born with a halo and it expands or narrows depending on who you are and your choices in life.</p>

<p>Those who lose their halo have severed their connection from God.  Most know when this happens.  Typically happens on first death.</p>

<p>Devil horns on the head is the human way of expressing divine severance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So obvious they censor the shit out of these forums. They leave just the dismissive comments and maybe 1 or 2 woke one and censor all the other woke comments. Always notice the comment number and actually count the comments to see how many are being censored. Like now its showing 16 yet I only count 11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People like yourself, who post bullshit like this are doing no favor to anyone. As you know. To prey upon those who have not grounded their convictions and are still receptive to many things is a sin that you perpetuate upon yourself and many others, now and in way into the future.
