       North and South Korea are in talks to announce a permanent end to the officially declared military conflict between the two countries, daily newspaper Munhwa Ilbo reported Tuesday, citing an unnamed South Korean official.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ahead of a summit next week between North Korean premier Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, lawmakers from the neighboring states were thought to be negotiating the details of a joint statement that could outline an end to the confrontation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kim and Moon could also discuss returning the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone separating them to its original state, the newspaper said.

       Conspiracy: North Korea was run by CIA and Trump administration kicked them out and they have reunified their country.

       SK ousted their corrupt president and elected Moon who immediately said he wanted to do talks with NK.

       Couldn't have said it better myself. Unsure how/where Trump played into it. This is something that SK and Japan should be proud of negotiating and solving this. The only reason I think we can thank Trump is that he's isolated US interests in the region, and SK/Japan don't want to work as closely with the Trump Administration, which has taken US interests off the table, perhaps making things easier to resolve between the Koreas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Q's biggest proof in the Thread Reader link is a picture taken out of a plane window, "matching" the landscape of NK - with a bunch of squiggly lines that really don't line up with the Google Maps projection of NK. I love the way Thread Reader breaks down the Q stuff, but I don't buy it. Trump needs any win he can get at the moment, and some cryptic poetry on a chan isn't the way to beat his chest. He's not some humble, heroic gentleman.

       Yeah, I remember that time because I was a bit irked by Trump not congratulating Moon on winning the SK special election. He congratulated Macron at the time because it was around the same time but in Donald's defense he was deeply involved in trying to spread propaganda on the Macron leaks to get his opponent elected.

       Wait? You clicked on the link? And it has a picture of land outside of a window? Pretty sure that was used way before during one of Qs posts about Trump going to Japan. Wait, you can't possibly mean this

       Kim is a from a Korean dynasty that has seen their country stand up to the power of the vaunted United States and rise to create atom bombs to keep Donald on twitter in the face of economic sanctions meant to cripple their economy and not allow them to trade goods on a free market.

       Because SK and Japan don't want to work with the Trump Administration and Trump hasn't taken the issue seriously outside of tweets and speeches:  he never appointed a SK ambassador, the NK Special Representative stepped down earlier this year and has no replacement, and the Japanese Ambassador's previous role was bringing major league soccer to Nashville, TN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, what Trump's done to the State Department is killing the ranks of foreign service officers to help work policy through research and skills.

       Fair enough. Here's my question: What has Trump done outside of tweet to NK? He's upheld similar sanctions that previous administrations have had against NK, and has sent no representatives to any of these dialogues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, NYT reported that Moon thanked Trump for:
       <em>
        “underscored the importance of continuing the maximum pressure campaign against North Korea,” adding that Mr. Trump “expressed his openness to holding talks between the United States and North Korea at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances.”
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       "...continuing the maximum pressure" - Continuing from when? From Obama, from Bush, from Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to my original question, what specifically, has Trump done outside of tweet?

       Obama,Bush,Clinton had nothing to do with it. Trump used new sanctions. Outside of a tweet? He had meetings about it.  Have you not followed the situation or do you only refer to tweets?

       Yep he says right in the article it's because of U.S sanctions and pressure. Which has always been there before Trump. But it's pretty clear Trump doesn't care enough about human life for Kim to hold SK hostage anymore. So why not talk it out and see what happens. U.S will have to relieve sanctions and let NK trade with at least SK.

       What peace has the State Department created?

       Incredible how the world is changing one year into Trump. Peace in Korea, a coup in Saudi Arabia by Trump allies leading to the most liberalization they've seen in their history. Syria and Palestine are next. The Mexican frontrunner is talking about cleaning up corruption, citing Trump's concerns.

       Mmkay - while I am envious of your convictions - I don't think any of that is thanks in any part to Trump.

       Also, yay Saudi Arabia (??) who's been leading a campaign destroying the poorest country in the ME.

       I'm not holding my breath on the 'changing the world' part. And I'm not a hater - just like to search for the truth. Something I think is lacking in both Trump and his lackey supporters.

       Every power/regime is built on the backs of the poor. USA, Russia, China, UK/France, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc. The important thing here is that Saudi Arabia is on the path towards social liberalization. You guys can't bitch about them and then rebuke them when they are doing what you want.

       This isn't a coincidence that all this is happening under Trump. His belligerent madman talk scared the shit out of both Koreas, as well as China and Japan. He is playing hardball and really has nothing to lose politically. Trump isn't a Republican or Democrat stooge. He does what he wants and the rest of the world knows/fear this.

       OK - Trump has turned into the biggest Republican stooge. You are clearly hypnotized. Look at his cabinet, appointments, and political stooging in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of the world fears this because they see an unstable leader in charge of the world's biggest superpower.

       And whatever defense of Saudi Arabia you are doing is ridiculous, they are not on a path towards social liberalization. You've got to be kidding me. The Crown Prince is doing some heavy PR for his country because they are basically a backwards, religious fundamentalist terrorist state.

       The people who work for Trump merely work for him. He does whatever he wants and will fire more people as he goes along who don't do what wants. That is the opposite of a stooge. Even with Syria all he gave was a token response, not an overthrow of Assad.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you mean they aren't on a path to social liberalization? Every country that has liberalized did so in steps and over time. Saudi Arabia is taking drastic steps in only a few months. Not shocking to you but shocking to the Muslim world.

       Heres how its going to play out, just a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kim will say how much he wants to disarm and reunite.... as long as the US removes a large bulk of its forces from the peninsula. NK and SK will make headway in reunification and then when Trump and the hawks refuse to remove forces Kim will say "Look we wanted peace and they wanted more war! This is a sign we will continue nuclear weapons!"
