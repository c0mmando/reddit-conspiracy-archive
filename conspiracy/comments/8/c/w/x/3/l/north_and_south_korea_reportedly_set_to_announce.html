<p>Ahead of a summit next week between North Korean premier Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, lawmakers from the neighboring states were thought to be negotiating the details of a joint statement that could outline an end to the confrontation.</p>

<p>Kim and Moon could also discuss returning the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone separating them to its original state, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>Conspiracy: North Korea was run by CIA and Trump administration kicked them out and they have reunified their country.</p>

<p>Q (the one so many call a larp) has been dropping intel and confirming this since November. I found this thread reader that explains it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t have said it better myself. Unsure how/where Trump played into it. This is something that SK and Japan should be proud of negotiating and solving this. The only reason I think we can thank Trump is that he&#39;s isolated US interests in the region, and SK/Japan don&#39;t want to work as closely with the Trump Administration, which has taken US interests off the table, perhaps making things easier to resolve between the Koreas. </p>

<p>Also, Q&#39;s biggest proof in the Thread Reader link is a picture taken out of a plane window, &quot;matching&quot; the landscape of NK - with a bunch of squiggly lines that really don&#39;t line up with the Google Maps projection of NK. I love the way Thread Reader breaks down the Q stuff, but I don&#39;t buy it. Trump needs any win he can get at the moment, and some cryptic poetry on a chan isn&#39;t the way to beat his chest. He&#39;s not some humble, heroic gentleman. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I remember that time because I was a bit irked by Trump not congratulating Moon on winning the SK special election. He congratulated Macron at the time because it was around the same time but in Donald&#39;s defense he was deeply involved in trying to spread propaganda on the Macron leaks to get his opponent elected.</p>

<p>Wait? You clicked on the link? And it has a picture of land outside of a window? Pretty sure that was used way before during one of Qs posts about Trump going to Japan.

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Here&#39;s my question: What has Trump done outside of tweet to NK? He&#39;s upheld similar sanctions that previous administrations have had against NK, and has sent no representatives to any of these dialogues. </p>

<p>Also, NYT reported that Moon thanked Trump for:
<em>“underscored the importance of continuing the maximum pressure campaign against North Korea,” adding that Mr. Trump “expressed his openness to holding talks between the United States and North Korea at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances.”</em> </p>

<p>&quot;...continuing the maximum pressure&quot; - Continuing from when? From Obama, from Bush, from Clinton? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep he says right in the article it&#39;s because of U.S sanctions and pressure. Which has always been there before Trump. But it&#39;s pretty clear Trump doesn&#39;t care enough about human life for Kim to hold SK hostage anymore. So why not talk it out and see what happens. U.S will have to relieve sanctions and let NK trade with at least SK.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a coincidence that all this is happening under Trump. His belligerent madman talk scared the shit out of both Koreas, as well as China and Japan.

<p>What do you mean they aren&#39;t on a path to social liberalization? Every country that has liberalized did so in steps and over time. Saudi Arabia is taking drastic steps in only a few months. Not shocking to you but shocking to the Muslim world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heres how its going to play out, just a theory. </p>

<p>Kim will say how much he wants to disarm and reunite.... as long as the US removes a large bulk of its forces from the peninsula. NK and SK will make headway in reunification and then when Trump and the hawks refuse to remove forces Kim will say &quot;Look we wanted peace and they wanted more war! This is a sign we will continue nuclear weapons!&quot;</p>

<p>If this come off, then we can ALL celebrate as people of the world, as we have reunited long lost families, traditions and technological possibilities by tearing down walls.</p>

<p>This will be a great day to celebrate peace. </p>

<p>Well done Koreans, now show the world what you can do technologically with both the North and South working together.</p>
