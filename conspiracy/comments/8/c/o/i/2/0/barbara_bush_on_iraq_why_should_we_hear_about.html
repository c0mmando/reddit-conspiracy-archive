<p>The fool me twice line is directly from George Bush Jr.</p>

<p>The NBC stuff could be related to the &quot;thoughts and prayers&quot; brigade out due to Barbara Bush&#39;s recent health announcements. I couldn&#39;t find direct &quot;she is the best lady&quot;, just NBC articles quoting other politicians who are telling them how much they love the Bush family.</p>

<p>The bolded text is a direct quote from a JFK speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I saw the two quotes listed above yours on the comment you responded to, thought you were asking about those quotes </p>

<p>As per OP: Diane Sawyer interview March 18, 2003 and here is the full quote:</p>

<p>&quot;I watch none. He [former President Bush] sits and listens and I read books, because I know perfectly well that, don’t take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we’re talking about the news. And he’s not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags, and deaths, and how many, what day it’s gonna happen, and how many this or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it’s, it’s not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that? And watch him suffer.&quot;</p>

<p>I get demanding a source, but literally copy and pasting the quote onto Google will take you directly there lol.</p>

<p>Sounds like a fellow conspiritard if wasn&#39;t for the rest of the trash coming out her mouth. Also sounds like she agrees with none other than President Trump on his assessment of &quot;fake news.&quot; Wonder how she feels about Trump&#39;s allegedly grabbing chicks by the pussy and fucking porn stars a decade ago.

<p>Mrs. Bush, with a polite apology to Diane, insists that she watches no television during this tense time: &quot;90% of what I hear on television is supposition … why should we hear about body bags, and death, and how many, and what day it&#39;s going to happen … it&#39;s not relevant.&quot; In keeping with this distance from a presumably overwrought media, 41 reminds himself and his wife that they have resolved, apparently without total success, to avoid interviews, particularly about the subject of Iraq.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope the Satanists have you fooled, that&#39;s the major part of their whole plan, if they can&#39;t have you outright then to control you by keeping you asleep and empty inside. Your existential pain comes from being trained by TPTB to refuse the love of your Father in Heaven. God gave you free will (that&#39;s what all this is about really), so he will let you make that choice, but God is waiting if you ever want to reach out to Him. He loves all his people, and Jesus will bring you the blessing of the Holy Spirit which will direct you in these times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depression is often caused by demonic affliction. By following the false god, the demons leave you alone and relieve you of your depression (that they were causing), because you gave up your soul to them. Christians are the top target for demons, because they seek to weaken and pull one away from their faith. But luckily for Christians, Christ gives his followers the power to exorcise demons in His name, and if your faith is strong, the demons DO eventually give up and seek easier targets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God doesn&#39;t commit those atrocities, humans (by satan&#39;s ways) do, and I think people don&#39;t often realize how much God intervenes (there is a massive spiritual war going on in the unseen realm around you all the time). The whole point of it all is Free Will. </p>

<p>God knows it sucks shit down here, but He loves you. That&#39;s why he sent Jesus, not just to save humanity but to act as your personal Savior if you choose to have a relationship with Him. Jesus makes it significantly easier to be trapped on &quot;Hell on earth&quot;, and many of Jesus&#39; great work are done in the poorest and most destitute areas of the planet. </p>

<p>My belief is that life on hearth is basically for hardening the soul. Stress testing it to determine the souls that seek to do good vs the souls that seek to do evil. There is definitely a basis to the idea that Hell might be for destroying souls entirely. The idea that at death, God separates the wheat from the chaff is strongly pronounced in the New Testament. </p>

Why is it that if we tried to say Santa is real because you can&#39;t prove that he isn&#39;t, we would get laughed off the atlas, but postulate that for your mythical eight-headed elephant skydaddy and all of a sudden that&#39;s enough evidence to say religious deities exist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a crutch and it&#39;s obvious you do not hold respect for people who hold Christian beliefs, nor do you understand what Christian faith is, born again Christians are not struggling with whether Jesus is Lord, they struggle with putting their faith into Him, because they are pulled away by Satan. Faith and Sin are exact opposites. Has nothing to do with &quot;belief&quot; as belief is a prerequisite to becoming a born again Christian but spiritual warfare. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t going to find Jesus in the material realm. You&#39;ll find evidence that he was a real person, who lived about 2000 years ago, and multiple corroborating accounts on what he did, along with other circumstantial evidence. But the real proof is spiritual and that spiritual truth is in fact found in the Bible. If you mean generic proof of God, than He is everywhere in the nonmaterial things you take for granted.</p>

<p>If you want something more logic oriented, then maybe look at gematria (basically Jewish numerology) found in the Bible. </p>

<p>Barbara Bush actually said, on March 18, 2003, on Good Morning America, &quot;Why should we hear about body bags and death? I mean, it&#39;s not relevant. So why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this on <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/barbara-bush-beautiful-mind/">Snopes</a>, so take it for what it&#39;s worth.  Of course there&#39;s very little other link to the interview (probably because this quote reflects so badly on her).  </p>

<p>The quote is taken out of context.  Mr and Mrs. Bush were asked about watching television coverage leading up to the invasion of Iraq.  The coverage at the time was largely speculative with approximate casualties and body counts, etc.  So she was saying she&#39;d rather not waste her &quot;beautiful mind&quot; speculating on body bags.  She left that to her husband who apparently watched all the news.  Still comes off rather elitist and uncaring.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty tasteless to bring all this up now as the woman is on her death bed, even if she is elitist and unfeeling it&#39;s just crass to speak ill of the (almost) dead.     </p>
