    <div class="md"><p>The dairy industry definitely lies about the need for bodies to have calcium from milk and benefits of milk in general. There was some study that said cheese activated the same addictive centers in the brain as hard drugs. While not a lie, there has definitely been a marketing ploy to make people believe protein only exists in meat. Dairy industry definitely kills the cows. The animals are not kept in hospitable living conditions like commercials like to attest.</p>

<p>So it is more just marketing and people not doing independent research than outright conspiracy.
Also all of us vegans come from the Vega system. 👽</p>

<p>Bonus: Cows only produce enough k2 in milk if they eat primarily grass(NOT grains or soy, who would have fucking thought!) and without k2 your body has a harder time using calcium correctly. So you can drink lots of processed milk and make things like osteoporosis worse. Cheeses can be better but most milk is garbage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that but allegedly it has to be fresh green grass. Apparentky the human body converts k1 to k2 mk4, so I am guessing the same happens in ruminant animals and the k2 is stored in their flesh. When they eat corn their bodies have low k2 levels...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, corn is bad for cows! k2 can and should come through in their milk.

    <div class="md"><p>True, but where do cows get the k2 from? Afaik k1 comes only from green plants, presumably exists in grasses too. Dunno if it has to be fresh. K2 series comes onky from bacteria and animals. So are cows able to produce k2 from a corn fed diet vs their natural grass diet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>long time ago  when the Annunaki kept their monkey-human-slaves in a concentration camp (nowadays called Paradise) somewhere in a land that is now called Turkey - we have been engineered away from our animal origins and now our subconscious mind is probably still conflicted about that.</p>

<p>the idea of those alien-gods called Annunaki was to turn the happy savage monkey-like animals  into slaves that would be able to grow crops and such. The Annunaki consumed loads of beer and wine so they needed a big work-force to grow all the grapes and hop and such. they also liked gold i think- but that was probably less important. imho it was all about booze and fun ...</p>

<p>i know ! hear me ou!t i´ll come to the vegan thing in a second!</p>

<p>the annunakis home-planet was in trouble somehow and some of them really needed to make a crazy way to long space-voyage to come to our nice monkey-animal-planet.</p>

<p>to cut it short now : while traveling through space the humanoid annunaki gods started to shed skin-particles that were floating around in their space-ship. due to solar radiation those skin-particles were basically fried and released a specific bacon- odor. after hundreds of years of space-travel that odor or burned skin was just like home for the astronaut-gods.</p>

<p>so when they arrived on monkey-planet they had great barbecues - i mean megalomanic gigantic barbecues where they would just plain burn whole animals with fur and claws and all that. they would not eat it- they just wanted it for the smell.</p>

<p>and we the monkeys probably kind of did not like that very much because maybe we smell specially good when roasted.</p>

<p>so yeah thats why we are conflicted internally- other than that it´s all okay to not eat meat. i mean why not ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh Boy! So, there&#39;s a lot of weird stuff having to do with vegan or near vegan diets and certain extreme outliers in human spirituality. In fact, probably the biggest major exception I can think of to what I&#39;ll start talking about would be the tibetans given that it&#39;s basically impossible for them to live where they live and not eat some quantity of meat.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ll try to just shotgun stuff out there because I don&#39;t have a cohesive narrative or theory so much as a lot of interesting odds and ends, but let&#39;s get started shall we?</p>

<p>Ok, so there&#39;s a bunch of spiritual practices that involve either abstaining from meat or abstaining from meat dairy and eggs, we have classic stuff like normal hindu and standard buddhist practices, lent for Christians and whatnot, but that&#39;s not the interesting thing. The interesting things, at least some of them, are the traditional beliefs around a lot of plant medicines, specifically ayahuasca. traditionally one is supposed to abstain from all animal products, salt, caffeine, intense flavoring products, chocolate and stuff like that for weeks prior to an ayahuasca ceremony. It&#39;s believed that having even trace amounts of that stuff in your system fucks around with the purity of the dmt fueled experience people have. DMT is a whole rabbit hole all it&#39;s own. </p>

<p>All right, so along with that, we have a traditional spiritual practice in regions of central america where a certain class of diviners known as motherfathers(they can be either men or women, but they&#39;re all known as &#39;motherfathers&#39;) will engage in a specific hyper restricted diet of only in season fruits vegetables nuts and herbs for between 60 and 270 days prior to attempting certain high intensity divination. No animal products, no grains(unsure about potatoes), no fancy spices no sex etx. Once again, it&#39;s believed that to get best results from their divinatory practices one must &#39;store up their power&#39; by eating this very specific ultra restrictive diet while also abstaining from sex and a few other things. Interestingly, they don&#39;t do it indefinitely, it&#39;s a 60-270 day deal and then after they&#39;ve finished with their magic(k)al workings they go back to standard diet. There&#39;s also a bunch of other ones like the motherfather thing, but I can&#39;t give concrete examples. Basically, all over the world you have a commonality, although not universality, of intense hardcore spiritual practices being associated with a vegan or near vegan diet that also restricts a lot of spices, stimulants and alcohol.</p>

<p>So, another example of this which is much more conspiracy themed is this bad boy. <a href="http://www.essene.com/GospelOfPeace/peace1.html">http://www.essene.com/GospelOfPeace/peace1.html</a> the authot/translator claimed he discovered a text in a secret vatican library while he was doing research back around the turn of the previous century. The vatican claims he never had access to such a text, that no such text ever existed and that his photographs of the untranslated texts are frauds and hoaxes. </p>

<p>This work purports to be a secret Essene sect text that features jesus providing detailed and explicit instructions to sick outcasts on how to heal their physical ailments. Of note, is how bizarrely detailed his instructions are and how much they overlap with rumoured practices of earlier secret/mystery traditions. Part of his recommendation  involves a specific extreme form of ritual prayer and fasting coupled with the most insane raw vegan(plus milk, honey and yoghurt) diet I&#39;ve ever seen described. It&#39;s not even fruititarian, it&#39;s just a super bizarre raw foods thing featuring sprouted wheat bread &#39;cooked&#39; in the sun and eschewing foods that have been touched by fire. Was this a hoax or fraud stemming from the natural health movement of the 19th century? Was it aurthentic? Perhaps the text is an authentic text, but it was written at a later date using Jesus as a narrative standin for another sect&#39;s philosophy. Who can say. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also weird stories about pythagoras and his cult and rumours that pythagoras&#39; cult was based on stuff he learned in egyptian mystery schools. For the record, it&#39;s said that Pythagoras and his followers would eat milk and dairy products, but no meat and no beans. I don&#39;t know about eggs. They where also alleged to have been super weird and secretive about there inner knowledge and there&#39;s all sorts of stories about them.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a passage in the koran that seems to suggest that moses may have, at one point or another eaten some sort of seasonal hyper minimalist diet similar to the motherfather or essene diet I mentioned above, but that&#39;s a connection I&#39;m speculating on, the evidence is very thin. There&#39;s also the story of daniel in the bible and his whole vegetarian diet that also eschewed any fancy foods we would think of as vegetarian. vegetarianism isn&#39;t even a jewish thing, but the daniel story creates a very clear link between restrictive dietary practices above and beyond kosher law and spiritual AND physical development within that narrative context.</p>

<p>T Here&#39;s a conspiracy theory that claims that the new testament and various buddhist scriptures where retroactively editted to make them more acceptable for meat eaters, either for the purpose of better missionary work or as part of some sinister ploy to spiritually weaken and corrupt adherents to those traditions.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of issues with modern vegan diets and how they&#39;re evangelized(they seem to work for some people but definitely not everybody and in some cases seem better as a on and off thing rather than full time), especially the more restrictive one&#39;s, but the overlap between those practices and certain extreme altered states of spiritual development is striking and hard to miss out on. When you see a pattern emerge again and again all over the world independently you wonder what exactly is going on.</p>

<p>Oh, and lest I forget, there&#39;s a bunch of tradition within chinese buddhist and taoist traditions about veganism as it relates to spiritual work and cultivating/manipulating qi. Pretty much all of the weird hermit ascetics who are claimed to be capable of superhuman feats are fueled by weird meat restricting diets. In the case of the toaists some of the stories get REALLLY out there.(Meat eating taoist and buddhist qi cultivators are a thing too, but the dominat theme definitely seems to be one of vegetarianism and a lot of masters will say outright that meat and milk inhibit development and &#39;clog up&#39; the energy systems of a novice)</p>

<p>So, we have a series of religious conspiracies. ANything having to do with qi brings in conspiracies having to do with the human bio-energetic field, electromagnetism, secret hidden sciences, the true nature of reality and on and on and on. WE have vatican coverups, the vatican which was the world leader in hunting down and exterminating the people who tended to have hardcore spiritual practices that diverged from western standard, effectively burying tons of knowledge about these dietary practices as they relate to human consciousness. I could go on and on and on.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that was coherent enough to be readable. I hope it answered some of your questions. Btw, if you where to actually seriously follow that essene gospel practice more or less as written, even without the daily gourd enema(haha), I can personally guarantee that weird shit would start happening and you&#39;d notice it happen. Of course, who has the time and energy to go off into the wilderness and fast for days or weeks on end coupled with ceremonial incantations invoking elemental forces and followed by the most bizarre diet one can find. I&#39;m just saying, fasting plus prayer actually works and boy howdy if you couple it with hardcore nature exposure and weirdo diets you&#39;ll run into &#39;something&#39; out there. (pro points for dry fasting and getting your water intake from the gourd enema[I&#39;ve dry fasted, but not with enema hydration too hardcore even for me])</p>

<p>+++ As an aside, a common criticism of vegan diets I&#39;ve seen is psychotic behaviors brought on as a result of nutritional deficiency. This may be an issue, but there&#39;s also a tremendous amount of overlap between things we call &#39;psychoses&#39; and well understood spiritual phenomena within those communities. It could very well be that the stigma around psychosis is used as a may of masking an overlapping unrelated spiritual phenomena. ie. sometimes people develop a psychosis for &#39;normal&#39; reasons and in other cases they actually are opening up their sensory abilities and connecting to other realms in which energetic spirit parasites really do work with various forces in order to feed off of humanity and siphon it&#39;s energy. Ever notice how much common psychotic narratives overlap with gnostic beliefs about parasitic archotic powers and how almost every culture&#39;s spiritual traditions believe in actual literal spiritual parasitic entities? Maybe they&#39;re not just metaphor, maybe that&#39;s what &#39;they&#39; want you to think.</p>
