        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It feels like World War III has been for nearly twenty years now just right around the corner. I simply can’t believe that all of these wars are natural occurrences; they must be staged in my mind; there’s no way we could be this stupid and irresponsible. </p>

<p>But I could be wrong, that’s an equal possibility. We all know the governments are all corrupt but maybe they are “putting on a front” with movies and news as if they have more power than they actually do. Maybe we really are facing a nuclear war or a at least a war that would make WWII look like child’s play. </p>

<p>Maybe there is some overarching conspiracy, maybe there isn’t. Either way we reach the same conclusion that <em>shit is fucked</em> </p>

<p>We must avoid this war at <em>all costs</em> </p>

<p>The outcome will undoubtably be tragic for humanity. </p>

<p>I bet at the last minute when all the nukes are fired up all 189 countries sign a U.N. on steroids pact. </p>

I may be so desensitized I dont see it but why doesnt Russian troops amassing near the Ukraine set off this fear? Or Russian troops amassing in Crimea? Why doesnt the fact US troops were found to be in Africa cause this reaction? Is there something special in Syria, something that would cause a larger scale war, that doesnt exist elsewhere? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly confident this is all planned to jack up the price of oil as well as irradiate the existing oil fields to the point where the oil is not recoverable. The US has nearly doubled oil production in the past decade, with Saudi&#39;s and Russia also both relying heavily on the price of oil. It is in all three of their best interests to play along and scare up that oil price. We will also get the planet off fossil fuels simultaneously.</p>

If Russia fires a nuclear missile at the US or vice versa the deadman&#39;s switch that has been in place since the Cold War will trigger, meaning that the receiving target&#39;s payload will launch at the other. The resulting nuclear impact will result in ecological disaster. Hordes of refugees will attempt to pour into what countries remain and, due to the current trend of nationalism, will be met with resistance. Civil wars will break out between those who believe aid should be offered and those who do not want to let anyone in. What doesn&#39;t tear itself apart will remain at the mercy of whatever significant climate impact such an event will have wrought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to say that it&#39;s pretty damn obvious that as fast as the former Soviet Union and then Russia tried to move away from any possibility of ever having to engage in a nuclear war with the US and it&#39;s western allies, they, in turn, only saw it as an opportunity to take even more steps towards having one with Russia that they believed they might have an even greater possibility of winning. The same thing is also true when it comes to China being deceptively lured into taking a more moderate posture until the day of their final reckoning comes. </p>

<p>The declared US policy of &quot;Full Spectrum Dominance&quot; is an open threat against every nation and a warning that they must live in subservience to the dictates of Washington or else see the US and it&#39;s so called &#39;allies&quot; use every means at their disposal to destabilize, wreck, or ruin them.</p>

<p>We are essentially living in the last chapter of the fall of the Roman Empire in modern dress, replete with all of the corruption, decadence, debauchery, intrigues, and public spectacles and circuses to occupy the masses while things steadily fall apart all around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s staged. There&#39;s just a pile of crap to sort through to figure out what is going on.<br/>
There&#39;s endless, very dark conspiracies, but the truth in the end tends to be a lot more boring.  </p>

<p>In this case the truth for the this political shitstorm is that we are at the precipice of world peace. (Or at least we were a year and a half ago.) The &quot;deep-state&quot; is another way of saying &#39;embedded neo-liberal power-structure&#39;. They worked with Obama to start folding all of the rogue states into the global system and started taking out the last few &quot;bogeymen&quot; that were resisting (like Ghadaffi). They couldn&#39;t quite get it all done in time before he left office but that&#39;s OK because here comes Hillary, neo-liberal sweetheart, and here we are about to embrace world-peace and the world&#39;s first female President gets to usher it in. It is a fanatical neo-liberal wet-dream to have their policies validated and virtue-signaled like this at the same time. It is difficult to over-state how important this is to them - it validates who they are as people. Along Comes Trump.<br/>
Even if you think Trump is a 4d-chess-amazing-genius, there is no possible way everything going on it just his doing. (Pre-Syria, rewind the clock a month, shit has changed.) The deep-state had a lot of things lined up to happen so that Hillary just had to walk in and declare success (less she fuck it up.) Well now Trump walked in, and start knocking over the dominoes, and now Trump is getting credit from brining the world to unity.  </p>

<p>This why Muh Russia is pushed so hard. To the deep-state it was like being on the Titanic - FULL REVERSE.<br/>
They cannot bear the thought of Trump getting credit for world peace when it could have been the first female President. And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s how petty it really is.  </p>

<p>So now Russia needs to be enemy and we need to heat up the old cold war so that we don&#39;t get peace in Trump&#39;s time. I think they found enough dirt in the Mueller investigation that they got Trump to roll.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We must avoid this war at all costs  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is non-sense. I&#39;m all about #SarinGasMyAss but &quot;avoid war at all cost&quot; is loser-mentality.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The outcome will [undoubtedly] be tragic for humanity.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just straight-up propaganda lies. Some land might be lost for use for a number of decades.<br/>
They rebuilt Hiroshima. Thousands and thousands of nuclear bombs have already been detonated.</p>
