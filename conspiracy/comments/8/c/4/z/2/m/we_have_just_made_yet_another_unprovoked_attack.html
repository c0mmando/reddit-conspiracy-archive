       Bombing hospitals is considered a war crime just like chemical weapons,  and I remember watching a video once where they did use illegal chemical weapons on Palestinians.  It wasn't in Jerusalem though.  It was white phosphorus and it was horrific. It's really, really, hard to defend Israel honestly.  The Justice minister has called publicly to kill Arab women so they will not birth snakes.  They are actively committing genocide with the full support of western nations that just attacked Syria. All of it is incredibly hypocritical.

       I don’t see us being idiots, Trump and friends didn’t need our permission to go to war, or at least attack Syria. In fact, it even appears that they don’t even give a shit anymore that so many people can see thru their lame ass false flag chemical attack. We’re not idiots, they’ve just gotten so bold that we don’t matter anymore.

       news alert:  The only way our "government" can balance the books with our true masters, the bankers, is through invading sovereign nations.

       First we start with "rebuilding loans", when they can't pay up, we start seizing assets.  This making sense yet?  They do the same thing in this country.  It's a hell of a scam.

       This is false. The majority of our debt is owed to American citizens. China is the largest source of foreign ownership of our debt but even it doesn't make up a majority of foreign debt. So Chinese entities (not the state) own the largest minority of a minority of our debt. Also there is literally nothing China could do to "call our debt". The worst case scenario is our credit rating is downgraded.

       The lockstep movement of the Western mainstream media apparatus is incredibly powerful. When everyone you see or hear or read tells you 'THIS', you're going to believe THIS -- especially when they tell you that only crazies and enemies monsters believe THAT.

       Not exactly true, the primary camp they inspected (Theresienstadt) was made to look like a model camp with no issues. The only other accounts of visiting camps all come up showing the Germans deliberately would only show the cleanest parts while refusing to show the gas chambers or crematoriums.

       What about the Nuremberg trials? Why would they admit to these things? Its makes me cringe when people say it “never” happened. It was 80 years ago. I believe the numbers/resources could have been embellished, but if you think it “never” happened, then you distract from the issues we currently face.

       The numbers can certainly be contested somewhat, but that doesn't change the fact that millions of Jews, blacks, gays, crippled, mentally handicapped, and other minorities were systematically murdered.

       You know it looks like a planned war game right? US fires on domascus russian anti air defends. They are fucking messing with everyone. If russia can defend the invasion of syria is futile? Idk, but if you do an actual attack you dont advertise to the world what when where how much. Have you seen the videos? First one was televised like it was xmas morning. This one is like one rocket. I have seen one rocket so far. It wasnt the iraq fire and hailstorm.

       Why doesn’t israel send their Jews to fight their own goddamn wars? Oh, that’s right: because they can get their goyim (cattle) to do it for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: the original meaning of goy means “of Abraham.” That’s because the “goy” are the seed of Abraham. Google “Jewish Encyclopedia Edom,” and you will see that in the Jewish Encyclopedia between the years of 1900 and 1927, it explicitly states that Jews are not the true descendants of Israel and have no such claim, it states that Jews are the descendants of the Pharisees, and it states that Jews are Edom—Yids/Yidom/Edom.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible is very clear that Yahweh literally hates Edom and that they are his enemy and the enemy of his people Israel. So what we have is antichrist imposters pretending to be the people that they hate. And it’s not hard to find any of this if only you know where to start looking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another couple leads you could start with is “Talmud quotes” and something like “Jewish quotes goyim” or something like that. A lot of the quotes you’ll find are some of the most disgustingly hateful things you’ll ever lay your eyes on. People think that people like me are the haters, but when you see what these people say by their own admission maybe you’ll start to see why people like me speak out about them. They are the most deceitful, venomous creatures in existence.

         We have just made yet another unprovoked attack on one of Israel's enemies solely for Israel's benefit. For the past year, Israel's backer's have conducted a propaganda campaign in the MSM to convince us that Russia is manipulating the US government. We are truly a nation of idiots.

       Why are people still acting like the Russian collusion is not real? Yes the oligarchy has always supported Isreal. Isreal and the US are the biggest threats to Russian expansion. Russia hacked the election and propped up a puppet leader in an attempt to destabilize the oligarchy and reduce popular support for the war. And it worked. In response to this the oligarchy had the syrian rebels they armed gas a bunch of people and then blamed it on Assad. They took advantage of trumps fragile ego by using MSM to pressure him into retaliation despite the fact that there is no proof the gas attack was launched by the Syrian government.

       That was the fairy tale a year ago. Now it has been toned down to: Russia sent surveys in Facebook and broke their rules. The truth is that the Russian Boogeyman fantasy was constructed to rationalize Hillary's loss.

       Okay but it wasn't just Russia it was Cambridge  analytica, who had Bannon and Conway on their payroll during the trumps whole campaign. At this point if you don't think Trump is a Russian shill you're in denial.

       You're saying this like it disproves what I said somehow. Yes she exposed herself and yes she probably would have won if not for that critical error. That doesn't change the fact that Trump is a Russian shill, or at the very least had a large number of Russian shills working for him and was too stupid to notice.
