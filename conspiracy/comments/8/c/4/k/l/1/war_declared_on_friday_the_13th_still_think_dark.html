        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As much as I had faith in Donnie to shake the system up, it looks like they either got him or have just manoeuvred him to be where they want him to be. The hidden hand behind the world circus are dark occultists armed with the knowledge of the ancient (or maybe not that ancient) mystery schools. </p>

<p>The super secret knowledge they&#39;ve tried to hold onto is that humans are multidimensional beings that shape reality around them by how they focus their thoughts and attention. They&#39;ve used religion, then media, to shape how the masses view and think about reality over the past years of this epoch of civilisation. It was done in the Reformation (inquisition) years by killing anyone who knew otherwise, and then in the colonial period by straight up conquering and murdering the remainer of civilisations on the globe who knew otherwise. So now we find ourselves in a world where what we think reality and the world to be is told to us by school (look up where the education system came from, who was/is behind it, and the methods they use to &#39;teach&#39; us all), then TV and the media which dictates to us all how &#39;normal&#39; people are supposed to think and act. </p>

<p>By keeping this knowledge of reality manipulation from us, and controlling the perceptions we all have about ourselves and the world around us, they (the hidden occult masters) warp the collective consciousness and shared reality experienced by humans to favour them. Because we all think that humans are savage little creatures that need to be ruled at all times, we comply with their social structures that propagate this. Thus we find our world in the state it is today. Falsely believing the lies about ourselves, cosmology and history that institutions owned and controlled by these people (religion, education, media) have told us. This way there is relatively few people who can warp reality contrary to what &#39;they&#39; want it to be and so their will is more effective. Especially because they are able to use celestial energies and symbology significant to the collective consciousness to further accomplish those means.</p>

<p><strong>Here is why not all hope is lost</strong>. All that black magic and manipulation of reality works on <em>consent</em>. If we think they have the power to do this, then our reality is affected that way to accept they can. If we fear them because of a power we believe they hold over us, they do hold that power. Whether you think that &#39;it&#39;s always been this way&#39;, or &#39;the powers that be always win&#39;, or &#39;if I say too much the Government is going to kill me&#39;. Any of those things cement the fear you have of those powers having power over you and thus you give them your consent to have that power. You shape your reality around you to have those properties. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very simple but <strong>do not fear them</strong>.  &#39;But hey what if they kill me, or send me to war, or plunge the country into a feudal ruin?&#39;. It all still boils down to the choices <em>you</em> make. You don&#39;t have to kill anyone. For war, for food, for whatever reason. Part of that knowledge hidden from us is that we aren&#39;t just billiard balls in space alive for an instant, we are immortal spiritual beings. If you die, you don&#39;t stop existing, this physical shell just dies. You&#39;ll be back. Either here or somewhere else. We don&#39;t have to give in to that fear and stain our souls with war and murder because we thought we <em>had</em> to. They might kill you. Fine. It&#39;s only this iteration of you. The spiritual damage done by participating in war and murder is far worse than staying true to yourself and your fellow man and not doing what they want you to do out of fear.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t go to war. Don&#39;t participate in the killing. Love your fellow man because he is you and you are him. Everything is energy, and energy is conscious. Don&#39;t fear these hidden masters, don&#39;t give them the consent to control you and they can&#39;t. Live a life of love and spiritual development and they can have no power over you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s why no one takes you seriously. You talk about the failures of the <strong>public school</strong> system and the big government complex, and then throw your support behind someone like Jill Stein? Who is a massive big government social justice proponent.</p>

<p>Of course, I knew your answer before you gave it. People that you that espouse this ignorant nonsense are a dime a dozen. That&#39;s right, you&#39;re not enlightened or special. None of this is enlightening or original. It&#39;s all extremely derivative and you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about if you think any of this can be fixed by electing someone like Jill Stein or Bernie Sanders, just because they talk to you nicely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is exactly that. Big government proponents ride their way on sanctimonious nonsense, and then once they have the ultimate power either they, or their successors abuse it at the levels you see now.</p>

<p>If you want to be anti-war and anti-interventionism, you need to start supporting small government, entitlement reform, shrinking of the federal machine, lower taxes, etc.. Please, for the love of god, pass it along. I&#39;m beyond sick of watching members of this generation moan on about the state of the world and then espouse political stances that are the exact cause of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The federal reserve is one of many central banks owned by the Rothschilds, from what I&#39;ve read. From what I&#39;ve read the economic system the central bank (Fed Res) is based on a debt based system. Where the country which has the central bank is in a state of never-ending debt. Therefore every dollar spent is ultimately already in debt and hence the money will never be paid back and the country is always at the whims of these wealthy elites who they are forever indebted to. And if you try to get rid of this system they will destroy everything you have (Gaddafi when he tried to introduce the Gold Dinar), or if you do not have this system they will destroy everything and rebuild it how they feel (Afghanistan, Iraq, etc). So it is bad because it is essentially based on nothing and leaves the country at the whims of the powerful elite who want nothing more than their own gain by using us the people with the real power as their cattle.</p>

<p>Also while it&#39;s true that the Roman&#39;s did associate the jewish god with saturn that&#39;s a really big leap from the jewish god actually being Saturn, right? Jehova as a concept is more descended from Mesopotamian gods like El and Marduk, there wouldn&#39;t have been much contact with the predecessor for the roman religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I studied comparative religion for close to twenty years with a primary focus in primitive earth based religion, metaphysics, and occult studies. This is my understanding (not a belief but an explanation based upon my knowledge):</p>

<p>Friday the 13th is an interesting date because of the origin of that has to do with fall of the Knight Templars. This was the day when the leaders of the Templar were executed King Philip the IV of France. </p>

<p>The numerology aspect of the number 13 is interesting as well as considering astrology. </p>

<p>Understanding what Magick is and how it is used within context is as simple as understanding energy and how to send, receive, and manipulate it. The power of prayer is a form of Magick. </p>

<p>Thinking good thoughts, manifesting reality, wishing upon a Star, and performing a ritual are all forms of Magick. </p>

<p>The human body and mind operate through bio-electrical impulses, the human body gives off an magnetic field. Everything living has energy aka an magnetic field or a bio-electric mechanism. </p>

<p>The idea behind Magick and astrology has to do with the ebb and flow of certain energies and the ability to manifest an action. If all things are tied together and yoked to a web or field of energy and you have the tools and understanding to manipulate that energy then you can control and influence your environment. This falls within the concept and idea of universal consciousness.</p>

<p>The other notion is that spiritual entities around us see and recognize occult aspects of ritual or even acts of prayer. In Christianity for example, that would be angels and demons. Demonic influence through ritual is achieved by understanding and correlating aspects of occult knowledge to signal your intent and in essence command a spiritual entity to carry out a specific task.  In the same vein of thought, again with Christianity as an example, if there is indeed a war raging in the heavens between Angels and Demons, God and Lucifer, Heaven and Earth, then there is also understanding that a timeline exist within scripture. Just as Christians have Holy days, so do those who follow the Occult. Dates and times are very important in this regard.</p>

<p>This is not an all inclusive and may not be factual information, but is rather intended to be my interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But where does the human draw it’s power from? </p>

<p>Many who have not studied the occult primarily exist within a reality where they focus on the exoteric and not on the esoteric. </p>

<p>For example: </p>

<p>When one engages within a sadomaso sexual practice, they draw ‘power’ from a real ‘place’. However, most believe it to be superficial. 
I am not saying it’s satanic. Such a childish word. More so, it is an act that can harness a specific area of ‘energy’. Somewhat similar to the ‘force’ from those Star Wars pictures. </p>

<p>You live how you wish, for life is but an expression of individuality and change. </p>

<p>When existing within the world of matter, there is more to everything then meets the eye. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, Friday the 13th is tied to dark wizards? It is made up BS. But I guess you believed in a guy who was made by the dark wizards of mainstream media reality shows, so why not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>starting WWIII on friday 13th would be sending a message/warning to the Freemasons (descendants of the Templar supposedly).</p>

<p>not sure that really jives with the reality? most of the dark shit is done based around the lunar calendars (jewish usually) and astronomical alignments</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is exactly that. Big government proponents ride their way on sanctimonious nonsense, and then once they have the ultimate power either they, or their successors abuse it at the levels you see now.</p>

<p>If you want to be anti-war and anti-interventionism, you need to start supporting small government, entitlement reform, shrinking of the federal machine, lower taxes, etc.. Please, for the love of god, pass it along. I&#39;m beyond sick of watching members of this generation moan on about the state of the world and then espouse political stances that are the exact cause of it. </p>
