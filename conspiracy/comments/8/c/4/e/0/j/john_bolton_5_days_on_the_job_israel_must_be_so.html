    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not what this is at all.  Our support of this war had been haphazard at best until the US led coalition started giving direct air support to the Kurdish led forces.  This is showboating.  It will have no effect whatsoever on Assad&#39;s progress.  If they even did hit any chemical weapons facilities, chemical weapons have not been a part of any decisive events in the war.  They even said &quot;Mission Accomplished.&quot;  It&#39;s a show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re still waiting to see, then you haven&#39;t been paying attention.  The only way the US alters the outcome of this war is with major intervention involving large numbers of air-supported troops on the ground to secure territory, not this pinprick nonsense.  Assad&#39;s forces are in the best shape they&#39;ve been since the war started, and their increasingly isolated foes are at their weakest.  Like I said, there is no way this event changes the outcome of the war.  Only major escalation can do that.</p>

<p>All of which say that Russia has Iran cannot be trusted to make sure Assad follows the rules...and that &quot;something&quot; needs to be done to assure that stability in Syria is achieved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean that you haven&#39;t been paying attention to what&#39;s been happening in the Syrian Civil War.  You can pay attention and read into to whatever nuances in language used by whoever and wherever regarding this, but what&#39;s happened by parties on the ground over the long term has had very overt results.  Trump hasn&#39;t even been President for most of it, let alone influential.  Either way, barely anything has happened, just effectively the same shit that happened last time as a result of the incident in Khan Sheikhoun this month last year.  Like I said, Trump&#39;s  nonsense is a show until escalation says otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I partially reached the conclusion because you asserted the idea that the airstrikes were a last-ditch effort to keep Assad from winning, which is insane.  When I claimed you weren&#39;t paying attention, you diverted to the idea that you were paying attention to peoples&#39; language at the UN and Trump&#39;s language regarding dealing with Syria, which is also ridiculous consider the UN won&#39;t do anything because of Russia, and Trump only says what he thinks will immediately benefit himself.  Also, if you have paid attention to the situation in Syria for any length of time, even for the last year, you&#39;d know how little we&#39;re actually involved in these areas and that our current actions are token and bullshit, and have zero possibility of changing the outcome.  Zero chance of changing anything = distraction and posturing = it&#39;s a show.  </p>
