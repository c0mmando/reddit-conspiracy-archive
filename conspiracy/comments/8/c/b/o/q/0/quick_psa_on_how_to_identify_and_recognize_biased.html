       New Rule Proposition:
      </h1>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I propose that when submitting a link, or an image graphic that in your submission statement you must state the bias of your source. Text post are optional.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ex: source Bias: Gov.

       <p>
        I believe that we should state which bias is shown in our links/images, so that we can establish facts and evidence from opinions, articles telling us what we should believe,  sensationalistic news, propaganda, and disinformation.

       How so? Can you expand on your opinion and provide more detailed explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it will help improve discussion if one can recognize bias, it will help them recognize facts from opinions, and allow them to determine their own view points. It also promote self reflective critical thinking skills.

       First off it is not the responsibility of the poster to defend the source. r/conspiracy exists to share and discuss conspiracies, this terrible rule would make whoever posts something responsible for policing the potential bias of the content.
      </p>

       Which would make everything a possible rule violation, up to the interpretation of whoever is enforcing.

       Of course it is. The poster wants me to consider and discuss what the source is saying. Therefore they should explain to me what agenda the source may have.

       It is because the things I take away from what I read/watch could be totally different from what you gather from it. It is just like how not conspiracy minded  people view the world and how we in this sub see the world. Even though we all see the same things, we have a different view point.

      <p>
       Thank you for clarifying. I am not asking the person to defend the source, no where did I state that.What I want is for them to state what bias there source presents.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are already muliptle RT news articles in new, RT is owned by the Russian Gov. and used as a propaganda machine to control it's country. Asking them to state the bias of the article is to make them think critically about what the are reading, and inform us as well. All I want is for them to state the biase/ viewpoint of the article or image. I do not care what the conspiracy is as long as it has relaible sources, one of the ways to tell that is to determine the level bias the source has. It is not the ideology, theory, or belief  that I care about, but how it is presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you mean by policing the potential bias of the content?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy is a place to share conspiracy and discussion. What I want is for  people, as the should, to think critically about the sources of their conspiracy. So we do not fall victime to false information and propaganda.

       In my opinion, I've seen nothing to suggest that implementing more rules or guidelines will improve this sub in any which way or form.  I believe the remaining community is smart enough to make up their own minds. Herding  minds into an ideology is dangerous at best, and despite our best efforts, this sub will not show signs of improvement anytime soon.

       That is clearly not the case. As you can see they is still a lot of people who do not have the skills to think critically about the stuff they are reading. Thus fall victim to propaganda, and disinformation.

       No shit of course it is dangerous. I am not suggesting we heard like minded people together, I am asking for them to 5hink critically about their article and tell us what it's viewpoint/bias is.

       I am aware that the are bias news sources. The list is for sources known for spreading disinformation, sensationalist news, propaganda etc. That tell you what to think, and who to blame.  At the moment there is a huge push to spread misinformation, false accusations, and distraction news. From the Syria Air Strike. I listed the ones I believe are the most susceptible to the stuff I listed above. Feel free to provide me with more left leaning bias sources that are prone to those characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those two news organizations do hold left leaning bias but do not let it affect how they report the news. For example New York Times piece on Harvey Weinstein. That is actual reporting. Many of the  news reporters belgoning to those news organizations have gotten killed from actually going out to get evidence for their reports.

       I do not claim this to mine.  I am claim it to be ours. It is a community and communities work together. "Your" is a possessive descriptor(i.e that is
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       bike.), thus this is your sub as much as it is mine. This is not about me but us, thus I unconsciously did not use I personal possesives (like mine).

       I stated it in the disclaimer, on why I made this post, but I am happy to expand on it. My bias in posting this is that I am fucking fed up with the half-ass bullshit source being useed. The ones that clearly have a strong bias, and is used to spread disinformation and lies. Posts like Q and shit that are not based on reason, or actual logic. That abuse people who lack the reasoning skills to self reflect critically, that are prone to paranoia and delusions. News that has caused people to be so far removed from reality. My goal is that this will force people to think critically about what they are reading.
