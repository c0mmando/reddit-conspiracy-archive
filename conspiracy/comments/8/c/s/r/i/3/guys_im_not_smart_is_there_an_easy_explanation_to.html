    <div class="md"><p>If you like to speculate then the fact that Cohen&#39;s specialty is paying off women who had sex with rich white men then you might surmise that Hannity may be in that club. Which would probably cause many 60+ year old women&#39;s heads to explode.  </p>

<p>The other issue is that since these buffoons all smoke each others cigars together they probably coordinate their spin efforts to discredit their rivals through Hannity&#39;s radio and entertainment show. Which is slimy and shitty but what can you do Hannity is a known right wing propaganda shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just saw this <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8cq5o1/michael_cohen_represented_sean_hannity_lawyers/dxhguy4/">summary</a>from <a href="/u/CarlosSafeSpace">/u/CarlosSafeSpace</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In sequence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump&#39;s lawyer, Michael Cohen, was the target of FBI raids last week. They went through his offices, his home, his hotel room (where he&#39;d been staying recently), his safe deposit boxes, and his devices.</p>

<p>Some of the things seized in these raids are apparently recordings of Cohen speaking with many, many people about things that may be illegal.</p>

<p>Cohen and Trump, with whatever vague association, have argued that these seizures of evidence violate attorney-client privilege.</p>

<p>The FBI and the DOJ have argued contrarily that documents involving attorneys and their clients discussing or co-operating in the commission of a crime do not have that privilege -- which they unambiguously don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Still, the FBI/DOJ are determined to have these documents looked over by what&#39;s called a &quot;taint team&quot; -- a team of lawyers who will examine the recovered materials, and who are still bound by the same sort of privilege as that claimed by the parties at hand. The point of this team is for it to determine if these documents demonstrate criminality; if they don&#39;t, they are bound by oath and law to remain silent about their contents, and can be trusted to do so.</p>

<p>Cohen and his team filed a temporary restraining order to prevent the FBI/DOJ from going through the evidence collected, claiming that it would impact multiple clients of Cohen&#39;s and that he and his team needed to go over the documents to determine which was which.</p>

<p>The judge asked him to name these clients in support of this claim.</p>

<p>Cohen refused, inviting a finding of contempt. He insisted that one such client had ordered that his cliency should never be revealed, under any circumstance, and so he was bound by this.</p>

<p>The judge told him to fuck off.</p>

<p>Cohen then revealed that the third client (after Trump himself and RNC finance official Elliott Broidy) was apparently Fox News personality Sean Hannity.</p>

<p>We know nothing official yet about what legal services Cohen provided to Hannity, but it has certainly invited a gigantic response. Hannity, for his own part, has insisted throughout this afternoon and evening that he he was a friend of Cohen&#39;s who would sometimes ask him for a legal perspective on stuff he was thinking about, but who never paid him for legal advice or representation and who did not consider him to be Hannity&#39;s lawyer in any sense. Still, he also claimed that these discussions were bound by attorney-client privilege, so one might wish for him to choose one or the other.</p>

<p>The current state of affairs is that the temporary restraining order has been denied, but also that the judge has ordered that copies of all evidentiary documents be made available to both Cohen&#39;s team and to the FBI/DOJ so that both parties can work out their respective claims for privilege. We now wait on their determinations.</p>

<p>This is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Do you literally go into every conspiracy theory thread and call them &quot;speculative&quot; and say people are &quot;reaching&quot; or only ones where conservatives are targeted?</p>

<p>I know. I know. You aren&#39;t a conservative. Sure. How people can pretend the only time on this sub when you see people quick trying to downplay a conspiracy it&#39;s when it&#39;s against Trump and conservatives. It&#39;s astounding.</p>
