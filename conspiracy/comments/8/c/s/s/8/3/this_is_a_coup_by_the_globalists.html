       Is no one talking about this? These rapid fires against Trump, the coerced Syria strike to upset his own supporters, the sudden change of heart on TPP.. the neoliberals are staging a coup of this country
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not saying Trumps not dirty. Of course he is. But so are all politicians. The difference is TPTB have decided Trump is not conductive to their goals and are now in the process of removing him from office. And replacing him with ANYONE more sympathetic to the globalists is frightening indeed.

       Exactly. Tulsi Gabbard is good too, but that is impossible as well. We will end up with some Obama 2.0, one thing that can be certain, they will be a COMPLETE STOOGE for the Globalists. No more wrenches being thrown.

       The deep state coup was originally presented as a counter-coup:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Clintons have been involved in co-opting our White House, our Judiciary, our CIA, our Federal Bureau of Investigation, our Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and our Director of the FBI James Comey for some time now. What they’ve done is make sure that they were part and parcel of a group of people who were interrelated through political cronyism.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, in order to stop this coup, we in the intelligence community and others involved have informally gotten together and with their permission I am beginning to announce that we initiated a counter-coup through Julian Assange and WikiLeaks …
       </p>
       <p>
        We decided that there was something that we had to do in order to save the republic. So we initiated a counter-coup through Julian Assange who’s been very brave and really quite formidable in his ability to come forth and provide all the necessary emails that we gave to him in order to undermine Hillary and Bill Clinton… I am just a small part of something far bigger than myself…
       </p>

       This guy literally admits that he is trying to steal the election for Donald Trump, but he fabricates a story about how it's really a "counter-coup." This is so transparent.

       I voted for the first black president and I think you are implying that he did nothing to stop the wars and surveillance of US citizens while running on a platform that was supposed to reverse much of the government overreach seen during the Bush years.

       No I voted because the alternative of McCain and Palin would have been worse. I was a long time AZ resident and I had some respect for McCain but I lost it all after he gave in to the RNC platform. Bush was a horrible president who destroyed personal freedoms and set the stage for all the shit that we are living with right now and McCain would have done more of the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       In retrospect Obama did not do anything to really right the ship and that's all on him but the republican congress really put the brakes on him after 2 years. He was completely ineffective and gave in to compromises that were not good at all.

       Of course. But you still have to choose one or the other. I absolutely hate the fact our choices are billionaire crook one versus crook 2 or stooge 1 verses stooge 2 but you have to make a choice that you believe will have even the slightest alignment with your desires.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real issues are definitely being ignored. Corporations are running away with all our personal freedoms and the government is enabling them. I don’t think it’s coincidence that the last two presidents campaigned specifically to buck that trend and in both cases they failed miserably.

       I see you as much more  of a drone.  A drone to the fact-less and proof-less world of mediocre conspiracy theories.  It's quite a drug to young people thinking they have the inside information or know stuff that others don't.  And meanwhile the boring truth is conspiracies aren't that sexy or numerous and voting does work and most people in government are good and we have all fallen for the 'outsiders' shtick before.

       If you're partisan and cannot break past the paradigm that both "sides" aren't different and do not work together to fuck us all without consent in the ass, then yes... you are nothing but a drone. Drones only do and say what they are taught/told to say.

       See, there's one of those secret truths you believe that are false.  If you are interested in nuance and details, the system in the USA may suck but it does work and an individual vote does count if nothing than at the local level.

       You have a broken world view. The real conflict line is between the 36 primal lodges with some politicians who are even in several with conflicting agendas. They plan and execute the world wide events.
      </p>
      <p>
       There you find all the key players, world wide. From Rothschild, Bush, Kennedy, Putin, Merkel, Kissinger, Brzezinski.....bankers, politicians, university professors(S. HP. Huntington rings a bell, I assume?), church figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could read Italian to fully grasp "Massoni. Societa a responsibility illimitata. La scoperta delle Ur-Lodges" by Gioele Magaldi, grand master of the masonry lodge "Grande Oriente d'Italia Democratic" and Laura Maragnani talking with high level masonry cover identities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of these identities in the book were uncovered since the release like Brzezinski.
      </p>
      <p>
       It contains informations about Robert Kennedy's assassination, attack on Reagan and the Pope in relation to Masonry I'm sure most have never ever heard before.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the book these primal lodges control "para" lodges like the Bilderbergs, Bohemian, Fabien, Pilgrim, Round Table, Tavistock....
      </p>
      <p>
       And these organisations pretty much control our parties.

       Why don't you look into the book first before you get defensive about this. This isn't just about the "rich". This is about intellectual/"spiritual"/power elitism, not just random oligarchs with too much money.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are preciously few informations about that book in other languages than Italian but what's there is dynamite enough if you realise who worked on that book. This isn't just some random conspiracy writer.

       I also think it's funny that people assume I'm some trump supporter. I didn't vote for him and was a supporter of Bernie Sanders. I supported the fact that Trump would occasionally throw wrenches into the globalist machinery, and that he wasn't pure rotten evil as Hillary is. And now that has been taken from, which is not good for any of the people against the globalist agenda. I alao think Trump was a genuine nationalist and cared about trying to make our country strong. Opposing TPP, Natalie, and pro tariffs were Bernie platforms too and Trump was following through on them. But that's all gone now, Trump is compromised and will either be a stooge or resign soon enough.

       Nothing about Trump was genuine that’s what a conman narcissist does - he believes he is the smartest most able person in the room and will say and do anything to prove it to whomever is willing to listen to him. He lies for karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       His whole life was a desperate plea to be one of the global elite. The financial world shunned him due to business incompetence in the 80s and 90s, Hollywood told him to fuck off over and over, so he ran to foreign money for support and capitalized on the stupid to become a reality brand. That was probably his most brilliant con ever until the current shit show that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump isn’t compromised by the globalists he is just a globalist charlatan doing his best to destroy the county because he is mad the elite think he is a douche.

       Why do Trump supporters still perform mental gymnastics for the retard-in-chief?  It's getting fucking ridiculous.  The man is and always has been a total sham, and it was painfully obvious to me that he was going to screw over you conservative types, just like your leaders always do.  Conservative politicians thrive on the ignorance of their supporters, it's been that way since conservatism was a political thing.

       You act like ignorance is exclusive to conservatism. The left has fallen hook, line and sinker for Marxism and all of the bullshit that entails. Nobody has any room to talk.

       I never said liberals or socialists are immune to ignorance.  What is true is that conservatives are, as a rule, dupes or liars.  The whole point of conservatism is to elevate the fucking aristocracy and bring back monarchism.  It's a shit ideology and conservative leaders don't even try to hide how they're fucking their supporters (and everyone who isn't rich or noble) in the ass.  In any decent word, conservatism would be laughed out of the public sphere, and the fight would be between liberals and socialists.  (Actual socialists, not whatever moronic definition of socialism Americans have been brainwashed to accept.)

       Literally replace every reference to conservatives with liberals and nothing changes. The liberals and the socialists (which are pretty much the same damn thing here now) are the ones advocating to fuck us in the ass by repealing the 2A, opening our borders so every state can turn into the unequal shithole they've turned California into and dumbing down our education system with common core. The fact is every single serious political ideology has been coopted to serve the movement towards a global government. Liberalism and the modern left as a whole are a cancer destroying the West from the inside and it's going to get violent before it's over.

       You clearly have no perspective on what words actually mean.  Propaganda has done its work keeping people blind, by convincing people to insist on their own facts rather than any meaningful definition of words.
      </p>
      <p>
       What use is holding on to a gun when you're too blind to even know what is what, and can be coaxed to point your gun towards the people who are trying to save your ass, by the people who are clearly manipulating you?

       You didn't pay attention to the shitshow that was the Democratic Party in 2016, and the backlash from lefties against the Clintons?  Read a goddamn book, I'm not going to try and negotiate with someone who is gorging on a diet on conservitard media.

       I do read. That's how I can see the parallels between current mainstream leftist ideology and not just the fall of other major civilizations in history but the rise of authoritarian governments within the last century.
