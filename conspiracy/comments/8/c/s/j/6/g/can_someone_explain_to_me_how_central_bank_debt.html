    <div class="md"><p>Zapruder film, for starters, but your question is very worthwhile. They partly accomplish this by pushing &amp; pulling people into power who are already corruptible and, largely, self-serving idiots. &quot;Decision makers&quot; also indoctrinated early through Skull-n-Bones, through families who are already in politics/banking/entertainment, etc.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s blackmail, threats, financial rewards, promises of power and influence; it they want to be in leadership, they have to play that game, and there are pix of them on scopolamine with naked teenagers and shit like that. The ones who try to stay in the game and remain honest end up like Paul Wellstone.</p>

<p>The threats and stakes are also global, which is why we let a small mid-east nation do what it wants, and what it wants us to do. The founders of that country own our money supply, and the money supply is at the root of what will keep an American politician in line with whatever necessary agenda. I don&#39;t know what, exactly, Trump was told about Syria after he suggested we GTFO, but it probably involved not only threats to his family, but possibly threats of real attacks against the U.S. and/or U.S. soldiers and citizens abroad. Israel and its military and intelligence are capable of ghastly things that would hit us hard and ruin him as a president.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone on too long, and not hit everything, but I hope others join in. Great question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A sovereign state that openly defaults on its debt obligations will find it very difficult to borrow in the future--if financing is extended at all, it is likely to be done at high rates, and under onerous terms.</p>

<p>To the extent the state owns property outside its own borders, it risks seizure by creditors, as with any debtor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that. What is to stop a nation then issuing a new currency based on something such as gold reserves. So long as they have an economy which has demand for its exports they should be relatively fine. The idea they have to keep &#39;borrowing&#39; from this institution is what I don&#39;t see as necessary. It&#39;s like getting money from a loan-shark. If you really want to solve your problems you don&#39;t pay them back. In the personal world the loan shark breaks your legs. In the state realm the loan shark doesn&#39;t have an army. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in the 19th century you actually would see other sovereigns use force to protect bondholders at risk of taking losses in a sovereign default--the most famous case being England&#39;s war against Egypt. </p>

<p>But, in the modern era, that hasn&#39;t occurred, so a state would be relatively free to pursue the course you outline (and it doesn&#39;t even need to issue a new currency)--<strong>if</strong> it has a strong enough export sector to enable it to pay for necessary imports without inflows of foreign capital.</p>

<p>I think a common issue is that if your economy is doing so poorly that you are considering a default, the odds of you having a favorable balance of trade is low. And the economy is so specialized now that autarky is very difficult.</p>

<p>But all that said, sovereigns do still default. Typically their borrowing costs go up, but they can still somewhat function; commonly, compromise deals are worked out in which the sovereign agrees to pay a portion of the defaulted debt, and the creditors agree not to totally ostracize the country.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I have $1000, I put that in a bank, the bank will loan out that $900 and they&#39;ll keep 10% of it for a reserve so they&#39;ve kept $100 and given out $900, so now if he checks his balance it&#39;s $900 and he can take the entire money out at every time and if I check my balance it&#39;s $1000 and I can take it out at anytime. They problem comes in when everyone wants to withdraw money at the same time, if that happens the entire banking system would collapse because there is more money than what is actually in notes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all, you have a few misconceptions. What you probably want to ask about is <em>sovereign debt</em>, debt that is owed by governments. Many people on this sub think that all or most sovereign debt is owed to central banks. This is not the case.</p>

<p>The United States federal government, for example, borrows money by auctioning United States Treasury bonds. Anybody can buy them, and many people and institutions do. <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124">Here&#39;s an article that explains who owns United States debt.</a> Note that the Federal Reserve only owns about 13% of the federal debt.</p>

<p>So, why does the United States not default on its debt? The first and most important reason that the U.S. and other governments don&#39;t default on their debt is because they will want to borrow again. If you default, you will either not be able to borrow at all, or you will have to pay high interest rates.</p>

<p>If the United States defaulted on its debt, it would also anger many voters, such as Social Security recipients, since the Social Security Trust Fund is the biggest owner of Treasury bonds and uses them to pay social security.</p>

<p>It would also anger many rich people in the U.S. who own Treasury bonds. Rich people often have great influence over elections, by campaign contributions and other means, so politicians don&#39;t like to anger them.</p>

<p>The U.S. has a particular reason not to default, since that would end the dollar&#39;s position as the world&#39;s reserve currency, which gives it advantages in world trade and finance, in addition to helping secure the extra low interest rate that the U.S. enjoys.</p>

<p>Note that countries have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_debt_crises">often defaulted on their debt</a>, in whole or in part, over the centuries.</p>

<p>Creditors in other countries (who are often governments themselves) can try to collect the debt in many ways, including using courts to seize assets the defaulting country owns in other countries, or by using (or threatening to use) tariffs or even military action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The title of that video is a lie.</p>

<p>This started with Alan Grayson asking questions of Federal Reserve Inspector General Elizabeth Coleman back in May, 2009. He uploaded a video to his YouTube account titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXlxBeAvsB8">&quot;Is Anyone Minding the Store at the Federal Reserve?&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>More than a year later, people started re-uploading the video with false titles, such as &quot;9 TRILLION Dollars Missing from Federal Reserve!&quot;  and &quot;Federal Reserve Bank admits they lost 9 Trillion Dollars!&quot;</p>

<p>In the video, Grayson asks Coleman, &quot;What have you done to investigate the off-balance sheet transactions conducted by the Federal Reserve, which according to Bloomberg now total $9 trillion in the last eight months.&quot; Look up what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-balance-sheet">&quot;off-balance-sheet&quot;</a> means. It does not mean &quot;missing&quot; <em>or</em> &quot;lost&quot;.</p>

<p>Grayson was wrong about <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120302072325/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&amp;amp;sid=aGq2B3XeGKok">what the Bloomberg article said.</a> It wasn&#39;t just about the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>The $9.7 trillion dollar figure was the total from adding together all the <em>potential</em> maximum liability of all the bailout progams of the government—including tax cuts, Bush&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Asset_Relief_Program">TARP</a> and Obama&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009">ARRA stimulus plan</a>—plus the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The actual amount spent or lent was much less.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120318154419/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;amp;sid=a7484bxHz7Bk">Here are detailed figures from Bloomberg from later that year (December 2009), months after the hearing.</a> Note the distinction between &quot;program limit&quot; and &quot;amounts outstanding.&quot;</p>

<p>Grayson asks Coleman about things that aren&#39;t her job: &quot;My question specifically is do you know who received that $1 trillion-plus that the Fed extended and put on its balance sheet since last September. Do you know the identity of the recipients?&quot;</p>

<p>He then asks a loaded question that presupposes something false: &quot;Have you conducted any investigation or auditing of the losses that the Federal Reserve has experienced on its lending since last September?&quot;</p>

<p>Coleman is understandably confused since there had been no losses up until that time ... and there never were losses from the Fed&#39;s emergency lending programs.</p>

<p><em>None</em> of the emergency loan programs from the Federal Reserve lost money. All of the loans <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NI4WF.png">were repaid years ago</a> (that&#39;s figure 11 from the GAO report <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d11696.pdf">11-696: <em>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM: Opportunities Exist to Strengthen Policies and Processes for Managing Emergency Assistance</em></a>). The peak amount lent out at any one time was about $1.1 trillion. The Fed made a profit from them, almost all of which was paid to the United States Treasury. The Federal Reserve paid the US government $47 billion in 2009, $79 billion in 2010, and $75 billion in 2011.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of time they lend money to governments for their expenditures and are payed back with the tax revenue, and governments run such deficit that they cannot afford to not borrow the money, therefore the banks have them by the balls, look up the the story of when the banks took over New York and basically scale up that idea to the whole world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that. What is to stop a nation then issuing a new currency based on something such as gold reserves. So long as they have an economy which has demand for its exports they should be relatively fine. The idea they have to keep &#39;borrowing&#39; from this institution is what I don&#39;t see as necessary. It&#39;s like getting money from a loan-shark. If you really want to solve your problems you don&#39;t pay them back. In the personal world the loan shark breaks your legs. In the state realm the loan shark doesn&#39;t have an army. </p>
