I collected these images from various websites/videos and did my best to pick out the most interesting(lmore than just rocks which is what I usually found lol) ones for you all to investigate in an easy to view/share format. I tried to verify these images, however, if there is a known hoax image that slipped into the mix then please let me know so I can remove it from the collection. Forgive me for not having all the sources as it proved to be somewhat of a pain in the ass, plus I just wanted to get this out for everyone quickly. The information/source should be out there though if interested, and if you can&#39;t find it then i&#39;ll do my best to help look or remove the image in question if not creditable enough. Feel free to suggest other images too! I&#39;ll also include the images from the last drop for anyone who was not able to view them at the time, thanks!</p>

<p>Also i&#39;d like to shout out to SiriusDogon here on the forum for allowing me to use some of my favorite images from his collection he linked me in my last post. If you&#39;re still interested in more anomalies then i&#39;d highly recommend checking out his vast collection for even more interesting images!</p>

<p>Yeah I noticed several NASA pics of moon and Mars &quot;missions&quot;. Those are all fakes. Moon missions can be debunked very easily, it&#39;s about as easy as debunking the official 9/11 narrative. Flag waving, astronauts hanging from wires, intersecting shadows, no blast crater under LEM, bubbles in space, the impossibility of getting through the supposed Van Allen Belts without dying (as the LEM has 0 shielding), the fact that they gave a Dutch minister petrified wood and passed it off as a moon rock, and so much more. I could write a whole essay on it.</p>

<p>The fact that they lost their best 3 pieces of evidence should be enough to show something is up - they lost the original footage, all telemetry data, and astronot Don Pettit now claims they even lost the original technology needed to get to the moon. Also, here&#39;s a quote from Bill Clinton&#39;s book <em>My Life</em>, where he talks about a carpenter he worked for in his younger years:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just a month before, Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left their colleague, Michael Collins, aboard spaceship Columbia and walked on the moon, beating by five months President Kennedy&#39;s goal of putting a man on the moon before the decade was out. The old carpenter asked me if I really believed it happened.  I said sure, I saw it on television. He disagreed; he said that he didn&#39;t believe it for a minute, that &quot;them television fellers&quot; could make things look real that weren&#39;t. Back then, I thought he was a crank. During my eight years in Washington, I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if he wasn&#39;t ahead of his time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t have to bring it back, it&#39;s one tenth the weight, and doesn&#39;t need oxygen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was aware that that might cause some controversy among this community, however I felt that it doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that the pictures are true as I have seen many of them before. I just found that he had them organized in an easy to pull from manner, but if you are aware of some of them that he has indeed doctored then please let me know. I can also remove all of his and find separate sources for as many as I can if you think that would be more optimal. It&#39;ll just take some time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the pics with arrows point out &#39;anomalies&#39; are easily identified. One of them points to the command module orbiting the moon prior to or during the docking. Others are just wild imaginations of moon bases. Knowing the state of technology and science advancements, supporting a moon base would be near impossible to keep staffed and supplied and in operation safely but more importantly, <em>secretly</em>.</p>

<p>If alien tech is involved then it doesn&#39;t matter anyway, we wouldn&#39;t ever know it since they wouldn&#39;t be using modern human tech such as rockets, combustible fuels and normal metalurgy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official explanation of the long trail is that it was part of the hillside previously and had broken off and slid down the slope. </p>

<p>However, it seems quite large compared to anything else in frame. If you look at the shadows you&#39;ll notice it is made up of vertical, jagged peaks with the tallest one facing it&#39;s direction of movement. Also, there&#39;s barely any surrounding debris if it did break off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course! I&#39;m really glad that you enjoyed them! And i&#39;ll try to find time to come up with another one soon, just busy with work and school ya know. If you&#39;re specifically asking for more Antarctica anomalies then i&#39;m afraid were a bit sol cause thats about all there is. I could do one about all the whited/blurred out areas but that could easily be dismissed as just glitches for imaging errors... Thanks again though!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, these are great. My own personal break down :</p>

<p>Moon anomalies </p>

<p>Hoax, too fuzzy and easily debunk-able. IF there was anything on the moon, we would have discussed it in more detail by now. There would be more rumours or &#39;leaked docs&#39; showing things in more detail.</p>

<p>Mars anomalies </p>

<p>Seriously? Fucking scary. Some of those pictures make me feel dread in a deep deep part of my soul. I can&#39;t explain it. It just makes me feel...wrong. One or two of those pictures could be hand waved away as fuzzy interpretations. Some of the pictures though, Jesus Christ. I believe 2020 will be a crazy year to be alive (six nations are planning to launch Mars Missions).</p>

<p>Shower though and shamalalamalamalaman twist :</p>

<p>What if we didn&#39;t come from Mars, but we have previously been to Mars?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I could find, they seem to be legit images from the rovers and various orbiters. A lot of the images show sources or coordinates on them but I couldn&#39;t find them for all the others. I&#39;ve also seen many of the images repediatly on other sources like msm/alternative news, but I know that doesn&#39;t count as completely creditable. There are just so many out there so I really just wanted get some out and get peoples interest into researching further. Thanks for the comment!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Due to the vast skepticism and questionable verifiability towards any or all the watermarked &quot;Secureteam10&quot; images, I successfully removed all them from the collection. I knew I was taking a risk by adding them, however, I felt that his affiliation did not take away from the images in question. I was hoping that you all could see past his agenda, whatever it my be, and view the images for what they are. I&#39;m not trying to defend him here but I did find he usually has sources and img numbers to back up most of the images he posts. I&#39;ll do my best to go back and find different sources so there is no more confusion, thanks </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re saying <a href="https://youtu.be/1bbPzX-dfV4">the 4th guy on the moon</a> is wrong? Maybe you should write to NASA and let them know they made a mistake! Lol.</p>

<p>Regardless of when they claim to have discovered the Belts, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that there are a million inconsistencies and the bogus landing is easier to debunk than the official 9/11 narrative. Like I said, it just takes a critical thinker to question their own beliefs to be able to see it. We all believed it at one point or another.</p>
