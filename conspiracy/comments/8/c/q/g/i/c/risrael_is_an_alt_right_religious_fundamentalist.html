I&#39;ve noticed a lot of hate and prejudice in their sub. People keep talking about removing this from reddit and that r/conspiracy is a hate breading ground, but Israel is way worse. I&#39;ve seen people call blacks the Hebrew word for nig###. I&#39;ve seen them call Palestinians pigs cockroaches infestations and so on. They talk about gays should die as its a sin. They laugh at soldiers killing children. They call Americans slaves and other things. It is just as bad as t_d for racist nationalism. For some reason its ok for them but not ok for the alt right t_d users. They even say disabled people are being punished by god. </p>

<p>The conspiracy is with reddits admins to squash religious funfdamentalists in America while giving the ones from Israel a safe place and promote it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the Abrahamic religions it certainly is. In Christianity there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;chosen people&quot; you aren&#39;t special because of your belief or the colour of your skin, the same with Islam. There&#39;s no such thing as chosen people in either Christianity or Islam, these religions aren&#39;t ethnicity based religions. Whether Christians or Muslims treat people differently is strictly irrelevant, that&#39;s something that is not based on scripture or if it is, it&#39;s based on very shoddy scripture which most scholars would reject. Jews believe in religion through your ethnicity, not through your beliefs. Many Jews believe that if you have descended from Israel who was a person I believe he changed his name from Yacob, then you are a true jew and that is one of the main reasons why they don&#39;t see Ethiopian Jews as being real Jews. People will often say it&#39;s anti semitic to criticise Judaism and Jews, it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a perfectly valid criticism of Judaism and how Jews believe in ethno supremacy. It&#39;s absolutely despicable. The idea of God choosing you as a group of people based on your lineage is so incredibly dangerous, people underestimate just how dangerous it is. You can literally get away with murder because you&#39;re the chosen people, you can kick people off your land, why? Because you&#39;re a chosen group of people. Judaism is unique in being ethno religious in the Abrahamic faiths, Hinduism has its own issues with caste and other religions have their own issues.</p>

In Islam which is very similar to Judaism in many ways doesn&#39;t have an idea of chosen people and it&#39;s largely believed that it&#39;s a fabrication, especially considering what God&#39;s supposed chosen people did throughout the old testament. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Islam doesn&#39;t believe they are the real Jews. Islam recognises that Jews come from a different person and Muslims come from a different person. Muhammad descended from Ishmael, the first son of Abraham whereas Jews descended from Isaac who is the second son of Abraham. In Genesis 17:20, it mentions that through Ishmael a great nation would be made however Muslims don&#39;t believe in that, it just so happens to be in the old testament. </p>

<p>The only verse that makes Muslims special from the old testament is Genesis 17:20 &quot;And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.&quot; </p>

<p>However Muslims do not believe in this. Muslims do not rely on the old testament or the new regarding their religion. Muslims believe that these books have been corrupted and therefore they cannot be relied upon. There are some scholars who say you can believe in the old testament and new as long as it doesn&#39;t contradict Islam however this is not something that authentic Islamic scripture mentions. You are right about what Christians do however Muslims see the old and new testament as being corrupt and they do not rely on them. They have in the past, especially with the curse of ham but nowadays not so much. </p>

Muslims do not believe in having rights to Israel/Palestine because the covenant was made through Ishmael. In fact, this simply isn&#39;t even an issue in mainstream Islam. No Muslim actually cares about who the covenant was through or who was meant to be sacrificed but what is clear is that arabs at the time of Muhammed believed they came from Ishmael, Muhammed himself came from a tribe which was believed to have come from Ishmael. There is nothing significant about that per se, the Quran does not mention anything about the fact that Ishmael would be blessed with a nation and nor does the Quran mention anything about Muhammed&#39;s lineage. The idea of Ishmael which would 1) Be monotheistic, 2) have its own laws 3) have a direct connection with God comes from the old testament. Muslims don&#39;t even know about the covenant between God and Ishmael of the old testament because it&#39;s not in Islam, Muslims believe that Ishmael was about to be sacrificed but God saved him and the significance of that was it showed obeidance to God and Hajj is done to commemorate that. Jews believe the sacrifice of Isaac establishes a covenant, Muslims don&#39;t believe that the attempted sacrifice of Isaac establishes a covenant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in christianity the israelites were the chosen people too. So thats where youre wrong. Starting right off the bat with your comment here. You should try actually opening a bible and reading it not just parroting what you see others saying.</p>

<p>Its also been warped. In the bible it specifies they were chosen as examples of morality. That was thousands of years ago when they actually had morals </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I said was in Christianity there&#39;s no such thing as chosen people as in you can be Christian based solely on your faith, you don&#39;t have to come from a certain lineage to be considered a true Christian which is however quite odd, especially considering the fact that Jesus himself mentions many times that he has come for the lost sheep of Israel alone but from what is understood as Christianity and from Matthew 19:28 I believe, Jesus mentions that make everyone a Christian, I am paraphrasing by the way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No... &quot;chosen&quot; refers to that Jews were chosen to carry the weight of commitment to god, because Jews were the more stubborn and &quot;stiff necked&quot; people. Also in the Talmud it does not say Jews will rule, it says when they are united and godly, that other people will want to emulate them. It&#39;s not a master-slave relationship.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good day sirs, I respectfully submit the opinion of myself that I have frequented r/Israel and have not seen the hate on all those subjects that this this post attested to.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly,  statistics would show there be a dick or a few in every sub, however to say it’s an “alt right religious fundamentalist racist haven” would be a persons opinion, and in fact I would strongly disagree with this statement.</p>

<p>Don’t need to go into how Israel is the only democracy over there, the rights of an Arab in Israel versus a Jew in practically every other Arab or Persian country, that deflects. The Gaza Strip is a fucked up situation, no Israeli would disagree.</p>

<p>This conspiracy sub itself tends to have characters that espouse anti israel/Jew threads about once a week.   Being that it is a conspiracy sub, and that Jews have been targets for millennia, this doesn’t surprise me, I expect that this forum would have these opinions.</p>

<p>However, respectfully, I don’t find any interest in Jewish cabals, it seems contrived. Personally, I’m more interested in space, politics, innovations, pre existing civilizations and the like.  </p>

<p>I don’t see how this is a conspiracy post, it appears to me that someone is trying to rile up anger towards an ethnic group. And yeah I realize that some Jews aren’t zionists. </p>

<p>OP,  if there is a conspiracy here change my mind, otherwise I don’t see your angle. </p>

<p>I suppose I write this as an experiment to see a reaction, or just one beer to many. </p>

I made this post in hopes their community will see it and see that Israel supporting Americans dont want to see it become Israel&#39;s T-D, alt right religious fundamentalist are ruining Israel and America. A good portion of the Israel sub are just as idiotic and prejudice as the r/the_Donald sub. The world needs to fight this because religion should be tolerance and compasdion, not war and hate.</p>

All men are free to practice their religion side by side. The government shall represent no religion. We are all equal and land can&#39;t be ruled, only used in peace and for the benefit of all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides, I&#39;m an Israeli. I very often have to travel to Tel Aviv, Haifa, Acre, Carmiel, and Beersheba. Basically I get to meet all different types of Israel&#39;s society. From the most liberal left (Tel Aviv) to right wing (Beersheba) to mixed cities (Haifa, Carmiel) or dominantly Arab cities (Acre). I&#39;ve never actually seen anyone who is anti-LGBT other than migrants from the former Soviet Union (telling you this as an immigrant).</p>

<p>Noticeable hatred towards Arabs is actually very limited to certain geographic locations such as towns and cities close to Gaza (they get all the rockets) and in about half the settlements. Some sects of Arabs, namely the Druze, are actually very appreciated in Israel, and I don&#39;t think anyone hates them other than the Ultra Orthodox Jews who hate literally anyone who isn&#39;t them so it&#39;s not a big deal (we all hate them back anyway).</p>

<p>Hatred towards blacks/africans is limited to southern Tel Aviv, who has taken in thousands of African immigrants and subsequently was under-developed and under-funded, which obviously angered the long time residents of southern Tel Aviv. Other than them, nothing else. Their feelings to them can be described as somewhat similar to what Europeans are thinking about the immigrants they&#39;re taking in, except somewhat less extreme.</p>

<p>Christians pretty much get no hate in Israel. It&#39;s just one of those things you mention in small talk and never really focus on it because Israelis are not all that interested in religion anyway.</p>

<p>Whites are practically the majority in Israel, and disabled people.... Well how do you even hate disabled people? That&#39;s nuts. Never seen such thing.</p>
