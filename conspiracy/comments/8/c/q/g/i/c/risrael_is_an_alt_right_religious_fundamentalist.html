       I follow their sub because in interested in the region amd have family there. I've noticed a lot of hate and prejudice in their sub. People keep talking about removing this from reddit and that r/conspiracy is a hate breading ground, but Israel is way worse. I've seen people call blacks the Hebrew word for nig###. I've seen them call Palestinians pigs cockroaches infestations and so on. They talk about gays should die as its a sin. They laugh at soldiers killing children. They call Americans slaves and other things. It is just as bad as t_d for racist nationalism. For some reason its ok for them but not ok for the alt right t_d users. They even say disabled people are being punished by god.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy is with reddits admins to squash religious funfdamentalists in America while giving the ones from Israel a safe place and promote it.

       This is why when I hear people say…"Not all Jews are bad/support Israel" I think to myself…"They better be speaking out then cuz if they're not they're every bit as much of there problem as the bad ones."

       Luckily many Jews are speaking out and even being arrested for protesting Israeli actions. I think somewhere around 50% of US Jews are opposed to Netanyahu / far right Israel / Zionism.

       They don't remove the comments. Look at all the hate after the recent protests. Its an alt right hate sub. While a lot of users arent this way, many are racist religious fundamentalists.

       "Schvartze" is Yiddish, and not a very common term in Israel. Not a derogatory term either, it means "black". "Cushi" translates to "African". In recent years people have been complaining about its usage so it's funny watching Israeli politicians and news personalities trying to talk about Africans without using the word "African". There's no equivalent to the n-word.

       Israel's religious fundamentalist use them as deragatory because they don't like Africans. My aunt says a lot of high society look down on them. Netanyahu even said Africans have bad character that corrupts Israel's good character and values. That's the sane argueargument the alt right in America hold. Israel has alt right too and they are in power. That's why I fight them. They think their race is superior and that God wants them to rule all people and be the high class.

       None of what you said answers my response to you. And I will stand by the fact that you invented something out of whole cloth to post here because you could not find anything to back up your assertions that bigoted language is a mainstay of
       <a href="/r/Israel">

       .

       So I'm calling you out on it. Back up your post with some actual evidence (top comments calling Palestinians roaches, usage of the n-word, calling for the death of gays, etc.) or leave and apologize for the deceit that you knew this subreddit would so quickly swallow.

       There’s been a lot of full blown antisemitism and holocaust denial on here recently.

       I just visited
       <a href="/r/Israel">
        /r/Israel

       and I couldn’t find much on there that shocked me. I’d also like to remind the OP that despite Israel’s horrific treatment of Palestine, it is nonetheless the most liberal country in the Middle East. There’s a lot of backwards views in the Middle East and the views you find among Israelis will seem mild in comparison. KSA still executes people for being gay and even for witchcraft, and honour killings  happen across the Islamic world.

       Your whataboutism is just a dismissal of not wanting to look and criticize both sides. He brought up an argument, we don't need the label of whataboutism.

       In the Abrahamic religions it certainly is. In Christianity there's no such thing as "chosen people" you aren't special because of your belief or the colour of your skin, the same with Islam. There's no such thing as chosen people in either Christianity or Islam, these religions aren't ethnicity based religions. Whether Christians or Muslims treat people differently is strictly irrelevant, that's something that is not based on scripture or if it is, it's based on very shoddy scripture which most scholars would reject. Jews believe in religion through your ethnicity, not through your beliefs. Many Jews believe that if you have descended from Israel who was a person I believe he changed his name from Yacob, then you are a true jew and that is one of the main reasons why they don't see Ethiopian Jews as being real Jews. People will often say it's anti semitic to criticise Judaism and Jews, it isn't. It's a perfectly valid criticism of Judaism and how Jews believe in ethno supremacy. It's absolutely despicable. The idea of God choosing you as a group of people based on your lineage is so incredibly dangerous, people underestimate just how dangerous it is. You can literally get away with murder because you're the chosen people, you can kick people off your land, why? Because you're a chosen group of people. Judaism is unique in being ethno religious in the Abrahamic faiths, Hinduism has its own issues with caste and other religions have their own issues.

       I didn't realise the chosen people reffered to ethnicity rather than just followers of the religion. Forgive me if I don't just take your word for it though, I'll have to do some further reading before I can agree/disagree.

       Don't believe anything I say because I myself could be wrong I would of course recommend everyone do their own research but from what I know the idea of "chosen people" was because God made a covenant with the second son of Abraham and through him all nations would be blessed and they would be God's chosen people. In Islam which is very similar to Judaism in many ways doesn't have an idea of chosen people and it's largely believed that it's a fabrication, especially considering what God's supposed chosen people did throughout the old testament.

       Islam believes they are the real Jews as they are the spiritual successors. Much like many christians read verses that imply they would like to go back to Israel...

       Islam doesn't believe they are the real Jews. Islam recognises that Jews come from a different person and Muslims come from a different person. Muhammad descended from Ishmael, the first son of Abraham whereas Jews descended from Isaac who is the second son of Abraham. In Genesis 17:20, it mentions that through Ishmael a great nation would be made however Muslims don't believe in that, it just so happens to be in the old testament.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only verse that makes Muslims special from the old testament is Genesis 17:20 "And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation."
      </p>
      <p>
       However Muslims do not believe in this. Muslims do not rely on the old testament or the new regarding their religion. Muslims believe that these books have been corrupted and therefore they cannot be relied upon. There are some scholars who say you can believe in the old testament and new as long as it doesn't contradict Islam however this is not something that authentic Islamic scripture mentions. You are right about what Christians do however Muslims see the old and new testament as being corrupt and they do not rely on them. They have in the past, especially with the curse of ham but nowadays not so much.

       each faith believes they are the authentic Abrahamic teachings. We are in agreement, perhaps my words were a bit loose, but that is the reason Islam feels it has a religious right to the same parts of Palestine as Jews... because they are the "real" abrahamic faith.

       That's not what I was saying, in the old testament, God said I will make a covenant with Isaac, and Geneisis 17:20 says that I have also heard him, I will make him into a great nation too. Not that the covenant would be established through Ishamael. Whether it was Isaac or Ishmael who was about to be sacrificed is highly debatable among Muslims and that is not an issue I would like to get into. Muslims do not believe in having rights to Israel/Palestine because the covenant was made through Ishmael. In fact, this simply isn't even an issue in mainstream Islam. No Muslim actually cares about who the covenant was through or who was meant to be sacrificed but what is clear is that arabs at the time of Muhammed believed they came from Ishmael, Muhammed himself came from a tribe which was believed to have come from Ishmael. There is nothing significant about that per se, the Quran does not mention anything about the fact that Ishmael would be blessed with a nation and nor does the Quran mention anything about Muhammed's lineage. The idea of Ishmael which would 1) Be monotheistic, 2) have its own laws 3) have a direct connection with God comes from the old testament. Muslims don't even know about the covenant between God and Ishmael of the old testament because it's not in Islam, Muslims believe that Ishmael was about to be sacrificed but God saved him and the significance of that was it showed obeidance to God and Hajj is done to commemorate that. Jews believe the sacrifice of Isaac establishes a covenant, Muslims don't believe that the attempted sacrifice of Isaac establishes a covenant.

       Well in christianity the israelites were the chosen people too. So thats where youre wrong. Starting right off the bat with your comment here. You should try actually opening a bible and reading it not just parroting what you see others saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its also been warped. In the bible it specifies they were chosen as examples of morality. That was thousands of years ago when they actually had morals

       What I said was in Christianity there's no such thing as chosen people as in you can be Christian based solely on your faith, you don't have to come from a certain lineage to be considered a true Christian which is however quite odd, especially considering the fact that Jesus himself mentions many times that he has come for the lost sheep of Israel alone but from what is understood as Christianity and from Matthew 19:28 I believe, Jesus mentions that make everyone a Christian, I am paraphrasing by the way.

       No, the Jews were not moral at that time. They were chosen because they were stubborn and after they finally believed they would hold that belief for thousands of years in diaspora.

       No... "chosen" refers to that Jews were chosen to carry the weight of commitment to god, because Jews were the more stubborn and "stiff necked" people. Also in the Talmud it does not say Jews will rule, it says when they are united and godly, that other people will want to emulate them. It's not a master-slave relationship.

       I have no agenda I'm a Gnostic that hates Israel. I just feel like people twidt the words to that which they arent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is we cant ever know what in the bible is the word of god vs the word of man its been corrupted so many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it says morals (and we ignore genocide) we dont necessarily knlw its the true word.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be. They could have been picked. Or theyre lying and its not even in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally dont think god would choose one over the other for he loves all his creations even the monsters of the other realms.

       Good day sirs, I respectfully submit the opinion of myself that I have frequented r/Israel and have not seen the hate on all those subjects that this this post attested to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Undoubtedly,  statistics would show there be a dick or a few in every sub, however to say it’s an “alt right religious fundamentalist racist haven” would be a persons opinion, and in fact I would strongly disagree with this statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t need to go into how Israel is the only democracy over there, the rights of an Arab in Israel versus a Jew in practically every other Arab or Persian country, that deflects. The Gaza Strip is a fucked up situation, no Israeli would disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       This conspiracy sub itself tends to have characters that espouse anti israel/Jew threads about once a week.   Being that it is a conspiracy sub, and that Jews have been targets for millennia, this doesn’t surprise me, I expect that this forum would have these opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, respectfully, I don’t find any interest in Jewish cabals, it seems contrived. Personally, I’m more interested in space, politics, innovations, pre existing civilizations and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t see how this is a conspiracy post, it appears to me that someone is trying to rile up anger towards an ethnic group. And yeah I realize that some Jews aren’t zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP,  if there is a conspiracy here change my mind, otherwise I don’t see your angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose I write this as an experiment to see a reaction, or just one beer to many.

       You hit all the talking points ;) while I am a shepardi jew with a Knesset member in my family, I think its a gasoline to fundamentalist who follow the Talmud, judiasms Mormon or johavahs witness is to Christianity. Netanyahu has broken gods law and has corrupted many more to do the same. Bc of this r/Israel has become a place to barf his extremism as Russian trolls barf Putin's extremism. I made this post in hopes their community will see it and see that Israel supporting Americans dont want to see it become Israel's T-D, alt right religious fundamentalist are ruining Israel and America. A good portion of the Israel sub are just as idiotic and prejudice as the r/the_Donald sub. The world needs to fight this because religion should be tolerance and compasdion, not war and hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americas bed rockof belief is this:
All men are free to practice their religion side by side. The government shall represent no religion. We are all equal and land can't be ruled, only used in peace and for the benefit of all.

       Besides, I'm an Israeli. I very often have to travel to Tel Aviv, Haifa, Acre, Carmiel, and Beersheba. Basically I get to meet all different types of Israel's society. From the most liberal left (Tel Aviv) to right wing (Beersheba) to mixed cities (Haifa, Carmiel) or dominantly Arab cities (Acre). I've never actually seen anyone who is anti-LGBT other than migrants from the former Soviet Union (telling you this as an immigrant).
      </p>
      <p>
       Noticeable hatred towards Arabs is actually very limited to certain geographic locations such as towns and cities close to Gaza (they get all the rockets) and in about half the settlements. Some sects of Arabs, namely the Druze, are actually very appreciated in Israel, and I don't think anyone hates them other than the Ultra Orthodox Jews who hate literally anyone who isn't them so it's not a big deal (we all hate them back anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hatred towards blacks/africans is limited to southern Tel Aviv, who has taken in thousands of African immigrants and subsequently was under-developed and under-funded, which obviously angered the long time residents of southern Tel Aviv. Other than them, nothing else. Their feelings to them can be described as somewhat similar to what Europeans are thinking about the immigrants they're taking in, except somewhat less extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christians pretty much get no hate in Israel. It's just one of those things you mention in small talk and never really focus on it because Israelis are not all that interested in religion anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whites are practically the majority in Israel, and disabled people.... Well how do you even hate disabled people? That's nuts. Never seen such thing.

       Now can you verify with any certainty that every poster is Jewish?  Or Israeli?

       Israel effects countless aspects of the US, most importantly our foreign policy which tends to kill young americans.
