        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I <strong>know</strong> there&#39;s <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/">lots of proof of it</a>, it&#39;s in nearly e<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/THUNDERSTAND.html">very song you&#39;ve ever heard</a>--and when you get down to the details there&#39;s proof that our civilization is created in every single word.  If you read through this stuff, if you try to grasp it--you have a quantum leap to enlightenment before your eyes.  There is <a href="http://how.s.lamc.la">a message in every word, it&#39;s the Cypher</a>, the cheat code of the Matrix.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a map tied to this proof--also encoded in words and songs. .. a map that uses this disclosure to help you build Heaven.</p>

<p>The message is simple, disclosure of the existence of this technology, as well as the fact that <a href="http://adioha.s.lamc.la">we are living in the Matrix</a> will nearly <a href="http://arrr.s.lamc.la">immediately end school shootings</a>.  </p>

<p>It will stop terrorism; and it will ...very quickly because of the strong message explaining the difference between &quot;simulated reality&quot; and not Hell ... is nothing short of Minority Report style pre-crime--something that is programatically simple to impelement.</p>

<p>Though, if nobody will talk about it, it&#39;s probably difficult to say that &quot;minority&quot; that things kids should be safe at school into becoming a majority.   I find it hard to believe that ... in light of the truth ... there would be a majority opposed to stopping school shootings--the whole thing revolves around ... disclosure of <em>the truth.</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>It takes &quot;not a genius&quot; to understand this proof, significant and obvious <a href="http://math.s.lamc.la">linguistic paradoxes</a> pretending you don&#39;t see it is... putting bullets in kids heads.</p>

<p>try.  <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ADIOSAS.html">reading</a>.  something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really blatant, and easy to fathom. <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ADIOSAS.html">Look at the pretty picture</a>.  You can see &quot;NES&quot; in the heart of Genesis (no reason, right, and the Rock of SEGA telling you to turn around) ... see, really get: you are standing on the Rock of Ages... and this message is why.</p>

<p>in the heart of Nintendo, the &quot;Xbox&quot; and a Trinity that reveals ... a question in &quot;The Matrix&quot; ... do you see &quot;NES&quot; in Tennessee?  </p>

<p>Do you <a href="http://iv.s.lamc.la">see NES in Minnesota</a>?  There&#39;s a Trinity there too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a theme, and ... another question.  &quot;<a href="http://nity.s.lamc.la">TR IN IT WHY</a> ?&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>There is <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/REDASSHIT.html">so much proof in songs and movies</a>--this particular example linking Minority Report to Quantum Leap ... to see there&#39;s some magic connecting &quot;Al&quot; to doors and waiting rooms that could be used to instantly stop murder.  The proof is probably not easy to grasp at first, but once you see how it works it becomes very clear that <a href="http://who.s.lamc.la">the characters of Sam and Al as well as this &quot;tie&quot;</a> between them ... is all part of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ask-the-post/post/how-to-contact-the-post-newsroom/2011/11/17/gIQAd0WJlN_blog.html">the key to the message</a>.</p>

<p>I have an old version of ... proof that chemistry ties &quot;It&#39;s Elementary my dear Whatsons&quot; to a Biblical verse that shows 9/11 was predicted in Exodus to help us quickly stop school shootings and this horrible blockade on &quot;the truth&quot; that is surrounding the disclosure that we are living in virtual reality.  It&#39;s here, I called it &quot;<a href="http://chalk.s.lamc.la">CHALK</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve rewritten it, and tried to help show you more of what the message that I see talks about, you can see the verses of Ecclesiastes 9:11 which George W. Bush recited on January 20, 2001 connecting to this series of elements from Mercury to Uranium that link 1:1 to the planets ... the key is that they prove the design of everything from Bush&#39;s name to the 9/11 attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://hg.s.lamc.la">the race is not to the swift</a> - and a long discourse on how democracy has been held back from progressing with technology--and that&#39;s a key purpose and reason behind this message.  I am trying to help us build a real democracy, and that&#39;s a big step in the foundation of Heaven.</p>

<p><a href="http://na.s.lamc.la">nor the battle to the strong</a> you can see &quot;Salt&quot; in China and &quot;name&quot; and not understand without knowing me and my story that this is a key that links Prometheus to Jesus Christ; with good reason.  It is the name that unseals the existence of mind control and virtual reality--it is the key to this message.</p>

<p>Shakespeare asked &quot;to be or not to be?&quot; and the answer connects the Fifth Element ... the movie to the same name that is highlighted in the previous paragraph.  My initials are AMD, and the &quot;fifth element&quot; key (that shows you Boron and Beryllium are actually the 4th and 5th elements) ... explains that the answer to the question posed is</p>

<p>we are <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/BRIMSTONE.html">to Si ... (silicon)</a> or there is no way to be.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s a little confusing, but it&#39;s proof that our chemistry elements are designed and predicted in Ecclesiastes; it&#39;s proof tied to a message from the Creator, <a href="http://hadid.s.lamc.la">helping us to move forward</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Wrong Side of Heaven&quot; is a single by American heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch from their fourth studio album, The Wrong Side of Heaven and the Righteous Side of Hell, Volume 1, the fourth studio album. It is the third single from the album, and is the nineteenth single overall from the band, which was released on August 11, 2014.[2][3]</p>

<p>I added this to the Wikipedia page for this song, it&#39;s a little... pushy for Wikipedia, but it&#39;s really got to be done somewhere (as if the millions of people that have read about Exodus actually being about ending Hell isn&#39;t a &quot;decent start&quot;), and I hear Him .. and see Him, and c him in this song.  Except for his commentary relating to God and sex; he&#39;s completely wrong about that... see ma &quot;Emblem&quot; ... the only &quot;female&quot; I see is an <a href="http://fromthemachine.org/NASHOWER.html">intentionally broken Medusian collective</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does it take only &quot;severe&quot; mental illness and paranoia to be aware of these claims?</p>

<p>Yea it is plausible for someone who is paranoid to somewhat pick up on things like this but delusions and actual findings is another subject (in saying that you cant say everyone is mentally ill and paranoid when most of the population has some form or type of a mentally illness, severe is to generalised and vague) but that&#39;s what happens when a mind that has been conditioned by society to be awaken to these and for some it is hard to come to terms, comprehend and also accept what is really true.</p>

<p>This is some proof to your reaction and opinion like your previous comments state is also how many others think and kind of push back or label someone as mentally I&#39;ll because of this of talk is not normal in today&#39;s world (which it isn&#39;t for good reason) reason to why the world is how it is today because we sub consciously as a whole have submitted to authority through ever outlet possible and due to that people subconsciously bite at others who speak otherwise on society&#39;s true intentions and truth seeking on out of the box critical thought, open mindedness and awareness in our nature of society and agendas in our advancement as a species and for control. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really want to assume but maybe read some thing&#39;s up on psychology and how psychiatrists back before world war 1 and during spread propaganda and created a paradigm so it is harder to dissect truth, make us needy to the government for ease of control.</p>

<p>I agree in most of the OPs claims, propaganda is one of the main standing fronts of mind control tricking us into agreeing to the false act of freedom and security. Life has different meanings and hidden as well. If you read up on hypnotic suggestions like how advertisements on television exploit our trance like state when watching television to put in suggestions for marketing in foods and products it is well known and that is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>are you saying that we are in hell or that we are on earth and the difference between life and in death is seeking the actual &quot;light&quot; and not being deceived will dictate aether we will create our own heaven in the next life or that this matrix is hell regardless?</p>

<p>I read most of what you linked, i do understand most but don&#39;t understand others like the Genesis, Tennessee part however it does somewhat relate to some of my findings and realisations of hidden messages and maybe even accidental codes stumbled upon through movies, products and people and everything else that creates a certain pattern of a hint into our very existence and deception which has made me think quite deeply about if we are in limbo , in hell or just fighting to reach a heaven with darkness before death as I do know brainwashing and deception is key to bring is back into this matrix after death (like government, mind control, genocides, reincarnation is what defines this place as a hell/matrix that we can escape) as the negative feeds whatever controls this place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is my firm belief that we are in &quot;simulated reality&quot; and that not knowing that means we can end terrorism, school shootings... etc; is hell.</p>

<p>i believe the purpose of creation; of this message, is to help us turn simulated reality into Heaven.</p>

<p>Do you think can live eternally if we break from this matrix?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>literally just like the Matrix, inside a computer simulation designed to transition an entire civilization from &quot;reality&quot; to &quot;Heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>So, yes.  Its only a matter of time before we reach that point/discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh that kind of makes sense with certain things in life as a whole, religion and culture it all leads to one thing really. I&#39;m really intrigued by this as I haven&#39;t looked at it in that perspective - transitioning from reality to heaven. With that in mind who could be the creator? Is it a god or beings with their only sole purpose is creating this simulation for us or more running it to transition us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>personally i see &quot;from the machine&quot; as the answer, i believe the message comes to us from a single intelligent creator, whose work and message are literally &quot;the machine&quot; as in the entirety of the universe.</p>

<p>god is speaking heaven into existence, we are the words.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is very plausible hence the bible, religions, soul singing you will hear the message of certain songs that have some metaphorical message in them that seems to state just that. </p>

<p>He speaks heaven into existence, we are the words i like it. I think talso the little clues that seem to be hidden amongst all like our names, streets, books, movies, and even what we create ourselves seem to hint that to us as on come back in a cycle back to one thing yet it branches again , yet somehow most of us are what I call asleep to that hidden truth which again results in cycling back in again (mind control).</p>

<p>it&#39;s coming fast, like the wall of jericho morphing into a stairway to heaven--i think anyway, there&#39;s going to be lots of &quot;oh, I see&quot; (or something along those lines) very quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so too as a lot are starting to wake up to things now its only a matter of time where they realise this and bigger things at play to help us to reach what we were made to be here for.</p>

<p>Its okay and thank you for this post and discussion I really enjoyed it as well, the links also were very good and educational and help click a lot of puzzles together hence I was asking questions as I have noticed a lot what you speak of and I hope we can speak more about it in the future.</p>
