        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>remember a few years ago when (and I still kind of hear it a little here around canada) everybody went on that diet where they didn’t eat anything that was packaged in China? </p>

<p>if I remember correctly, this is around the same timeline of when it was starting to be widely discussed about China becoming a super economy. Do you think that the American government had anything to do with the push in publicity for it in order to destabilize the Chinese market a little bit?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Go google Chinese counterfeit and tainted foods and drugs.</p>

<p>Google counterfeit eggs, Chinese baby formula melamine, Chinese sewage in food, gutter oil, newspaper in food, dangerous chinese food.</p>

<p>Go watch the thousands of videos about how dangerous food(and other things like drugs) are on YT.</p>

<p>I have been against everything made in China for much longer than that fad. The corrupt elements in the US govt also WANTS people to buy shitty Chinese made garbage because they are our biggest trade partner in the exchange of their shit for our money.</p>

<p>Also google Chinese night soil fertilizer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chickens require warehouse sized farms. You have to buy the animals, feed them, water, veterinary care, medicine, climate control, quality control for the safety of the eggs. Chicken farms operate on low margins, and even lower when they are humanely farmed.</p>

<p>It costs about half as much overall to make literal poison counterfeit eggs as it does to grow real ones, and it can be done comparitively instant. Mix the chemicals, put them in a mold, done.</p>

<p>I dont remember the chemical they use to create the shell but the inside is alumina based so it gives you dementia pretty fast if you eat it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should be warned, once you go down the made in China rabbit hole you will probably find it difficult and significantly more expensive to shop.</p>

<p>I have gone the opposite direction from the typical western consumer as a result: instead of filling my home with cheap slave labour made trash, i buy few but very nice things that tend to last forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s plenty of Chinese Australians making a fortune by buying foods such as baby formula and selling it back to China. It&#39;s our news every second day. As soon as stores open, there&#39;s a line up of about 10 Chinese people and they buy all the baby formula. Theyve introduced limits of 4 per customer but they&#39;re still doing it. One lady makes $100,000 a year and all she does is take orders from Chinese people, buys the stock in Australia and sends it back to the rich Chinese. They don&#39;t trust any of their products so they want to be they stuff from Australia where they know it&#39;s safe.</p>
