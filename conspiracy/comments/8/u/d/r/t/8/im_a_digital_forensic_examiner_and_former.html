        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/JangoTheJanitor.html">JangoTheJanitor</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve always been a very logical person. I work as a private-sector digital forensic examiner, have testified under oath in court on numerous occasions as an expert witness, and have lived my life with a very rational and evidence-based outlook on everything.</p>

<p>In my personal life, from about 2013-2017 I lived with my Dad. I moved in with him after he lost his wife and after my then-fiancee decided she wanted to be with someone else. We had a great father-son relationship and things were good.</p>

<p>During the tail end of 2016, I functioned as a mod on <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>, and focused specifically on trying to keep the &quot;investigations&quot; focused and evidence-driven. I encouraged validation of external claims, proper inductive reasoning as opposed to wild conclusion-jumping, and I participated in analyzing a number of files for steganography. Nothing significant (to my knowledge) resulted from this.</p>

<p>In January of 2017, I was woken up by the coroner pounding on the door, telling me that my Dad was found dead in his truck in the middle of the intersection two blocks from the house. He didn&#39;t crash - just stalled the engine and drifted to a stop in the middle of the intersection. Supposedly people just drove around him for three hours until a sheriff&#39;s deputy finally found him.</p>

<p>He was 66, in perfect health. He didn&#39;t smoke, didn&#39;t drink, worked out with me multiple times per week, and had a pretty low-stress life. He had just been to his doctor for a checkup and told me that his cholesterol and blood pressure was &quot;like that of someone half his age&quot; according to the doctor. </p>

<p>About two minutes after talking to me, the coroner concluded it must have been a heart attack &quot;by process of elimination,&quot; handed me a card for the funeral home, and told me that I&#39;d have to pay $200 by the end of the day to get his truck out of impound. And that was it. My entire world blew up around me in an instant. My Dad was my best friend and my only real family. I was in complete shock, and frankly have been for over a year. Because of this I&#39;ve been battling severe depression and grief for over a year and most days can barely keep things together.</p>

<p>And the more I think about it, the more I realize that everything seemed very sloppy about the whole situation. I was never offered the chance for an autopsy. The coroner&#39;s report (which I saw later) seems to have been written hastily, even misspelling his name and my name (which was also on the truck registration, determined from a DMV lookup).  The coroner also that they &quot;couldn&#39;t find his wallet,&quot; which I later found in the glove box of the truck after getting it out of impound. Obviously very little investigative work was done if they didn&#39;t even examine the vehicle. I also forensically examined my Dad&#39;s phone and found no attempts to call 911 or anything of the sort.</p>

<p>I&#39;m the first person to cite &quot;correlation does not equal causation,&quot; and I fully understand that psychologically I don&#39;t have any logical reason behind why any of this happened. It may very well be that there is no logical explanation for why my Dad apparently just dropped dead in the middle of an intersection.</p>

<p>But some days, something deep in my heart just screams at me that this isn&#39;t normal. And I&#39;ve never shared this with anybody, but here I am laying it out on the table. If this can just be written off as the psychologically-disturbed disregarding of Occam&#39;s razor by someone in the throes of depression and grief, so be it.</p>

<p>Given the timing of <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> being banned about a week before my Dad died (I think), the fact that I had done all my activity on that sub from my home without a VPN, and the fact that I was (probably) the only professional investgative person involved with it, in my darkest moments I can&#39;t help but feel the circumstances are related. There, there&#39;s my crazy conspiracy theory. I&#39;m a shell of my former self, so I don&#39;t care what repurcussions it brings to say so, but it&#39;s good to get off my chest in any case.</p>

<p>From that moment onward I had completely abandoned all work toward the pizzagate stuff. It didn&#39;t matter. The fact that I&#39;ve made it this far without just offing myself is honestly shocking even to me.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know where else to get it out, so I got it out here because anywhere else on the internet I&#39;d be either condemned, mocked, or committed.  But I&#39;ve already lost it all, so I have nothing to lose by putting this crazy association into writing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m out of the woods for that.  Not gonna happen.  I couldn&#39;t say the same thing a few months ago, but I&#39;ve managed to get a foothold back in my life again and move in the right direction.</p>

<p>As for any ideas, I really can&#39;t say.  I&#39;ve never been one of the types of people to subscribe to ideas like a &quot;heart attack gun,&quot; but there&#39;s just so much I don&#39;t know.  Assuming the hypothetical, poison makes some sense, or possibly through another methodology altogether where he was then placed back in the vehicle in the intersection.  He drove to work very early in the morning on a backroad that doesn&#39;t get a lot of traffic, but I can&#39;t imagine his truck sitting in the middle of the intersection for three whole hours and not having a single person call the police.  It just seems really odd.</p>

<p>Again, this is just running with the hypothetical that something actually happened and I&#39;m not just projecting.  There&#39;s just so much that gnaws at me as not making sense out of this, although I know there&#39;s little sense to be made of a person just spontaneously dropping dead when they were fine just hours before.  I remember waking up hearing him having his morning coffee at 3AM right before he left.  Business as usual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So sorry for your loss.
Importantly, there are people and groups, local and online, who can help with grief. It&#39;s very powerful... </p>

<p>Are you important enough to warrant attention?
If so, wouldn&#39;t it be easier for you to get a &#39;warning&#39; or disappear entirely?
Have people as important as you also suffered loss?
Who else suffered loss?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the kind words.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say I was &quot;important&quot; in a meaningful sense outside of the fact that I really tried to put the hammer down on the &quot;investigative work&quot; being done on that subreddit.  I really drilled people to focus on the evidence, to validate external research (and subsequently helped disprove a number of fake claims coming out of 4chan that were just being accepted as fact), and not to jump to crazy conclusions without a factual basis, as well as teaching a number of people things like steganography and recommending the right kinds of tools.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t paid attention to where it&#39;s gone since then, but from what little I know about it, it migrated to Voat and the wild massive goose chases took over.  The inmates running the asylum, so to speak.</p>

<p>To run with the hypothetical, &quot;why me,&quot; probably because I was the only person with any real investigative training and was trying to lead the research in a direction that focused on proper research.</p>

<p>As for whether anybody else involved in that community has suffered a loss, I can&#39;t say.  I&#39;ve totally shut myself off from the whole community and have spent the better part of a year just trying to focus on my job and on getting through the next day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t read any of your post, but my spidey senses tell me this is supposed to scare people away from researching pizzagate.  If you think some group has killed your father, you need to contact all available law enforcement agencies at the same general time.  Tell as many qualified people as possible. Send your research to each of them</p>

<p>Spread out your investigation so that its not so easy to snuff out. Good luck.  Don&#39;t let fear guide your decision making.  That&#39;s how they win</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my job I&#39;ve gotten referrals from local law enforcement (and a few from the local FBI guy I know professionally), and they&#39;re usually people who think the government put spyware on their phone or TV or microwave.  People who think there are small robots in their skin, things like that.  I know how they see claims like this, and I&#39;d be thrown into the same category.</p>

<p>Plus, as far as my research goes, there&#39;s no hard evidence other than suspicion on my end.  I&#39;ve been in a black hole of grief for over a year and haven&#39;t been able to think straight.  Maybe the evidence of this thread is continuing to prove I&#39;m still not thinking straight, but I&#39;ve missed the boat in terms of any hard evidence.  My Dad has already been put to rest, no autopsy was offered, there&#39;s nothing formal out there except for the vague coroner&#39;s report.  It&#39;s a wild suspicion that probably can&#39;t ever go past that because any evidence is long gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all believe we are just ordinary ppl living ordinary lives in an safe, democratic country where ppl who live above the law will not come after us for exercising our free speech.  It’s pretty sobering to realize how little security we actually have as ppl are suicided left and right for daring to believe the law and the constitution mean something. Where whistleblowers are maligned and ruined while criminals are protected. </p>

<p>The fact they closed down the sub is <em>huge</em>.  If you remember there were threats made by the dc restaurant owner against a guy doing research on some properties.  The dialogue was practiced and chilling.   I would not put it past them. HC came out of post election loss to address it. </p>

<p>You sound very depressed and grief stricken. I hope you’ve sought counseling.  But, we hear you and acknowledge you. Thank you for all you did to help and for sharing your experience. You will be in my prayers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the kind thoughts.  Counseling hasn&#39;t helped much, but I&#39;ve focused a lot on fitness, meditation, and philosophy and it&#39;s gotten me to a better place than I was a year ago.</p>

<p>When the sub was banned, it came as quite a shock to everybody involved.  Supposedly the official reason was people were being doxxed, but I absolutely didn&#39;t see any of that going on or any specific instances where that behavior was being promoted.  The few times it came up, people were warned and banned.  Looking at news articles on that sub it makes it sound like the whole community was setting up organized rallies for people to harass Alefantis or Podesta, but that couldn&#39;t be more distant from the truth.  Any sort of witchhunts would not be tolerated, especially from somebody like me who wouldn&#39;t say the sky was blue without having documented evidence first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt in your professionalism.  The narrative was to make <em>anyone</em> looking at this seem deranged and dangerous. What changed everything was that post by a Journo challenging colleagues to report their findings. That’s when the sub went down. It was all preemptive. They probably feared what finally happened recently with kids separated from parents at the border. Everyday ppl targeting ICE.  <em>Finally,</em> some reaction from the masses. </p>

<p>I also understand your sense of security to operate without vpn, I keep believing I’m too unimportant to bother with and don’t use one either.  Probably even vpn may have vulnerabilities. At this point we have to assume no privacy <em>and</em> no justice from govt.  These ppl abuse their power in broad day. Look at Pharma bro in jail for trolling HC, who has secret service 24/7.  Look at Julian Assange, just crazy use of entire, plural, govt agencies —amazing not droned yet. The overreaction with alefantis (response from highest levels of power coming out in his defense) was obviously not organic.  </p>

<p>I’m glad you are getting better. Hope you continue in your recovery bec we need good ppl around.  You are on the right side of history, though it’s been personally highly costly. Be well and safe, friend. </p>

I&#39;m not trying to fuel OP&#39;s fire, I also think they should try to move on - there&#39;s not much that can be done with it now, and nothing will restore things to how they were before the death of OP&#39;s father.  </p>

<p>But we shouldn&#39;t dismiss the whole thing either. OP was investigating a high-society conspiracy of unparalleled scale when someone who could have been mistaken for being him died suddenly. There is smoke here, even though we don&#39;t see the fire.</p>

<p>Honestly, the fact that it&#39;s been a year and a half and this is the first time I&#39;m even getting these thoughts written out (outside my head) shows how tough it is to even think about.  The loss of him alone is the most devastating thing I can think of, and to approach this subject seriously almost makes me admonish myself for doing so.  Calling myself crazy, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a theory that I&#39;ve been just tiptoeing around for so long and I know it&#39;s going to be impossible to gather any real evidence of at this point, so it may just have to be one of those hanging threads in my mind.  I don&#39;t think I have it in me right now to have him exhumed and examined, or whether that would even yield anything of value at this point.  So it might just have to be something I bite the bullet on and realize I&#39;ll never have an answer.</p>

If your gut says something is up then in my experience your gut may just be right.  So with that said, do not give up on life.  Help take the fuckers down that you were investigating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to give up.  I&#39;m past ever seriously considering suicide again.  It&#39;s been a long and labored process to get here, but if I&#39;ve learned anything from this, it&#39;s that death comes for us all.  The train will eventually reach the station, so why should I rush it?</p>

<p>At the time I was teaching various members of the sub how to use anti-steganography tools and concentrating specifically on some seemingly nonsensical Powerpoints emailed to Podesta from a Chinese guy I forget the name of.  I remember that each document had slides with pictures of flowers and no words, and it seemed very odd so I had extracted the images and was trying various anti-steg methods to see if anything was inside.  At the time it was inconclusive and I totally dropped it after my Dad died.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I want to have him exhumed.  I&#39;m honestly not sure if I could handle the thought of me doing that to him &quot;in a moment of insanity.&quot;  Most days the logical part of my brain just beats down the thought of this &quot;conspiracy,&quot; but for some reason I just had to get it out in writing today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course not.  I don&#39;t have any evidence of it in the first place other than my gut, and chances of getting any actual evidence - if it even existed - are long gone.</p>

<p>If you wanted to establish I was a pizzagate mod, just google this screenname.</p>

<p>If you wanted to establish the story behind my Dad&#39;s death, the obituary has a lot of information on his name, my name, where I live, things like that.  And I don&#39;t feel comfortable just putting that out there.</p>

<p>So if you want to assume I&#39;m just making up a story, that&#39;s fine by me, because if I could just turn my life into fiction and have my Dad alive again, you bet your ass I would.  This is my life and I have to live with it, whether the hard-to-swallow pizzagate correlation exists or is just in my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t make any value judgments on it at all.  I didn&#39;t start looking into this because I&#39;d already established a conclusion and wanted to find the facts to prove it - that was exactly the kind of thinking I worked to prevent.  I first got into it because I found my curiosity piqued by a number of things I saw in the Podesta emails that resembled steganography, which I deal with in my professional life, and wanted to sate that curiosity.  As I interacted with the community, I focused on teaching various members how to use proper inductive reasoning and not fall into the trap of trying to chase down foregone conclusions.</p>

<p>If anything, my efforts in that community were directed at minimizing &quot;insane horseshit&quot; and only basing conclusions on evidence and fact.  That is clearly no longer the case, and I don&#39;t maintain any association with the current state of that community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss, especially with it happening so suddenly.  It&#39;s no wonder it took your mind this long to recover from such a devastating blow.  It sounds like you&#39;re through the worst of it, but I would advise not exhuming your father.  If you&#39;re wrong, you disturbed his resting ground for nothing.  If you&#39;re right, you&#39;ve just made your entire life about getting justice for him.  That&#39;s not a fulfilling path in my estimation.</p>

<p>Having said that, I appreciate your efforts and way of thinking.  There have been a handful of times I&#39;ve seen misinformation spread out of the image boards that I spend a day off attempting to nip in the bud, and even that small amount of time is a sacrifice given for the community at large.  Letting insane horseshit, as the previous poster described it, take root in a theory kills any credibility over time.  It must have taken quite a bit of both time and effort to moderate a sub like pizzagate.</p>

<p>P. S.  Do you happen to have a copy of a guide/write up about steganography that you could repost here or a link to somewhere that does give good information on the subject?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that the most likely conclusion is I&#39;m projecting out of grief.  Most days I keep these thoughts fairly closed off.</p>

<p>If anything, I think that - assuming the unlikely hypothetical is true for a moment - it was a case of mistaken identity.  I don&#39;t have any online presence; no social media, no personal websites, etc.  Never have.  But my Dad spent most of his career in military intelligence and was a civilian DoD employee until his death.  And any sort of IP address subscriber lookup would have resulted in his name, since it was his house.  It&#39;s easy to look at his background and read what I&#39;d been writing and assume it was him.</p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s a stretch, but that makes more sense to me on the moments where I allow these thoughts to persist.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s conspiracy related or not, it&#39;s pretty clear to me that a lot of balls were dropped from the local law enforcement side of things.  Nobody even followed up with me after the initial coroner visit.  Considering that we lived together and his death was bizarrely asymptomatic, I would have at least wondered, &quot;was he perhaps poisoned?  Should we talk to the person he lived with?&quot;  Not a word.</p>

<p>From my experience personally and professionally, the way things are run where I live is defined by the &quot;minimal effort approach.&quot;  It&#39;s frustrating and disappointing.</p>

Regardless of the circumstances, I know nothing is going to bring my Dad back.  I might be projecting due to grief.  I might not be.  Either way, I am going to move forward and make the most of every day I can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so sorry for your loss. </p>

<p>My father was killed when I was very little and I have worked on trying to get someone to look into his cold case since I became an adult. I stumbled across a lesser known serial killer and found what I thought to be a greater number of similarities than chance would dictate. Approaching law enforcement with this made me feel like a crazy person, and thier responses have made clear that they don&#39;t take me seriously. I have only had a few conversations with the most recent detective, he is the 4th, and I don&#39;t think he is too far off from retirement so I have hope that the next guy will care enough to at least look and listen. </p>

<p>Which all seems off topic probably. What I&#39;m trying to establish is how theraputic throwing yourself into the investigation of that sort of thing can be. I see it as my way of honoring my fathers memory, it&#39;s what keeps me poking at those detectives even if they think I&#39;m a crazy person. It might help you to poke around too :)</p>

<p>Sorry if that sort of rambles, I normally lurk, and rarely comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate to say this, but it&#39;s completely normal for your fathers situation to be written off because of his age and lazily worked. it doesn&#39;t mean this was murder.. but on the other hand it doesn&#39;t rule out that this was murder. </p>

<p>it&#39;d make more sense for the conspiracy to be that you were poisoned. </p>

<p>I think this is just a rough situation for you and you need help. it sounds like you&#39;ve been in a depressive state for a while. I&#39;d recommend seeking help. Doctors are just starting to get around to using psychedelics to jolt people out of these brain patterns, i&#39;d recommend that path to get back to your normal self so you can move and live the rest of your life, so you can be the father to your son and bring him the joy yours brought you.</p>

I&#39;ve personally had a near death experience that made me mentally unstable for a while and I noticed that made me think very irrationally/emotionally until I got a grip on things again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bless you for your work my friend! Don&#39;t mind TMOR, they are a sack of very wounded individuals, many likely abused in many ways themselves - all of them no doubt in deep pain that even they themselves have walled of from.</p>

<p>You should be proud of yourself for the good you&#39;ve done, but now try to help yourself and for a moment forget about helping the world. Meditation, journaling, introspection....have done wonders for me personally and I highly recommend them all. You can heal yourself and your inner wounds, your inner pain. It&#39;s not an easy journey, but it&#39;s the only journey that leads to actual genuine peace, love and freedom. I hope the top minds harassing you take it as well.</p>

<p>Take care of your body, exercise, eat good food (listen to what your body needs), engage in creative activities, socialize with people you love, meditate, journal, find time to spend in nature.... </p>

<p>As hard as it may be, allow things to be as they are.</p>

<p>It will be alright. It&#39;s not easy, but it&#39;s the only way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came here post-edit, but I get the gist of it from your comments. Just wanted to say that I’m really sorry for your loss, and appreciate you sharing your story.</p>

<p>Sending best wishes, and hope life settles down for you.</p>

<p>PS - Don’t give the trolls headspace. Their opinions are often manufactured and it seems they’ve also  lost all sense of common decency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YO. I AM LOOKING FOR YOUR FURTHER INFORMATION OTHER THAN EDITS AND THE TITLE. CANT FIND. WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK.<br/>
believe in what you feel and what you know and nothing else. thats all that matters. the internet is the only place, as well as the worst place, to share this kind of information. i sometimes  do share shit and even when the response is positive i feel regret because i dunno, as much as i personally truly value the title alone of this as i dont need any other information to believe it, it probably would have been taxing enough on you with solely positive and inquisitive shit. much love, feel better.   </p>

<p>your good work probably got your dad killed.....<br/>
actions have consequences and sometimes you surviving while others dont is the consequence.<br/>
i say that with respect, gratitude, and intense empathy. much love, dont ever be deterred.<br/>
fight the good fight you probably arent wrong and wherever your dad is, he is most certainly on your side.  </p>

<p>once we are gone we dont care and he if anything would support stopping evil and if everything support his son. there is no upset after. just love etc. good luck stay strong bro. your dad smile over your work no doubt.  </p>

<p>.....jango, were u on voat?</p>

And ffs, yes, leave before you get SR&#39;d, if you have any concern..but.. before you go, please find someone to back up your shit. god knows, it&#39;s hard to find the originals. It&#39;d hard to find digital forensic guys on our side, for that matter. i&#39;m sorry they&#39;ve been successful in their crushing of your spirit. Be safe, and feel better, friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m out of the woods for that.  Not gonna happen.  I couldn&#39;t say the same thing a few months ago, but I&#39;ve managed to get a foothold back in my life again and move in the right direction.</p>

<p>As for any ideas, I really can&#39;t say.  I&#39;ve never been one of the types of people to subscribe to ideas like a &quot;heart attack gun,&quot; but there&#39;s just so much I don&#39;t know.  Assuming the hypothetical, poison makes some sense, or possibly through another methodology altogether where he was then placed back in the vehicle in the intersection.  He drove to work very early in the morning on a backroad that doesn&#39;t get a lot of traffic, but I can&#39;t imagine his truck sitting in the middle of the intersection for three whole hours and not having a single person call the police.  It just seems really odd.</p>

<p>Again, this is just running with the hypothetical that something actually happened and I&#39;m not just projecting.  There&#39;s just so much that gnaws at me as not making sense out of this, although I know there&#39;s little sense to be made of a person just spontaneously dropping dead when they were fine just hours before.  I remember waking up hearing him having his morning coffee at 3AM right before he left.  Business as usual.</p>
