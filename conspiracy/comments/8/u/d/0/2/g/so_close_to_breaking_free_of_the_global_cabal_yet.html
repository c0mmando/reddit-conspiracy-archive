<p>Do you expect the break to come from someone who has no flaws?  Lol.</p>

<p>We are here now, watching the resistance beg for mass immigration (like that will do anything but accelerate the destruction of the middle class) beg for the abandonment of liberalism and openly call for Nazi style public shaming and intimidation.</p>

<p>When do you ask yourself &quot;are we the bad guys?&quot;, Hitler&#39;s rise to power was on the backs of socialist who he quickly abandoned after power was obtained.  Socialism ideally is a caring and humanitarian ideology but that doesn&#39;t guarantee that it isn&#39;t used by the elites as a promise to gain power with.  Open your fucking eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from a family of school teachers, I&#39;m not a fan of common core, personally. Most studies that I&#39;ve seen have shown just a few percentage points increase in reading and critical thinking skills. It is only 7-8 years old though, so those numbers could be chalked up to other things like mass cell-phone/internet use that has increased literacy rates. It&#39;s tough to tell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you were. I think it&#39;s mostly shit, but I believe in public schools, and I believe there should be standards so that poor children get the same education and chance at success as wealthy children. </p>

<p>Our economy/relevant job skillsets/type of jobs available -they have all changed a lot since common core was implemented even just 8 years ago. It isn&#39;t fluid enough. Our education system definitely needs an overhaul, I just don&#39;t trust Betsy DeVoss to be the one to make any type of change that&#39;s in the public&#39;s best interest, so it&#39;s a moot point for the next few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any action through a demeanor of &quot;Me vs You&quot; is the prime delusion.</p>

<p>We gotta work together. Any condemnation or labeling or personal attacks do nothing but create more polarization. Unification is the way out of a fragmented collective. Unification does not fight, it invites everyone in, with a clear understanding of a &quot;higher&quot; intelligent order. It rehabilitates &quot;outsiders&quot; instead of alienating &quot;outsiders&quot; </p>

<p>So yeah I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is...</p>

<p>Love. I love you as an extended sibling within the great family of humankind. THAT is the perspective that will change the world. Not by talking about it, but by living AS that perspective. Thanks for the trigger fellow sibling &lt;3  </p>
