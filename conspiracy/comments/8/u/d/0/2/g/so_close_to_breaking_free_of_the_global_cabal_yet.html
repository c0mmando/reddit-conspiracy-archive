       Highly polished politicians are highly polished for a reason.  Because they are groomed to get into a position of power and use it against us.

      <p>
       Do you expect the break to come from someone who has no flaws?  Lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are here now, watching the resistance beg for mass immigration (like that will do anything but accelerate the destruction of the middle class) beg for the abandonment of liberalism and openly call for Nazi style public shaming and intimidation.
      </p>
      <p>
       When do you ask yourself "are we the bad guys?", Hitler's rise to power was on the backs of socialist who he quickly abandoned after power was obtained.  Socialism ideally is a caring and humanitarian ideology but that doesn't guarantee that it isn't used by the elites as a promise to gain power with.  Open your fucking eyes.

       Free movement of people can only work when you don’t have a national welfare state. Have to pick one.

       And no, they were the National Socialist Party. That who put him in power at least. Hitler himself wasn’t a socialist from what I’ve gathered.

       We’ve had immigration laws going back to 1790. We never had open borders since, they’ve just gotten stricter.

      <p>
       And do you disagree with the statement that you can’t have both open borders AND tons of social welfare programs?

       They were considered property, not citizens. You didn’t need to register your cows or other imported livestock either.

       What are you even trying to argue here? It’s a very simple concept. Open borders, or welfare state.

       This is the biggest test that the propaganda machine has ever faced. We shall see if it remains effective in the end. So far, it looks like it’s starting to fail. And the more they ramp it up, the more people they start to lose.

       Its interesting to me that people blame the immigrants instead of the companies who hire them. It reminds me of playing guns stead of the personal firing it. But we are over here giving tax cuts to billionaires while blaming the whole problem on immigration. So are we the baddies? Maybe you should ask that question from both angles.

       Nothing in my post has anything to do with "feelings." And nothing in your post has anything to do with facts that actually support any kind of premise.

       I'm not going to try to change your opinion. I'm not going to try to "debate" you. In order to have a debate, you have to have two things - a set of shared definitions, and a moderator. We don't have either.

       Coming from a family of school teachers, I'm not a fan of common core, personally. Most studies that I've seen have shown just a few percentage points increase in reading and critical thinking skills. It is only 7-8 years old though, so those numbers could be chalked up to other things like mass cell-phone/internet use that has increased literacy rates. It's tough to tell.

       Just so you know, I was being sarcastic. Common Core is complete shit.

       I know you were. I think it's mostly shit, but I believe in public schools, and I believe there should be standards so that poor children get the same education and chance at success as wealthy children.

       Our economy/relevant job skillsets/type of jobs available -they have all changed a lot since common core was implemented even just 8 years ago. It isn't fluid enough. Our education system definitely needs an overhaul, I just don't trust Betsy DeVoss to be the one to make any type of change that's in the public's best interest, so it's a moot point for the next few years.

       I believe in public schools as well. They are vital to everyone’s success. Fixing and keeping them great is a very difficult task.

       Trump supporters are just delusional at this stage. If you think he isn't a part of the global cabal, I just don't know what to say to you.

       Any action through a demeanor of "Me vs You" is the prime delusion.

       We gotta work together. Any condemnation or labeling or personal attacks do nothing but create more polarization. Unification is the way out of a fragmented collective. Unification does not fight, it invites everyone in, with a clear understanding of a "higher" intelligent order. It rehabilitates "outsiders" instead of alienating "outsiders"

       Love. I love you as an extended sibling within the great family of humankind. THAT is the perspective that will change the world. Not by talking about it, but by living AS that perspective. Thanks for the trigger fellow sibling &lt;3
