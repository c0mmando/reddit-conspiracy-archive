       Are we still required to do SS's? Been a while. "But the ghosts of 911 will forever haunt the engineering and academic world because nobody, FEMA, ASCE, NIST, AIA, engineering organizations, university scholars and all the kings horses and all the kings men. No one can make a simple experiment that can demonstrate the official force behind the motion."

       let's defer to the authorities who are qualified to judge the situation, and depend on them to tell us what really happened. The situation is too complicated for us to understand or investigate, only the experts can possibly be trustworthy. By the way, I'm a big pussy

       Well, those that are probably qualified according to you were funded by the government to do just that.  NIST anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       They created a collapse model specifically for the collapse of WTC7 and never shared it with the general public.  That kind of leaves people with less resources to do what they can with what they have.
      </p>

       That said, why do you think they never showed it to the public? And why are you seemingly trying to discredit independent research?

       They didn't. NIST admitted to almost freefall speeds when conservation of momentum would have slowed a floor by floor collapse eventually stopping it. Those light floors didn't crush the whole mass underneath it. It's impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video shows a model made of thin paper set on fire &amp; you can't get it to collapse at those speeds. Massive structural steel &amp; rebarred concrete core isn't going to vanish suddenly &amp; eliminate the conservation of momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
       People just need to ignore these dopes making arguments for murderers among the former US executive branch &amp; start making a movement to arrest people while a real investigation is held.

       Seems like momentum was conserved to me- in the top floors that were falling. Even you admitted it was near freefall speeds which means there was some resistance.

       Like the science clearly shows, all three buildings on 9/11 were controlled demolitions, the only reason they can not and will not release any analysis of a steel framed skyscraper being completely demolished via aircraft damage and office fires, just office fires for WTC7, is because it wouldn't be consistent with basic physical principles

       Where are they? Why won't a single accredited scientist or engineer publicly debate the physics of the demolition of these three skyscrapers in a public forum, even when offered over a thousand dollars would be donated to their selected charity?

       You're making a mistake if you think the

       majority of scientists and engineers have looked into this issue in any depth.

      <p>
       Richard Gage and AE911truth set up their booth at AIA conferences around the country, and the striking thing to me is how few of the architects and structural engineers in attendance have even heard of WTC7 - let alone read the report.

       He actually says that he is embarrassed now that he didn't look into the WTC issue in more detail years ago. But as soon as he actually started reading the reports, he saw how shoddy and unscientific they were.

       It's amazing that a cantilevered support structure- a modification not part of the original building design- over a diesel substation managed to collapse when two giant sky scrapers beside it were dropping debris on it for hours

       Again, just looking at NIST's faq page:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         Did the electrical substation beneath WTC 7 play a role in the fires or collapse?
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        No. There is no evidence that the electric substation contributed to the fires in WTC 7. The electrical substation continued working until 4:33 p.m. on Sept. 11, 2001. Alarms at the substation were monitored, and there were no signals except for one event early in the day. No smoke was observed emanating from the substation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Special elements of the building's constructionâ€”namely trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs, which were used to transfer loads from the building superstructure to the columns of the electric substation (over which WTC 7 was constructed) and foundation belowâ€”also did not play a significant role in the collapse.
       </p>

       What do you mean by a complicated event?  From a modelling perspective there's nothing really complicated about this.  There's an object with a known mass flying into a static structure.  Then there's a static structure that's exposed to a known temperature.  What do you think is complicated about the event that would affect the model or experiment?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a truly weird set of coincidences came together such that only a complicated model could explain this outcome, than you are by definition entering into a very unlikely scenario to have occurred.  The probability that all 3 buildings collapsed is almost infinitely small.

       The University of Alaska Fairbanks created a model more accurate than NIST's. They have determined conclusively that the WTC7 collapse could not have been caused by fire as described by NIST. They are still working on explaining the collapse. You can read more here:

       Physics.

      <p>
       Itâ€™s simply impossible to achieve free fall speed with ANY type of resistance.  If free fall speed is admitted to and agreed upon (which it is) then there has to be ZERO resistance.  By definition, pancaking floors are providing resistance, so that theory is impossible. Simple physics.

       Yes, you can't cut off the top 20% of a structure and crush the rest of the (undamaged) structure with it. NIST didn't even attempt to model this they just said that after the collapse initiates "global collapse ensues". That is not good enough for an event that killed 3000 people.

       The silence of the AIA is extremely disappointing.
