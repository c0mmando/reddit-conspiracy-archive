      <p>
       So everyone living in the area has noticed these cords running across streets, under railroad tracks even through my yard and others. These cords go on for miles. My local news station decided to “debunk” the cords and apparently it’s a gas an oil company from Ohio mapping out the underground. They say the company is in the “right of way” running these cables through people’s property and staking them down. Last night, around 10pm until about 11, every 5 minutes or so my whole house would vibrate so violently it was causing my water I had on my desk to inch it’s way towards the edge. Woke my kid up too. Drove by a local Walgreens and witnessed an unmarked white van parked sideways, a cord running in and out while also being hooked up to a very large antenna. The light was green so I didn’t have time to get a picture, but next time I drive by and if the van is still there, I’ll snap a photo. I don’t know if I should believe my news station, but something is fishy. Especially as nobody was notified of these cables being ran through their yards. Thought this was something the conspiracy crowd could dig and maybe help get to the bottom of.

       The local phone company ran a cable across my lawn for my neighbor's internet connection. I called them repeatedly threatening to cut it. I would have if I didn't like my neighbor so much. If there's a cable on your property that just shows up, cut that crap.

       You would have to hit both the DR (
       <em>
        disaster recovery

       ) site for CME/CBOT at the same time and that is highly unlikely. They have planned for events just like this.

       I have been in both sites and the amount of tech and setup is ungodly. The amount of money used to build and maintain it is insane. Trust me... the trades will get through.

       Its not trades, its prices. A price feed from chicago, and if they have to switch to a DR price feed they lose their 3 second advantage.  They specifically spent millions running this single cable because it was faster.  (Although this was at least 5-7 years ago, it could be a dinosaur by now, but it was the same thing...a cable run in front of people's yards etc)

       I see these every so often as well, but they are always across a road near a traffic light, so I just assumed they were a temporary way to gauge the amount of traffic so they could program the timing for the traffic lights. Simply: car rolls over the wire and it registers +1; a week later a traffic light guy comes out and sees the wire registeres 255 cars in a time period, so he adjusts the traffic light timing accordingly. Maybe the wires can also detect/categorize the type of vehicle based on weight or number of wheels hitting the line, thus allowing them to determine what type of concrete or maximum load the road should support. Just guessing anyway.

       Modern seismic surveys use this equipment.  The vibration is a twist I have never witnessed. In north Texas they used three foot diameter metal cones filled with propane pressed to the ground and fired to effect vibrations that allow transcription of the subsurface strata.

       Gathering seismic data isn’t necessarily associated with fracking at all, just oil and gas exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there’s no way this company has the legal right to run cables on other peoples’ property...and why in the world would an oil and gas company explore where there is a neighborhood? Is anyone familiar with how mineral rights work for suburban areas? Is that even a thing? I mean, I know you hold the mineral rights for actual rural

       (like 20+ acres), but a house plot...I’m not sure.

       Mineral rights vary from state to state AFAIK, but there's nothing that requires an entity to own both the surface and mineral rights of a property. They are often separate and owned by separate interests. If you happened to own the minerals rights to your property, you could lease them out to an oil company and get a cut of the profits. With the advent of horizontal wells, it's more and more common for there to be drilling under residential neighborhoods. The drill site/ wellhead(s) can be significantly separate from residences with this method.  If an oil company is looking to drill inside the town, it would be very normal for them to run 3D seismic ahead of time in order to verify the oil reserves underground before drilling. Good on this guy for being vigilant, but chances are everything is on the up and up here.

       Wow, so the only mineral rights the company has to own is to the land where the wellhead is, not any particular plot the deviated well may pass through subsurface? That’s sneaky as fuck. I should know this...I work in oil and gas...but offshore is quite different than onshore I suppose.

       In situations like these it can be anything and most people will drive by and go hum wonder what that is and keep driving thinking that the "right people for the job" know and are doing what they are supposed to about it.  This is a perfect example for when people say how could X amount of people keep quiet and pull off blank conspiracy theory? It is just like this and thanks for pointing it out it MAY BE NOTHING or it could be very much something that most people will assume is none of their business or worry and will literally as it sounds let this happen in their own backyards. I say get pics if you can at least the hive minds can get on it and give us some answers. Peace!

       That's not my issue. You asked a question. I answered it. Maybe go to a city council meeting to get the straight dope on right of way and permission in regards to the seismic testing. I'm not personally very knowledgeable about that aspect in particular. If they don't have the right to do it, I'm sure it'll stir things up at least.

       Nestle is definitely a bane to modern society and needs to be shut down from depleting aquifers. However, be aware that this has no association with drilling for or producing oil. In fact, there are regulation in place to prevent waste water from wells from contaminating fresh water ( and yes, the adoption and adherence to these policies is widely variable). There is no water you get from drilling a well that is drinkable. Water is a big part of what you retrieve from most oil production, but it consists of trapped ground water that is thousands of feet below anything we would drink in different geological strata altogether or water that was previously injected into the ground to improve production. There are a lot of issues with this whole process, its safety, environmental impact, etc, but the water involved with oil production should have nothing at all to do with drinkable water.

       Did seem like they know more than they are saying though. This article or another states that there are 10,000 underground military facilities worldwide... They just never give specifics of what underground network America has... Cheyenne mountain complex probably tunnels across USA!

       As someone who works in subsea fiber optics, what makes you think fiber optic cable is too fragile for on land data use?
       <a href="http://suboptic.org/?dl_id=43">
        Fiber is regularly used for seismology networks.
       </a>
       Some of them even
       <a href="http://suboptic.org/?dl_id=45">
        provide power in addition to data purely over fiber

       .  I doubt they'd even have to use lightweight armor for a temporary unburied use, which could mean they are copper- (or any metal) free as they said, for a small repeaterless network.

       That looks like RG-11 flooded coax cable. We use that for cable installations for running cable lines between distances of 151ft and 250ft. There is no way that same cable runs for miles because it would lose so much attenuation after 250ft. Look for where it connects and reconnects, but if that cable is running for miles the receiving end of that is getting horrible service from whatever it’s collecting.

       According to "Oil and Gas Lawyer Blog":
      </p>
      <p>
       "The seismic waves are created either by small explosive charges set off in shallow holes (“shot holes“) or by large vehicles equipped with heave plates (“Veibroseis” trucks) that vibrate on the ground."
      </p>
      <p>
       Small explosives... well, that's your problem. Pretty soon you won't have drinking water after spent toxic fracking water is injected into your aquifer. you should sell your property before fracking operations begin to even set up and subsequently becomes worthless.
