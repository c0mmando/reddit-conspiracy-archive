    <div class="md"><p>If you believe in it, the very nature of destiny is that you do not have any bearing on your own.  If you believe that you are in charge of your own future outcome, then you do not believe in destiny.</p>

<p>By definition NO ONE controls their own destiny.  Belief in that is something different to discuss.</p>

<p>I believe the question you may have meant to ask is:  Do you believe in destiny, or do you believe you are in control of your own future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, this is a complicated question. I suggest you read Nietzsche&#39;s the will to power. He talks about this stuff. Ons OC my favorite parts is where he describes the purpose of man. It&#39;s been a long time since I read it takes about the purpose of man is to bring his potential to fruition. So when you ask about not being in control of your own destiny you need to first ask who has the power over you? Are your actions simply that of your own or are the carefully crafted reactions to a world of competing powers in your environment? It&#39;s possible to contribute to your own destiny but nobody will ever be able to be in control of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if it&#39;s your destiny to feel as if you were not wholly in control of your destiny? Haha. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fun question and really brings to mind the essance of what free will is in the first place. </p>

<p>I HEAVILY recommend reading The Drunkard&#39;s Walk by Leonard Mlodinow. It&#39;s about probability and randomness, and how our lives are governed by them. It probably won&#39;t give you the answer you were specifically looking for relative to your destiny or lackthereof, but it&#39;s enlightening nonetheless</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Destiny as something that is meant to happen?  </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s your destiny to not be in control. If destiny do exists, then the chaos that is life, with multiple events causing a reaction that is probably very difficult to connect to the first event, then maybe your destiny was to be one day at an intersection and avoid the accident of the doctor that is gonna cure HIV in the future.  </p>

<p>I think people confuse destiny with fulfillment. More than finding your destiny, you have to find who you already are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are subjected to a lot of stuff that are not in our control. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We cannot choose anything related to our birth and/or our genetic traits. That alone define a lot of what a person may experience in life.</p></li>
<li><p>We cannot control the weather</p></li>
<li><p>We cannot, mostly, control other people&#39;s actions that may affect us (for example, a drunk driver that passes a red light and hit you)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you start to think, we are able to decide and control, very little in our lives. Accepting this contributes to a better state of mind, because most of our stress comes out of our desire for controlling things we cannot.</p>

<p>long story short: we cannot control what happens to us, only how we react to what happens to us.</p>
