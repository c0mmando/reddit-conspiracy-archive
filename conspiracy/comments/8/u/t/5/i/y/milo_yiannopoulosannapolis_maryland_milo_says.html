    <div class="md"><p>Because the gun control debate is not really a debate.  And like you said, where&#39;s the solution to gun control that could have prevented this?  I personally feel that even if all guns were illegal, there would still be a similar amount of gun crime.  The U.S. has an attitude problem with itself, toward violence, and toward the value of human life. (Ironically, I&#39;m pro-choice and don&#39;t see that as part of the problem of valuing human life, but a symptom of a society afraid to discuss sex and imposes values about the utility of sex and procreation vs. pleasure, and the unwillingness of a nanny generation to properly inform their children of sex, the consequences, and prophylactic measures to be used to actually plan when you have children and prevent STIs.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t have to get mad about it.  That&#39;s what TPTB want.  If we start mudslinging at each other, we don&#39;t recognize or accept what we have in common.</p>

<p>I will concede most of your points, but it doesn&#39;t really happen all that more often than it did when I was a kid in the 80s.  Information is instant now, and death and destruction sell.  It&#39;s a sickness.  But anyway, you know as soon as it happens, and everyone everywhere can know at the same time.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like hanging out on social media.  When I was a kid, I came home, watched cartoons, did homework, went outside to play, ate dinner, went back outside.  Now kids come home from school and have homework, but they spend the rest of the night on games, social media, or youtube.  If they go outside, they&#39;re on their phones.  Completely inundated with information every waking minute.  </p>

<p>I never spent that much time giving a shit about other people&#39;s opinions and stories when I was young, or even into adulthood until I got my first smart phone around 2008.  If I cared what someone thought about something, I would call them.  Now you get everyone&#39;s unsolicited opinion in a constant news feed on twitter, reddit, and facebook.  At least with reddit I can decently filter who and what I want to see.</p>

<p>Tptb do want us to be focusing in on eachother.</p>

<p>But going out side is a devils dance now and days. You dont which preist is going to rape your daughter. Or which coach is gonna rape your kids. Or which cop is going to murder you on the side of the road. Although my background and where i live makes that unlikley. </p>

<p>And i think kods spend a lot more time outside than you think. This younger generation is getting a lot more human interaction than people give them credit for and they all appear to be on the same page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s remember, Milo is someone that thinks relationships between 12 year old boys and grown men is not only normal, <em>but beneficial</em>.</p>

<p>He&#39;s been a leader in the &quot;alt-right&quot; movement which has allowed the media to portray anyone even slightly on the right look like racist ass holes.</p>

<p>And now this.</p>

<p>If you ask me, it looks like he&#39;s nothing more than controlled opposition, who VERY LIKELY is involved with (or at the very least knows about) any kind of big pedo organization/support groups, and knows people involved. With the arrest of that 22 year old pedophile that worked with the UN and shit yesterday... this all seems too perfect for TPTB.</p>

<p>Maybe he&#39;s helping to create not just a distraction from the intense backlash that Maxine Waters&#39; comments have been receiving from the public, but a <em>weapon</em> that the left can use against people on the right, and even President Trump directly for &quot;being mean&quot; to the media (who lie just as much as he does, but we&#39;re supposed to forget about that). </p>

<p>This can allow them to attempt to further silence views they don&#39;t like, because they can claim that they are responsible for American deaths. They can claim that talking shit on the media is dangerous.</p>

<p>Combine all this with the fact that posts like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8ump5k/sheriff_multiple_people_killed_in_maryland/">this</a> in r/conspiracy, with 74 votes (aka clearly not a FP post) experiences voting patterns that make you forget where you are because it looks like r/politics or r/news (aka <em>HARD</em> vote brigading), and you get an event that should be called into question by every critical thinking human being in the world.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no such thing as coincidences. </p>

<p>The power structure is losing it&#39;s grip, and we are watching it go down in real time. Expect to see desperate measures attempted. And don&#39;t fall for their bull shit.</p>

<p>Milo said this in a DM to a journalist interviewing him. He was being typically snarky with a journalist. It was a private comment. Nobody other than the one person he said it to would have ever heard it had the person (who was trying to hurt him) had not broadcast it.</p>

<p>Therefore, if the shooter heard it and it inspired him to do what he did, he would have had to be a follower of the journalist that reported the private comment. They would have had to have heard it from them, not Milo.</p>

<p>I think it is a fair suggestion to tell you to research before posting, because if you had, you would have known that Milo never even said this publicly.</p>
