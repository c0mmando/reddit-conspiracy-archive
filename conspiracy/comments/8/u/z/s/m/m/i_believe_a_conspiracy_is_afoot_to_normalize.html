        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We know from our ability to read that several of the last few mass shooters have had contact with either the government in general or the CIA/FBI specifically. I believe that the intelligence agencies and/or the government/deep state are attempting to normalize mass shootings by lone gunmen in order that, in the near future, politically unacceptable opinions can be quelled with the “lone/crazy gunman” excuse being used to kill a few random people with the intended target also being killed. We’ve seen the government brazenly kill people before, but this excuse provides plausible deniability and scapegoats pro-gun people and mentally ill people so that no one needs to explicitly come out against them when they can simply be killed instead. We’ve seen less and less fanfare with each of the last few mass killings, and the media is covering them less and less. Socialist and/or third-world countries who have seen an increase in random killings have also seen an increase in politician/activist killings (see: Mexico, Columbia), and so I feel that we are also being groomed for this.</p>

<p>I, sadly, do not have evidence for this theory. It’s just something I have put together from a mixture of reading, observation, discussion, and conjecture. Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>I see what you are saying and agree mostly, but I also have some questions on what is a &quot;mass shooting.&quot; I live between Flint and Detroit, so I hear about a lot of shootings (maybe I&#39;ve been desensitized early?), and rarely see updates if the person was caught.

<p>as someone who left the united states out of fear something like this would happen to me, i believe this is true.  </p>

<p>i think it is also likely there will be a &#39;online safety force&#39; that flags people who are &#39;hateful&#39; or who knows what and these people might be put in jail for 10 or so years off of reddit posts from even 10 years ago, or some such.  </p>

<p>Everything we take for granted about the &#39;legal&#39; system is now in question, innocent until proven guilty, habeus corpus, free speech, and that thing where you can&#39;t be liable for a law before it was made law, yeah all of this could go away or is already gone.  </p>

<p>or some other emergency and when the dust settles a bunch of people will just be missing. </p>

<p>they know through data analysis who the &#39;rabble rousers&#39; are and i do not put it past these people to just say &#39;why not get rid of these thousand people and then rest a little easier&#39; </p>

<p>they are not americans, it is the country being run by the mob(and israel)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why it&#39;s better to have some levels of violence than a solid system of censorship: individuals doing things, some bad, is better than building a system of laws, enforcement, precedent, and social acceptance of human and speech censors.</p>

<p>Because a system is run by people in charge, and it&#39;s impossible to prevent those people from one day being evil.</p>

<p>If you hate Trump with everything to have, he is a lesson: he is in charge of so many systems that can affect your life. If you hated Obama or Nancy Pelosi... Same lesson. If you hate all this politicians as the same and evil... Same lesson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>indeed, well said </p>

<p>but what i have learned in life is that no one pays attention to us &#39;thinkers&#39; in the corner saying &#39;the long term ramifcations of this are shit&#39; or &#39;this is simply a thinly veiled control mechanism that is going to be abused from day one and you are voting for your own lobotomy&#39; </p>

<p>it is fun to think about things like this but my comment is about the need to realize that there is no way to stop these changes now, history is in motion and you can chain yourself to some statue as protest but the forces at work here are so far beyond the capacities of an individual that it is not worth discussing.  </p>

<p>we are seeing the fun parts of the internet gradually shrink while the scary parts enlarge and are put in the hands of the mafias and cults who hold the reigns of power.  this means all the fun shaped colorful furniture at google was just a mask over the prison they are building, one that is expanding into every aspect of the non-virtual world and gradually incorporating it into the model that is being overlaid it to enforce a hierarchy&#39;s structure.  </p>

<p>This means in large part that all of us tech and programmers have failed and that the &#39;suits&#39; and &#39;uniforms&#39; have simply used us as chumps to create a vast torture chamber for humanity, and I am no longer contributing to this effort under the now obvious veil of lies.  </p>

<p>Write back, would enjoy discussing further.  Your point about safety being impossible and un-safety being preferable to being permantently crushed by the boot of the state is important although I doubt there enough people on earth remaining with the capacity to grasp it.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>or... the mass shootings are meant to provide justification for disarming us.</p>

<p>Whenever you see a &#39;rise in something&#39;, ask yourself if there really is a rise, or if it just seems like a rise because the media is covering it right now.</p>

<p>The media were just caught in a lie about the number of mass shootings. They said something like 22 mass shootings since the beginning of this year. It was shown that they included all sorts of garbage and tied it into a list of 1 shooting and called it 22.</p>

<p>For example cop on minority shootings. Is it really &#39;rising&#39; or did the media suddenly decide to start covering every cop vs. minority shooting in order to make people feel like it was rising? Because you didn&#39;t really hear about them before.</p>

<p>Looking at the stats, the number of people shot and/or killed by cops hasn&#39;t really budged. But if the media now points out every cop vs. minority shooting and doesn&#39;t mention cop vs. white shootings, it would look as if it were an epidemic.</p>

<p>Illegal immigrants being detained and kids separated. Obama was doing this. Bush was doing this. Clinton was doing this. But now the media is interested in pushing a narrative, so suddenly it looks like it is &#39;rising&#39;.</p>

In order to cover it up from the gitgo that it&#39;s a political killing, they send a lone gunman in to shoot up the office or school, thus the political killing is hidden within the mass murder.</p>

<p>Not a very likely practice. Especially when they can suicide you, plant child porn on your computer and arrest you, kill you and make it look like an accident, inject you with something to make it look like a heart attack, just plain make you disappear, and god knows what else they can do.

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t think any part of the government really thinks that making Americans give up their guns is even possible. It&#39;s a Pandora&#39;s box that&#39;ll never be closed.</p>

<p>I do believe the USA is not experiencing the optimum level of health in mind and body. I would blame food corporations, FDA, the sugar industry, sugar-delivery system industry, cultural beliefs about eating, Big pharma and their opioids and other harmful drugs, doctors and their complete irresponsibility about pushing opioids, and the loss of mythology in people&#39;s lives. </p>

<p>A country in which mental health is faltering due to everything people are ingesting, stress, and lack of exercise mixed with availability of guns will produce what we&#39;re seeing. </p>

<p>Most gun deaths aren&#39;t these kinds of mass murders (I think only 1-2% of homicides are these kind of shootings), but good ol&#39; regular murder, suicides, gang battles, and spontaneous fights (often alcohol related). </p>

<p>The USA is a stable country on the whole. It&#39;s easy to focus in on news stories about political protest, mass murders, inner city gangs, and whatever else is in &quot;the beam&quot; and believe the country is going to hell. It&#39;s not. Year after year, I go through life rarely experiencing anything &quot;negative&quot;, unless I tune into the &quot;the beam&quot; (the feed of cherry picked stories from the billions, if not trillions, of things that are experienced in a day by all the human beings on earth). </p>

<p>It&#39;s vitally important to be rooted in primary reality, and not in &quot;the beam.&quot; The former orientation is reality as it unfolds, the point of personal power, and rife with potential for creative action and loving experiences. The latter (the beam) is a place of powerlessness, unresolvable mental loops, delusion, illusion, and almost always a real downer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about normalizing public executions...But I definitely think that all the mass shootings are being perpetrated by the Government. I really think it is just setting the public up to WANT to give them our guns. I think they are trying to creat a public outcry that will eventually lead to citizens calling for a ban on firearms. You don&#39;t hear about these mass shootings in other countries as much as you do here. There are isolated incidents, but it&#39;s becoming a weekly thing in America. </p>

<p>Once the public has had enough and decides that guns can&#39;t be legal anymore, we won&#39;t have the ability to fight back once the Government starts it&#39;s take over. George Washington warned us. Eisenhower warned us. Lincoln warned us. Kennedy warned us... And yet we are letting it happen. </p>

<p>I am not usually one to believe in the whacky conspiracies, but this one I believe in fully. There are dark days ahead if we don&#39;t stop this and make a change. Dark days indeed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why we need to use our rights protected by the 2nd Amendment and arm ourselves while we can. Train and prepare, find like minded people and form a militia. Talk to anti-gunners and show them the truth about firearms, why the Founding Fathers put the 2nd Amendment in the Constitution...its not easy, but it can be done.</p>

<p>For example, I know some gun control advocates - yet they call Trump a fascist and fear he&#39;ll legitimately become a tyrant/dictator. I&#39;ll make the point of &quot;And how are you going to fight an oppresive government if you disarm the people?&quot; Some think twice, others give the old &quot;How can we stand against tanks, drones, jets, and attack helicopters?&quot; Look at all the &quot;militias&quot; (terrorist groups like ISIS) still giving our military a hard time in the middle east, using old AKs and rusty trucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its important to make the point that arming as many individuals as possible is not to make us like ISIS (because to be honest, theyre not using rusty AK&#39;s, theyre using weapons provided by us and israel). The point is that when you arm everyday citizens, the prospect of instituting martial law by force would be completely unthinkable by any potential tyrant in America. It would necessitate killing so many armed american citizens to establish order, that no one would ever consider trying it. As it stands, our police alone has the resources to wipe out every major city, even if we were all armed. Fortunately, in the information age, something like that, ala stalin/mao, could never happen in this country...</p>

<p>TLDR; forming a militia is not the point you want to make, its that having armed citizens necessitates that any takeover be excessively violent, making the prospect of that takeover unthinkable in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a few challenges to your theory:</p>

<p>1) Countries like mexico and columbia (and others in south america) have a very long history of politician/activist killings...this isnt something new for them, and certainly doesnt correlate with increase in random killings recently.</p>

<p>2) I definitely agree that we are being densensitized to mass shootings, but I wonder whether its actually intentional or not. If we start from the premise that these shootings are to some degree orchestrated or allowed, I think the original intention was for them to allow stricter gun laws and more police in schools/public places to get kids/people used to increased police presence everywhere (I.e the long game being that the next generation accepts vastly restricted freedom of movement everywhere because theyve grown up with it). I think we are so easily desensitized to war and mass shootings mostly because of television, video games, etc...Just knowing what I know about neuroscience, I dont think that school shootings on the news (if orchestrated) would be nearly as effective in desensitization as these other methods, which points to an ulterior motive for them, in my opinion.</p>

<p>3) I think the difference between what you&#39;re suggesting and whats actually happening, is that most of these mass shootings today are happening to either kids, or seemingly random groups of people for the most part. If a trend started to develop wherein groups of people with a connecting agenda (like protest groups) started to be shot by &quot;lone gunman&quot;, I think people would quickly catch on. </p>

<p>Also, in the digital age, I think they&#39;ve circumvented the need to silence protestors....they simply control the message through news, media, etc on television and internet, and it becomes very easy  to coerce the public at large to believe anything...they dont really need to silence detractors anymore. Look at obvious events like 9/11...if they can pull that off in the media without having to kill protestors, imagine what they can get away with without any violence against americans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The effects are certainly the same, which is why it&#39;s not necessary to endanger oneself of being convicted down the road of 1st degree mass murder when you can simply stage a shooting, play some sounds of gunshots, post a &quot;shocking&quot; video to Liveleak which actually doesn&#39;t show anything, hire some crisis actors and, in accordance with the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act, employ news networks to tell your lies for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am really curious about the motivation behind all these &#39;there were no victims&#39; theories that come out every single time, even since 9/11.</p>

<p>To me, it seems like either a campaign to derail conspiracy theorists by injecting the most insane, irrational, and illogical conspiracy theory possible in order to discredit the entire movement or a simply the results of a contest to come up with the most bizarre theory to stand out from other theories.</p>

<p>If the government were staging a shooting to accomplish some goal, why wouldn&#39;t they just simply kill real people? This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Do you think they have some aversion to killing people? Some moral compass that says, &#39;I support staging a mass shooting in order to manipulate the population, but killing people is just going too far!&quot;? Especially considering that conspiracy theories follows with them apparently killing people that question or investigate the hoax.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bizarre. I think it is intentionally bizarre.</p>

<p>Most would be willing to entertain the idea of the government being behind mass shootings and terrorist attacks, but claiming that there were no victims doesn&#39;t make any logical sense at all.</p>

<p>Even if the people were actors in the event, it would make sense to actually kill them so you had less witnesses.</p>

<p>There is no scenario in which I can find any benefit or advantage to doing some elaborate hoax not actually killing people as opposed to simply killing the people. And nobody, to my knowledge, has ever offered an explanation for why they would do that vs. just killing them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The &#39;FEMA camp&#39; stuff is one thing that made me back up and question a lot of sources of CT. I live in a region that is effected by natural disasters. I&#39;ve gone to the &quot;FEMA camps&quot; in such disasters. They are obviously set up in response to what happened in Katrina as a means to house large populations of displaced people.</p>

<p>Could they be turned into prisons? Maybe. But as of right now, they are just already functional facilities prepped to respond to emergencies. There are no bars on the windows and no prison like doors on the front. People, even in these emergencies, are not stopped from leaving if they want to.</p>

<p>If they are to become prisons, they would need an awful lot more work done to them and would need to stop operating as actual functional facilities.</p>

<p>At least as of now, &quot;FEMA&quot; camps aren&#39;t much more than large buildings that have gotten money from the government to make specific improvements to their structure to be able to quickly convert into a space for people to retreat safely from natural disaster.</p>

<p>I have yet to see a FEMA camp that was just sitting there unused year-round with barb wire fences, gun turrets, and solid steel doors intended to keep people in. They are large gyms, auditoriums, warehouses, big-box stores, certain schools and colleges, etc...</p>

<p>Could they be turned into prisons? Maybe. But I will save my conspiracy theory of that for when they actually start to look like prisons. Right now, they don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The economy of sin (the CIA, the criminal netherworld) has grown overlarge and this threatening the &quot;reality&quot; of the rest, i.e. what people assume is the true or base reality of things. The economy of sin is distorting, jamming and interrupting the assumed reality of middle and working class lives. We now are fully in the CIA´s economy of sin (drug trafficking, gunrunning, and other dark money ) reality at this point, after all, no one needs to tell this to Mexico at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent theory. It definitely seems to me to be a ploy in the rise of fascism in this nation. The thing that convinces me of this the most is the recent deaths of journalists. If we become desensitized to the suspicious deaths of people who have the constitutionally guaranteed right to publicly dissent in mass media, then we have truly opened the doors to fascism in this nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I found a bug at Cisco they said they would never fix, then I found that the company hid evidence of the bug, but the bug still affected people, but not completely and tagged it, so the customer was outraged and returned $3Million of product.   But I&#39;m autistic and am told I am quite annoying.  Also a Trump supporter and a Christian, and all of those were given to me as reasons they hated me.  Any two of those reasons is enough motive for murder.</p>
