       Why wouldn't you think they were engineered is my question to you lol these people been blatantly pulling strings behind the curtains since they came to power. The federal reserve owns the USA. Our money are literally receipts for debt that us the tax payers pay for and then they have the audacity to fuck us over while controlling the economic  waves.

       They are engineered to consolidate and monopolize wealth for the largest banks and corporations.  During 2008 depression it was the smaller banks and businesses that faultered and closed-despite not taking the risks the "too big to fail or jail" banks did which contributed to the recession.  The TBTF banks extorted bailout money and grew larger to control even more of the market.   Most of these same banks were around-Goldman, Wells Fargo, Citi, BOA etc. And used the same tactics during the Great Depression.

       you'd basically want to sell your property now and move somewhere else til the shit storm blows over. gold always costs you more than you get back although its always a solid currency - unless youre buying bullion its not a great idea imo.

       I would recommend barrels of Beans and Quinoa in bulk. Quinoa is superior to rice in every way as a survival food and arguably stores even better. Also multivitamins, and of course water.

       That's poor peoples doomsday prep in a nutshell? Can't afford gold bars and crates of ammo? Get some canned goods, don't get shitty stuff plan like you may one day eat it. Keep a huge bag of beans and rice as an oh shit
stash. Don't forget seasonings sauces. Beans and rice taste way better with a dash of soy sauce and hot sauce. Salt cured ham can also be kept for quite a while. You also need water or a means to access  extract and filter a water source

       Replace rice with Quinoa. Quinoa is a complete protein by itself, and has more fat than rice. If you run out of beans, Quinoa will keep you going longer and better than rice.

       Cool. I've seen it in stores and has family that used various super grains but wouldn't have thought of it but will add some on your advice. How's the taste? One of my focal points is flavor. If shit hits the fan a good tasting meal will be one of the most luxurious things one could hope for aside from survival and access to modern medicine. Don't forget household products too. Extra toilet paper hurts nothing if you have the space as well as dental products and extra soap

        Here's the best description we found (from Dietriffic.com) : “The taste and texture of quinoa is a bit like brown rice crossed with oatmeal. It's fluffy, creamy, crunchy and somewhat nutty, all rolled into one.” It's versatile and can be prepared several ways.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Found that description on google. You have to rinse it first (it has a bitter and slightly toxic coating of saponin which quinoa adapted to deter birds from eating it), so just buy pre-rinsed stuff and it'll taste great, and be great for you. It is also gluten free, so if you have any celiac survivors with you, you're covered. It is on the low end of the glycemic index as well that means  that you don't have to worry about diabetic concerns, either. It can be prepared in as many or more ways as rice. Of course, if you want to know if it'll work for you, just buy and prepare some. It has an earthier flavor than rice, but that can be a strength. Black beans in particular go quite well with it.

       Totally if you have the means. Most people will need a tiller so if you don't have one find a friend that does. It's very laborious to do without tons of pesticide and savings wise it may be a wash depending on how valuable your time is, but it's a skill that would increase ten fold in value should famine or economic calamity occur. Don't forget the seeds. Non gmo ones without the self destruct gene dialed to 11

       Sixty days is the time frame for finding work (an entirely different concern).

       Now you're just ranting.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't even keep straight what the terms of the discussion are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  There may be a recession
       <strong>
        within
       </strong>
       2.5 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  In order to prepare for that recession, again
       <strong>
        within
       </strong>
       2.5 years it would be a good idea to stock some canned goods and a couple of months rent.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  Here is where you come in:  B-b-b-b-UT if you have 2.5 years to get ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)  Here is where I respond:  "Within" is inclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  To which you respond something along the lines of sixty days not being 2.5 years...
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, who knows what you're even getting at any more.

       <a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2010/3748hamilton_constitution.html">
        A Matter of Principle: Alexander Hamilton's Economics Created Our Constitution
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to the views of nearly all economic experts, there is a simple reality which
       <strong>
        thinking Americans
       </strong>
       must face in the midst of this unprecedented breakdown of the financial and physical economy: First, that the key to reversing this global crisis, which threatens civilization itself, can be found in the principle behind the economic measures of America's first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton. Second, that that principle is firmly embedded in the U.S. Constitution itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be those who yell and scream about this assertion. Both Wall Street financiers and unwashed populists will insist that Hamilton was an elitist who copied the British System, and that his institution of national banking and government promotion of manufactures and internal improvements was a violation of the free-trade system which has supposedly been responsible for our prosperity as a nation. But, they lie. For Hamilton was the intellectual author of the U.S. Constitution itself, and its unique principle of using a credit system, based on national sovereignty, to foster capital formation for technological progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hamilton's genius in economics was evident from almost immediately after he came to America's shores in 1772. By 1774, he was already writing anti-British tracts which contained the germ of the concept of national physical economy, in which he asserted that the development of the nation was dependent upon the promotion of agriculture and manufactures together. As he developed his ideas later, especially in his three famous government Reports—two on Public Credit, and one on Manufactures—Hamilton asserted clearly that
       <strong>
        the chief driver for economic development was the inventiveness, or power of the human mind, which expressed itself through the increase in the use of "artificial labor" (i.e., machinery), and was enhanced by the development of infrastructure
       </strong>
       . This concept he summarized as the "productive powers of labor."
      </p>
      <p>
       This intellectual foundation, which stands in the sharpest contrast to the bestial "free-trade" ideas of Adam Smith, was strongly informed by the political-economic ideas of the great German scientist Gottfried Leibniz, especially as they were expressed in the works of one of Leibniz's sponsors, French Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and the Swiss promoter of Leibniz, Emerich Vattel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hamilton, and his collaborators, most emphatically including Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, faced an enormous struggle to establish the institutions which would permit the realization of their vision of human progress. Faced with British determination to suppress any such development, they knew they had to fight not only for independence politically, but to establish institutions that would support such independence and economic growth. The result was the U.S. Constitution, which embodies the principle of the credit system, as well as its necessary complements—the National Bank and the manufacturing policy which, although defeated in the short term, eventually took off under the presidencies of John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, ignoramuses and Tories rave against an activist government, and can't tell the difference between debt incurred by speculation, and credit issued for long-term capital development. They claim our Constitution calls for giving free reign to the markets, and that the "government that governs least governs best." Their ideas, like those of the political forces in the United States who opposed Hamilton and his collaborators in the 1780s and '90s, serve none other than the British Empire, although today that empire functions as a financial system, not a colonial system policed by a massive army and navy. Thus, we have reached the point where patriots have no choice but to master the principle of Alexander Hamilton, now!

       I don't know what free markets you're talking about, but they have never existed in the history of human civilization and are impossible to bring into creation without absolute anarchy. The existence of government necessitates a limited "free market". Government is by definition a violent imposition of regulation upon the market, even if just by tax. That's fine, mixed economies are always superior to command economies are "mostly" free markets. It's all about balance.

       Well, i moved out of stocks after losses during the GFC- the money i was putting into my shares, i now put into shit that is far more useful than something that is rigged from the get go &amp; will continue to fail. If you want to hedge bets, go for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even moving 40% of stocks into fiat cash, which in turn can be used for preps or even stuffing under a mattress, makes more sense to me these days than losing money that could of been put into tangible assets that will lessen the discomfort of when it goes to shit again- and it will.

       and if you would have not touched them you would have recovered plus even more gains on top of that. You are thinking of stocks the wrong way. Over time...they all go up. That's just what happens. Yes there are dips, but you want your money to make money, not sit under the mattress.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you enter into the stock market, you are buying shares (not always but go with me here). No matter if the market dips, the number of shares you own will never change. You may lose money on paper, and a lot of people have realized losses because they panic sell. Wait it out. Time is always your friend with the market. That's why as you get older your portfolio should shift more towards bonds over stocks....more stable because you have less time left.

       At 25, it should be 6 months. 30-35 and up, you should have some type of mixture of emergency funds and personal saving that 6 months is just something you tell young people. It's like telling a toddler to brush your teeth twice a day.

       It's tough buddy. And it's not always possible when your just getting started in your career. Find a number or an account that you can set aside. Act like it's pretty tax money, whether it's 20 dollars a pay check or 100.set it aside before the bills are paid. You will get there soon enough.

       If you have capital to invest during a recession, you can make out like  a mother fucking bandit. In this situation we are assuming that we are going to be in a recession in 2.5 years (i.e. we know a recession is coming). Since this is the case, we must also assume that liquidating your assets in preparation for the recession which you
       <strong>
        know
       </strong>
       is coming is sound advise, because then you have a whole bunch of capital to put into the market and turn yourself into a multi-millionaire.

       This is a hypothetical scenario in which you know for a fact, there is about to be a recession. That's impossible to know, best you've got is a guess. It's objectively true that if you have capital during a recession you can make a fuck ton of money.

       Paying down debts before a crash is a waste of money. Your debts too big to pay down will destroy your credit all by themselves, if you default. It's a 7 year ding to your rating--it doesn't matter it is just one default or a dozen. Save the money for spending on what you need to get through the day/week/month, not on helping out your lender's bottom line.

       Im talking more about, say, a dentist bill you havent paid out- get rid of it, keep in good stead with the tooth doc, and if it goes belly up, at least you may get something fixed/ pulled out because he will have 100 other people still owing him cash &amp; refuse to do it, if your squared away with him, you would have a higher chance; remember, cash will still be good for maybe a week or so in a major collapse prior to everyone cottening on that it is worth a tad more than toilet paper (which it is really worth now, as nothing is backed by anything phusical, only IOU's)

       Why would that matter during a recession? I would not consider giving my money to pay off a debt when I have to worry about food. You're going to give you money to people who just want more and won't care if you have none or are even homeless.

       Just save money and prepare yourself to take advantage of the recession. It may only last a couple of months and not be all that bad though. People see the word recession now and think that means we will have a 2008 all over again. That hadn't happened since the Great Depression and more than likely won't happen again in our lifetime. There will be a bloodbath in the stock market on some overvalued giants, which is usually what happens and then the market will correct itself. If you have positioned yourself correctly, you will make some money. Just always go by Warren Buffett's investing advice.

       Realistically, it's a recession, not a fucking apocalypse. If it's like the tech bubble or the 07-08 recession you're not going to need guns and 6 months of canned goods to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay off debt. Save as much cash as possible. Consider moving money in your 401k / IRA out of stocks (maybe not quite yet, my rule is to move out when the market drops below the 12 month simple moving average (SMA), which we are close to, but not quite there).
      </p>
      <p>
       From a practical stand point, if you lose your job, get a new one ASAP. Even if it pays much less wage, keep a flow of income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just be prepared to be frugal and after 12-18 months throw your money back in the market when it goes back above the 12 SMA. And then maybe buy property while it's cheap if you need a home.

       all these people telling you to buy stupid shit you won't need. There will still be food and water, your bank accounts won't go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Want to make money? Buy put options when the stocks tank. You can make money whether the stock market goes up or down. If you have any investments now, leave them. They will recover. Don't panic sell. Time in the market beats timing the market 99% of the time.

       The biggest thing about 2008 was people losing their jobs. No jobs, no way to pay rent, car payments, mortgages, etc. Rule #1 of the collapse: PAY OFF DEBT NOW. Or better yet, don't get into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, get together 6+ months of living expenses. Rent, mortgage, utilities, food. In the short term, you might just be living off this. A smaller percentage in 2008 were hit super hard and resorted to living on what they had for a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, post-6 months, into years timeline. Having additional food is handy. Less you have to spend later. Might be good if it gets into the "SHTF" scenarios everyone dreams up. Way down on the list, firearms, flashlights, stored water, etc. As always, focus on this last. We're probably not going to get into this area, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally like a little silver on the side. Silver will go up, but it might always skyrocket too. Obviously only if you have extra cash to spare.

       Get rid of as much debt as you can before hand if you currently have any. Whether you own or rent make sure you have at least 3 months worth of mortgage/rent saved.  There next one will probably be worse than 08.

       Cash, food, any luxuries that you like you should stock up on - use a site like slickdeals.net to buy things when they are discounted.

       Extra cash to spend on things when the price crashes is useful as well.  Possible to get a good used car at a very good discount if the economy craters.

       I'm a veteran of multiple recessions and slow downs. The only thing you really need to stock up on is cash. Converting some r all of your investments into cash is a good idea, but really only if you
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       a recession is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said no one can really predict them with any meaningful accuracy, so just using everyday good money management is really the best long term strategy. Make regular contributions to low MER index or ETF funds (as much as you can afford) regardless of market conditipns, keep three month's worth of expenses in a savings account, and don't try to time the market.

       The image doesn't show a pattern. All it tells us is that we haven't gone longer than 10 years without a recession.

       We're already seeing it transition into a recession. I work day labor for temp agencies atm. We're the first to get cut, and myself and others have gone two weeks or longer and only working 16 to 24 hours.

      <p>
       That's cycling through 3 different temp agencies.

       Pay is getting lower and hours are getting scarce.

       It's a fucked cycle because most of these guys are homeless like myself, and now their best chance of income is illegal activity.

       My guess is that they wait until after Trump's re-election. This whole thing is feeling increasing "gamed out," they need to clean up a ton of other shit before they destroy the satanists' financial system.

       Possibly. But its optimum to keep the economy humming while they dismantle the pedophile network.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said....if the economy crashes and nobody goes to the multiplex, Hollywood collapses (maybe), cable/dish systems get cancelled/down-optioned (maybe), etc., and the entertainment cabal falls apart fast. Maybe.

       No doubt our economy is predicated on somewhat predictable boom and bust cycles. Profiteers know when to shift their money and win big whether boom or bust. Bit I think our current boom will grow to be much bigger and more sustained. Upswings usually lasts a good 8-10 years if you look at history, and the recession didnt end until 2012, so we still have a ways to go before another downturn. And keep in mind our last bust was statistically second to only the great depression. I think we'll have a longer and more intense boom than usual which will last roughly to 2022-24, with a moderate sustained constriction thereafter, of course this is precluding any major disaster or war. But the sun keeps rising, the world keeps spinning, and money keeps spending. THere is more of it in the US economy than ever before and it the whole thing is dependent on consumer spending. More money for people = more money for corporations and vice versa. We'll probably see one of the largest economic expansions in a generation, followed by a moderate corrective contraction shortly thereafter. Depression part 2 is nowhere in sight, in my opinion. But things can change rapidly in the face of unforeseen catalyzing events.

       You're right and it could be a 0.3% decline within the next 1-4 years. Most of these were the result of major political events, sudden and dramatic changes in policy, or corrupt, even illegal economic behavior, probably because recessions are largely the result of psychology. Belief controls economic success. Faith in institutions, corporations, governments etc.

       See a lot of moving money away from the stock market as advice here.  Always been more of a fan of dollar cost averaging and having a smaller percentage of my funds in equities than most models recommend for my age and much less so of trying to "time" the market.  I just assume the money I have in the market is there for the long haul and I adjust it down as I move toward retirement age rather than pulling it out and putting it back in every few years trying to predict downturns.  I'm pretty conservative though - usually no more than 50% in equities and the rest split between bonds and cash.  No right answer, I know.

       So if I look at your "time since previous recession" column, there really isn't a pattern. The time period ranges anywhere from 1 year to 10 years. You may say that a recession happens every 1-10 years, but that's a pretty board scope. Also, your upper limit for your 2.5 exceeds the maximum range of the highest gap between recessions, consideirng that we are at 9 years since the previous one.

       If it's a pattern then why is it going over 10 years since the last recession in 2008? That's never happened. Most have occurred within the business cycle which is every 7 years. There is only one other time in history where the economy didn't hit recession until the 10th year after the precious. You can wiki the dates too. Also, I didn't know we ever really came out of the last recession, some say we never had a recovery.  So what pattern are taking about?

       Your example that there will be a recession is the fact that economics haven't steadily grown for 100 years?

       That's because the government has been semi competent in stimulating the economy.

      <p>
       Bush's low earner tax rebate softened it - the housing crisis recession would have been significantly worse without it. Obama did a marginally better job, with policies like cash for clunkers, some green energy rebates and things for commuting.

       That's because how hard the recession hits will be direcctly tied to "who won the election"'s policies.

       we are soooo overdue to a recession. The cycle should've busted in 2015/16 (commodities crash) and within the 7 year crash cycles. A small correction occured later on, but we are back to record highs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course because of QE, ZIRP, and all the other financially wizardry being done nothing happened (well developing markets crashed, but nothing global).
      </p>
      <p>
       the crypto currency boom and ongoing unicorn startups are perfect example of how the market is overextended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some thought (myself included) that Trump would usher a crash (ie market correction), in his first year ("I'm the king of bankruptcies, and we ar bankrupt").
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet here we are, overheated, overextended, and with many of her safeguards imposed post-great recession discarded.

       Work for a major investment firm and our lead in wealth management is predicting a 33% chance of a recession this year and next. There are always ups and downs, nothing new. This isn’t a conspiracy theory, it’s a cycle that happens.

       Why do you say 2.5 years? I've been anticipating one for the last 2.5 . This is the longest run without one since the Great Depression. I feel the next one will make the GD look feeble. There's no room for stimulus as rates can't go any lower and M1 is so high already. Not to mention all the safeguard regulations imposed on Wall Street after the Great Recession of '08
have been either dismantled or weakened sufficiently to be ineffective. The next one could be a complete collapse that even the Fed and their minions can't weasel their way out of with our money.

       Why would that matter during a recession? I would not consider giving my money to pay off a debt when I have to worry about food. You're going to give you money to people who just want more and won't care if you have none or are even homeless.

       Replace rice with Quinoa. Quinoa is a complete protein by itself, and has more fat than rice. If you run out of beans, Quinoa will keep you going longer and better than rice.

       This is a hypothetical scenario in which you know for a fact, there is about to be a recession. That's impossible to know, best you've got is a guess. It's objectively true that if you have capital during a recession you can make a fuck ton of money.

       And you're the one who has an issue with someone responding to you. That is pathetic, especially since this is reddit where commenting to other others is a key part of the site.

       Cool. I've seen it in stores and has family that used various super grains but wouldn't have thought of it but will add some on your advice. How's the taste? One of my focal points is flavor. If shit hits the fan a good tasting meal will be one of the most luxurious things one could hope for aside from survival and access to modern medicine. Don't forget household products too. Extra toilet paper hurts nothing if you have the space as well as dental products and extra soap
