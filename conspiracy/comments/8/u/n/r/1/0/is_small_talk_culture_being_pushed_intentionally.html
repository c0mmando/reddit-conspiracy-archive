    <div class="md"><p>I slightly disagree. The fenomenon dates from the cold war and it&#39;s not a coincidence. Social media changes how we interact but the lack of argumentative is more due to the way information is fed through the media. We&#39;re conditioned to take our opinion from there and anything else different is the &quot;wrong&quot; opinion. Therefore since most segments last less than 5 minutes, good luck talking with someone about something he heard on TV more than this. He will be quite inconfortable going further in his arguments than the news channel. </p>

Most women and men under 35 were raised primarily by single mothers,  educated primarily by women in schools and universities, and radical feminism had become the status quo.  Every aspect of our culture has become materialistic,  superficial, and emotionally driven aka female.

<p>Incel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve commented in a response about that ridiculous term and it&#39;s use/proliferation <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8rtov8/jordan_peterson_threatens_to_sue_prof_who_called/e0ujsm4/">here</a>, when it was used on Jordan Peterson by a professor:</p>

<p>(possibly useful context for <a href="/u/IdmonAlpha">/u/IdmonAlpha</a>,  <a href="/u/Randy_Dream_Weaver">/u/Randy_Dream_Weaver</a>, <a href="/u/Employee_073291">/u/Employee_073291</a>, <a href="/u/SocialJusticeYamcha">/u/SocialJusticeYamcha</a> and
<a href="/u/dankweeddoe">/u/dankweeddoe</a> who are discussing the term)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So is incel, the latest term to be added to the deep and sophisticated vocabulary of &quot;these people&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s ridiculous on many levels. The claim of ‘incel’ is an unfalsifiable sexual assesment usually involving the claim that someone is unable to lower their expectations enough to have sex, or cannot get sexual attention from females (with the exception of prostitutes). Those who claim the former either claim the person’s value structure is invalid (Christians waiting for marriage, those who don’t masturbate, etc.) or is mentally ill.</p>

<p>For some background, this “Involuentary celibacy” drama stems from a small community on reddit (<a href="/r/incels">/r/incels</a>) which was banned in 2017. The reason the term &#39;incel&#39; was used on Jordan Peterson (a married man with children, who advises men to take their proper place in the world), is because it&#39;s become an epithet divorced from almost all truth, that&#39;s frequently used on “angry&quot;, sometimes &quot;white&quot;, &quot;men” by the the mainstream media, leftists, and astroturfing organizations (funnily when the sub itself seemed quite diverse).</p>

<p>Part of the reason he got called a &quot;white nationalist&quot; alongside &quot;incel&quot;, is because after the toronto van attack, the media tried drawing assosiations between other angry or disenfranchized men, lumping them all into one pile. In various articles, the MSM tried drawing an association between involuntary celibacy and right-wingers, despite the genuine right being in absolute anathema to that sort of ressentiment based slave-morality. News outlet articles would say that &quot;Angry&quot; , &quot;disenfranchised&quot; , sometimes &quot;white&quot; &quot;men&quot; were what constitute the violent incel threat.</p>

<p>The ridiculous concept of &#39;involuntary celibacy&#39; was weaponized in a kinda pied-piper sort of way to distract from real issues. The way the epithet was used, It similtaniously served as a defense for promiscuous hookup culture which hurts the the nuclear family, and offensively as an epiphet to browbeat critics of said hookup culture. More frequently, without the slightest care for being accurate, left-wingers are calling people &quot;incels&quot; and/or &quot;white nationalists&quot; in a weaponized fashion. The radical-left must keep hidden the big secret that right-wingers do in fact care about what’s best for women, children, and other ethnicities.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also unsure how much of this &quot;incel&quot; craze is entirely organic, as they seemed keen on a tactic commonly employed by shills called &quot;blackpilling&quot;, that makes it&#39;s target give up and lose hope. Satan wishes to sow resentment in everyone that he possibly can.</p>

<p>This is a programmed emotional response to words you don&#39;t like.   It&#39;s a feminine argument style and you don&#39;t even recognize it because it&#39;s the only way most people deal with disagreements in the modern world. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a shut-in,  I&#39;m not an incel.  I interact with more people in one day than most people do in a month.  Many more people than old rednecks think the way I do, Reddit is one of the few places we can speak our minds without being accused of wrongthink and having our lives ruined.  You&#39;re either young and haven&#39;t had enough experience in life to realize reality doesn&#39;t line up with your indoctrination,  or you&#39;re older and lucky to be sheltered from these hard truths.   </p>

<p>He could&#39;ve brought up social media/ubiquitous technology, breakdown of the family or religion, PC culture and it&#39;s consequences on free speech,  forced diversity of cultures but no diversity of opinion,   education style, soiled capitalism, fucking anything else.

<p>I mean most of those other issues stem from the unchecked female imperative, I&#39;d argue. But no true inquiry.  Hey, maybe for the sake of argument, grant my stance has some validity and we can talk about my opinion of my causes.   Or at least let the new idea lead you to your own research. </p>

<p>Nah, fuck that.   This guy&#39;s an incel. Probably a racist homophobe, too.  As if those words have any meaning anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When someone argues that &quot;Everyone does X,&quot; or &quot;people Never do Y,&quot; their thesis is automatically invalid, and I take that as evidence of a small mind incapable of nuance. If you said &quot;more people than before do X,&quot; or something that is at least plausibly true, I would be open to agreement, not that an internet stranger&#39;s opinion should really matter. Not for nothing, but I associate always/never statements with women, because that is usually where I encounter them in my personal life.

<p>Way too simple to be taken seriously. This does not fly with the part of society that actually makes the big decisions. You are a small thinker and will never be taken seriously by anyone who currently matters in civilized society.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t. Your statements are far too simple and incomplete to be accepted as true.</p>

<p>Women do have a lot more power and freedom than they did in the past, but the above statements are simply not true for everybody. I am sorry you feel you are treated badly and that women are running ramshod over society. Maybe certain types of men or male behavior are being squashed. Are you thinking that men should be free to be violent and to bang as many women as possible while married to a wife? If so, and if those are part of what &quot;man&quot; means to you, then yes I can see your point. I dunno, I just don&#39;t feel that in my life or the lives of other men, that we are being treated poorly. But maybe we have been beaten down by society to the point that our natural instincts are stunted. But, just because something has existed naturally in the past does not mean that it is good. It just means that it was good enough to make us survive. If population growth goes unchecked, as it does when males have their way, the species is in danger. Maybe a little shift in gender dynamics is a better way given the current circumstances. </p>

The majority of women are materialistic, superficial, and histrionic. therfore Feminism will lead to materialism, superficiality, and fucktarded, emotional, shaming comments like yours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shaming by saying your just like everyone else? </p>

<p>Let me ask you, how many women have you actually gotten to know intimately? There are definitely superficial materialistic people out there, but it looks like a pretty equal distribution to me. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;ve had my share of arguements with insufferable people who call themselves femenists. But claiming most women are materialistic and superficial?</p>

<p>Mad at women cause you can&#39;t seem to get one to like spending time with you. So it must be their fault.</p>

<p>Lastly, you are way more emotional than I am. </p>

<p>With all due respect, you’re acting as the mouthpiece for an ideology, and have no clue what you’re talking about. War, aggression, and the “need” to dominate forms of space are deeper human phenoma. They’re biologically rooted, and manifest themselves across entirely different species even. If you actually wish to understand what you’re talking about, learn about Jungian shadow integration [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exqL4C2u7HA">1</a>] [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBet_lgh4wc&amp;amp;t=5m36s">2</a>] and not some partial ideology that took you 10 minutes to learn. Also, throwing the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak, by doing &quot;our thing and toss strict gender roles onto the trash heap of history&quot; sounds utterly foolish. The most robust &amp; successful human cultures have all been phallocentric. Human existance has been characterized by pro-natalism, and men caring for women and children. Males which should be protecting ‘mother &amp; child’ are being coherced into abdocating their responsibility and completely giving up. The feminization that’s occuring is  extreme and completely unnatural. Worse, it’ll all end in disaster.</p>

<p>The west is clearly being feminized in favor of male-like insititutional authority. Our, shallow, nihilistic, pleasure seeking culture will passify and weaken the individual, the nuclear family, and  nation at large. Thanks to feminism, the &#39;masculine&#39; in male individuals is being attacked in favor of the &#39;effeminate&#39;, and/or in favor of never­ developing and remaining like a child. Males in the west are becoming more female-like, or infant-like, and thus themselves are more suceptible to male-like institutional authority. Nu-males, soyboys, cucks, etc. with a hard on for big government, will bring about the end for us all. The masculine male individual is what revivifies the stagnant state. Without masculine men, we&#39;re done for. &quot;Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create bad times.&quot; It&#39;s in these and other ways that modern feminism plays directly into TPTB&#39;s plans.</p>

<p>The sexes are being pitted against each other with these terribly flawed ideologies like Feminism. Instead of the fundemental narrative being one of males and females struggling to survive throughout human history together, feminism tries to say that history was characterized soley by the oppression of females by men. Ideologues are peddeling false ideologies that rejects biology and that sows resentment in individuals for not being more like the opposite sex. </p>

<p>Communism caused it&#39;s citizens to resent that they all weren&#39;t equal in wealth and subsequently tried bringing the rich down to the poor&#39;s level. Modern feminism cased the sexes resent that they weren’t all the same physically, and subsequently tried turning them all into females. Both pit percieved oppressors against those that are percieved to be oppressed. </p>

<p>In media nowadays under the guise of &quot;female empowerment&quot;, a shallow hyper-sexual hookup culture also peddles lies of “inconsequential” sex. Later on down the line, the cohercive welfare-state also plays the masculine provider role in single-motherhood that traditionally males in the close family would have filled. Children then growing up in single-parent households then become developmentally impared, as studies show both a father and mother are needed, further weakening the individual, family, and nation at large. Birth rates inevitably also go down spelling doom for civilization, as individuals wait longer to have children (if at all), use birth control, get abortions, lose their ability to pair-bond, don&#39;t wish to get stuck paying child support, etc.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Random selections will not prove right 100% of the time, but stop all together? Why? Acknowledgement of the truth is what sets us free, and creates oucomes that are better for us all.</p>

<p>Females are higher in trait neroticism and agreeableness on average, but  occupy more of the extremes. Males are more intelligent on average, but also occupy most of the extremes. In both humans and monkeys, males exhibit a greater male interest in “things”, and females exhibit a greater interest in “people”. The sexes are built and wired to fulfil different tasks, and compliment each other quite well. Females are hardwired towards the nessesary role of child rearing, while males are hardwired for the nessesary building and maintenance of civilization.</p>

<p>A recent large study including over 5k participants compared brain scans of men vs women, confirming differences. Men tend to have bigger, more specialized, and compartmentalized brains with greater variance in specialization than women. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sex differences in the human brain are of interest for many reasons: for example, there are sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits that brain differences might help to explain. We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44–77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.</p>

<p>Fear of being criticized. Fear of being wrong. The Desire to fit in. Lack of attention span. Big Pharma. Media induced. School brainwashing.</p>

<p>The other thing that makes it worse is anti-intellectualism is being called out by the very ones that ARE anti-intellectual. A good example is how most &quot;educated&quot; people feel that they already know the answers, so they refuse to engage in any discussion that may threaten their beliefs.</p>

<p>Media is currently attacking true intellectualism. Talk shows make fun of &quot;deep thinking&quot;. Everything is for a quick laugh. Hell, look at Reddit. It&#39;s all about the entertainment factor. It&#39;s mostly people attempting to be witty, funny, punny, posting pics of cute animals. That&#39;s one of the reasons I like r/conspiracy.

<p>Editing is so fast paced </p>

<p>They discovered that when the image changes, it activates a primal/reptilian reflex of re-capturing attention - whereas if the shot stays the same, after a few seconds your brain gets &quot;used&quot; to it and decreases attention. So fast editing makes people want to stay, and pay attention to whatever idea/product/program is being advertized.</p>

<p>I agree with you that small talk is debilitating. I can&#39;t stand it for very long. Imo it is a symptom of conformism and collectivism. Have you heard already that in the US, if you&#39;re polite, you don&#39;t talk politics or religion? That&#39;s because politics is increasingly tied to one&#39;s identity (just like religion), so by (convincingly) disaggreeing with someone you are attacking who they are.</p>

<p>If by that you mean the things that are bad and getting worse in terms of international relations or any genuine economic progress, wars, floods of refugees, etc. etc. there&#39;s definitely a sense of frustration and desperation that these are beyond anyone&#39;s ability to anything about and may get far worse before they get any better. </p>

<p>So there&#39;s a reluctance to both think or talk about them on the part of many ordinary people. Just as they are reluctant to talk about many of the things we discuss on this forum in relation to many of those ongoing problems and what&#39;s actually behind them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what OP meant, but I&#39;ve noticed that most people don&#39;t want to talk about ideas. They want to talk about people, events, and things. To me, &quot;deep&quot; could mean anything involving abstract ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you can&#39;t very well discuss quantum physics with someone who has no idea about what that is or any other abstract theoretical matters that they have no background or a sufficient enough understanding of it to be able to intelligently converse or simply ask any relevant questions about it. </p>

<p>Obviously they wouldn&#39;t want to appear dumb even if they are so shrugging off the conversation and appearing to be indifferent is only to be expected. </p>

<p>That takes in a lot of ordinary people these days considering what&#39;s happened to the education system </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if its that most people just aren&#39;t that deep to begin with?  They&#39;re mostly content with superficial reality and aren&#39;t really that interested in more than that.</p>

<p>I spent about an hour working on someone&#39;s computer yesterday and they worked with another co-worker on some manual task chatting behind me and I was astonished at how trivial and empty their conversation was.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that they&#39;re not capable of it.  Sometimes you find yourself stuck due to other circumstances in close proximity with them, and I&#39;ve found that they&#39;re <em>capable</em> of understanding more in-depth concepts if you give them the right prompting questions and they&#39;re in an atmosphere devoid of most distractions.</p>

<p>I think a lot of it can be cultural.  I find that New Yorkers will, by virtue of how MUCH they talk, will get to less superficial topics very quickly.  Midwesterners actually get offended if you try to talk too much and can be prone to just clamming up; having an opinion beyond &quot;that&#39;s different&quot; is a faux pas. </p>
