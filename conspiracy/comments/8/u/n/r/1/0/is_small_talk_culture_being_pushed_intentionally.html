       I am from Eastern Europe ans moved to North America’s couple of years ago. It’s ridiculous how people can’t stand deep conversations over 5 min long and then you get blank stare.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not trying to make NA look dull but it shocked me first time. All I can hear around is “yeah, yeah, right, ... wow”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed huge changes in mainstream drama movies. Editing is so fast paced so 70s-80s action movies look so calm now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst thing is that one looks so deviant if is not engaging in bullshit talks about daily news or sport results.

       Its social media. It has stopped real face to face communication. I would bet money that the people youbinteract with in person will talk more if you were text them. Its sad. Social media, including reddit, is tearing the fabric of human society into shreds

       That's true, but individuals weld power to end it for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surround yourself with people you love and teach them the truth of the world, yes humanity has created a culture of small-talk but you definitely don't have to be involved with it, you have the power to control a conversation for the better.

       True. It really comes down to the individual. I'm not the best at holding a meaningful conversation all the time, but I make an effort to be engaged. I also try and talk to everybody, including homeless people

       I slightly disagree. The fenomenon dates from the cold war and it's not a coincidence. Social media changes how we interact but the lack of argumentative is more due to the way information is fed through the media. We're conditioned to take our opinion from there and anything else different is the "wrong" opinion. Therefore since most segments last less than 5 minutes, good luck talking with someone about something he heard on TV more than this. He will be quite inconfortable going further in his arguments than the news channel.

       Agreed. I have a few very close friends I'll open up to and talk about heavy stuff, but in general I think the average American is just busy living their life and not inclined to get into a deep/long conversation with anyone they aren't particularly close to.

       The West is currently experiencing it's death rattle.   The feminization of Western Culture is what you're seeing.   Most women and men under 35 were raised primarily by single mothers,  educated primarily by women in schools and universities, and radical feminism had become the status quo.  Every aspect of our culture has become materialistic,  superficial, and emotionally driven aka female.  People are short-sighted and easily distracted; if you're not being entertaining or spouting SJW nonsense don't expect most people to pay you much attention.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's ridiculous on many levels. The claim of ‘incel’ is an unfalsifiable sexual assesment usually involving the claim that someone is unable to lower their expectations enough to have sex, or cannot get sexual attention from females (with the exception of prostitutes). Those who claim the former either claim the person’s value structure is invalid (Christians waiting for marriage, those who don’t masturbate, etc.) or is mentally ill.
       </p>
       <p>
        For some background, this “Involuentary celibacy” drama stems from a small community on reddit (
        <a href="/r/incels">
         /r/incels
        </a>
        ) which was banned in 2017. The reason the term 'incel' was used on Jordan Peterson (a married man with children, who advises men to take their proper place in the world), is because it's become an epithet divorced from almost all truth, that's frequently used on “angry", sometimes "white", "men” by the the mainstream media, leftists, and astroturfing organizations (funnily when the sub itself seemed quite diverse).
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of the reason he got called a "white nationalist" alongside "incel", is because after the toronto van attack, the media tried drawing assosiations between other angry or disenfranchized men, lumping them all into one pile. In various articles, the MSM tried drawing an association between involuntary celibacy and right-wingers, despite the genuine right being in absolute anathema to that sort of ressentiment based slave-morality. News outlet articles would say that "Angry" , "disenfranchised" , sometimes "white" "men" were what constitute the violent incel threat.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ridiculous concept of 'involuntary celibacy' was weaponized in a kinda pied-piper sort of way to distract from real issues. The way the epithet was used, It similtaniously served as a defense for promiscuous hookup culture which hurts the the nuclear family, and offensively as an epiphet to browbeat critics of said hookup culture. More frequently, without the slightest care for being accurate, left-wingers are calling people "incels" and/or "white nationalists" in a weaponized fashion. The radical-left must keep hidden the big secret that right-wingers do in fact care about what’s best for women, children, and other ethnicities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also unsure how much of this "incel" craze is entirely organic, as they seemed keen on a tactic commonly employed by shills called "blackpilling", that makes it's target give up and lose hope. Satan wishes to sow resentment in everyone that he possibly can.

       It's OK if you disagree, most people do.   If you can't see what I see, I can't make you.   However, maybe consider you're a product of the declining feminized society of which I'm speaking. Your response consisted solely of perjoratives and emotionally laden terms like extreme and absolute.   Try throwing radical or reactionary in there next time.  Your comment led credibility to my own but you're to blind to see it.  I'd debate you, but as any man knows arguing with women is pointless.

       Bro, there was no emotional baggage in my response. I was pointing out that your description of society is way too far to the extreme and simply not true. Real, live people are not the way you describe. You were spouting pundit-style, attention-grabbing nonsense. I thought about my possibly being a product of "declining feminized society" before posting, but that does not change the nature of your comment. And you still have not confirmed that your viewpoint comes from real life. It sounds like it is based a talk show script, not from actually meeting people.

       This is a programmed emotional response to words you don't like.   It's a feminine argument style and you don't even recognize it because it's the only way most people deal with disagreements in the modern world.

       I'm not a shut-in,  I'm not an incel.  I interact with more people in one day than most people do in a month.  Many more people than old rednecks think the way I do, Reddit is one of the few places we can speak our minds without being accused of wrongthink and having our lives ruined.  You're either young and haven't had enough experience in life to realize reality doesn't line up with your indoctrination,  or you're older and lucky to be sheltered from these hard truths.

       I mean most of those other issues stem from the unchecked female imperative, I'd argue. But no true inquiry.  Hey, maybe for the sake of argument, grant my stance has some validity and we can talk about my opinion of my causes.   Or at least let the new idea lead you to your own research.

       When someone argues that "Everyone does X," or "people Never do Y," their thesis is automatically invalid, and I take that as evidence of a small mind incapable of nuance. If you said "more people than before do X," or something that is at least plausibly true, I would be open to agreement, not that an internet stranger's opinion should really matter. Not for nothing, but I associate always/never statements with women, because that is usually where I encounter them in my personal life. Most of the men I hang with strive for intellectual honesty.

       Women do have a lot more power and freedom than they did in the past, but the above statements are simply not true for everybody. I am sorry you feel you are treated badly and that women are running ramshod over society. Maybe certain types of men or male behavior are being squashed. Are you thinking that men should be free to be violent and to bang as many women as possible while married to a wife? If so, and if those are part of what "man" means to you, then yes I can see your point. I dunno, I just don't feel that in my life or the lives of other men, that we are being treated poorly. But maybe we have been beaten down by society to the point that our natural instincts are stunted. But, just because something has existed naturally in the past does not mean that it is good. It just means that it was good enough to make us survive. If population growth goes unchecked, as it does when males have their way, the species is in danger. Maybe a little shift in gender dynamics is a better way given the current circumstances.

cannot see this lasting a lot longer at current rate of decline.

       Your standard of evidence is impossibly low. If anything, I feel more right than when we began. Every "argument" you and the other incels have regurgitated is based on blowing sand. None of it passes the most basic logical testing, so you have regurgitated the mere worthless opinions of disenfranchised media addicts.

       and the rest of you resort to exactly the "feminine" style that you wrongly accuse others of. You all have resorted to shaming by calling my masculinity into question and by comparing me to a child. In addition, I was labeled as "one of them" who is unable to see the world in your special way. Your opinions are just incel groupthink. Your datapoints are the impotent online festerings of a self-marginalizing cult. Your viewpoints do not reflect the experience of men who succeed with women by actually interacting with them and seeing that generally females complement (not compliment) males.

       The greatest divided among people isn't race,  it's gender.  You have more in common with a Chinese fisherman than you'll ever have with one of your own women.   Learn that early and you'll be fine.

       You do realize the basis for everyone's existence is reproduction, right? That's the driving urge behind virtually all we do-economics, war, art, etc all comes from the urge to reproduce. If there's a shift in the power dynamic between men/women that could have huge ramifications on a society

       I agree with everything you just said, but there is more at play in current events than a gender war. There are classes, races, politics, religion, and so forth. It seems that this person is hyper-focused on the gender thing to the point of handicapped reasoning.

       Saying things you don't agree with is communicating like a normal person.   And what you deride as redpill jargon was known as common sense for most of human history.   You realize that we are living in the most "Progressive" time ever and it may have unintended consequences?

       Being superficial and materialistic aren't a product of feminism. Feminism rejects those things. Human beings are emotional creatures, that's how we experience things.  You seriously need help if you really believe this garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Delusions of grandeur, thinking you see things that others can't.  Your just a normal stupid ape like everyone else bud.  Seeing what you want/expect to just like everyone else. Women are the obvious target of your anger be ayse none of them want you.

       Feminism isn't the dictionary definition. Feminism isn't about equality, it's about privilege for and removing accountability from women.  It's about believing in the Patriarchy boogeyman and therfore relieving women of their agency throughout history and today.  It's the primacy of the female imperative.  The majority of women are materialistic, superficial, and histrionic. therfore Feminism will lead to materialism, superficiality, and fucktarded, emotional, shaming comments like yours.

       Shaming by saying your just like everyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask you, how many women have you actually gotten to know intimately? There are definitely superficial materialistic people out there, but it looks like a pretty equal distribution to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong. I've had my share of arguements with insufferable people who call themselves femenists. But claiming most women are materialistic and superficial?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mad at women cause you can't seem to get one to like spending time with you. So it must be their fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, you are way more emotional than I am.

       What does "feminization" have to do with small talk? 90 percent of the small talk I experience is with men ("just business" nonsense and innocuous pop culture junk), 90 percent of the deep and actually meaningful chats I have are with women (those who identify as trans are pretty much 100% deep and interesting). Even worse is when men
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       they are having an interesting chat but are in fact full of shit and just enjoying hearing themselves talk and say big words. These are tendencies our culture has taught us (as men), and they suck.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were you, I would stop assuming men are naturally intellectual and women are naturally emotional (and thus non-intellectual and dumb).

       If western culture has become "feminized" in some way, this needed to happen because war, pointless aggression, and the need to dominate forms of space are the results of infinite patriarchy. Not that a lady dominated society is necessary either, let's just do our thing and toss strict gender roles onto the trash heap of history.

       With all due respect, you’re acting as the mouthpiece for an ideology, and have no clue what you’re talking about. War, aggression, and the “need” to dominate forms of space are deeper human phenoma. They’re biologically rooted, and manifest themselves across entirely different species even. If you actually wish to understand what you’re talking about, learn about Jungian shadow integration [

       ] and not some partial ideology that took you 10 minutes to learn. Also, throwing the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak, by doing "our thing and toss strict gender roles onto the trash heap of history" sounds utterly foolish. The most robust &amp; successful human cultures have all been phallocentric. Human existance has been characterized by pro-natalism, and men caring for women and children. Males which should be protecting ‘mother &amp; child’ are being coherced into abdocating their responsibility and completely giving up. The feminization that’s occuring is  extreme and completely unnatural. Worse, it’ll all end in disaster.

       The west is clearly being feminized in favor of male-like insititutional authority. Our, shallow, nihilistic, pleasure seeking culture will passify and weaken the individual, the nuclear family, and  nation at large. Thanks to feminism, the 'masculine' in male individuals is being attacked in favor of the 'effeminate', and/or in favor of never­ developing and remaining like a child. Males in the west are becoming more female-like, or infant-like, and thus themselves are more suceptible to male-like institutional authority. Nu-males, soyboys, cucks, etc. with a hard on for big government, will bring about the end for us all. The masculine male individual is what revivifies the stagnant state. Without masculine men, we're done for. "Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create bad times." It's in these and other ways that modern feminism plays directly into TPTB's plans.

      <p>
       The sexes are being pitted against each other with these terribly flawed ideologies like Feminism. Instead of the fundemental narrative being one of males and females struggling to survive throughout human history together, feminism tries to say that history was characterized soley by the oppression of females by men. Ideologues are peddeling false ideologies that rejects biology and that sows resentment in individuals for not being more like the opposite sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Communism caused it's citizens to resent that they all weren't equal in wealth and subsequently tried bringing the rich down to the poor's level. Modern feminism cased the sexes resent that they weren’t all the same physically, and subsequently tried turning them all into females. Both pit percieved oppressors against those that are percieved to be oppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In media nowadays under the guise of "female empowerment", a shallow hyper-sexual hookup culture also peddles lies of “inconsequential” sex. Later on down the line, the cohercive welfare-state also plays the masculine provider role in single-motherhood that traditionally males in the close family would have filled. Children then growing up in single-parent households then become developmentally impared, as studies show both a father and mother are needed, further weakening the individual, family, and nation at large. Birth rates inevitably also go down spelling doom for civilization, as individuals wait longer to have children (if at all), use birth control, get abortions, lose their ability to pair-bond, don't wish to get stuck paying child support, etc.

       Females are higher in trait neroticism and agreeableness on average, but  occupy more of the extremes. Males are more intelligent on average, but also occupy most of the extremes. In both humans and monkeys, males exhibit a greater male interest in “things”, and females exhibit a greater interest in “people”. The sexes are built and wired to fulfil different tasks, and compliment each other quite well. Females are hardwired towards the nessesary role of child rearing, while males are hardwired for the nessesary building and maintenance of civilization.

       A recent large study including over 5k participants compared brain scans of men vs women, confirming differences. Men tend to have bigger, more specialized, and compartmentalized brains with greater variance in specialization than women.

        Sex differences in the human brain are of interest for many reasons: for example, there are sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits that brain differences might help to explain. We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2750 female, 2466 male participants; mean age 61.7 years, range 44–77 years). Males had higher raw volumes, raw surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had higher raw cortical thickness and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume, total surface area, mean cortical thickness, or height. There was generally greater male variance across the raw structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.

       Also,kids are now conditioned from an early age in schools not to offend anyone. Under any circumstance. Safe spaces etc... This makes deep conversations a bit of a gamble. A deep conversation with a stranger has the potential to expose true beliefs, which might then be challenged, which might then offend someone.
Yes the future looks bright ;)

       Small talk has always been my single worst failure. It's so stupid. If I'm not talking, it doesn't mean I don't like you, it means I'm not sure what a meaning conversation with you would equate to. I oftentimes blow people away when I get a moment to have "small talk", cause my small talk is this stuff. Besides that, I only say what is needed for me to say in any given situation. None of this, "did you hear the storm last night?" Or, "the LeBron james, I tell ya..." Fuck that shit.

       "Retarded" in this context TO ME = not just ignorant but PROUDLY ignorant in a very.... aggressively persistent way that is currently affecting the rest of the planet. This in an of itself is not necessarily unique but the EXTENT of it, and the lack of much to offer in return is.... fairly uniquely American.... I was just too lazy to type all that shit. Also it's getting worse by the day. As far as immigrants, yes that is true but immigrants are banned now lol #WALL. Idk I'm probably just salty but.... this country irritates me more and more by the day

       I've noticed it in mainstream movies as well. I don't watch all that many but check out some of the hyped up blockbusters. The way people interact and talk to eachother seems to be getting very child-like and kind of autistic.

       I agree with the top comment, about it being directly tied to social media. People are becoming more shallow/narcissistic and so are their interests. I think it also has to do with the immediate availability of information (on-demand) and it's effect on our ability to remain focused on a single topic for longer than 8 seconds.

       I still have deep talks with people. I usually get a sense of someone before taking them on a ride. Doesn't work with the military down here in Destin though. I've tried with a few discussing Israel, and discussing the pawns subject. I only know a few that are open and will discuss it otherwise it's the same old same old Israel is our ally, those vids are fake, I'm providing for my family mentality. The easiest ones to talk to are pilots. They are chill and just love to fly and usually share common ground.

       This is hilarious and you’re spot on. We are a peculiar bunch, anal about shit that doesn’t matter, willfully blind about a bunch of other stuff. But relative to wherever I’ve been globally, our society sure does function nicely, at least for now still. Truth spoken by Eastern Europeans always stings but is so true

       Ha i've never really thought of it like that - you are so very correct in saying it is a culture issue. I believe it is the 'who cares' and 'what does it matter' western ideology mixed with social media that has made us this way - one is considered a kook if they like to discuss the inner workings of life.

       I'm not from NA but I too have this feeling, I'm not very good at small talk and don't like it very much. For me personally, the way of small talk feels a bit hypocrite, for example I worked in a workspace with a lot of girls as my colleagues and I've very rarely been engaged to a real conversation, to something deeper than your average "how are you" or "how was your weekend" and not expecting really hearing something meaningful in return. Of course there were some exceptions, but those people are rare. So it was kinda frustrating being there, all could I do was wait till it's over.

       This is one of my least favorite "kids these days" criticisms. We're only having such conversations because some unwritten rules say we should be. If we had anything meaningful to say to one another, it wouldn't be "small talk."

       There are a lot of reasons for this...
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear of being criticized. Fear of being wrong. The Desire to fit in. Lack of attention span. Big Pharma. Media induced. School brainwashing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing that makes it worse is anti-intellectualism is being called out by the very ones that ARE anti-intellectual. A good example is how most "educated" people feel that they already know the answers, so they refuse to engage in any discussion that may threaten their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media is currently attacking true intellectualism. Talk shows make fun of "deep thinking". Everything is for a quick laugh. Hell, look at Reddit. It's all about the entertainment factor. It's mostly people attempting to be witty, funny, punny, posting pics of cute animals. That's one of the reasons I like r/conspiracy. It's one of the few places people aren't afraid to have deep thoughts about serious issues. (regardless of the fact that there is propaganda in this sub as well).

       Yeah it is. It's an extension of the "no mind" New-Age mystic bullshit being pushed since the 60s counterculture/MK-ULTRA era. It's just another way to turn real life into Idiocracy so that the Satanic/Zionist powers that be can rule over us. They live, we sleep.

       no rule of law, no journalism, police state harassment for anyone who can actually think, no good jobs, all jobs are tyrannical nightmares where you are asked to do contradicting things and are routinely humiliated with lies.

      <p>
       With the exception of paddington and some indie films like captain fantastic, what you are saying about movies is true, they are brainless and an insult to the intelligence.  And also essentially military propaganda as the cia et al, and israelis, are running the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       and in general it looks like the place is run by some sick secret societies who are also incompetent and murderous.

       some make the comparison to NPC's, like a thinking person will get the same feeling walking around the usa as one gets in fallout 4 or skyrim.  that no one could really be your friend because they aren't programmed like that.  heck in skyrim you can get a party together even, but no so much in the usa.

       They discovered that when the image changes, it activates a primal/reptilian reflex of re-capturing attention - whereas if the shot stays the same, after a few seconds your brain gets "used" to it and decreases attention. So fast editing makes people want to stay, and pay attention to whatever idea/product/program is being advertized.

       I agree with you that small talk is debilitating. I can't stand it for very long. Imo it is a symptom of conformism and collectivism. Have you heard already that in the US, if you're polite, you don't talk politics or religion? That's because politics is increasingly tied to one's identity (just like religion), so by (convincingly) disaggreeing with someone you are attacking who they are.

      <p>
       If by that you mean the things that are bad and getting worse in terms of international relations or any genuine economic progress, wars, floods of refugees, etc. etc. there's definitely a sense of frustration and desperation that these are beyond anyone's ability to anything about and may get far worse before they get any better.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's a reluctance to both think or talk about them on the part of many ordinary people. Just as they are reluctant to talk about many of the things we discuss on this forum in relation to many of those ongoing problems and what's actually behind them.

       Well you can't very well discuss quantum physics with someone who has no idea about what that is or any other abstract theoretical matters that they have no background or a sufficient enough understanding of it to be able to intelligently converse or simply ask any relevant questions about it.

       Obviously they wouldn't want to appear dumb even if they are so shrugging off the conversation and appearing to be indifferent is only to be expected.

       What if its that most people just aren't that deep to begin with?  They're mostly content with superficial reality and aren't really that interested in more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent about an hour working on someone's computer yesterday and they worked with another co-worker on some manual task chatting behind me and I was astonished at how trivial and empty their conversation was.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't think it's that they're not capable of it.  Sometimes you find yourself stuck due to other circumstances in close proximity with them, and I've found that they're
       <em>
        capable
       </em>
       of understanding more in-depth concepts if you give them the right prompting questions and they're in an atmosphere devoid of most distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of it can be cultural.  I find that New Yorkers will, by virtue of how MUCH they talk, will get to less superficial topics very quickly.  Midwesterners actually get offended if you try to talk too much and can be prone to just clamming up; having an opinion beyond "that's different" is a faux pas.
