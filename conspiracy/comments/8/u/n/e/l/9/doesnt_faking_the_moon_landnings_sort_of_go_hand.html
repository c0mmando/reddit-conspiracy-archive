       I know
       <strong>
        alot
       </strong>
       of you doubt we ever went to the moon, yet FE is somehow a psyop to discredit the conspiracy community? I understand many say we faked the moon landings to "win" the space race against Russia. Honestly, that all sounds abit
       <strong>
        meh
       </strong>
       ... If NASA lied about us going to the moon, what makes you think the deception isn't
       <strong>
        much
       </strong>
       bigger than that? Also, this subject is so freaking cool, it amazes me that this sub is so hostile towards it. Doesnt smell right. Thanks for reading!

       Not necessarily.  Some believe the moon landings were faked for political gain.  Flat earthers say the moon landings were faked because, well, the earth is flat.  So they don't necessarily correlate.  There's actually different earth theories, mega earth, hollow earth, matrix earth, to name a few, as well as derivatives of them such as flat mega earth, or inside out hollow earth.

       It's like the application of a "backronym" that doesn't have meaning until you go back and provide the proper context. In the case of FE latching on to the moon landing, I'd say they're more opportunists than people connecting real dots.

       Yeah, because a flat Earth and space being a hoax sort of reveals religion to be true, a creator of sorts. Imagine what that would do for our collective consiousness... Pretty interesting.

       It does, but the effect is miniscule since gravity is a relatively weak force. Those particles of sand do get pulled towards the mountain, but they are pulled much more strongly in the direction of the center of the Earth, since there is a greater Vince traction of mass there. The gravitational pull of mountains is why you can see pendulums swinging differently near mountains.

       It's proportional to the mass involved. It's weak relative to the other forces. When we're talking about the mass of the moon and the mass of water in the ocean, tides are a natural consequence. Maybe you don't understand, and that's okay. I don't get angry at flat earthers, I'm just fascinated by them.

       I watched most of that but it seems to show a lack of understanding about the physics involved. It used the example of helium balloons floating up as proof that gravity doesn't exist. The reason that the balloons float is that they are less dense than the air around them, which as it is being pulled towards the center of the earth is displacing the balloons upward.

       Exactly, density explains it. Gravity has nothing to do with it. :-) Mass attracting mass is an unproven theory designed to make sense of a heliocentric universe. That is my belief.

       Difference is, gravity is the reason you believe in a globe Earth. Without it the heliocentric model falls apart. It's a magical force invented to prevent us from knowing the truth. In my humble opinion, ofcourse :-)

       It seems like magic because you cannot replicate the experiment yourself, I cannot get water to curve no matter how hard I try but I'm supposed to believe it's possible because of... Gravity! A theory that magicly just does what it does without nobody able to explain it. :-)

       The reason why you can't get water to curve is because you'd have to use a curbed object with greater mass than the Earth, otherwise the water will be pulled from whatever you're trying to curve the water around back towards the center of the Earth... Just as gravity predicts ;)

       There are many experiments that prove gravity! I already linked you to one. Here's another thought experiment - if I asked you to calculate the trajectory of a ball fired out of a cannon, how would you work it out if I have you the initial velocity, the mass of the ball, and the angle of the cannon relative to the ground? Is there a formula you'd use?

       Gravity wouldn't cause it to lose forward speed, but air resistance would. You realize every time that in a vacuum or not, the ball is accelerating downwards at 9.8m/s
       <sup>
        2.
       </sup>
       That acceleration is due to the force of earth's gravity at near sea level. Without gravity, can you explain why the ball will always drop at the same rate, even in a vacuum? And if you say the destiny of objects again, I'll ask you to explain how that would be any different than gravity. You haven't done that yet.

       Yeah that's how the Aztecs and Mayans had calendars more advanced than ours. Because they thought the world was flat.

       It has nothing to do with the bible and church because their book says the world is flat because it's made by some dude living in the clouds.

       After researching the Flat Earth for over two years I realized how batshit crazy globeheads are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially the fact that they believe an atmosphere can coexist next to the vacuum of space.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is impossible for a gas next to a vacuum to behave that way. Heck,even a small vacuum at sea level can suck up water against gravity.

       To be honest I wish it were called "Fake Space" instead of "Flat Earth." I think the concept of a flat earth has been so painted as an archaic and primitive idea that it immediately turns people off. Furthermore, it's a hell of a lot easier to demonstrate that outer space is a fictional construct than it is to show the shape of the earth. The "point" of Flat Earth theory is an enclosed system, after all. That's why it would need to be hidden. If the earth were a flat disc floating in space, but space were the way it is depicted in our education system, movies, and television, I don't see why it would need to be concealed.

       Yes, you make a good point and I agree. The idea of a vacuum existing next to a pressured system with no physical barrier between is impossible, gravity or not. Add in that the earth is supposed to be spinning around its axis while spinning around the sun while the sun is shooting forward while circulating in a vortex style pattern. All of these motions are happening simultaneously and somehow these gasses are just tagging along a ball of rock in a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, if space was real the shape of the earth would not need to be concealed, I think you have a good point with that.

       At sea level, there is 1 ATM of pressure (the weight of the atmosphere) pushing down on everything.  When you apply a vacuum, what happens is the water is pushed up, not sucked up.  At the top of the atmosphere there is no such pressure.

       “Math” doesn’t prove anything. You can pretend the mirrors exist and construct math equations to support it. The real funny thing is that you said you don’t need NASA then linked to nasa.gov.

       All you audience members are so fortunate as tonight is a full moon! Go outside if you can tonight and take a good long look at that big bright moon, also look at the clouds next to it. Also if you can do temperature readings take a reading from the moonlight and then in the shade. This information will bring you closer to the truth.

       Spheres have a “hot spot” of light that the moon doesn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the same face of the moon faces us at all times. It looks like a bunny to me. That’s how I recognize it. This is explained away by saying that the moon is “tidally locked” with the Earth. But, if anyone can believe that, I bet they also believe the insane claim that the sun is both 400x larger and 400x more distant than the moon which is why they appear the exact same size.

       Why is tidal locking insane? You can read about how it works, it's not as if it's just swept under a rug. They don't appear the same size, and the sun is many, many times larger than the moon. As for the hotspot, I don't know what you mean. I can light a sphere with my photography lights in such a way that it is evenly illuminated.

       My eyes tell me otherwise. How close are they in size, to fractions of a degree? Surely not so close that we cannot measure a difference at all. And even if we couldn't, what would that matter? I suppose I don't see your point.

       If you ever studied art, you would know when shading a sphere, the shadow follows along a S-Curve, it doesn't gradully creep across like how the moon does. Also it's impossible to create a shadow Smaller than the object casting it, another inconsistency with the moons shadow.

       Electromagnetic is two (or more) forces at work, the sun being the electro and moon magnetic. Look up some research on moonlight and temperature and you will find the opposite is true. The moon absorbs or emits a cold light that will decrease in the light, opposite of the nature of the sun.

       no. when you can see the moon on a clear night sky, its means little cloud cover in your area. which means there is nothing to keep the thermal radiation emitting around you and from yourself from escaping into the cosmos. which makes the moon light "feel" cooler; no clouds to keep in the loss of thermal energy, which is greater  than the thermal radiation of the moons reflected light.
      </p>
      <p>
       when you are in the shade from the moon and it "feels" warmer, its because what ever is casting the shade is both reflecting the thermal radiation back to you and producing its own which is also makes it feel warmer in the "shade" of the moon.

       I'm telling you the opposite is true and you can demonstrate this with experiments, the light in the moon is colder than the light in the moon shade. It defies known physics. Also women menstrual cycle is on full moon and seed planting is impacted by the moon, also coral reefs release their eggs all at once only during full moons. The moon is not what you have been taught.

       It’s doesnt defy physics, in fact it’s easily explained by physics.

       No shade means nothing preventing the thermal energy in that area from dissipating into space. No shade also mean moon light is shinning through in that area. The net thermal energy escaping into space is greater than that of thermal energy of the moons light. So the temperature in the area of moon light is less, since more energy is being loss in that area then being gained.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the shade the object providing the shade is also reflecting all thermal radiation back onto you and the earth, as well as creating its own, which together is greater than the thermal energy from the moons reflected light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore shade actually has more thermal energy because less is escaping than it would if there was no thermal reflection but moon light was still shinning in.

       That doesn't explain why the moonlight is colder than the shade right next to it. Also what are your explanations for the coral spawning on full moon? And women's menstrual cycles tied to the moon? Also why is there better seed germination during certain moon cycles? Hormonal changes during certain lunar cycles?

       Yes it does, did you not fully understand what I have explained twice now?
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon light is warm. Where the moon light is shinning (non shade areas) will have a lower over all temp because having nothing to create thermal energy, or reflect the moons thermal evergy which would be the thing the creates the shade, is not present. So even though the moons light is “warm” temperature is just the measurement of the average heat of an area, or in other words, average molecular energy in an area. Since there is nothing to create shade (which is also reflecting thermal energy back to the area) more energy is lost dissipating into space then is brought in by the moon light. So you have a net loss in moon lit areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the shade, the object creating the shade reflects back more thermal radiation then could be provided by the moon light in the adjacent non shaded area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biological things you brought up have to do with just how organisms have evolved in concert with the moon cycles and their natural effects on the earth, such as tides in the case of the coral, and perhaps the menstrual explanation is that women are more fertile in the time around menstrating, and on the full moon, it is brighter out at night so our ancestors stayed up later because it was lighter and fucked more, making menstrating in concert with moon cycles a more beneficial trait to pass down.

       Ok, so you're saying that these observable phenomenon is a passive evolutionarily trait passed down and not by the nature of the moonlight itself? How about the seed experiments? If you plant seeds at certain times during different lunar cycles it will yield different results. So next up is how have there been objects/blue sky/stars observed THROUGH the moon? And how come we observe the same side of the moon and it flips orientation depending on what part of the earth you observe it from? Also when half Moon and crescent moon can be observed regardless of their position in the sky towards the sun?

       So you are saying all 3.8 women on the world menstrate at the same time in line with the lunar cycle?  How do you explain women that do not? Is that a passive genetic trait that was passed down for women who do not for whatever reason? Because if so, than you are saying my explanation if equally as valid for why they do not vs do.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moons cycles are not caused by the shadow of the earth, except for eclipses. This is why you can see a half or crescent moon right next to the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a baseball and lamp in a room without other light sources and look at the shape of the illuminated area from different directions relative to the lamp. The different shapes of the moon is caused by the shadow the moon is casting on itself from the sunlight. If that doesn’t make sense, do the experiment I explained above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing other light sources through the moon is a well documented phenomenon. Gravity bends light. Different gravitation pulls can pull the light from start around the moon to appear in front of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is concrete as it’s the same issue time has with gravity, and why our satellites and super precise to operate at nano second differences in time because of the time dialiton from being so far away from the the earth.

       what i dont really get is in most flat earth diagrams, the sun and moon are under the firmament and not technically in the "waters above" or the heavens, so even in the FE model wouldnt moon travel technically be possible? for what its worth i do think FE has some truth to it

       Not sure, but I think most FEers would agree that in all likelihood the moon is not a place we can actually go, just because it's not necessarily a solid object. Even if it is below the firmament.

       If they realized they could fake the first one, why wouldn't they fake the later ones and just pocket the extra money, spread a few billion around to their friends? By the way over 130 billion dollars was taken from tax payers for Apollo 11, and if they didn't go and only filmed a few men on strings for a few bucks relatively speaking, where did all the rest of that money go?

       They had to make it look realistic, men on strings unfortunately even for that time wasn't good enough. They had to really push it, and perhaps they did share with their friends and that's where the rest went. They wouldn't fake the next landings, they have no reason to.

       Whether it was faked all the way to Apollo 17 or not, were the Russians supposed to not go ever? "They played golf up there already, what's the point in going now?" You'd think it was inevitable by now that every powerful nation on Earth would have wanted to put their first citizen on the Moon, the same with the first woman, the first black astronaut, etc etc etc., or to be the first to put a permanent structure, or  the first telescope there, on and on. But nothing in decades. They don't even pretend to go anymore. Next stop: Mars, same deal.

       The Apollo 10 photo of Earth from May 18, 1969, was the first photo of the totality of Earth from space.
      </p>
      <p>
       So once you realize the Apollo missions were all hoaxes, it follows that this photo was fake. What should it tell you that the first photo of ball Earth from space was fake?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Apollo missions also served to inculcate the notion that the moon is also a sphere, and a terra firma, a place where we can go and walk.

       Yes it does.  Giant rabbit hole. The interesting thing is what’s going on at the North Pole. Hyperborea, shambhala, etc...   I think the FE psyop is to distract people away from the north and have them focus on the south, ice wall.

       Idk, I would like to think we will but there is so much deception and distraction it’s hard to say. I think it’s all a personal journey in a way, and the truth is there, we just have to put the pieces together. But also, I think it’s a collective journey to try and wake everyone up.
