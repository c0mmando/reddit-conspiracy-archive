<p>It seems as though the recent upset in Boston, where a Latina beat the incumbent allegedly because she stated that he is white and doesn&#39;t understand what minorities experience. Based on this, people claim, is the reason she won.</p>

<p>Now, what if other races fall suit. And just race bait everyone into voting for them and against their opponent? This would bring about radical change, and possibly not in a good way.</p>

<p>My way of thinking is that it is best to hire someone based on their abilities rather than their race. When people hire/fire someone based on their race, bad things are very likely to happen. </p>

<p>I know how powerful the race card is, and I wonder how soon this will overtly be used in upcoming races. I hope this doesn&#39;t happen, but we&#39;ll see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were. Hell, I&#39;m ashamed to say that I voted for him and I&#39;m not Black. But just look at the statistics and it should become apparent to you that many, many Black folks only voted for Obama because he is Black.

<p>I&#39;d be curious to know how many black people voted for Obama just because he is black, versus how many white people voted against him just because he is black.  I know people in both of those categories as well.  Although to be fair I live in a smallish rural town in a solidly republican state, so I know a few more in one category versus the other.</p>
