       First and foremost, I'm not racists. I'm not advocating racism. I don't tolerate racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as though the recent upset in Boston, where a Latina beat the incumbent allegedly because she stated that he is white and doesn't understand what minorities experience. Based on this, people claim, is the reason she won.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, what if other races fall suit. And just race bait everyone into voting for them and against their opponent? This would bring about radical change, and possibly not in a good way.
      </p>
      <p>
       My way of thinking is that it is best to hire someone based on their abilities rather than their race. When people hire/fire someone based on their race, bad things are very likely to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know how powerful the race card is, and I wonder how soon this will overtly be used in upcoming races. I hope this doesn't happen, but we'll see.

       They're all Marxists now, this is the new normal for the Democratic party. This is not new, the far left has been operating on this for quite some time now.  I recall hearing Schumer saying something to the effect of "We don't need anymore white judges".

       It’s happening. It’s called identity politics. To them you are no longer an individual with individual rights, you belong to a race/class that is being pitted against the other races/classes.

       I believe there were many races who voted for Obama. It is possible, and unfortunate, that people voted for him solely based on his race. I don't recall him overtly using his race card against his opponents.

       There were. Hell, I'm ashamed to say that I voted for him and I'm not Black. But just look at the statistics and it should become apparent to you that many, many Black folks only voted for Obama because he is Black. He didn't have to use the race card against his opponents, it was enough that he was Black. Democracy is a very flawed concept.

       I know people who vote for people just because there is an R in front of their name and not a D, so it wouldn't be surprising to me that people vote based on other not important things like skin color.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be curious to know how many black people voted for Obama just because he is black, versus how many white people voted against him just because he is black.  I know people in both of those categories as well.  Although to be fair I live in a smallish rural town in a solidly republican state, so I know a few more in one category versus the other.

        It seems as though the recent upset in Boston New York, where a Latina beat the incumbent allegedly because she stated that he is white and doesn't understand what minorities experience.

       OP and his group of friends who are totally not racist at all yet hypersensitive to anything racial and collectively pee their pants at the thought of non-whites in power.  They claim this and they're all like, really smart stable geniuses.
