        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-28 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/slay_the_deep_state.html">slay_the_deep_state</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Even if it’s true, you might be wondering - why does this matter? Let me explain. </p>

<p>First a bit of background:</p>

<p>It’s open knowledge that Obama had several gay flings while in college, see here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4470040/Obama-s-sex-drugs-past-laid-bare-new-biography.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4470040/Obama-s-sex-drugs-past-laid-bare-new-biography.html</a></p>

<p>And that these some of these men were Muslim. </p>

<p>Now, <strong>this is not too important</strong> because at the time, he was a student and journalist, not a public representative. I don’t agree with his choices, but that was his private life before he was even a senator. </p>

<p>Here’s where it gets interesting. He kept in contact with the same men, even while in office:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Ryter/jon212.htm">http://www.newswithviews.com/Ryter/jon212.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/5354/confirmed-barack-obama-practiced-islam">http://www.danielpipes.org/5354/confirmed-barack-obama-practiced-islam</a></p>

<p><a href="https://jtf.org/obama-admits-hes-a-muslim-again/">https://jtf.org/obama-admits-hes-a-muslim-again/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.conservapedia.com/Obama&#x27;s_Religion">http://www.conservapedia.com/Obama&#39;s_Religion</a></p>

<p>Other general tidbits that offer clues about his faith:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his book Dreams from my Father admits in his own words that he &quot;attended a Muslim school while living in Indonesia&quot;. As such he would be REQUIRED to pray Muslim prayers.</p>

<p>In a rare speeches from the Oval Office, on Dec. 6, 2015 Obama devoted much of his 14-minute presentation to promoting Islam to the American people.</p>

<p>Obama said the Muslim call to prayer is &quot;one of the prettiest sounds on Earth at sunset,&quot; and recited &quot;with a first-class Arabic accent&quot; the opening lines: Allah is Supreme! ... I witness that there is no god but Allah ....&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One connection stands out in particular. His relationship with <strong>Raila Amolo Odinga</strong>, who was Head of the National Muslim Leaders Forum. Read the above sources. He kept in contact with him even during his presidency. He was part of a special envoy that visited the White House. Look at everything as a while. The balance of probabilities tell a story.</p>

<p>As I said before, it does not matter if he had gay flings in college. That was his choice. But the fact he he kept in contact with the same men when he serving as president (see Raila Amolo Odinga and others) , means that he likely <strong>continued these relationships in office.</strong> If this is the case then he cheated on Michelle and lied to his constituents. Had they known, he would have been impeached by a Republican House and Senate. A lot of the damage done during his tenure could have been avoided. It would have fundamentally changed the course of the presidency. This is not a footnote.  Read the above links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read my post again. I don’t care too much that he is gay and Muslim. The implication is that if he was investigated for any unrelated matters while in office, and he was asked about his affairs and connections, then he would commit perjury and face impeachment just like in the Lewinsky scandal. Unlike Clintons presidency though, republicans had both the house and senate and so he would have been forced to step down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying that ANY president that sleeps with someone other than his/her spouse is impeachable.</p>

<p>Even if this is true, what IS IT with Americans and this puritanical viewpoint? why should we care? In Italy f.ex. something like 50% of women have had an extramarital affair(!). The laws that lead to this invasion of privacy of the POTUS are a technicality anyway.</p>

<p>For example, I could say:</p>

<p>“Trump imposes $50b in tariff on Chinese goods one week before Ivanka has patents approved”</p>

<p>See how easy that is?</p>

<p>So if he was corrupt and was trying to help his daughter why would impose tariffs? </p>

<p>Face it, Trump is serving the American people, which is why he has an approval rating at around 80%. See my previous posts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes him easy to blackmail which I would consider unelectable.</p>

<p>But his sexual orientation is hardly the issue here. The issue is his fake family with fake kids to lie to the US population to make him appear electable.</p>

<p>But on top of that the guy was groomed to mock the US population and show the informed class that they could do nothing and that they were defeated. Just look at the obvious fake birth certificate which I consider an intentional bait.</p>

<p>Does anybody seriously think the intelligence/power(seems like a MI6 operation) which pushed Obama into office couldn&#39;t have provided either a perfect fake document or a better candidate without these flaws? </p>

I didn’t read super into that first article but what I saw was that he had considered experimenting at one point due to really respecting a gay professor he was close with but there’s nothing there about him having multiple affairs with guys. And even if it was true who cares. Trumps still in contact with women he’s been with before. Does that mean he’s cheating on Melania and should be impeached?
