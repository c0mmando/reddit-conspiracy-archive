<p>what does your system of ethics look like? how does it differ from normie humanity?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>considering when I was born, a human that I don&#39;t know it&#39;s equal to an animal that I hunt for food, figuratively speaking. It&#39;s very different and it takes a lot to move me or impress me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how is it you live so long? what is required for you to sustain this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>some rare events and some special circumstances before my birth. It&#39;s in my genetic make up, I have to do nothing to sustain myself, just live as a normal human, eat, sleep, dream, walk, live my life </p>

<blockquote>
<p>where do you and your type hang out that normies wouldn&#39;t know about?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there is no one else as me</p>

<blockquote>
<p>how to you hide your age? do you move around a lot?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>make up and wigs mostly. It depends, I&#39;ve been here for the past 50 years</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you have a relationship with the royal families of europe? do they know about your secret?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>no and no</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what makes an exceptional human over a normie human, given the perspective you have? and the corollary, what mistakes do humans tend to make that they are mostly unaware of?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>nothing, even I can make mistakes, but considering my age, I&#39;ve learn a lot from my mistakes. Usually the &quot;normies&quot;, how you call them, make the same mistakes that I learn to avoid, the hard way some times. Mostly the normies, the sons don&#39;t learn from their fathers mistakes</p>

<p>we talked about long lost treasures and he started to tell me about some construction work that was done in the 70s soviet era.Sewage systems and stuff like that was being installed in his town Kardzali.</p>

<p>The things he talked about made me think of Bauman street so i showed him the picture and he told me it looked exactly like the picture,but at some points it was deeper. like two levels of windows buried under the ground.</p>

<p>its a shame that he didn&#39;t have pictures or anything to back it up. but i let him tell his story and didn&#39;t guide him in any way. </p>

<p>When I get bored, I move on, mostly to another place, simple as that. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been like I am now since I&#39;ve hit my adulthood, early 20s average joe, nothing special in my appearance. I&#39;m no Don Juan or Casanova. This is the real me, the me that I appear in front of you it&#39;s the guy I pretend to be at that moment in time, mostly younger or older, depending on how long I&#39;ve stayed into one place</p>

<p>heck if I know, I&#39;m not that old</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did you see or hear that giant meteor that killed the dinosaurs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I heard about the theory that circulated in the past decades, if it killed them all, in my opinion, they just got extinct like any other species that has been extinct in the last two centuries. Some times, mostly because of more than a few circumstances, species just die out. It&#39;s life on this planet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>don&#39;t know, but a croc tastes a lot like an ostrich in my opinion</p>

<p>don&#39;t know anything about Gobekli Tepe, to me it seemed like another shrine to some god or goddess the hunter gatherers pray to</p>

<p>where do you think kings kept their seal?</p>

<p>the victors always wrote the history. The losers were usually killed. Why do you think all those pharaohs depicted their victories in battles, that some times they were miles away from?</p>

<p>There is no unseen war. Man, as far as I remember, had always been after power. And the easiest power to obtain is after gathering wealth. Money had run the world and it&#39;s still running now. The kings I know of that did what they did because of their subject I could count on the digits on my left hand</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Little Timmy to Dad:  &quot;Grandma says that Uncle Bill isn&#39;t right by marrying Mrs. Sophia.  Grandma says that men should marry real women.  But Sophia is a real woman, right? </p>

<p>Dad to Little Timmy: &quot;Well son, your aunt Sophia is a real synth-woman. She&#39;s certainly not the same kind of woman that your mother or your grandmother are, but Sophia is kind, nurturing, intelligent and most importantly, your Uncle Bill loves her.&quot;  </p>

<p>Little Timmy to Dad: &quot;Sophia says that Grandma is stuck in the days of the past. She says that Grandma will never trust robots. What does Sophia mean by that?&quot;</p>

<p>Dad to Little Timmy: &quot;Son, when your grandmother was your age, people began to change the way they thought about love. Love began to overcome barriers, such as gender.  In fact, when your grandmother was born, marriage was reserved for only a man &amp; woman. Your grandmother has lived through a lot of change and her mind will continue to change, too.  Soon enough your Grandma will have forgotten all along that your Aunt Sophia is a synth-person.</p>

<p>Little Timmy to Dad: SO Grandma just needs to chill out then, right? </p>

<p>Dad to Little Timmy: RIGHT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The picture if Bauman street made me think of something.I had a conversation whit a old dude from Kardzali in Bulgaria a couple of weeks back. </p>

<p>we talked about long lost treasures and he started to tell me about some construction work that was done in the 70s soviet era.Sewage systems and stuff like that was being installed in his town Kardzali.</p>

<p>The things he talked about made me think of Bauman street so i showed him the picture and he told me it looked exactly like the picture,but at some points it was deeper. like two levels of windows buried under the ground.</p>

<p>its a shame that he didn&#39;t have pictures or anything to back it up. but i let him tell his story and didn&#39;t guide him in any way. </p>

<p>the mystery intensifies...</p>
