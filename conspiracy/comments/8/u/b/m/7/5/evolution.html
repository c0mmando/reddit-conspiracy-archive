        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am a medical student. One day our teacher started discussing about all the anatomical changes that happened due to modern human habits, Like processed food intake has made jaws smaller with many newer generation kids never developing the wisdom tooth buds as they are vestigial, shortening of pinky fingers and toes due to no major use ( good riddance from stubby pinky toes) etc etc.</p>

<p>Now it intrigued me to do some research of my own. And if you may do so yourself you will find that humans are going to have bigger eyes, since size of eyes is increasing due to constant use in this digitalized world, blue iris becoming common, humans are getting shorter each generation, human skin is getting more darkly pigmented to adjust with uv rays, loss of muscle due to no major physical activities like hunting, running etc. And increased size of skull throughout the past centuries. </p>

<p>In short, here are the features humans might acquire in future </p>

<ul>
<li>large skull with small lower jaw, </li>
<li>big eyes with blue iris</li>
<li>3 fingers and thumb</li>
<li>slender body</li>
<li>short stature</li>
<li>pigmented and dark, possibly leathery skin</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, if you havent noticed yet let me point out, isnt it too similar to the grey aliens we are used to hearing about.</p>

<p>Here is my theory. So in future we are supposed to create time machine and what we see/know today are actually future humans . This would greatly explain why humans wont recall about time lost or event feel like they were abducted for days when they were not missing for long.</p>

<p>Why would future humans need present humans? </p>

<ul>
<li>study</li>
<li>correction of past mistakes </li>
<li>alteration if gene pool</li>
<li>retrieving past features like good skin</li>
<li>creating hybrids for beauty purposes etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other factors are..</p>

<ul>
<li>There are various types of aliens being suggested,  so the grey ones are possibly humans</li>
<li> flying saucers have perfect aerodynamic structure, maybe in future we understand physics behind it.</li>
<li>makes more sense for government to support humans from future to experiment and abduct rather than giving humans and risking invasion from another planet.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am open to discuss more about it. Kindly direct me to appropriate subreddit for this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many browsers of conspiracy reject macro-evolution entirely.  Because there&#39;s no proof or evidence that it happens - at all.  There&#39;s been tons of forged evidence that&#39;s been debunked over the years (Piltdown man etc) - Add these frauds to a total lack of fossil evidence.  And the fact that we&#39;ve never seen one species give birth to another - it has literally never happened.  People seem to just want to believe it&#39;s true because it&#39;s a simple answer to annoying question of, &quot;How did we get here?&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry probably not the response you were looking for, but discovering fraud in science is one of my favorite topics.  Cheers, hope you have a good one.</p>

<li><p>In 1905 de Vries found that some of his evening primroses, Oenothera lamarckiana, had developed a variant number of chromosomes that was not able to be bred with the original plant. The new species was then named Oenothera gigas.</p></li>
<li><p>A sterile hybrid of the primrose species Primula verticillata and primula floribunda were crossbred. The offspring were fertile, therefore showing macroevolution, and were named Primula kewensis.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Fossil record show macroevolution. </p>

<p>But no you cant see it in real time. It would be like saying &quot;I cant see a tree grow in real time therefore trees do not grow&quot; </p>

<p>So you have no response to the laryngeal nerve, mitochondria or the example of parents having children with mutations? </p>

<p>Explain to me what an adaptation is, if you could. I think that is where the issue is. </p>

<p>So you concede the other points I have made, right? You have made zero effort to explain why all mammals have a laryngeal nerve in the location that they do. Or that all cells have mitochondria. </p>

<p>I gave you two examples and you erroneously labeled them as an adaptation. The fact that you refuse to clarify or exaplin tells me you realize your faux pas and would rather move the conversation forward than have to address it. </p>

<p>Youre refusal to address any of my other points also tells you are stumped and cant come up with a reasonable explanation so again you would rather avoid them. </p>

<p>The rest of your comment is just a rehash of your earlier points which have mostly been addressed. </p>

<p>You are being purposely obtuse because you cant support your claims so you verbally attack others and shift the conversation away from your failing points. </p>

<p>Evolution is really just a philosophy - or a &quot;scientific theory&quot; - it is not science.  It is not real - it is not truth.  You can believe it if you want to, but the total lack of evidence, and the presence of only this type of theoretical explanation is quite telling IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct that species do not spontaneously create other species. This is a fundamental flaw in your logic. Someone taught you all of the classic misconceptions in evolution. Here’s what you are missing. There is a common ancestor between two species, we will call them A  and B. Well over time let’s say the common ancestor had 2 populations split geographically. Now the populations mutate independently of each other. 5 million years later the species are 5% different in their genetic code. This is not a lot but what if it means the two groups cannot interbreed due to the 5 % difference. They would be classified as two separate species.</p>

<p>My daughter is growing up every day in imperceptible ways (analogous to mutation) and I do not notice it. If I look back at pictures of her a month ago she is extremely similar with small differences. But compare that to the photos of her at a day old and she is worlds different.

<blockquote>

<p>Evolution understood as descent with modification is a scientific fact.  The arguments about the mechanisms by which this occurs, are informed by the hard sciences, and the soft sciences.  Molecular biology, I thin can safely be classified as a hard science to the STEM crowd, and it provides some of the most compelling evidence for evolution. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you really believe that it&#39;s science, can you please explain how, using the scientific method, macro-evolution was first revealed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are asking for a historical account, the answer lies that arguments about &#39;transmutation of the species&#39; were becoming common in the scientific community and than Wallace and Darwin provided accounts of how geographically isolated populations showed morphological differences, and provided a mechanism by which this can be accounted for.  So it was discovered by observation of the distribution of species.  </p>

<p>There is no macro-evolution.  Look, if you travel a centimeter a year, the distance traveled is a &#39;micro distance&#39;.  But travel a centimeter a year for 400 million years, and you went from Los Angeles to New York city a &#39;macro distance&#39; comparing your starting point to your destination.  </p>

<p>Again, speciation was observed in a laboratory setting by Lenski. </p>

<p>Or read about retrovirus DNA that becomes incorporated into the hosts.  We share viral DNA with primates, for example.  </p>

<p>This is your whole problem - you assume this is true.  You have no idea if it is not - you assume the evolutionary philosophy is true, therefore, you assume all change is actually an example of evolution.  Presto chango, science!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is your whole problem - you assume this is true.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t assume this.  This is a fact.  Every living organism is a result of descent with modification.  You are a product of your parents, and you are different from either one.  The tree in your your yard comes from previous generations and is different from them.  The cat across the street came from cats before and is different.  There is no lifeforms on the planet that did not arise from reproduction of the previous cell line.  Unless you want to claim divine intervention... which makes you a creationist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>evolutionary philosophy is true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>evolution is not a philosophy.  It is a scientific fact.  A philosophical position would be methodological naturalism as an epistemological position or a hard naturalism as an ontological position. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calling all changes &quot;evolution&quot; is the only way you&#39;re able to convince anyone evolution is real.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one is doing this.  Evolution refers to changes in the population as they reproduce over time.  These changes need to be passed down to offspring.   It  is descent with modification.  That is the definition of biological evolution. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps more accurately - circular reasoning?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no circular reasoning maintaining that populations reproduce,  that they change over time, and that these changes are passed down.  This is the definition of evolution.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacteria changing their food source is not evolution - it&#39;s adaptation to a new food source. The bacteria are still bacteria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just don&#39;t want to listen.  One factor that determines the SPECIES of bacteria are metabolic pathways.  A population developing a new metabolic pathway, is speciation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bacteria are still bacteria. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bacteria is a general term for one cell organisms that lack a nucleus.    There are many transitional arrangements whereby symbiotic relations occur.  These are precursors to multi-cellular organisms and one celled organism containing new organelles.  </p>

<p>I am pointing out facts to you.  Viruses have the capability to embed themselves in the genome, and be replicated as the genome is replicated.  Human beings share a lot of DNA with other primates in the sense that they have the same changes in the genome.   Think about that.  There is identical viral code embedded in  human and other primate genomes at identical places... </p>

<p>This is not a presupposition, this is an a posteriori conclusion.   Not only have your religious commitments left you uneducated in biology, its  has sent you on a road of philosophical misunderstanding as well. </p>

<p>Amazing!  It is precisely what is the problem.  Not only do you not have a coherent concept of kind, you have no idea what people discovered and have argued about speciation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacteria remaining bacteria and adapting to a new food source is NOT macro evolution - it is not new species coming from old species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To repeat a claim.  There is no macro-evolution.  This is a creationist canard.  What you refer to as macro-evolution is merely small changes added over geological time, in such a manner that the differences from the starting point to to the end are &#39;extreme&#39; in your subjective experience.   There is nothing scientific about the difference. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bacteria remaining bacteria and adapting to a new food source is NOT macro evolution - it is not new species coming from old species.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is precisely what it is.  A change in a population over time where changes are passed from one generation to the next.   It is witnessed evolution.   It is a change from one species into another.  You don&#39;t know the difference between a domain and a species.  Bacteria are a domain of life,  just like eukaryotes are a domain, of which humans and foxes are members of. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>We are not conversing.  You show a lack of knowledge about evolutionary theory, but refuse to accept basic facts and distort actual claims coming from the theory.  You exhibited the following rhetorical moves creationists make.  </p>

<ol>
<li>An appeal to kind as a meaningful biological division. </li>
<li>An allegation that Evolution is a philosophical commitment. </li>
<li> Use of &#39;macro&#39;-evolution as  a meaningful category.</li>
<li> Alleged presuppositions and circularity. </li>
</ol>

<p>At this point I would yell out bingo. </p>

<p>Secondly, I do not think mainstream appeals are meaningful in the context of scientific facts. </p>

<p>There are claims made in the scientific community and than there are distortions of those claims.  You practice distortion.  It would be one thing if you could accurately articulate that &#39;mainstream paradigm&#39;, and offer critiques, but continuously distorting it in order to push a creationist agenda is not it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, there is not and has never been ANY direct proof of one species turning into another or giving birth to another</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, there is direct evidence of speciation in a lab setting from the domain of bacteria, but evolutionary theory neither postulates that one species changes into another... populations change.  It certainly does not mean that one species &#39;gives birth&#39; to another.  </p>

<p>This is an example of a distortion of evolutionary theory.  So if you want to critique something, you should at least reproduce the claims accurately. </p>

<p>No, to repeat the point again, not only am I not providing many arguments, but you are not limited in terms of time... nor space in formulating a response.

<p>Your language shows that you are not familiar with science in any serious manner.  There is no proof, as proofs are the realm of deductive arguments like mathematics.  What there is evidence that supports the theory, and the explanation by the theory of observed phenomenon.   The evidence for evolution is overwhelming, all you have to do is actually read a little. </p>

<p>You can continue to repeat this as mantra all you want, but it is diametrically opposed to the facts.  Evolutionary theory contains plenty of &#39;theoretical&#39; explanations and arguments.  We can argue about what the unit of selection is,  we can argue what traits are, what are adaptations, how we decide something is a product of natural selection vs genetic drift.  We can have all these theoretical arguments, informed by the hard and soft sciences, but still not undermine the claim that evolution is a fact.  There is modification through descent of populations.   </p>

<p>I actually find what I do way easier to parse through than a plain old wall of text. Do you think this is somehow difficult? Have you ever tried RES? I can just highlight text and hit reply. </p>

<p>Its fine that we disagree but I will keep on responding like how I normally do. It is worth noting that in the 7ish years Ive been on reddit not a single person has ever had an issue with it. </p>

<p>So much for “I have RES so all I do is highlight and reply.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This only works for what you highlight and you can only hit reply once, so separating quotes out will still require &gt; use.  For instance I highlighted what I quoted and responded to that statement.  If I wanted to comment on another of your points I&#39;d have to copy paste it into my comment and put a &gt; in front of it.  So it goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Highlighted text and hit reply</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logical Fallacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Copy and paste using the &gt; to make it a quote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logical Fallacy.</p>

<p>All the highlight and hitting reply does is just copy and paste what you highlighted into your comment and it puts a &gt; in front of it.  So it just saves you a couple steps, but is still pretty handy in my experience.  </p>

It actually makes no sense if you just logically consider it for a few minutes yet you’re of course being assailed as an anti-intellectualist.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I think I can explain this.</p>

<p>You&#39;re making basically the one major mistake that every evolution non-believer makes, which is that you&#39;re underestimating the amount of time that macro-evolution is supposed to take. It is never immediate; it always takes a long, long time.</p>

<p>So, in answer to your questions: no, a fly never gave birth to a non-fly, etc. But you could say that the definition of the word &quot;fly&quot; slowly changed over thousands of years, so that a fly early in the chain wouldn&#39;t recognize (or be able to mate with) a fly late in the chain.</p>

<p>We do, frequently, see animals (and other lifeforms) giving birth to offspring that have slightly different characteristics but that are otherwise similar enough to their parents and peers that they&#39;re part of the same species. Stretch that out over many, many generations, and you get evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adding a huge time scale does not make the philosophical nature of evolutionary theory any more scientific.</p>

<p>There is no direct proof or evidence that evolution is real - none at all.  Why should I believe something when there&#39;s no evidence at all?  No way to test if it can possibly be true?  Sounds like pseudoscience to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there&#39;s no <em>direct</em> evidence, but there is evidence, from which we form a theory that attempts to both understand that evidence and make predictions. That&#39;s science!</p>

<p>Similarly, we have no &quot;direct&quot; evidence that the earth goes around the sun; we can not observe this phenomenon directly, because it&#39;s very slow and we don&#39;t have the proper vantage. We only theorize that it does so by observing the movement of stars in the night sky. It&#39;s a good theory, because it accounts for that evidence and makes accurate predictions about the movements of bodies in space.</p>

<p>Also as with the theory of evolution, as you say, it&#39;s impossible to prove that the heliocentric theory is true (at least with current technology); but it is possible to prove that it <em>isn&#39;t</em> true (if, in fact, it isn&#39;t true). All you would need is to observe a stellar body moving in a way that heliocentricity does not predict. Similarly, evolution could be disproven if, for example, a complex organism suddenly sprung from nowhere, or if you could disprove either the genetic theory or the theory of the age of the planet, both of which evolution depends on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a scientific <em>theory</em>. It&#39;s widely accepted as fact because it&#39;s a very good theory that does a really good job of explaining the phenomena we observe in the world around us. </p>

<p>Sometimes our limited human perspective -- our lifespans, or sensory organs, and our place in the universe -- mean that direct evidence is simply not something we&#39;re capable of getting. If only direct evidence counted, then it would be pointless for science to even try to theorize, for example, the origin of the universe. We weren&#39;t there to see it, so it would be impossible for us to even speculate on. This is, in many ways, the nature of science. If you choose only to believe the very narrow scope of things that you can see and experience for yourself, I sympathize with that viewpoint, but it&#39;s very narrow, and you&#39;re bound to only apply that standard selectively.</p>

<p>Think of all the scientific theories you <em>do</em> subscribe to, but for which you have no direct evidence. You probably basically accept, for example, the atomic theory of matter -- even though you&#39;ve never seen an atom or its component parts before. Lack of direct evidence of atoms doesn&#39;t mean the atomic theory is a &#39;lie&#39;, right?</p>

<p>This is not how evolution works, species don&#39;t just give birth to new species.  Populations change over time.  Secondly we literally saw evolution confirmed among organisms that rapidly reproduce, i.e., bacteria.  Read about Lenski&#39;s experiment. </p>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with the claims of the e.coli experiment.  As I have already said a number of times, changes or adaptations are not the same as evolution.  Has e.coli ever evolved into something else in a lab?  No, and it never will.  It will continue to be e.coli - generation after generation, though it may adapt to changes to some extent.</p>

<p>Exactly - thanks for admitting no species has never given birth to another - it&#39;s not how reality works at all.  Evolution is psuedo-scientific philosophy - it&#39;s not, has never been, and will never be science.</p>

<p><em>Humans share about 99% of their genomic DNA with chimpanzees and bonobos; thus, the differences between these species are unlikely to be in gene content but could be caused by inherited changes in regulatory systems. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) comprise ∼ 5% of the human genome. The LTRs of ERVs contain many regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation signals and factor-binding sites. Thus, they can influence the expression of nearby human genes. All known human-specific LTRs belong to the HERV-K (human ERV) family, the most active family in the human genome. It is likely that some of these ERVs could have integrated into regulatory regions of the human genome, and therefore could have had an impact on the expression of adjacent genes, which have consequently contributed to human evolution. This review discusses possible functional consequences of ERV integration in active coding regions.</em></p>

<p>&amp;gt;Evolution is just a story</p>

<p>Not even when you deliberately ignore the evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll link up but you won&#39;t read because it&#39;s that that&#39;s who you are but anyways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From skeletons to teeth, early human fossils have been found of more than 6,000 individuals. While people used to think that there was a single line of human species, with one evolving after the other in an inevitable march towards modern humans, we now know this is not the case. Like most other mammals, we are part of a large and diverse family tree.  Fossil discoveries show that the human family tree has many more branches and deeper roots than we knew about even a couple of decades ago. In fact, the number of branches our evolutionary tree, and also the length of time, has nearly doubled since the famed ‘Lucy’ fossil skeleton was discovered in 1974! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>here you can explore all the known variations of human species:</p>

<p><a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species">http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ardipithecus kadabba</strong>: Where Lived: Eastern Africa (Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia) When Lived: Between about 5.8 and 5.2 million years ago Ardipithecus kadabba lived between about 5.8 and 5.2 million years ago. Ardipithecus kadabba was bipedal (walked upright), probably similar in body and brain size to a modern chimpanzee, and had canines that resemble those in later hominins but that still project beyond the tooth row. This early human species is only known in the fossil record by a few post-cranial bones and sets of teeth. One bone from the large toe has a broad, robust appearance, suggesting its use in bipedal push-off. Year of Discovery: 1997. When he found a piece of lower jaw lying on the ground in the Middle Awash region of Ethiopia 1997, paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie didn’t realize that he had uncovered a new species. But 11 specimens from at least 5 individuals later, Haile-Selassie was convinced he had found a new early human ancestor. The fossils—which also included hand and foot bones, partial arm bones, and a clavicle (collarbone)—were dated to 5.6–5.8 million years old. One of the specimens, a toe bone, is dated to 5.2 million years old; this fossil has features of bipedal walking. Faunal (fossil animal) evidence from the site indicated that the early humans there lived in a mixture of woodlands and grasslands, and had plenty of access to water via lakes and springs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>maybe another one?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the earliest members of the genus Homo, has a slightly larger braincase and smaller face and teeth than in Australopithecus or older hominin species. But it still retains some ape-like features, including long arms and a moderately-prognathic face. Its name, which means ‘handy man’, was given in 1964 because this species was thought to represent the first maker of stone tools.  Currently, the oldest stone tools are dated slightly older than the oldest evidence of the genus Homo. Year of Discovery: 1960. A team led by scientists Louis and Mary Leakey uncovered the fossilized remains of a unique early human between 1960 and 1963 at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. The type speciman, OH 7, was found by Jonathan Leakey, so was nicknamed &quot;Jonny&#39;s child&quot;. Because this early human had a combination of features different from those seen in Australopithecus, Louis Leakey, South African scientist Philip Tobias, and British scientist John Napier declared these fossils a new species, and called them Homo habilis (meaning &#39;handy man&#39;), because they suspected that it was this slightly larger-brained early human that made the thousands of stone tools also found at Olduvai Gorge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess that&#39;s just religion. Now about dna:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DNA shapes how an organism grows up and the physiology of its blood, bone, and brains.
DNA is thus especially important in the study of evolution. The amount of difference in DNA is a test of the difference between one species and another – and thus how closely or distantly related they are.
While the genetic difference between individual humans today is minuscule – about 0.1%, on average – study of the same aspects of the chimpanzee genome indicates a difference of about 1.2%. The bonobo (Pan paniscus), which is the close cousin of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), differs from humans to the same degree. The DNA difference with gorillas, another of the African apes, is about 1.6%. Most importantly, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans all show this same amount of difference from gorillas. A difference of 3.1% distinguishes us and the African apes from the Asian great ape, the orangutan. How do the monkeys stack up?  All of the great apes and humans differ from rhesus monkeys, for example, by about 7% in their DNA.
Geneticists have come up with a variety of ways of calculating the percentages, which give different impressions about how similar chimpanzees and humans are. The 1.2% chimp-human distinction, for example, involves a measurement of only substitutions in the base building blocks of those genes that chimpanzees and humans share. <strong>A comparison of the entire genome, however, indicates that segments of DNA have also been deleted, duplicated over and over, or inserted from one part of the genome into another.</strong> When these differences are counted, there is an additional 4 to 5% distinction between the human and chimpanzee genomes.
No matter how the calculation is done, the big point still holds: <strong>humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos are more closely related to one another than either is to gorillas or any other primate. From the perspective of this powerful test of biological kinship, humans are not only related to the great apes – we are one.</strong> The DNA evidence leaves us with one of the greatest surprises in biology: the wall between human, on the one hand, and ape or animal, on the other, has been breached. The human evolutionary tree is embedded within the great apes.
<strong>The strong similarities between humans and the African great apes led Charles Darwin in 1871 to predict that Africa was the likely place where the human lineage branched off from other animals – that is, the place where the common ancestor of chimpanzees, humans, and gorillas once lived</strong>. The DNA evidence shows an amazing confirmation of this daring prediction. The African great apes, including humans, have a closer kinship bond with one another than the African apes have with orangutans or other primates. Hardly ever has a scientific prediction so bold, so ‘out there’ for its time, been upheld as the one made in 1871 – that human evolution began in Africa.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapomorphy_and_apomorphy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapomorphy_and_apomorphy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In phylogenetics, apomorphy and synapomorphy refer to derived characters of a clade – characters or traits that are derived from ancestral characters over evolutionary history.[2] An apomorphy is a character that is different from the form found in an ancestor, i.e., an innovation, that sets the clade apart (&quot;apo&quot;) from other clades. A synapomorphy is a shared (&quot;syn&quot;) apomorphy that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>religion?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most important discoveries that lead to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution was extinct animals found as fossils. Early paleontologists, like Charles Lyell and George Cuvier, noticed a very simple fact: Species that lived in the past are very often drastically, wildly different from anything alive today. Trilobites, dinosaurs, giant sloths, baculites, etc., they all suggest that life on Earth has changed quite a bit.
That would be interesting enough on its own. What makes it more interesting is that, the further back one goes, the more different the species appear when compared to today’s species. These overarching trends can also be seen on the individual level, as lineages can be seen changing over time.
How do we know, though, that fossil progressions don’t just represent separate, unrelated species?  First, they have similarities that suggest they are related (see above reasoning concerning similarities between species). Secondly, they represent a trend, also known as a progression of change. For instance, over time, the species go from low expression of a certain trait to intermediate expression to high expression. Like the evolution of legs, for example. In fact, since we are on the topic, there is no missing link in evolution.
Lastly, the fossils are dated and organized by direct means (like radiometric dating) or indirect means (like relative dating using unique marker layers, fossils, or other techniques).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you even know what both &#39;religion&#39; and &#39;science&#39; means LMAO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turn over a manufactured product today, and you are likely to see a small sticker or tag that says what country it was made in. Like those tags, species bear the marks of where they came from. These signs of origin might come in the form of repurposed traits, traits that hurt a species chances of surviving or reproducing. Put simply, species are flawed, and it’s these flaws that clearly tell of their natural origin.
What’s so powerful about learning these three basic facts about evolution is that you now have the ability to look at any species and ask yourself these questions:
Does this species share similarities with other species that might suggest that they are closely related?
Are there progressions of change for this species that we can see in the fossil record, recorded history, or across geography?
Does this species have any traits that are the remnants of past generations?
Those three simple questions can, if you let them, transform the way you look at the biological realm around you. Go ahead. Ask away. Biology will never look the same.</p>

<p>How is what you&#39;re doing any different. I did a degree mainly focused on evolutionary bio and taxonomy of various groups, and your dismissal of evidence no matter how compelling is really only making you look like a fool to the educated, and this is me trying not to belittle you because I see what point you&#39;re trying to make. You don&#39;t understand the meaning of science if you think it is any sort of religion besides calling it blind belief. Science is compiling evidence that either supports a hypothesis or dismisses it. Nothing should ever be taken as absolute fact in science, EVER, and should always have room to be disproven. Theories like evolution cannot be disproven or proven and that is what constitutes a true theory, and that is the closest thing in science you will come to a fact, apart from laws.</p>

<p>Evolution does not lead to speciation, speciation IS evolution. The natural world is far more complex than you are making it out to be. A thousand microevolutions in isolation will lead to macroevolution, unless you are suggesting that this planet hasn&#39;t been around that long. </p>

<p>I sincerely doubt you&#39;re qualified at all - all you&#39;ve done is change your definitions around so that the current world proves evolution is true - you have no examples, no hard evidence at all - at best you&#39;ve only provided a circular argument.</p>

<p>Please provide any proof that evolution is real, and please provide proof that you have the educational background you claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did not move definitions around. I am giving you the correct definitions. Again, you can google those.</p>

<p>And what do you expect me to do, flash my degree? Take pictures of my textbooks? If I had them with me I would take pics of the definitions you assume I&#39;m making up. Would that somehow make me more credible to you, because you seem beyond convincing, even if I had a doctorate, you would just say I am a priest in a religion of falsities.</p>

<p>As for hard proof, the only thing I can give you are journal articles that point towards it.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/91/10/4599.short">http://www.pnas.org/content/91/10/4599.short</a> in article this four species of Oyster Mushroom are gathered, rDNA sequences are compared to the geographic region and the phylogenies synchronize with the gene sequences</p>

It&#39;s a speculative narrative on how life could have formed and how it could have become diverse - it&#39;s also not falsifiable, which is another requirement of science.  Evolution is merely speculation.</p>

<p>Again there is evidence you just say it doesn&#39;t count because it doesn&#39;t follow your own personal definition of scientific method that you refuse to share.</p>

<p>Part of thinking scientifically requires those involved to agree to the definition of terms, that you refuse to define your terms leads evidence to the fact that you aren&#39;t thinking scientifically.</p>

<p>Not even when you deliberately ignore the evidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll link up but you won&#39;t read because it&#39;s that that&#39;s who you are but anyways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From skeletons to teeth, early human fossils have been found of more than 6,000 individuals. While people used to think that there was a single line of human species, with one evolving after the other in an inevitable march towards modern humans, we now know this is not the case. Like most other mammals, we are part of a large and diverse family tree.  Fossil discoveries show that the human family tree has many more branches and deeper roots than we knew about even a couple of decades ago. In fact, the number of branches our evolutionary tree, and also the length of time, has nearly doubled since the famed ‘Lucy’ fossil skeleton was discovered in 1974! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>here you can explore all the known variations of human species:</p>

<p><a href="http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species">http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ardipithecus kadabba</strong>: Where Lived: Eastern Africa (Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia) When Lived: Between about 5.8 and 5.2 million years ago Ardipithecus kadabba lived between about 5.8 and 5.2 million years ago. Ardipithecus kadabba was bipedal (walked upright), probably similar in body and brain size to a modern chimpanzee, and had canines that resemble those in later hominins but that still project beyond the tooth row. This early human species is only known in the fossil record by a few post-cranial bones and sets of teeth. One bone from the large toe has a broad, robust appearance, suggesting its use in bipedal push-off. Year of Discovery: 1997. When he found a piece of lower jaw lying on the ground in the Middle Awash region of Ethiopia 1997, paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie didn’t realize that he had uncovered a new species. But 11 specimens from at least 5 individuals later, Haile-Selassie was convinced he had found a new early human ancestor. The fossils—which also included hand and foot bones, partial arm bones, and a clavicle (collarbone)—were dated to 5.6–5.8 million years old. One of the specimens, a toe bone, is dated to 5.2 million years old; this fossil has features of bipedal walking. Faunal (fossil animal) evidence from the site indicated that the early humans there lived in a mixture of woodlands and grasslands, and had plenty of access to water via lakes and springs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>maybe another one?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the earliest members of the genus Homo, has a slightly larger braincase and smaller face and teeth than in Australopithecus or older hominin species. But it still retains some ape-like features, including long arms and a moderately-prognathic face. Its name, which means ‘handy man’, was given in 1964 because this species was thought to represent the first maker of stone tools.  Currently, the oldest stone tools are dated slightly older than the oldest evidence of the genus Homo. Year of Discovery: 1960. A team led by scientists Louis and Mary Leakey uncovered the fossilized remains of a unique early human between 1960 and 1963 at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. The type speciman, OH 7, was found by Jonathan Leakey, so was nicknamed &quot;Jonny&#39;s child&quot;. Because this early human had a combination of features different from those seen in Australopithecus, Louis Leakey, South African scientist Philip Tobias, and British scientist John Napier declared these fossils a new species, and called them Homo habilis (meaning &#39;handy man&#39;), because they suspected that it was this slightly larger-brained early human that made the thousands of stone tools also found at Olduvai Gorge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guess that&#39;s just religion. Now about dna:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DNA shapes how an organism grows up and the physiology of its blood, bone, and brains.
DNA is thus especially important in the study of evolution. The amount of difference in DNA is a test of the difference between one species and another – and thus how closely or distantly related they are.
While the genetic difference between individual humans today is minuscule – about 0.1%, on average – study of the same aspects of the chimpanzee genome indicates a difference of about 1.2%. The bonobo (Pan paniscus), which is the close cousin of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), differs from humans to the same degree. The DNA difference with gorillas, another of the African apes, is about 1.6%. Most importantly, chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans all show this same amount of difference from gorillas. A difference of 3.1% distinguishes us and the African apes from the Asian great ape, the orangutan. How do the monkeys stack up?  All of the great apes and humans differ from rhesus monkeys, for example, by about 7% in their DNA.
Geneticists have come up with a variety of ways of calculating the percentages, which give different impressions about how similar chimpanzees and humans are. The 1.2% chimp-human distinction, for example, involves a measurement of only substitutions in the base building blocks of those genes that chimpanzees and humans share. <strong>A comparison of the entire genome, however, indicates that segments of DNA have also been deleted, duplicated over and over, or inserted from one part of the genome into another.</strong> When these differences are counted, there is an additional 4 to 5% distinction between the human and chimpanzee genomes.
No matter how the calculation is done, the big point still holds: <strong>humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos are more closely related to one another than either is to gorillas or any other primate. From the perspective of this powerful test of biological kinship, humans are not only related to the great apes – we are one.</strong> The DNA evidence leaves us with one of the greatest surprises in biology: the wall between human, on the one hand, and ape or animal, on the other, has been breached. The human evolutionary tree is embedded within the great apes.
<strong>The strong similarities between humans and the African great apes led Charles Darwin in 1871 to predict that Africa was the likely place where the human lineage branched off from other animals – that is, the place where the common ancestor of chimpanzees, humans, and gorillas once lived</strong>. The DNA evidence shows an amazing confirmation of this daring prediction. The African great apes, including humans, have a closer kinship bond with one another than the African apes have with orangutans or other primates. Hardly ever has a scientific prediction so bold, so ‘out there’ for its time, been upheld as the one made in 1871 – that human evolution began in Africa.</p>

<p>religion, eh?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapomorphy_and_apomorphy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapomorphy_and_apomorphy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In phylogenetics, apomorphy and synapomorphy refer to derived characters of a clade – characters or traits that are derived from ancestral characters over evolutionary history.[2] An apomorphy is a character that is different from the form found in an ancestor, i.e., an innovation, that sets the clade apart (&quot;apo&quot;) from other clades. A synapomorphy is a shared (&quot;syn&quot;) apomorphy that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>religion?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most important discoveries that lead to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution was extinct animals found as fossils. Early paleontologists, like Charles Lyell and George Cuvier, noticed a very simple fact: Species that lived in the past are very often drastically, wildly different from anything alive today. Trilobites, dinosaurs, giant sloths, baculites, etc., they all suggest that life on Earth has changed quite a bit.
That would be interesting enough on its own. What makes it more interesting is that, the further back one goes, the more different the species appear when compared to today’s species. These overarching trends can also be seen on the individual level, as lineages can be seen changing over time.
How do we know, though, that fossil progressions don’t just represent separate, unrelated species?  First, they have similarities that suggest they are related (see above reasoning concerning similarities between species). Secondly, they represent a trend, also known as a progression of change. For instance, over time, the species go from low expression of a certain trait to intermediate expression to high expression. Like the evolution of legs, for example. In fact, since we are on the topic, there is no missing link in evolution.
Lastly, the fossils are dated and organized by direct means (like radiometric dating) or indirect means (like relative dating using unique marker layers, fossils, or other techniques).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think you even know what both &#39;religion&#39; and &#39;science&#39; means LMAO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Turn over a manufactured product today, and you are likely to see a small sticker or tag that says what country it was made in. Like those tags, species bear the marks of where they came from. These signs of origin might come in the form of repurposed traits, traits that hurt a species chances of surviving or reproducing. Put simply, species are flawed, and it’s these flaws that clearly tell of their natural origin.
What’s so powerful about learning these three basic facts about evolution is that you now have the ability to look at any species and ask yourself these questions:
Does this species share similarities with other species that might suggest that they are closely related?
Are there progressions of change for this species that we can see in the fossil record, recorded history, or across geography?
Does this species have any traits that are the remnants of past generations?
Those three simple questions can, if you let them, transform the way you look at the biological realm around you. Go ahead. Ask away. Biology will never look the same.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not religious at all - but keep making baseless claims if you want, doesn&#39;t bother me.  It also doesn&#39;t bother me if you want to believe in evolution - it&#39;s your right - but evolution is not science - we can&#39;t even honestly say it&#39;s real, it&#39;s just a philosophical supposition :)</p>

<p>&quot;Science&quot; is knowledge provided and supported by the scientific method - religion is a series of views practices and beliefs based on faith.  Evolution is a religion :)</p>

<p>Did you just pull the &quot;evolution is just a theory&quot; thing? LMAOLMAOLMAOLMAO You <strong>really</strong> haven&#39;t read about it. You can&#39;t even argue about the evidence, you just dismiss it as if you have some credibility or even a basis for it. Dude, seek help LOL</p>

<p>Evolution is just part of the creation story for the materialist and atheistic worldview </p>

<p>Oh the hate against atheists, but go ahead keep saying you&#39;re not religious hahahahahahah. By the way computers only exist due to an ATHEIST <strong>scientist</strong> using the same logic, notion and structure of knowledge of the Evolution Theory (theory = law in science, the Theory of Relativity, the Law of Gravity and the Theory of Evolution <em>all</em> have the same status as a scientific fact and you can cry about it but it&#39;s true lmao)</p>

<p>Again, here&#39;s the definition of bigot - a person who is intolerant of those holding different views of opinions.</p>

<p>Not only do you openly hate and insult all religious people, you are bigoted against some non-religious people too.</p>

<p>Still waiting for you address the main topic btw:  do you have any scientific evidence to support your religious notion of evolution? :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn’t sound like your teacher really understands evolution. In order for a change to take hold, there has to be a random mutation and then an environmental force that essentially kills off anyone without that mutation or doesn’t allow them to reproduce. Just because we don’t need powerful jaws for processed food doesn’t mean that people with strong jaws won’t be able to eat and die, just because there’s not much use for our pinky doesn’t mean that there’s any reason we won’t survive with it. It’s the same reason we have an appendix, we literally don’t need it to survive but enough people with them in the past survived so everyone has it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have no trouble telling me how one &quot;mutates&quot; a circulatory system into existence.  A nervous system.  Maybe mutating a digestive system is easier?  If you accidentally &quot;mutate&quot; any of its components into existence, it won&#39;t work.  What good is transmuting a heart, if it has no veins or arteries?  Or vice versa?  How does one transmute even a simple brain into existence from &quot;nothing&quot;?  Not just magically creating a brain from nothing, but the nervous system required to connect it to the rest of the body?  At the same time.  Fully functioning from the get-go.</p>

<p>People use the word &quot;mutation&quot; the same way they use it in comic books.  A word twisted into ambiguity to mean whatever they need it to mean.  And when people start to suspect that this lunacy might be impossible, they buffer it with &quot;but it took <em>billions</em> of years!&quot;, like that will make it sound less ridiculous.</p>

<p>The advantage of studying bacteria is you can witness hundreds of thousands or even millions of generations within a relatively short time.  Surely, with a few million chances for the generations to &quot;mutate&quot; into something else, we would&#39;ve witnessed it by now.  I mean, humans supposedly spawned from monkeys in <em>far</em> less.  But we can&#39;t even see something as simple as a bacteria switch to <em>anything</em> else.  A digestive tweak is the best they could muster.</p>

<p>Well, good for you I guess? It comes across as a severe lack of understanding regarding evolution. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve read into it at least a little bit, maybe you just misunderstood.</p>

<p>And again, if whatever you DO believe has absolutely no supporting evidence and is just a theory pulled out of your ass, it&#39;s pretty worthless. Moreso than evolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My pet theory could be just that, no more or less.  But if it got forced into schools, with every grant seeking scientist and his cousin trying to shoehorn it into every other unrelated theory, it&#39;d be a problem.  I wouldn&#39;t mind &quot;evolution&quot; if were accurately labeled as a natural philosophy, or speculative history.  But it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s ramrodded down peoples&#39; throat as &quot;scientific&quot; &quot;Fact&quot; when it&#39;s neither, and has just as many and more flaws than biblical creationism.</p>

<p>I <em>suspect</em> that the beginnings and &quot;evolutions&quot; of life are electrically driven.  That we are based off a common template/foundation/source that expresses itself differently from other creatures by design.  Not accident, or random mutations, but with purpose.  (I don&#39;t know the purpose :)</p>

<p>Some of this is just natural philosophy.  But it&#39;s a topic I&#39;m casually interested in.  Here&#39;s a couple short links that touch on it.  One is a short article on a landmark abiogenesis experiment from the &#39;50&#39;s, and the other is a short 6 minute video on the electric nature of our dna.  </p>

<p>You lost me. Facts change all the time, it&#39;s the scientific process to reanalyse and test known theories to either disprove or strengthen them. Evolution is the current accepted &quot;fact&quot; because it&#39;s the most likely explanation given the evidence. And I think your claim it has more flaws than creationism is utter bullshit, frankly.</p>

<p>Your theory is nice, but is apparently based off one experiment and a YouTube video. I&#39;m glad that the scientific world is a little more discerning than you are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing scientific about the theory of evolution.  It&#39;s generally untestable, but the handful of tests that have been applied to it fail miserably.  Bacteria remain bacteria, and fruit flies, even when deliberately mutated and accelerated, remain fruit flies.  The leap between microevolution and macroevolution is vast, untestable, unreplicated, and unfalsifiable.</p>

<p>The scientific method cannot be applied to it.  Because it&#39;s strictly a <em>philosophy</em>.  A post hoc explanation for observations which could have a variety of explanations.  But it&#39;s become dogma, to the point that even questioning it is taboo...  I mean, heretical...  err, blasphemous.  It gets nothing but eyerolls and insults from its <em>believers</em>.</p>

<p>And I was being concise, showing you the shortest and simplest intros to the idea.  If you want to mock that yoo, then good for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please read this my dude...</p>

<p>We dont &#39;magically&#39; gain a respitory system, in chemical terms o2 exists naturally as a gas and is highly reactive, carbon in gasious form is not therefor theres more energy transfer from oxygen than carbon. Nature finds the optimum usually. If o2 and co2 are both atmopspherically available then laws of probability dictate a variation of a non-perfect copy will form (mutation) but in cell or asexual reproduction. Here co2 and o2 life forms would branch into the stagnant co2 kingdom and o2 kingdom where o2 has a scientific advantage. Multiply this effect 1,000,000X and complex life forms start forming. Time really is the biggest variable. </p>

<p>In terms of a non-perfect mutation and why this happens it can be both chemical or physical properties that cause these errors. Think of gama and beta radiation or ionic chemical interactions in a polar covalent carbon chain.</p>

<p>BTW, something like &quot;humans will have big eyes because they stare at screens&quot; makes absolutely no sense. If bigger eyes are deemed more attractive or give you a much better chance of surviving then YES, you can induce humans will have bigger eyes. This literally means however that people with smaller eyes need to have an immediate danger such as lack of sight in a war.</p>

<p>The melanin is actually partly correct presumption however given that :</p>

<p>1)  The ozone layer burns out.
2) Humans cant exfoliate properly.</p>

<p>In such a scenario high melanin levels are massively advantagous and people without it will simply get skin cancer and die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course he understands evolution. I&#39;m completely shocked at these comments, as OP&#39;s thesis is quite simple and yet everyone seems to miss it.</p>

<p>He is literally saying that in a world where the needs of humans and their interactions with the environment are becoming more and more conductive to the evolutionary traits he is describing (due to a more digitized world), these traits (that he is proposing) would in fact be optimal. Thus humans with these traits would become sexually more attractive, mate more, reproduce more, carry their genes forward. Not to mention that people with such adaptations would have a higher chance of survival. That is exactly what OP is saying. Now are the specific traits he mentions actually traits that would be more conductive for human survival in the new environment humans are creating? That depends. It depends what kind of environment humans will create, but in a techno-dystopia, such traits could be favourable for survival.</p>

<p>A larger skull would mean a larger brain capacity and a less athletic and muscular body would indicate that the entire new world would be based on minimal physical activity and/or effort - everything would be mind based. The skin pigmentation could change based on changes in our atmosphere and the Sun&#39;s activity....etc.</p>

<p>Thus even from a regular mainstream view of evolution, OP&#39;s ideas make sense. However I personally stand more by the view that genetic mutations are not random, but are intelligently brought forth by the species and beings themselves - however to make any sense of this, one has to revise their whole view of reality and see it as a system where the entirety of nature (and the Cosmos at large) is in constant communication with every part of itself on a quantum level ( r/holofractal has some intriguing theories on this).</p>

<p>I have to say though that I personally would not like to live in a dystopian world where the body of a Grey alien (no offence Greys) would be the optimal evolutionary set-up for a maximum ability to survive, thrive and reproduce, but hey, that&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>Evolution is more than the concept of natural selection and survival of the fittest. It is a mechanism by which genes are made, modified, and expressed, and which no one here can explain. They can simply do some hand-waving and at best say &quot;this enzyme does that.&quot; No, you have not explained the mechanism by which a fish becomes a human.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="/u/Sendmyabar">/u/Sendmyabar</a> - that book you linked (looks like one chapter was called &quot;Problems with Evolution&quot;) looks like a must have for me.  Can you please give the full title and perhaps any other recommendations for other books about science hoaxers and frauds?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries man, I am primarily here to recommend books to people that are interested :). The one that page is from is called, <em>Ancient Mysteries: A history through evolution and magic</em> by Micheal Baigent. I&#39;m only half way through it but it is incredibly interesting.</p>

<p>I would also recommend highly <em>Worlds in Collision</em> by Immanuel Velikovsky and <em>Cataclysm: Compelling Evidence of a Cosmic Catastrophe in 9500 B.C</em> by D S Allan and J B Delair. Those books will completely change the way you look at human history :). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard about Velikovsky - I&#39;m trying to get through a book on &quot;the New Chronology&quot; by A Fomenko right now - he references Velikovsky.  Are you perhaps familiar with Fomenko&#39;s work?  Seems right up this alley too - I think you might really enjoy it, I know I am!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this type of speculation, i shall put my own opinion in. </p>

<p>The thing to consider is that Natural Evolution is increasingly becoming a nonfactor. With our ability to influence evolution through genetic editing we will very very soon be able to guide it ourselves. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>large skull with small lower jaw, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smaller jaw, also means less muscle and thinner neck. Which stands in contradiction to having a bigger skull and brain. Since we need to support this weight via our spine. A Larger skull also requires considerably more blood. However with a smaller neck there is a limit to that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>big eyes with blue iris</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Blue eyes poorly filter out ionizing radiation. Like UV. Blue eyes are a mere Aesthetic Bonus. (one which i possess, Oh yeah!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3 fingers and thumb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont see that happening. We use all our fingers, the more complex and technological we become. the more fingers...the better. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>slender body</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yeah, i can see that! If supply of food has never been an issue for generations then its smart that the body doesnt need to spend energy to store fat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>short stature</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not with a big head, that wouldnt really work. Not in our gravity at least.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pigmented and dark, possibly leathery skin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We mostly live indoors nowadays, we are not exposed to the Ionizing radiation of the sun as much as our forefathers. so i dont see that happening.</p>

<p>You are trying to compare apples to rocks. I know you are trying to make the ageold comparison that &quot;the grays&quot; are infact timetravellers.</p>

<p>You are forgetting that as i mentioned before natural evolution is a burden we are soon going to be rid of. With that we will age slower and eventually become technically Immortal. Then there is the fact of using technology to enhance ourselves. Trust me, alot in our bodies is replaceable. Take our ears for example.</p>

<p>Ears fucking suck!!!</p>

<p>If you have a device in your head that takes over the ears function you can hear from 0.1 hz to 200khz easily, and without loss. You can exclude other sounds and you turn off your ears when you wanna sleep. Otherwise you can just listen to music as loud as you want because...its not really loud...you just think its loud. So no harm done. You can literally call your SO and have them in your head all day (for better or worse)... Our natural ears are always on...you cant filter out sounds. You are forced to listen to everything and they degrade really quickly...All in all pisspoor design.</p>

<p>Then you have eyes...</p>

<p>You have the Brain...</p>

<p>You have the heart.</p>

<p>There is sooo much that can be easily replaced and enhanced in the human body. The temptation to do this will be too big to resist. Our bodies will merely become Immortal modular vessels for our consciousness. Once Nanotechnology and Nanites become a thing, we could have all those things without even giving up any of our Aesthetic Goodies. Any changes due to a different enviroment would then be options without consequence.</p>

<p>You need radiation resistance? Well you just ask your cells to make exactly that. You want to see just the IR or UV spectra? Ez buddy! </p>

<p>Consequently Humans in the Far future should look very similar to us (as in Supermodels with superhuman abilities).</p>

<p>The gray aliens on the other hand, well first thing, we dont even know if they actually exist. Lets say they do, their Physical appearence suggest that they evolved in an enviroment with considerably less gravity then we have.  The big black eyes mean that the planet mostly had a thick atmosphere or that their eyes are evolved from insect type eyes (ours are basically fish eyes).  The gray skin could mean anything.</p>

<p>the biggest problem in your theory though is the timetravel aspect.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly reverse timetravel is bound to some rules. The biggest rule would be that you cant travel back in time to a point where you havent invented timetravel. Since there is no particle that travels backwards through time. So you have no way to communicate in the reverse.</p>

<p>Imagine it like this. You need to open a very specific wormhole that goes to a certain place and time. Lets say i  open it to 10 minutes in the future.</p>

<p>So i press &quot;Start&quot; and have to wait then for 10 minutes IRL. I go make some tea for 2 and when thats done i see the wormhole opening. I go in and come out. So there are 2 Me then, and we can drink a tea together. But the wormhole is still there. so we both wait for a bit and go back together with kitchen knives and murder ourselves drinking tea.</p>

<p>The Point is, this type of timetravel requires the multiverse theory to be correct, each time any particle or wave travels through the open wormhole a new universe is &quot;created&quot;. As is the theory that every quantum choice happens. And our reality is merely a fuzzy mishmash of different realities overlapping. This means that there wont be any paradoxes. Still it means that you cant travel back to a time before you openend the wormhole. Because you can only go back to the point at which you created the wormhole in the first place...not further.</p>

<p>If you really wanna get into the nitty gritty of Alien life i would highly suggest taking a course in astrobiology. Its super fascinating. If that isnt available, microbiology, Virology and Biophysics should supply you with a strong understanding of evolution of very different systems. </p>
