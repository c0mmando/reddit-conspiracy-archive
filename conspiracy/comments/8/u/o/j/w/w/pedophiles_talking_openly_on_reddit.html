<p>I was reading through r/worldnews when I saw an article about an absolutely awful website that had videos of sexual abuse of minors, including gang rapes. I thought others would agree that this is evil, but most of the reddit comments were expressing sadness that they didn&#39;t know about this site before (in a tongue-in-cheek manner, implying that they will look at it now), and asking for recommendations for other disgusting sites &quot;to avoid&quot; (ie, to check out). It&#39;s just horrifying how brazen these pedophiles are, and their awful comments are upvoted on balance, so there are more supporters of their opinions than dissenters.</p>

<p>They are so blatant with their sick immorality. It&#39;s infuriating how they feel like they can chat about this openly on a site where anyone can read their comments. They only do this because they know they can get away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh...that sounds like normal reddit joking around tastelessly. Shoot, I have cracked jokes like that myself.</p>

<p>We have had a handful of <em>actual</em> pedos, and <em>lots</em> of serious pedo defender trash shit up our sub here in the past. The don&#39;t crack jokes. The subtly try to make their case that pedophiles should be accepted in society, or we should have sympathy for them, like we would for someone with say gender dysphoria. </p>

<p>Real ones are much more subversive imho.</p>

Why do I ask why when we have freaking netflix with cp in their movies we have FB taking surveys about it and even Ted talks defending their position too. Its like its a soft opening for even deeper darker and sicker shite to come no wonder they feel so safe. They are building their tribe and gaining numbers by the day. They need to know this isnt going to be something that they will be able to make us the bad guys for not accepting!!</p>

They fight to allow pedophiles who are already in prison to have access to their magazine, they advocate man boy love movies.

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve been on here forever. Back in the days of r/jailbait I res tagged a bunch who were requesting more nudes in pm in threads. For years after I would see those same people in threads all over reddit arguing that posting kids&#39; stolen facebook photos was free speech and reddit had no right  to choose not to host it. </p>

<p>I even saw one commenter detail some of his favorite types of cp with links and get upvoted and guilded. And if I talk about my own experiences with csa, I still get trolls mocking me, even here in r/conspiracy by some of the same people pushing the pizzagate conspiracy. </p>

<p>If they could satisfy their urges by going offline, they would be offline. But they mostly can&#39;t, so they practically live and breath the internet and especially the dark web.</p>
