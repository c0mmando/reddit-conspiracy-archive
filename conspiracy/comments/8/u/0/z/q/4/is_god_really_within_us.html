       Surgeons can heal and cure man of his illnesses. Do they have the power of God within them?

       Is God really within some of us and not only an external force? (Like the God in the holy books that is an old man with beard in the sky)?

       God is separate and sovereign.  God is only within people who are born again by his Holy Spirit who he adopts as his children.  To become a child of God all one must do is repent and believe this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       Only true repentant sinners who believing in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ as the final blood atonement for their sins have God within them.  They know that nothing they do can save them.  No works, no good deeds, no going to Church, no water baptism, no sacraments, no vibrating at a higher level, no nothing saves you.  Only trusting in what Jesus Christ did.  This is the only way to make your body the Temple of God.

       No they don't.  God can use them to save lives to give those lost souls more time to repent.  He can use anyone he wants.

       Sure.  Travel the world and try to piece together the Textus Receptus from whatever you can find.  Or you can just realize that the King James Version is the refined, preserved, pure word of God in the most universal language in these times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psa 12:6  The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psa 12:7  Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ecc_8:4  Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

       The Catholic Church is the Church of the antichrist.  The Pope is the high priest of Mystery Babylon.  The Vatican is the Whore of Babylon riding the beast in Revelation drinking the blood of the saints:

       Who cares what the pope says. There have been extremely evil popes in the past (and present just less publicly) . The Catholic Church made the bible illegal, they aren’t really following it in my opinion.

       The universe is "God". Every atom of every single thing in existence is part of that one universal consciousness. Therefore we

       part of "God" and "God" is part of us. It's all one thing.

       In much of Buddhism, the power of the universe is based on the results of cause and effect and you are the purveyor of that power because you are the one making the causes and thus you get the effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Karma is the accumulation of your billions of tiny causes and the resultant effects.  This basically makes you responsible for your world (which is the result of your causes) so, that kinda makes you a god.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most importantly though, never look outside of yourself for the answers.  If you want to change your world or the world, start by changing yourself and the world will morph to meet that change in you.

       Surgeons and all humanity were created in the image of God and thus have many gifts as.a result.  However, bec we have been corrupted by sin, our goodness and goodwill are unreliable.  We can be tempted into selfishness and malicious intent.  We have the capacity to do good, but we don’t always do it, and sometimes we are actively harmful to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the scriptures we see examples of God influencing men who were not believers of Him —Pharaoh is a notable one.  We also see Him using and influencing men that
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       believe in Him and consented to obey Him —like Moses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before Jesus’ sacrifice for sin, God did not indwell any human permanently.  There’s a Psalm where David pleads, “please don’t take your Spirit from me.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though these believers did not have His Spirit, they were considered “righteous” based on their faith in what God had shown them.  Being righteous is the criteria for salvation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There  were also kings who were used by God and became believers in Him —-like King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who announced to all His kingdom that the God of Daniel was the true God of all.  Faith in what has been revealed thus far has always been the defining issue in faith that counts for salvation from the consequences of sin.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Holy Spirit living in believers is a New Testament phenomenon brought by Jesus.  In this way, He is with us, “always, even to the end of the age”, or our death, whichever comes first.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this helps. It’s not quite what you are asking but it can help figure out how God works in different situations.

       Depends what god is. If god is an infinite force of energy and creation, then I'd say so.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all matter could once fit on the head of a pin due to density, then all energy was once in a unified state. If the Big Bang caused a spreading of this energy, isn't it still the same energy which once existed as a single being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refer to newtons laws to determine that. Then determine what god is and you'll be closer to an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you give credence to various mystical experiences had by millions throughout history, there is a world beyond our senses which is as real, if not more real.

       I think there is a god. My life was spared a couple of times where a voice or feeling warned me before deadly accidents. I was worried for awhile, it was like I was in the movie Final Destination and kept escaping death. I've had quite a few big prayers answered that couldn't have been just coincidental.

       There aren't really noticeable any signs of the Christian god or any other gods in our world. Doctors being able to save lives isn't a sign of god's presence as they have the ability because if their secular education and training. Humans can have great powers without help of gods.

       Stop thinking, completely, for a moment (that's meditation, essentially). Let go of your entire life narrative -- everything you've ever believed was true. Sit there, in fundamental silence. And you will eventually see and accept that you are a space. An infinite space, in which your thoughts have surfaced since you started thinking words, composing a narrative of who/what you thought you were. But, really, none of that is "true". Your entire narrative is an illusion, which happens within what you
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       are. That space is conscious awareness, which is the essence of literally everything. Everything is the same thing'ness...the same, one "is'ness".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so obvious, and each of us knows this deep down. We're just stubborn, because of the egos we've developed throughout this particularly ignorant age we're living in, and we refuse to accept that we are no-thing. We are nothing, which is everything, which is God, or Brahman.
