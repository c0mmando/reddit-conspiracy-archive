<p>Suspect has been identified via facial recognition software, He is from Maryland and is 39. They are executing a search warrant on his home.</p>

<p>This really stood out to me, to think that the police have this giant database of our biometric data and can use it against us. I feel like we&#39;ve crossed the tipping point of no return and the police state is going to grow larger and larger. </p>

<p>Facebook was/is clearly an operation being used to mine our information, including face scans with us willingly helping them to fine tune the facial recognition software. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen videos of people recording the police and refuse to identify themselves only for the cop to come out with a camera and takes a picture of the person&#39;s face. This confirmed my suspicion that police are using this facial recognition software to identify people who rightfully refuse to identify themselves. This is like bringing asking for papers to a whole new level. </p>

<p>The sad truth is the average citizen I encounter does not value privacy. &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; ugh I hate this reference but the average citizen gets it. Well I imagine the average Jew in Germany had nothing to hide either and may not have cared about their privacy until a regime took over that made being &#39;you&#39; (a Jew) a crime. I bet they valued privacy then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Face recognition software has been actively used for at least 6 years that I have known. Yes, it is real. Yes, cops use it. It has not been publicised, because I assume, the public in general would flip a shit fit about it. Basically now its against the law in America to becovering your face in public and it has been justified by the statements and attitude of the government that when in public a citizen has no recognised right to privacy. At the same time more ans more often it is being legalized that software/hardware in products you own privately in your home can be legally having data.gathered on you. This is America, this has to quit. The patriot act has got to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best friend that I also worked with at the time, did a dine and dash at a rather expensive restaurant a few years ago at around 10:30pm. And the next day at work we went to lunch at 11:30am, at the same deli we always went to for lunch. The sheriff and a local cop we&#39;re waiting inside for him and pulled out a folder of printed out screen grabs from the security video of his face. As well as a bunch of pictures from his Facebook page. They handed him the check from the night before, and gave him a verbal warning that if he didn&#39;t pay the bill in, I believe it was 48 hours, that they would be pressing charges. </p>

<p>It was how nonchalantly that this all happened that was so weird.. It was only 13 hours later and they had a coordinated effort of local sheriff and local police stations working together. Over a 53 dollar check, it seemed like a bit of overkill. Only thing I could think is maybe the waitress was the sheriff or a cops daughter, but it was a really weird thing to witness happen to somebody in person. </p>

He brought a defamation suit against the columnist and the organizationâ€™s editor and publisher. A court ruled in the Capital Gazetteâ€™s favor, and an appeals court upheld the ruling.</p>

<p>According to a legal document, the article contended that Ramos had harassed a woman on Facebook and that he had pleaded guilty to criminal harassment. The court agreed that the contents of the article were accurate and based on public records, the document showed.</p>
