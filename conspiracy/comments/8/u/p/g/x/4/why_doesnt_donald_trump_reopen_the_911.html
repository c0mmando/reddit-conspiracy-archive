       Everybody works for themselves, regardless of position or job title. Its the part where we work together that should fill in all the gaps. If you can't see that he the gaps he is filling (aka NK, Isreal, US corruption, ect.), then you might see the vaccums he is creating (ICE, FBI, Dems). These storms occur when high levels of condensation(corruption) form in a volume of unstable air(AnonAmerica) that generates deep, rapid, upward motion(outrage culture) in the atmosphere(economy.) The heat energy(Commander-in-Chief) creates powerful rising air currents(Q) that swirl upwards to the tropopause(Deep State).

       Oddly, though, he didn't go to a single 9/11 victim's funeral, and when asked, could not name a single one of his friends who died.

       This question has bothered me as well.  We know Trump was in NYC on 9/11.  If you watch the news interviews, he is genuinely pissed.  He lost a lot of friends that day.  When he ran, one of the 4chan conspiracies that made a lot of sense to me was that he wanted payback for 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that one of his greatest rival, Silverstein, had the greatest windfall of his career due to the attack.  We also know that Silverstein had some knowledge in advance.  There's no denying this.  He deviated greatly from his daily routine to avoid the attack.  His entire family also deviated from their daily routine and was safe.   He spoke on why WTC 7 had to come down.  He leased the WTC when everyone knew that the building had to be demolished because of structural weakness and degradation.  He also knew that demolishing the building would cost exhorbitant amounts of money, far exceeding what it could generate.  Yet he leased the building from NY/NJ transit (which had NEVER leased the building before) and took out HUGE amounts of insurance against it.  All this took place just weeks before 9/11....
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trump won the Presidency, I felt two things.  One was that, THANK THE FUCKING LORD Hillary didn't win.  The other was, "maybe, just maybe, I think we'll get to the truth behind 911".
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, that didn't happen... yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, we have to understand.  Trump is under attack like no President in history.  Quite frankly, I can't even believe how well he's been able get anything done while all the war that's been waged against him.  I voted for Trump because I hated Hillary.  Now, I'm glad I voted for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       When will we see some 911 closure?  I think we already have.  We just don't know it yet.  The truth will come out sooner or later.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I mean by "we already have"?  Well, let me put it this way.  The Saudi's were involved in 9/11.  There's no doubt to this.  Remember the "purge" that happened a few months ago in KSA?  I strongly suspect this was the payback for 9/11.  Basically, the crown prince Mohammad, who was too young back in 2001 to have anything to do with 9/11, was confronted with the truth and demanded by Trump to retaliate during his visit to the KSA in 2017.  Why do you think Trump went to the Kingdom of SA?  Why did he make it his first priority to visit and talk to the crown prince?  Since when is the house of Saud more important than any other countries that have relations with the USA?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump will have his revenge.  There's no doubt about this.  Love Trump or hate Trump.  I don't care.  But what I do know about Trump is that HE'S AN ASSHOLE.  An asshole who never forgets anyone who disrespected him or his country.  You fuck Trump, he will fuck you over.  It may not be today.  It may not be tomorrow.  But rest assured.  He will fuck you over.

       He's also a legendarily loud bastard who refuses to shut the fuck up when he's got even the slightest thing - real, imagined, or fabricated - going for him. The likelier reality is that he just doesn't give a shit about 9/11.

       You are hopelessly naive if you think any president or even any politician at all, will EVER reveal anything about 9.11. A lot of truthers really believed Obama would re-open the investigation when he got elected because so much suspicion and conflict of interest was associated with the previous (bush) administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was part of Obama's unspoken mandate. When he spoke of hope and change, it was basically the same type of "dog whistling" associated with Trump in 2016 when he talked about "draining the swamp." People applied whatever meaning they wanted to the rhetoric, without these candidates explicitly mentioning a lot of the policies or stances that some chose to associate with them. Obama talked about Hope and change, and a lot of people interpreted that as meaning he would right all the wrongs of the previous administration. There was even serious speculation in major media that he would actually consider prosecuting people from the Bush administration. That idea went away real quick. He even openly addressed this idea and said, he thought it was just better to 'move on.' If anyone was going to address 9.11 again, it would had to have been Obama, but people were naive to think he would do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       We hear a lot of talk about the 'deep state' in reference to petty partisan ideas, and one party using the Gov't apparatus to target the other party, which has cheapened the term's actual meaning. 9.11 was a genuine deep state endeavor. It transcends political parties and goes deep into the highest most hidden levels of our government. This remains entrenched regardless of who is in office. No one associated with our government will ever reveal anything about it or call for any further investigating.
      </p>
      <p>
       It goes way beyond Trump's personal business rivalries with Silverstein. Silverstein may be rich, and may have beat Trump in in the NYC development game, but Trump is an international brand. Not to mention the fact that he holds the most powerful office in the world. Becoming president is enough of a 'fuck you' to any personal business rivals he may have had. Siverstein will never be able to say he was president of the united states. Trump may be an ego-maniac, but he's not stupid. He's not touching the 9/11 story. As president he too understands the psychological power it wields over people and he even evoked this in his veterans day speech last year, as well as his 9/11 anniversery speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a very fascinating, little known interview with Trump on local NY news within minutes of the towers falling where he himself mentions the possibility of what he said looked like explosives. Worth watching if you havent seen it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is probably an inaugural briefing for new presidents about 9.11. They are probably told "If you didnt know already, that was us. Keep your mouth shut." It probably isnt even necessary to brief them. I imagine anyone who makes it onto a presidential ballot has already been made aware. If not, it would lead to a serious slip-up. TPTB will not allow that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a moment to honestly and realistically imagine what would happen if the real truth about 9.11 was revealed to the general public. It will NEVER EVER happen. The real truth about 9.11 is something Americans will ever be able to handle. When they mention "classified for reasons of national security" this fits that criteria better than anything else that has ever happened in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you say 'the truth will come out sooner or later' I couldnt disagree more. I understand where your coming from. We tend to think honesty and objectivity and truth increase after time has passed, but with serious world changing issues like this, the truth never comes out. The official narrative is something that is permanently and irreversibly ingrained into American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       People thought the same thing about JFK, RFK, MLK. The people all said the truth would someday come out. It's been 50 years and we probably know less than we did then. If anything, with the passage of time there is less evidence available to question or disprove the official story, and a whole new generation comes up believing the history books as they are written. The alternate narratives disappear over time. Some of the historical events that shaped our nation forever may have been based on complete lies that people just accept, because they are never even presented with alternative possibilities. People still question Pearl Harbor and even earlier events, but we are certainly no closer to the truth with the passage of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of skeptics like to use the argument 'people cant keep secrets, someone will talk.' What they fail to realize is that protecting national secrets is the exact job description of the CIA. They are the world's foremost experts in keeping secrets and keeping things hidden. Walk into CIA headquarters and you'll see they have a memorial wall. But unlike the vietnam memorial wall or the 9.11 memorial wall, there are no names, only stars. A single star represents every CIA agent who has ever died in action. Even after these people have been long dead and their missions long over and obsolete, they still never reveal their identities. These people have an oath to defend information with their lives, and they have billions in funding and the world's most advanced technological resources to do 1 thing and do it very well: keep secrets.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some things the world will NEVER know, and what actually happened on 9.11 is one of those things.

       To me, it seems as if the elite chose him as a populist to appeal to theorists and subvert our effectiveness as the truth movement. We are traditionally skeptical of politicians, especially the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as if the trust for Trump spread once the "alternative media" started to endorse him. Alex jones, PJW, cernovich,ect. Couldn't these guys be gatekeepers that "flipped" on us? Our culture is being sucked into the partisan vaccum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few concerns I have..
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project.
      </p>
      <p>
       When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; "the trump name is still very much a future asset for us"...
      </p>
      <p>
       How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren't the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story.html">
        http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-wilbur-ross-commerce-20161208-story.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After singing the harms of Wall Street and corrupt bankers, he makes several Goldman Sachs and wealthy billionaires his cabinet members. The point is, he lied to you, turned around, and "got the band back together" so to speak, appointing many of the former bush era cronies in positions of power. Why is this good for us ? Do you trust a Goldman Sachs cabinet? Do you trust Jeff Sessions and John Bolton?
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did trump meet in private, and visit the home of known globalist Henry Kissinger? These first 3 alone reveal to me, a very establishment friendly puppet. Can anybody explain this? Are you OK with this and why?
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the "terrorism boogeyman" in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, "bomb the shit out of them and take the oil". Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them?
      </p>

        https://youtu.be/aWejiXvd-P8YouTube
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why Is trump saying that the CIA is "great" and "terrific"? Why did he say that he was behind them "1000%"?
      </p>
      <p>

       Why was his Bombing of Syria a strategic move for the betterment of US citizens? Was it not allowed to occur under false pretenses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, after criticizing Obama's policies, how are the continued drone strikes helping make America great again?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also has a slew of rape and sexual abuse allegations against him, some of them from children. One of these allegations that went to court was against a 13 year old girl, and allegedly took place at one of Jeffery Epstein's properties. Epstein is a convicted pedophile and long friend of Trump's.

      </p>
      <p>
       Finally after criticizing Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips, is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000 dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these anti establishment policies?
      </p>
      <p>
       These questions should be very easy for Trump supporters to explain. How do these moves, which many of us consider to be terrible overreaches of power and authoritarianism, benefit our country and help take down TPTB?

       You are hopelessly brainwashed if you think any of that about trump is real.  If you think trump serves anyone but himself, you're naieve.  2 years now. 2 YEARS and still nothing on 9/11.  There is no excuse for it.  That should be day 1 shit.  He doesn't give a shit because it won't benefit him financially.

       I’d imagine it’s the same exact reason he has never apologized to the Central Park 5. The official narrative is his go-to, any panderping he did on the trail helped to accomplish his goal, and he got what he wanted, so it doesn’t matter.

       I am sure he knows the truth, or at least most of it.  The reason you will never see anyone in political office re-open the 9/11 investigation is simple; There is NOTHING to be gained from it. Most of all financially, of course, as the government makes far more money and has far more control of people now (for far more reasons) than before.  It isn’t a matter of truth.  It is a matter of money and control.  Not to mention the chaos of trying to explain to people the truth of what happened wasn’t was fed to us in the news play by play.   Most people are happy to believe the official story and walk about in their day.  They wouldn’t know what to do if it came down as a lie.  Most people wouldn’t know what to do with real freedom for that matter...

       A con man leaves you broke, a con artist leaves you smiling. I've grown up around people like Trump. They can sell salt to a snail and water to a whale, but that is basically all they are good at. He tells people exactly what they want to hear and he convinces people to put their faith and devotion into him.

       The Christians really do believe he is a Christian. It absolutely blows my fucking mind when they say it too. I noticed this during the election. I asked a poster what made him think DJT was a Christian and he said:"everyone knows he is a Christian but the media makes him look bad. And that he became a Christian during the campaign". Hahahaha. By saying it like that, they can discredit anything the media says about him presently

       Religion is a political tool for control of the masses. Always has been for millennia. DJT / Q / GA is capitalizing on it like the old kings did in their times. This is a weapons to be used and abused.

       It will scare away atheists and less extremists persons.

       If you get past them on GA, sometimes you can get some really interesting stuff. The Christians owning the place is not tinting the source. Only the resulting talks.

       They want a savior, so much easier than doing it yourself. Trump tied into the language and culture of those waking up. So despite all the evidence to the contrary he must be that savior.

       I think.because he has enough on his plate right now. He cannot delegate further investigations to say the FBI because he KNOWS they are compromised. I am sure once he gets rid of the deep state traitors.in our government and big letter agencies a legitimate investigation will be made.

       Interested in buying a bridge in Brooklyn? Trump drained the swamp by installing them in his cabinet and key administrative positions. In case you haven't notice, the powers that be have their fingerprints all over the Trump administration. Their minions are well placed to continue to do their bidding. They are still well in charge.

       Bull fucking shit.   He's had 2 years.  Not to mention he's said over and over its only certain people he thinks are compromised.  It's not every single person in the fbi.  He's had plenty of time and yet he don't done anything.  It's because he doesn't give 2 shit about 9/11.  It doesn't benefit him financially, so why would he care?!?!
      </p>
      <p>
       And btw, his definition of compromised is an fbi agent investigating his administration for some shady shit he's done.

       Same reason Putin doesn't reveal 9/11 truth -- they're all pwned by the Freemasons. They're allowed to compete among themselves, but they all must comply with their shareholders' wishes. Dmitri Khalezov gets into it here (or possibly one of the earlier parts):

       Trump would end Mueller's career.  He would truly strike at the heart of the International Deep State.  He would wake up many.  He would earn respect of many who don't respect him now:  No Democrats complained when he threatened to release the JFK files.

       To me, it seems as if the elite chose him as a populist to appeal to theorists and subvert our effectiveness as the truth movement. We are traditionally skeptical of politicians, especially the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems as if the trust for Trump spread once the "alternative media" started to endorse him. Alex jones, PJW, cernovich,ect. Couldn't these guys be gatekeepers that "flipped" on us? Our culture is being sucked into the partisan vaccum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few concerns I have..
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump was financially bailed out by Wilbur Ross, A Rothschild consigliere in 1990, after his failing Taj Mahal project.
      </p>
      <p>
       When questioned why he helped him, Ross said; "the trump name is still very much a future asset for us"...
      </p>
      <p>
       How is his Rothschild connection anti establishment in the slightest? Aren't the Rothschilds the evil English banking dynasty?
      </p>

       Also, trump made Ross a cabinet position.

       After singing the harms of Wall Street and corrupt bankers, he makes several Goldman Sachs and wealthy billionaires his cabinet members. The point is, he lied to you, turned around, and "got the band back together" so to speak, appointing many of the former bush era cronies in positions of power. Why is this good for us ? Do you trust a Goldman Sachs cabinet? Do you trust Jeff Sessions and John Bolton?

       Why did trump meet in private, and visit the home of known globalist Henry Kissinger? These first 3 alone reveal to me, a very establishment friendly puppet. Can anybody explain this? Are you OK with this and why?

       Trump often discussed his plan to defeat the "terrorism boogeyman" in ISIS, and often cites his willingness to, as he put it, "bomb the shit out of them and take the oil". Why is he pushing the fake terrorism boogey man to accelerate more illegal war?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why after claiming terrorism was bad, and that Saudi Arabia was a known funder of terrorism (and potential 9/11 involvement), why did he do a multi million dollar arms deal with Them?

       Why Is trump saying that the CIA is "great" and "terrific"? Why did he say that he was behind them "1000%"?

       Why was his Bombing of Syria a strategic move for the betterment of US citizens? Was it not allowed to occur under false pretenses?

       Also, after criticizing Obama's policies, how are the continued drone strikes helping make America great again?
      </p>

       Trump also has a slew of rape and sexual abuse allegations against him, some of them from children. One of these allegations that went to court was against a 13 year old girl, and allegedly took place at one of Jeffery Epstein's properties. Epstein is a convicted pedophile and long friend of Trump's.

       Finally after criticizing Obama and his waste of taxpayer money to fund vacations and golf trips, is trump already golfing almost every weekend and wasting over $400,000 dollars A DAY for security at the Trump Tower? How are these anti establishment policies?
      </p>
      <p>
       These questions should be very easy for Trump supporters to explain. How do these moves, which many of us consider to be terrible overreaches of power and authoritarianism, benefit our country and help take down TPTB?

       He cannot do anything because the 9/11 is protected by the usual "secret defense" bullshit and the "911 investigation" was closed before it was even openned in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know 911 happened to close the loop on the soviet era take over of soviet ressources and business. and to promote a reason to vote new laws to remove us rights and for certain corporations to make billions from the new law changes. as well as invade some countries, sell bombs, planes, tanks,, fuel, ... you name it, it was all for profit.

       I'm not an expert on Trump by any means. But I think there are some areas that are just political suicide. Look at what became of Kennedy when he wanted to close the secret service. Unless he's sure hes got evidence that will support him, and he has some reason to pursue, it's a lot of risk for zero gain.
