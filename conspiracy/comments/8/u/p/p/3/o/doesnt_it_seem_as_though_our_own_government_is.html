       I'd actually say international entities are doing it, not any specific country (China, Russia, Europe...). Imho trans-national entities like massive corporations, banking institutions, families with massive wealth, power and influence. ...are trying to influence and start/stop wars, including various civil wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem like it's a fight and conflict between nations, but I'd say that is not really the case in most wars...

       I have but clearly you haven't seen the psychological efforts being executed on Reddit.  No shit, there are subs against hate that promote hate and violence.  Majority of the hate and violent wishes are stemmed by a group who has a different opinion.

       Yeah, there’s a lot of vitriol in the world today. Everyone hates everyone for some reason. People have become so clever, yet the wit is just a front for how vapid we actually are. They move with the tide, and it seems the tide is turning.

       Does anyone have a link to that leaked "future of conflict" powerpoint? It stated that over the next 10/20 years we will see more urban combat in developed nation cities. It was all pretty cyberpunk and a few news outlets even commented on it

       Big budget for defense does not impact a civil war.  Look what happened to Soviet Union.  You cannot control military personnel and their views or families.

       The elite who want European Socialism and  hate America  and it's constitution want to destroy our culture.  They pay politicians and give billions to universities and own the media. To blame the government wrong.  Voters can elect those who are not financed by the elite who are trying to destroy us.

       Very true but where do you draw the line? The problem is the blurred lines between various view points that sit under a 2 party system.  We often find democratic socialist become extremist on particular policy.  The 2 party system is a challenge.  The level of corruption in government is washed away with media distracting and often manufactured social issues.  We cannot take a corrupt government with paid puppets and think a transition of new democracy will work.  We need to clean up our government before we can truly progress.

       No dude. The left just wants to register more people to vote and get them engaged in the democratic process. We can only protect democracy and law with a silent majority. Hopefully people don't sleep through November like they did through 2016.

       The left is done till 2020. House, Senate, Scotus, and Potus. The only people claiming tyranny are the ones that attempted to foist that hag Clinton onto us. The left is outnumbered, isolated, and surrounded. Electoral maps show that cities are all you've got. The left pushed insane social policies to hard, and this is the blowback of the sjw offensive. In military terms your position is untenable and you're about to be overrun. Rednecks in the wire so to speak. If the left would likes to rally you should:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Distance yourselves form sjw insanity.
       </li>
       <li>
        Stop thinking anyone cares what Hollywood thinks.
       </li>
       <li>
        Accept enforcement of our borders and advocate for LEGAL immigration.
       </li>
       <li>
        Stop with the white guilt ( whitey is a majority, most aren't sniveling cowards, and don't appreciate being demonized).
       </li>
       <li>
        Most importantly; vote Pelosi, Warren, Waters, and Schoomer out. They seriously damage your cause. Pelosi for sure and Waters is probably losing cognitive function. Your party got " old" and is extremely out of touch with the majority of America. Enjoy the new justice, you won't like them and they'll be here awhile.

       You know how it is said that Trump was "memed into office"? I thoroughly believe that people are trying to meme the next Civil War on some level.

      <p>
       The real question we need to ask is
       <em>
        why?
       </em>
       There are no problems going on in this country, as far as I know, that cannot be solved through peaceful and lawful means. So, either there are some huge problems we don't know about that cannot be resolved in compliance with our existing laws and constitution, or "someone" wants regime change. I fear it is the latter.

       In my opinion this is the culmination of a RWC plan to destroy the U.S from within and create a "Corporation Nation State" with corporations in control instead of an elected government, think "Roller Ball" with James Caan. no protections for the "Little guy", modern feudalism.

If you know a revolution is at hand then you prepare in various ways: try to take guns away, lockdown social media/news, setup microwave tower defense systems.

       The answer is that globalist liberal leftists want to create an International Order NWO by coordinating an attack on all borders, of all nations. The liberal leftists include Zionists, Democrats, Socialists and progressives to some varying degree or another. Eradicating borders makes it easier to create a One World government. In order to eradicate the borders, you have to make it seem like the immigrants are poor and have children, they use empathy to achieve the goal. Donald Trump sees through this One World strategy, and is very cold and calculating about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does not want America's borders to suffer the same fate as the UK, Sweden, Spain and most of Europe including Germany. All these countries are currently being occupied under the guise of immigrants needing asylum. This coordinated effort is funded by many organizations, but we should pay close attention to the CIA and DOJ. Both are currently being investigated for attempting to derail the Trump campaign, and both were run by leftists under Obama, alomg with the same immigration "death camps" they claim are Trump's invention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump spent most of 2017 on golf courses. The left has alot to hide, including child trafficking under former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's watch. Her relation to John Podesta and Anthony Weiner's wife, missing Haitian kids, a sex trafficking camp in Arizona that was recently destroyed by unknown individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these mysteries being covered up, alomg with who is arming all these active shooters. All by the left, perpetrated by the liberal media like CNN and MSNBC who are complicit in spreading false and misleading information, such as the girl from El Salvador being seperated from her mother. The left is rife with lies, and their only defense is getting people to hate Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       When that gets tired, they'll do another false flag mass shooting to try and get guns taken away or try taking away some other rights. Anything to get America to unwillingly subscribe  to a world order view.

      <p>
       Me personally, when I go to a doctor, I do so because I am unable to treat myself. It's hard work and a lot of time and money, going to medical school and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know, I suppose you're right! I guess it doesn't really take much to be president these days. At most. not much more than some long-running, targeted advertising and marketing. No need for actual experience or qualifications--let alone an interest in the job! So I suppose in a way you are spot on to brag about his failures for him! (You're just part of his brand, baby. Gold star for you!)

       Anyway, no need for me to continue, because the lesson here is

       the people that run the US do not want a civil society or civilization, that is a threat to their way of life.

      <p>
       the global bad guys also want the US split into smaller parts for easy control.
      </p>
      <p>
       they would love to see the american multicultural experiment fail with extraordinary violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       the idea of someone like Bernie or Al Gore being president is a nightmare for them as they might be held to account, so rather than risk that, civil war and fascism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have said the 2 party system makes civil war inevitable as there is no way for new factions to develop at all and therefore the frustration only gets more intense until violence, which is what we are seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also looks like full capture of the government by a single minority party of extremists, which indicates the actual failure of the constitution and so maybe on a certain level bad ideas deserve to perish and I would rather whatever tragedy than the daily ongoing tragedy that is the us government police state.

       Do you have an argument? The democrats are the ones who want to amend the constitution. They want to screw with 2A. They’re the ones who want hate speech laws, whatever that fucking means. They’re she ones that call it a “living breathing document”. It may be bizarre to you that it’s Donald Trump defending the constitution, but that’s not bizarro world it’s reality.

       Why is it even a partisan question in your opinion whether or not the Constitution is a living breathing document? Wouldn't  the fact we have amended it in the past point to that being the case? If we couldn't change anything about the Constitution from it's original form half the population or more wouldn't even be able to vote.

       I think the key confusion is what the people who are telling you it’s a living breathing document intend to do and what you think they’re doing. It’s really sort of a bait and switch. See, the English system we broke away from didn’t have the concept of “unconstitutional”. Since the government was sovereign, any act of parliament was, by definition, constitutional. There’s was a “living breathing” document. In the United States, we have the amendment process and it’s by the people, not by some all powerful collection of judges running the government like dear old England.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. Constitution is essentially a contract forming a union of states. In any contract, provisions have a fixed meaning. When you sign on the dotted line, you expect them to remain constant over time. When disputes arise, you always attempt to ascertain what the parties believed they were agreeing to. The ratifiers acted with this expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
       James Madison
      </p>
      <p>
       “I entirely concur in the propriety of resorting to the sense in which the Constitution was accepted and ratified by the nation. In that sense alone it is the legitimate Constitution. And if that be not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for a consistent and stable, more than for a faithful exercise of its powers. If the meaning of the text be sought in the changeable meaning of the words composing it, it is evident that the shape and attributes of the Government must partake of the changes to which the words and phrases of all living languages are constantly subject. What a metamorphosis would be produced in the code of law if all its ancient phraseology were to be taken in its modern sense!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomas Jefferson
      </p>
      <p>
       “On every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted, recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the text, or intended against it, conform to the probable one in which it was passed.”
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, there’s a lot of sneaky backdoor tactics being employed to sign people up changing the constitution in ways they wouldn’t agree with if it were better explained to them. If this is a confusing topic, it might behoove you to closer examine the motives and intent of the people telling you it’s a “living breathing” document.

The government doesn’t grant it to you, it’s not like your drivers license. It’s a human right, and it’s no coincidence that the United States (and recently kinda sorta Czechia) are the only places with actual freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re trying to suggest that fresh off the war these people drafted the bill of rights with the intention of allowing a single generation driven by animus to swoop in and rewrite everything? You need to conduct a constitutional convention to do that, and that’s nearly impossible. And yet, if the Democrats keep this circus going they may just end up making that a reality because if you look at state governorships and the numbers in the house and senate, we aren’t that far off. And I PRAY TO GOD that doesn’t happen so please for the love of baby Jesus let’s hope the Democrats get their shit together before that Pandora’s box can even come close to being opened.

       There is unknown and speculated on corruption by politicians at heart of all this that we only get brief glimpses because of places like this that is eating away chunks of this country and western society as a whole. Whether it's intentional or not or it is just natural decay because of decadence and greed I dunno but the affects are the same. Plus, there is just plan ole everyday corruption that people see every day or read about in the news that we cant do anything about because of the power structure runs of greed and avarice now more than ever before.

       The government does want a civil war, because a civil war would be possible to put down and keep the existing power structure in control. A united violent insurrection against the government would most likely result in foreign governments having significant control over the united states government moving forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB know that the American people need to believe "the bad guys" have been defeated. I believe Trump was a legitimate concession made to Americans, and it already has 50% of the people or more believing TPTB are being defeated. Anyone can clearly see Trump is making pragmatic changes to our policies in a manner which is in fact benefiting Americans. He's also continuing the most important policies of TPTB-war and debt. He's doing a lot of good things for Americans, and continuing a lot of bad things. His administration does not represent a kow tow to the interests of Americans, on part of TPTB. If we will only be satiated by violent upheaval, civil war will come as a method of self preservation on part of TPTB. Avoid the temptation to promote violent insurrection. Make sure TPTB know that the people are serious about it as a possibility, though, and be serious about that threat as a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       The threat of violence underpins any confrontational negotiation. However, we should push forward towards receiving more concessions from the state by electing people outside the democrat-republican falsely partisan charade. Let's put some third parties in office and really shake things up. I'm willing to bet we'll see very different platforms start to emerge as a result. It could change America, and the world. Let TPTB know that what Americans are willing to settle for is nothing less than our Democracy, and unless TPTB want to lose it all, they better comply. There is no deal to make, except to let TPTB keep their riches and enjoy their luxuries from the sidelines of America's future.

       Problem-Reaction-Solution. Classic Hegelian dialectic where violence results to less freedoms, more regulations on personal rights. Pelosi for example crying for more gun control legislation. I don't think they want a civil war, but I think they want a divided country, and right now it seems to be divided 4 ways between the establishment Democrats, vs Socialist Democrats, establishment Republicans, vs Libertarian/self funded billionaire GOP. It's just a mess.

       Yes, but it's still quite gradual. It'll get worse in tandem with the muslim-immigrant/christian-native incitement in the EU. The famous 'third world war' letter Pyke sent to Mazzini has been widely discredited and exposed as hoax and forgery. And yet we're headed exactly where it pointed at.

       No, any talk of another civil war is absolutely ridiculous. What is most likely happening is that the media (including reddit) is being run by anti-human sociopaths. It's kind of like if internet trolls ran the news. They try to divide people as much as possible and to get them emotionally involved. Anything can be faked, protesters can be faked, comments can be faked, consent can be faked, and stories can be faked. Whatever is driving the sentiment of a civil war is either being faked or amplified by the media.

       I mean yeah, that is all true, but a desired result of these people inciting the insanity and division would quite possibly be a civil war. It's not necessarily going to happen (not if the people don't want it to), but it's being pushed.

       the problem with civil wars is no one ever really sees them coming when they start, and they seem so obvious after the fact.

       i said it while the primaries were happening were one political assasination/attempt away from riots, realistically if some one took out trump the following 24 hours would determine the next 50 years.

       Do the people that push for civil war even understand what the reality of that would be? I’ve been hearing so much about a civil war take two from both sides of the political isle as if it’s some sort of natural response to people disagreeing and on one hand conflict is very much human nature but anyone that actually advocates for a second American civil war doesn’t understand what it would look like... it would make these school/office shootings look like a joke there would be so much pointless bloodshed and massive violence and terrorist activity in every state and city no one would be safe everyone would be scared and would want big old Uncle Sam to come make them safe, regardless of the consequences. Not a good scenario... we are relatively free to express ourselves now a days but in a time of civil strife? Lmfao. Would the second civil war even have front lines? Would it be geographically organized like the first? Unlikely it would look like Iraq on steroids with even more bickering political factions and the sad reality is that it would be brother on brother regardless of people being mature enough to realize that fact. A second civil war is unacceptable and should be avoided at all costs

       as a canadian paying attention you are 100% right. i mean IF we had a border or even just a fucking fence we might be able to stay out of it, but any sort of civil conflict in the US means a horde of refugees walking across the board at minimum, and an outright invasion at worst.

       At the very least, the political theatre is content to push divide and conquer strategies to a critical mass. My opinion is that a civil war won't happen naturally, but becomes recognized in order to act as a scapegoat for legitimate state problems that citizens could be suffering from, if and once this becomes reality (war, militarization of the police, financial collapse, surveillance, job automation). Social movements that we have seen recently have been indicative of this: Antifa, white nationalists, BLM, SJW identity politics, Dem vs Repub hysteria, endemic drug issues, gender identity, religion, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any true social movement will be either controlled (OWS) or silenced (DAPL) and you can bet your ass anything else in the scope of discussion is to keep us distracted and hating our neighbors.

       I get the exact same feeling, but I get it from the media.

       Government and Media are in cahoots? So possibily the government.

       But YES, there is something going on where the PAB are really going
       <em>
        out of their way

       to make people mad and violent against each-other.

       If you objectively look at the US, not much is different. Other then the amount of anger coming from the people. The laws and the policies are very much the same. But the
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       are acting much different.

       Definitely yes, imho. I'd say the whole plan is to make America fall, like the Roman empire. It's almost impossible to make it fall via invasion, since the US is the most armed country on Earth, not to mention they likely have the most powerful current military (though that could be dismantled, the private gun ownership is more difficult to dismantle) . Thus the only way to destroy the US is via financial collapse, civil war or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       One theory goes that the cabal infiltrate countries, pump them up financially, instill strong morals in the population at firyt, use them for military conquest, then destroy the population' s morals, collapse their economy and destroy the nation. Some good examples would obviously be the Roman Empire, WW2 Germany and now the US, though we could probably get some examples of smaller nationa here as well if we looked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch yourselves Americans, stay united, don't fall for the false divisions either by race, sex or political leaning (or anything else) and don't fall for the provocations. I say this for the US, but it really applies to the whole world, every nation and humanity as a whole.

       After so many instances of it being caught on tape, why are cops still doing it?

       Yes! I have been thinking this for a few weeks. Here's my theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that both the right and left are polarizing to the extremes. Each time one does something it causes the other side to push further from center. Then this has the same effect on the other. The media is in charge on this one. They are purely responsible for the polarization. I bet the corporatocracy is masterminding this whole thing. The economic elite are finding it. The politicians are slowly taking our rights and money to the point where we will be slaves. Not after we all kill each other though. Together we are strong, but break us up into a thousand different ideological tribes, and we are nothing! It's their plan. The country is too populated. Some people need to go. Not gonna lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't say for sure if they want war or if they want to divide us to rule absolutely over us.

       We are marching slowly in that direction, but by "our government" do you mean whole government apparatus, intelligence services, or the Trump administration? The Trump administration is definitely playing us against each other and inciting violence with hateful rhetoric. But outside of Trump, what is happening that makes you think that?

       The government is aware of the impending collapse and is approaching the "use it or lose it" moment with the military/law-enforcement establishment. I think they're afraid if they don't have the Big Clampdown/Roundup soon, they won't have anyone left to enforce it.

       Thus, the asset-forfeiture, TSA dick-waving, open stripping of the 4th and 5th amendment protections by the courts, etc. They
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       , shall we say, the more excitable portions of the populace to react in splashy, bloody ways. Then will come the prime-time declaration of martial law by the weeping President, and those billions of hollow-points will be handed out to the 'troops'.

       The government does want a civil war, because a civil war would be possible to put down and keep the existing power structure in control. A united violent insurrection against the government would most likely result in foreign governments having significant control over the united states government moving forward.
      </p>

       TPTB know that the American people need to believe "the bad guys" have been defeated. I believe Trump was a legitimate concession made to Americans, and it already has 50% of the people or more believing TPTB are being defeated. If will only be satiated by violent upheaval, civil war will come as a method of self preservation on part of TPTB. Avoid the temptation to promote violent insurrection. Make sure TPTB know that the people
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       serious about it as a possibility, though, and be serious about that threat
       <strong>
        as
       </strong>
       a possibility. The threat of violence underpins any confrontational negotiation. However, we should push forward towards receiving more concessions from the state by electing people outside the democrat-republican falsely partisan charade. Let's put some third parties in office and really shake things up. I'm willing to bet we'll see very different platforms start to emerge as a result. It could change America, and the world.

       They wouldn't be desperately trying to disarm us if that were the case.
       <br/>
       They just want the usual: us hating each other over minor differences rather than setting those differences aside and going after them - the wealthy psychopaths who terrorize the world; who want to keep us sick, poor, powerless &amp; scared.
       <br/>
       Men vs women, black vs white, "left" vs "right", christian vs muslim, police vs minorities.

       They don't care which one you latch onto, as long as it keeps you from focusing your attention on them.
