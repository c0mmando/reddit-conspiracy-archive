      <p>
       Since the dawn of History men have often fought to reach the top of the food chain.Men were naturally aggressive and goal oriented in their lives before the gradual advent of the 21st century.The straight forwardness of men has caused them to often be adversaries of the powerful and in most cases checks to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       it was men in USA who fought for independence since they didn't want to pay another mans living expenses.It was men that went to civil war to fight for what they believed was right.
      </p>
      <p>
       By now you get the point, men are naturally Masculine hence the name.Although masculinity does have its draw backs it's pivotal to a functioning society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the Government and certain powerful figures are using their power to break the masculine cycle.They are pushing for a new type of male. A more feminine man a kinder , selfless male.One devoid of masculinity and filled to the brim with propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they be doing this? Simple! An emasculated man is a docile man , one who doesn't fight for what he believes.One he simply conforms to power because he is afraid of conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here at ConspiringConspiracists we will be judging the plausibility of this theory over the next week through immersive content.
      </p>
      <p>
       But please tell us , what do you think about this?

       Actually, punctuation is supposed to go inside the quotation marks.

       I just googled that and the first link from Purdue says for question and exclamation marks it goes inside if it’s part of the quote, outside if it applies to the whole sentence. Going by that, in this case, it belongs outside.

       I don't understand why people get flak for linking to their own content. All it means is that the owner/author will create a sock puppet, or ask/beg someone else to post the link for him. How is that any better? Tricking someone to view your content because it appears to be some organic event is not being truthful nor is it in the spirit of this community to act that way when it's one of the very things we try to expose on a daily basis. News companies and dirty moderators use those shady tactics.

       Take ashwaganda and forskolli extract. Exercise HARD CORE (a few 100-meter sprints release 400% more growth hormone than 60 mins of jogging), take cold showers and meditate. No processed shit/soy/plastic packaging. Dedicate to Intermittent Fasting (at least 16 hours per day), with a 30-48 hour fast at least once per month.

       The will to fight is very important for survival, provided it is tempered by some measure of restraint associated with reasoned decision making. Western prisons are filled with millions of aggressive men who would not be there had they possessed more of a filter. These days most important battles are fought and won strategically rather than via straightforward aggression.

       Aggression channeled into productivity changes nations.There is obviously a spectrum, society it seems is pushing us towards a complete neutering of aggression.

       What you are describing is machevillianism.Men are inherently selfless most likely due to them being providers in early hunter gatherer eras.The shift to machevillianism is extremely difficult and takes willfull effort along with fluidity in mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also of my opinion that machevillianism needs an internal aggression skill fully wrapped in stinging words.Questions which wound an opponent need to have an underlying aggression behind them.Something general films and media portray as "ungentlemently" in a guy.

       Men are not being emasculated but they are facing seismic shifts in our world that require them to adapt and evolve.  But the culprit is not a government or a group but a changing society that over the last 50 years moved from tight knit communities with extended families and someone always at home to a society where the family ran away from that community to the suburbs and then began divorcing at massive rates leaving single parent household and even when they did stay together, both parents would have to work and thus the real culprit: childhood isolation (aka - latch key kids).
      </p>
      <p>
       With the absent parents and the disappearing extended family, millions upon millions of children (for decades now) are being left alone with zero feedback and boundaries in their formative years (10-18).  When isolation occurs in these years, children do not grow, do not develop life lessons like socialization, dating, self love, peer relationships....they don't learn to take care of themselves in all the ways society requires (jobs, family, partners, friends).  Instead the develop social anxiety, depression, exaggerated egos that shield them from truth.  They internalize traumatic events from childhood and never move past them. They are essentially stuck at the emotional age where they were left to their own devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they chronologically grow up but the inner self stays stuck at that childish emotional age.  They even have a name for it and therapy that specifically addresses it: Adult Children (most of the science done on it is from the massive studies they did on alcoholic families which turn out to be the perfect test case for these adult children).
      </p>
      <p>
       So blaming females or a secret group is a waste of time IF you want to get better.  There is help folks and MRA. MGTOW and redpill is not the answer.  Getting into therapy and working on growing up your inner emotional age and self are the keys.  You literally have to learn to be your 'own good parent' and help that 'child behind the wheel' of your life become the man or the woman that they never grew into.

       Lots of truth packed into those paragraphs. We are evolving and many of the challenges that people perceive as originating with an abandonment of traditional values are actually connected to a rediscovery of what traditional values actually were before civilization stripped us of our humanity.

      <p>
       What's absolutely true is that we have the ability to shape our own destiny and to choose our values. Self-determination and free will are powerful perspectives in our toolkit.

       The key there is healthy ego versus shame based ego.  The former will set you free (things like healthy entitlement) and the latter will keep you stuck beating your head against the wall.

       Honestly I think we have way too little shame as it is. A little shame is healthy to regulate your own behavior. The reason I don't steal isn't because it's illegal. The reason is that inflicting unjust loss on others and thereby causing them distress is
       <em>
        shameful
       </em>
       to me and I empathize with how they would feel when being deprived of whatever it was I would have stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have no shame, you have no reason not to act entirely rationally like a psychopathic robot and that is not how stable and caring societies are made. There's a utility in shame, juts don't let it cripple you. Finding the balance is the key to good parenting.

       If you're really interested in shame, it's a fascinating topic.  Toxic shame (internalized, exaggerated, self loathing shame) is the underpinning of all these ills.  I super strongly suggest reading an AMAZINg book called "Healing the Shame that Binds"
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically this bad form of shame makes it impossible to grow because at ts core the erson thinks they are broken and the shame just hides it all.  That boom changed my life.

       I mean, intentionally as in America as a whole moved this way, yes.  Intentionally as in a group meant to maliciously destroy our support systems, no.  The only part that is nefarious to me is the folks that since the 60s have been killing the economy with tax cuts for the rich, deregulation and numerous other aspects that made it impossible for single earners to support of family.  Both parents having to work is the only thing I see as intentional (income inequality, rich getting al the net gains, etc).

       Oh I totally agree that it's less of a nefarious business situation and more something natural.  For a while I was super interested in the globalist bankers, Monopoly corporations, etc, all in search of the peak of The Pyramid of Power.  But I quickly realized the Cap Stone isn't an individual or entity, but just human greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we get to that conclusion it's less of an Evil Genius take over the world mentality. BUT, think about competition and cooperation. Imagine you're one of the few multi billionaires. How did you get to that point? Manipulation, coersion, domination.  Now since you're in a league of only a handful of others, and your network is so vast as to maintain your riches, then you MUST discuss with there other billionaires.  This creates cartels, shared but secret invested interests, under the table dealings, corruption, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically I just think that naturally humans would lead to this point, and that when I think it was intentional, it's like all these powerful dudes knew they had to work together or else they eat each other alive.  That's probably also a rich person past time in itself, but I think that the "Illuminati" exists conceptually.

       Bingo.

       IMHO, the real rabbit hole, especially in America, is that since we were colonies, we've had a strikingly stunning and creepy repetition going on between the two poles of our ideology: conservatism versus progressivism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sociologists and such have devoted lifetime studies tracking how with stunning regularity we lean conservative for like 40 years and then switch back to leaning progressive.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The cyclical theory refers to a model used by historian Arthur Schlesinger to attempt to explicate the fluctuations in politics throughout American history. Liberalism and conservatism are rooted in the "national mood" that shows a continuing shift in national involvement between public purpose and private interest. Each of these cycles includes a phase of dominant public interest, a transition phase, and a phase of prevalent private interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schlesinger defined these to be "self-generating and autonomous". They begin in the mentality of the masses, rather than creations of influential individuals of a time period. Leaders or politicians are representations of the "mood", chosen to express the voice of the majority. Shifts in the national mentality are initiated when discontent with present conditions over time drives Americans to pursue a new trend that promises to satisfy the interest of the masses. This discontent, described by Schlesinger as "inextinguishable", drives the cycles of change in national politics.

       And believing wholeheartedly in this ridiculous repetition I can see we are at the junctures of one of the switches.  Post WWII was extremely progressive till the early 70s when it flipped back conservative and since then we've seen the conservatism wreak havoc.

       There have always been effeminate men throughout civilized history, if you look, you will find them everywhere. Even pre contact, most human tribes have had a space for those who don’t fit into binary gender or sex roles.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can still criticize the way we deal with these things today but you can’t look to the past to justify a degradation.

       There’s a lot of discourse theory on sex and sexuality. Start with The History of Sexuality by Michel Foucault if you’d like to join in on the conversation.

       Here's a crazy theory that will get me downvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women are naturally easier to control mentally, men more easily physically.  Assuming gender roles and things like that are natural, think about how all throughout history the social chains men wear is physical labor, work of some kind.  With women, it's been entirely mental, with marriage rights, and other inequalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that They realize it's much easier to control "feminine" minds, and so I think the large push towards LGBT everything on the youth is to make everyone more feminine and easier to control mentally. We no longer live in a physical world of going to the factory and coming home to a home cooked meal.  The world is temporal now, so it makes sense to make everyone the homogenous.

       The shift from that physical world also marks a shift from self- or group-subsistence to dependency on large systems (the state? automation?). Which gender is more likely to accept that dependency?

       Whenever the subject of the feminization of western men shows up, it is immediately downvoted into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so obvious to an old guy like me. I look around when I'm out and about and I just cringe. I don't have anything against effeminate men, it's just that there seems to be so many now I can't help but wonder why. Soft, weak and fat. Bad posture, pasty complexion and unconfident demeanor...when at the same time women are becoming more masculine...it's no wonder marriages are failing at well over 50%. The natural instinctive roles of men and  women are being attacked as "POLITICALLY INCORRECT". Women are miserable because their men  are too weak and useless when it comes to performing traditional mens work around the yard and house. Some can't even start a fucking lawnmower. Cultural Marxism is a plague meant to destroy western society and it's starting to actually destroy western society. Feminism is a component of that pile of shit...attacking men for simply being Masculine. Masculinity and a MANS forward thinking is what is needed to survive what may end up being some very tough times ahead of us. Effeminate men will just sit in a corner and cry while their feminist wives scream at them to do something when the shit hits the fan.

       I think corporations/oligarchs/secret societies bribing our government (and imposing economic slavery on the people) is a more
severe conspiracy (higher priority in stopping)
but I agree that SJWism IS damaging the culture of society to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what this so called "cultural marxism" thing is that some people throw around, (I don't think it's the correct term). But EXTREME political correctness / SJW-ism is modern propaganda that the establishment manufactured to shit on actual woke pro-working class leftists, divide men and women and maybe make men more docile and women more obnoxious (dividing couples). I know not all men/women fit their gender properly, and that's ok. But there is
a HUGE ARTIFICIAL PUSH to turn large numbers of men docile, and women into aggressive man wannabes, divide the people, etc. It's degeneracy and not natural to push this wide for it. Acceptance is NOT the same as pushing it artificially.
Imagine men and women all swapping masculinity/femininity. Fucked up society. There's a reason it's not natural.
The anomalies (lack of kinder word) should not be considered the norm. Respect the anomalies but don't push it lol wtf.

       The only thing I can think of, is to educate those around you, very calmly. If SJWs are too close minded and will rage, just agree to disagree and leave the conversation, offering to return to the debate if they're open minded and calm to continue -- that's better than fueling divide and conquer. Another option is just trying to calm them down by sympathizing with them. "You want female equality right? I want the same thing + male equality. Humanism is a sensible alternative to feminism. But realize the most EXTREME inequality is against all WORKERS my friends".
      </p>
      <p>
       Plant the seed of the truth. Shifting away from divide and conquer male vs female, and instead to workers vs extremist oligarchs (the haves vs the have nots, i.e. establishment vs working/middle/upper middle classes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain arguments like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Establishment sponsored SJW argument: "the problem with the world is white male patriarchy, we need more female elites, I mean female CEOs".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then compare to a reasonable person:
      </p>
      <p>
       "nope, the problem is the corrupt elites hoarding extreme amounts of wealth at everyone elses expense. The gender or race of the oligarchs or puppet means nothing. We should do things like regulate corporations with a democratically controlled/not bribed government, break up monopolies, remove money from politics, nationalize the FED, remove cronyism from social programs, etc."
      </p>
      <p>
       Stuff like that. The other extreme side of the coin is the people who think "SJW = leftist" which is nonsense. The distinction should be made about leftist economics (pro-worker). Even normal leftist social issues like "protect vulnerable groups like victims, women, minorities, etc." has been twisted 
into crap like "white male patriarchy, Clinton is a woman, she should be president!" lol. Representation means nothing if
the puppet is part of the establishment. Jill Stein was a million times better than Clinton. But gender doesn't matter, policies do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe "SJW" crap is authoritarian but not really something you can put on the spectrum just like racism.
NWO corporate take over is way bigger of an issue:

       SJWs are a pain in the ass sometimes, but the elites are still controlling us and laughing all the way to the bank.
Common ground with SJWs can turn them into more reasonable people....hopefully.

       But using terms like left and right is foolish in this case. You can have far left hippies who are not SJWs (but some are). Likewise, you can have an extreme right extreme authoritarian fascist that's not racist (but some are).
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be different opinions on what "radical left" means,
hence I avoid meaningless terms like that and go for exact, specific names for things. When I say "SJW" there is no confusion what I mean. It's the stupid third wave feminist/muh white patriarchy crap/58 genders bullshit parading around as if it represents left wingers, and it clearly does not. I'm center left, and 100% not SJW and not an extreme authoritarian either (more like libertarian left).

       There's more  than one leader and there's more than one hierarchy. The head of FIFA isnt the coach of Argentina and the coach isn't Messi...

       They ruined everything when they split up power and made it meaningless. Every polytheistic God is a progenitor of an ethnicity just like monotheistic prophets. The Hebrews were lower class and subject to imprisonment just like me now because the upper class didn't know what to do with them and wanted to punish them for literally who they are rather than anything they had control over. My back hurts and I don't have that much energy. I will say that monotheistic religion is inherently more racist than what came before it.
      </p>

       Power is not over a particular thing. You either have absolute power or your ethnicity is being oppressed by division of power giving nobody it's benefit.

       I know this is super lame and really sucks but that's life kid we're not unique magical creatures. Also coveting of power is retarded because when in power the person transforms and kind of just does eerily almost the same thing as certain other rulers who share certain genetic traits that get activated only when they have absolute power. Some mammals change so much that they grow fuzzy patches of hair on their groins when they're dominant. Our species can be fooled more easily than them. Kim jong ils son doesn't have any PHYSICAL traits that are there just because he sort of has unlimited power. My point however is that it's illogical to directly covet power because it's one of those paradoxes where what does it matter what color the grass is if your fricking eyes change when you stand on your neighbors lawn while he barbeques?

       It's unpleasant but it's not unpleasant in the way you think it is.

       It's not relevant to my point and it's wrong in a bunch of ways. Power or status is not meaningless when it's not absolute. Your argument for this point is  absurd. Case in point, getting promoted gives you a non trivial rise in decision making power and money... Even if you're not the owner of the company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your tone is honestly funny to me. But I don't have any more time to wade through your diatribes, especially when you didn't even aknowledge the relevant rebuttal I made to your argument.

       Have a good day. And try reading some books, your muddled thinking sounds as if your stuck in your own head.

       Being brought up in single parent homes, or homes with largely absent "father figure", along with overzealous parenting (eg helicopter mom), PLUS all those xenoestrogens and psychotropes is what killed Western masculinity.

        Do you realize that in addition to fluoridating water, why, there are studies underway to fluoridate salt, flour, fruit juices, soup, sugar, milk, ice cream? Ice cream, Mandrake? Children's ice cream!...You know when fluoridation began?...1946. 1946, Mandrake. How does that coincide with your post-war Commie conspiracy, huh? It's incredibly obvious, isn't it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any choice. That's the way your hard-core Commie works. I first became aware of it, Mandrake, during the physical act of love... Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I — I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred, Mandrake. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women, Mandrake...but I do deny them my essence.

       Yes and no. A lot of men drop their masculinity to be gentle and caring. But I work in a field where I see people that have nothing to lose turn feral. Masculinity adjusts based on environment, and a docile man can be as vicious as a wild animal under pressure or stress.
