       Why do you usually see high IQ people commit suicide? What do they know that we don't? Do they know that life is meaningless? I'm wondering a lot about the meaninglessness of life lately.

       Haha!  Thank you.  It is worth the read.

      <p>
       Crowd sourcing intelligence is the way to go.  People will freely share their thoughts, and then they are openly discussed and someone else will share another thought.  There is usually someone who will say something that the others are not thinking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a great feeling when I find those gems of information, or I post something that is a gem to someone else.

       Of course, it is frustrating to sort through all the shitty comments, and the "reddit quips" that take up the first 20 or so comments in a thread before I find something that is fucking relevant.

       Exactly. Even if life, in general, is meaningless and we're only here for a number of years. At least try and make the best out of them. Release yourself from the spirit of control and manipulation, and see life in all it's glory. You have the power to do it, no one's stopping you. Life has a lot to offer, if you're willing to accept it.

       Just because someone believes life has no ultimate meaning doesn’t mean they hate life. No one can know whether or not life has meaning, how we interpret that is always going to be based around life experience and personal faith. Just because I believe life has no intrinsic meaning doesn’t mean I hate life or need to be ‘released from the spirit of control’. I believe in being kind and doing what makes us happy, as long as we aren’t hurting other people.

       Why do you think I have been conditioned? My opinions on why life exists are my own, just as yours are your own. When I say I don’t believe life has any particular meaning, I’m speaking in a grand, philosophical sense; I’m saying that I believe things just are because they are. None of us can know why life exists. It’s all a matter of opinion and faith. But that doesn’t mean I don’t have any morals.

       People are entitled to believe what we want to believe, just as you are. I’m not hurting anybody by believing life has no intrinsic meaning. I believe in being kind and doing what makes us happy, as long as it isn’t hurting anybody else. I don’t know why you’ve taken such an aggressive stance on my comment.

       You only think life is meaningless because you "believe" we live on a spinning ball in infinite space, were preceded by now-extinct giant lizards that preceded us by millions of years, and that you evolved from pond scum.

       And you “believe” that the earth is flat, dinosaurs never existed, and we are here by the will of a divine creator. Both work, because the key word here is “believe”. We’re both entitled to believe whatever we want, and neither of us truly know the answers. We all base our beliefs on life experience, choice, and faith.

       Are you insinuating that I think I’m a genius? Because I don’t. I’m saying that people’s personal existential philosophies have very little to do with intelligence. No one knows the purpose of life, but we are all entitled to our own faiths and philosophies. Also, generally speaking, people who take their own lives are not ignorant, they’re in pain, and often mentally ill.

       Also as others have alluded to, many lack the ability to switch off so to speak. They are often also mental poking and proding etc and struggle to relax because of it. There is just something different about their minds and the way they are driven. They are often obsessive compulsive too. It's mentally very draining.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also many hit a wall in what they are trying to do. Maybe due to lack of resources, or just in trying to break new ground. Many intelligent people dedicate themselves to a singular area and it almost becomes their identity. If they fail then that is often too hard a blow to get up from.

       Most people entirely change their profession something like 7 times in their lives if not more. Most geniuses will stay in the same field their whole lives.

       If you mean for a person that thinks too much about things? I'm going to assume this
      </p>
      <p>
       Healthy ways: Find a hobby, work out, meet people (perhaps at bars, where you can make small talk without anxiety and thinking too much), read, make something (in real life or virtually), learn about mindfulness (especially this!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Unhealthy ways: too much sleep, over/under eating, drinking, substance use, having lots of free time, not structuring life (partying, random events of debauchery), performing dangerous acts to get an adrenaline rush

       eh, I have a great degree. My HS teachers gave me a hard time and I was mostly kicked out of classes. I spent most of my time in resource room or walking around or skipping. I got in college via SAT.
I have a horrible family. I can't blame school but they didn't help.

       After college I suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. But everything I mentioned is pretty much the same. I have a harder time putting thoughts to paper.

       Exercise is great. Having animals around calms me down a lot, too. Drawing, cooking, gardening, photography, birdwatching, cleaning or tidying with good music on. Being creative in general is a wonderful help. If you can get the motivation, of course.

       An easy way to stop thinking that helps for me is to smoke weed. I smoke quite soft hash and it helps me a lot getting home and not having a 1000 thoughts in my head spinning. It's not bad thoughts, it's just exhausting and can't really stop it. Smoke a bit and I get a break from that and feel a hit more like a kid up there. Like lighter or something. I smoke for health reason but this is a side effect I've got from it that I really appreciate.

       If you're a regular person slogging it from day to day, there's always
       <em>
        hope
       </em>
       .  If you fall into despair, there's always the chance that you'll meet mr/mrs right, get that job you've always wanted, drive that car you've dreamed of, win a lottery, etc. and you'll finally be happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you already have everything you could want and you fall into despair - it doesn't matter if you're a successful musician, genius, billionaire, whatever - you don't have the lifeline that regular people have. You don't have that hope that with just a little more time you can still turn your life around and make it better because it's already really, really fucking good.  That's when people start thinking, "If I'm not happy with my life now, how can I ever be happy?".  That's also about the time a towel and a doorknob start looking like a reasonable choice.

       Geniuses commits suicide because they are well aware of how much bullshit, lies, greed, and control happens on a daily basis worldwide. They self educated themselves about how society really works in life.
They're smart for not having any kids so that they wont suffer for the mess that we have caused when they grow up. Also smart enough for not getting married, unless they are really lucky to find a life time mate. etc etc etc
Its really unfortunate that some geniuses commits suicide due to depression, stress, anxiety, etc
      </p>

       Remember folks, if you want to change the way the world is today, don't have any new born kids at all. spread the news about about it (Say no to having new born children)

       I overheard the following from my 6-year-old once: "That's why they don't use cats for war. They scatter."

       Geniuses are like cats. Good luck intentionally weaponizing them.

       Raising geniuses is really, really, I mean really hard. Dabrowski has a theory of "overexcitabilities" that describes the various personality intensities that often accompany a high IQ. The model is useful in showing why it so hard for high-IQ people to relate. (Your comment elsewhere ITT "imagine everyone you meet is the village idiot" is spot-freaking-on.) OEs are ridiculously challenging to deal with as a parent. Any productivity that you, the (presumably) genius parent of your genius children, may intend or aspire to is subverted into basic parenting energy trying to mold them into decent humans (or super-soldier evil geniuses, depending on your goals).
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes a village to raise a child. Now couple that with your assertion about the village idiots and imagine where that leads.

       Imagine everyone you meet is the villiage idiot.

      <p>
       People talk slooooow, they think slooooow, they rarely have anything interesting to say. Fluff and current events 24/7 at 2 words per minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       You come up with a new idea filled with mindblowing possibilities and people sit there stunned, blinking at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and sometimes, Geniuses are just obnoxious as fuck, being told you're a superman for most of your life has that effect. They usually have fairly weak social skills partly as a result of this. They're also fairly autistic which doesn't help. People start talking to them, the conversation gets going people get lost, confused and/or intimidated, communication gives way to awkward silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh fuck me, almost forgot the "Here's my IQ, what's yours?" pissing contest, that never EVER gets stale. Seriously, on the count of 3 shout your IQ and let's fucking move on please.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're rarely actually challenged. When they face a decent challenge, most of them have no tools to deal with it. Their ideas and beliefs haven't been field tested which leads to false positives and shitty ideas, because nobody could tell them no with any kind of metal muscle.
      </p>
      <p>
       They often lack common sense, I know a fairly disproportionate number of them, and Man alive, can they be some of the dumbest fucks on the planet sometimes. "Here's a unified field theory I came up with on the toilet", "Did you remember to wipe your ass?" "......Yeah, sure did, be right back"
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning is  subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the meaning of life is to observe the universe around us, random probability particles kinda lend themseves to this thought. Basically you're meant to be the audience to nature's great show.

       I agree with much of what wrote. However from my experience with highly intelligent people; most of them are not obnoxious (they are just bored with most people (village idiot thing)), almost anyone who brags or says anything about their IQ is not a genius, many don't spend a lot of mental energy on the day to day function. The last four sentences don't add anything to what you wrote.

       Sometimes men build cities, kingdoms, empires for themselves. These are places fit for all the finest things. And yet, man is not satisfied. There is more to be sought, to be conquered, to bring into the fold. This is the folly of such, for all things must have an end, an end to growth, a sense of satisfaction with what is (not what could be). Many highly intelligent people do not get the memo until late, and trying to include such am absolute idea in a system that doesn't already have space for it can be a lot. Rather pity such moments, because immortality of ideas is the same as other immortalities; non. Hemingway, Van Gogh, or George Price came to such and it was too much. Take time with your life, because I think much of that is the difference, knowing yourself, the smaller parts of your world, and making some minir peace for a time.
