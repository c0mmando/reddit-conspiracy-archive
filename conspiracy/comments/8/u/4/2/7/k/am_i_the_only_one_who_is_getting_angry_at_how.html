        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is in regards to Trump&#39;s tweets about suspending due process rights for illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>“Trump is making the tyrannical claim that he has the right to serve as prosecutor, judge and jury with respect to all those who enter our country. That is a breathtaking assertion of unbounded power — power without any plausible limit.&quot; That a quote is from Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard.</p>

<p>The Washington Post, also stated that &quot;As a legal question, experts say Trump’s proposition is unsound. The Constitution grants due-process rights not only to U.S. citizens but to every ‘person&#39; in the United States. The Supreme Court has said this covers undocumented immigrants.&quot;</p>

<p>Did the media fall asleep or something? This is something that has been going on for decades now. Since the beginning of the War on Terrorism under Presidents Bush, Obama and now Trump, the U.S. has made it so that the U.S. government can indefinitely detain U.S. citizens without due process, torture them if necessary and even assassinate them without any courts or a trial.</p>

<p>And now the Washington Post is making the fucking audacity that now in 2018 under Trump that is somehow new or unconstitutional?! Get the fuck out of here you dishonest MSM hacks. This is just making my blood boiling, I can&#39;t even.</p>

<p>Fuck you Washington Post and fuck you James Clapper, and fuck all you hypocrites. Goddammit I can&#39;t stand these Bush era liars.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Picking a “side” in the first place is a mistake. If you’re referring to political parties when you say “side”, then it is pointless. It’s not Democrats vs. Republicans. That’s <em>exactly</em> what they want you to think the battle is. If we are constantly bickering amongst ourselves how will we ever achieve any real meaningful change?</p>

<p>The battle is between the haves and the have nots. The “illumined” (as they like to call themselves) vs. the rest of us. The part lines are a distraction. Until we somehow move beyond this, nothing happens.</p>

<p>This is another reason the elite, or “haves”, are trying to destroy the traditional family and Christianity. The ten commandments that were etched in the Old Testament are moral rules that most humans can agree upon, and have for centuries. Do not lie, do not kill, and so on. I believe these rules create the foundation for the inalienable rights of all human beings. Our invisible captors want to strip us of these rights. </p>

<p>Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target&#39;s belief.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump makes his policy through shitty misspelled tweets.  That allows his supports to paint it in the best light and his detractors to paint it in the worst.  If he fucking developed any of his thoughts past two sentences maybe we could actually know what he means with the words he says, but I guess that&#39;s too high a bar for a president.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This could mean expedited removal, which has been a policy for over 20 years.  But then why say &quot;Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.&quot; if he is just promoting the polices of that system?</p>

<p>If he does mean expedited removal, that does constitute due process because due process doesn&#39;t mean &quot;see a judge&quot;.  The asylum interview counts.  But we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what he means.  Maybe he&#39;s trying to pretend it&#39;s a new policy so he can co-opt it instead of say it&#39;s a Clinton thing.  Cuz Dems wants open borders or something.  Maybe he wants super expedited<sup>TM</sup> removal, where asylum seekers don&#39;t get an interview, just shot in a cannon over his 100-story wall.  That is probably unconstitutional, because that&#39;s not a process.</p>

<p>He has no consistency word to word, but oh my god, the Post has the <em>audacity</em> to try to make sense of his ramblings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a valid point. However, I’d see it more as Trump coming in and threatening to wield absolutely the special powers the past few presidents amassed after 9/11 which they have been able to get away with using selectively. To the media’s credit, I recall a number of op-eds from during the election trying to warn about someone like Trump gaining the sort of dangerous power the presidency and the intelligence community gained in the post 9/11 era. But the president was never originally supposed to have that sort of power, for the same reason we have checks and balances, separation of powers, etc. It should have never come down to “you shouldn’t vote for him because he could be tyrannical.” The President isn’t supposed to have that sort of power, regardless. Not only is it dangerous regardless of who is in power. It is a threat to our elections. You’re not supposed to need to worry “what might this guy do with his power to spy on me, unlawfully imprison me and execute me if we elect him?” </p>
