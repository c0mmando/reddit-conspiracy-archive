    <div class="md"><p>i heard a theory a while ago that the CDC was about to go under/get phased out at one point, and all of a sudden the HIV/AIDS epidemic appeared. then they got a massive burst of funding. also, i&#39;ve never personally witnessed this, but i have been told that there&#39;s a correlation between people taking AIDS/HIV medications, and <em>then</em> getting sicker and dying. this was too big for me to look into... I was just wondering if anyone else has heard of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same thing with autism. I’m not an anti-vaccine person, but one of the authors of the study that is cited as THE definitive research finding no link between the current MMR (a CDC program) shot and the occurrence of autism blew the whistle on the CDC. He came out a few years ago claiming that the data were manipulated intentionally by the CDC scientists who authored the study, himself included. They know that 12-36 months is the most dangerous time to give kids the shot, and STILL recommend it at 12 months or so. Pretty crazy shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither of them were eradicated by vaccines.  Smallpox went away on its own as we learned about sanitation, dressing wounds, and that drinking our own shitwater was bad.  It only lingered on as long as it did, because of the vaccines, ironically.</p>

<p>Polio was never eradicated.  It was overdiagnosed in the first place, then renamed conveniently after the vaccine came out.  It was renamed to guillain-barre, transverse myelitis, and meningitis.  The diagnosis protocols were also changed after the vaccine was introduced, to make diagnosing cases of polio almost impossible.</p>

<p>The history and timeline of the polio &quot;epidemic&quot;, its vaccine, and &quot;eradication&quot; reveal that the vaccine industry is completely and utterly fraudulent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re talking about the fact that these government agencies are not for the people. They are private corporately owned evil enterprises pushing poison off as vaccines, forcing these vaccines on people drawing the money that they charge you for these procedures from your tax money. This is why we have the most expensive Health Care industry in the freaking world. Corruption like this, exactly like this, is always the answer. I guarantee the CDC is owned and controlled by those in the luciferian elite circles more than likely Satanist as well. So they use these &quot;vaccines&quot;to poison the people, charging it to tax dollars, they end up coming in sick to the hospital because you&#39;ve given them 50 vaccines by the time they&#39;re 2 years old and our bodies and minds breaks down because of that, on top of all the chemicals they spray in the sky, in the water, in the food. Which brings the masses into the hospital where everything is charged to your tax dollars. So instead of building a beautiful country where everyone works together United to create an amazing Utopia. We allow Satanist to poison us and steal our money two poisonous in her to some more.  The only safety and Truth in this life is found in Jesus Christ, who is God manifest in the flesh, and is now the Spirit working and advocating on His People&#39;s behalf. God bless you for reading. </p>

<p>Pslams 2: 1Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>

<p>2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying,</p>

<p>3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>

<p>4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lordshall have them in derision.</p>

<p>5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>

<p>6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>

<p>7 I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>

<p>8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t apply to everyone who disagrees with me on a topic, but it does apply to the increasingly large crowd of people which seem to include you and the guy above you whom instead of answering a question are opening the debate immediately jump to attacking the person for their ideas I have found that everyone or at least most people who operate in this manner are working with the same Spirit weather knowingly or unknowingly. So no I don&#39;t use that specific quote often but it came up there. The interesting thing is I&#39;m reading Hebrews 5:5 completely unrelated to this conversation  yet I realized that one of the quotes related directly back to that Psalm quote I gave you. These are little signs that God gives me through the day.
 The CDC is covering up the poisoning of Americans for profit. Men and women who I love to protect, and the only response I get from the people is that I&#39;m crazy... 
That reply would not work against the people who believe in Christ obviously that&#39;s the easier answer. It also would not be used by me on anyone who is honestly searching for the truth, for there is a great likelihood that they are being called by God out of this Darkness. I thank you for this question because it seems honest and straightforward and refrained from calling me any names.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. That makes all the difference in the world. I&#39;m trying to take on the challenge in the mission that the Bible has given me 100%. It is difficult and challenging but oh so rewarding. Every day God gives me little signs a little coincidences AR points me to one thing that leads to another. And sometimes he allows miracles to happen in front of me. God is good and knowing him is more than enough reward but he keeps giving me more. I am working on my sanctification and I&#39;ve noticed that helping other people overcome or realize their shortcomings helps me on my own Journey in many ways. God bless you and guide you. Thank you 😊</p>

Things that you won&#39;t even be able to possibly understand the beginning of. why don&#39;t you start at the Bible and start out by praying and asking God to open your eyes seek and you shall find, ask and it shall be given you, knock and will be opened unto you. if you knew and understood the great corruption in the evilness within the entirety of our government and be easy to see the lies for what they are. But for some reason you defend these multibillion-dollar National companies for what reason? How would you answer me who you are and why you defend their government and its private corporate entities. I don&#39;t have time for grammar, I have time to get the point across.

Who were you to think you know anything of anything. You sound like a neanderthal. do you exalt yourself above God, the one who created everything that you see. Are you comfortable in mocking him? You and your friends spirit line up exactly with what the Bible says in that men will be Vain and full of themselves and will seek to crush Godly men and hide their knowledge so they can continue on in their evil and perverse ways. The fact that you want to Outlaw my knowledge and my ways and force me into a mental institution or to take your worthless drugs proves the point to me. And it will help prove these points and many others to many other people who see through your worthless lies. You can try to confuse someone else child but you will not confound me. The Lord Jesus Christ rebuke the spirits who are working through you and remove their power and rewards from your life. May God set many stumbling blocks before all who mock Him and His people, including you, so that you can slow down and see your folly before your destruction. Lord help us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s probably stupid to bother asking because you don&#39;t seem in the mood to answer things directly, but I have a few questions in regards to your first post that first require some setup. I assume that your parents did not have the information that you have access to with the internet. If that were the case I assume that you are a person who has had the &quot;50 vaccines by the time they&#39;re 2 years old and our bodies and minds breaks down because of that&quot;. Given that,</p>

<p>1) How could we possibly believe that what you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t from a broken mind? If we assume that statement to be true, you have a broken mind and that is likely the cause of this rant. If we assume that statement to be false, then you are a crazy person who is off the deep end. Either one of those assumptions leads to the logical conclusion that we should not believe anything you say.</p>

<p>2) If we have had this done to us by parents who were not enlightened as you are, how is god to punish us? If my mind is broken by satanists and I do not have the capacity to understand god or his grace because of this, how am I punished by this deity that supposedly has grace? You imply that these vaccinations break us to the point where we are mindless masses that cannot do anything but blindly follow these satanists. If we literally cannot follow god&#39;s way, and it was our parents and the satanists that did this, don&#39;t they get punished while we, at worst, are stuck in a purgatory? I&#39;m just not following the story here on you telling people they need to face god&#39;s judgment and wrath while at the same time making an implication that they cannot know any better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are two very good questions, and I thank you for asking them. The best way that I know how to answer is through what I have gathered from the word of God which is the Bible. It states that all men will be tried by the adversary, who is the devil, who roams about as a lion seeking whom he may devour. it is the devil&#39;s job to break your mind, to feed you poisons, to make you think that you cannot overcome. The Divide comes once the choice comes, once the word of God comes and touches inside your soul and lights off an infinitude of questions. God does not allow you to be hurt in your ignorance, he is the possessor of your soul and there is no pain on Earth that heaven cannot heal. But once you are an adult, and know that there is a Creator and purposely decide not to seek after him he allows your mind to be confounded. There is scripture, Apocrypha, which states that Apostle Paul was forced to drink poison in front of a multitude of people, and nothing happened to him because of his faith in God Jesus Christ. however the king forced one of his servants to drink just a drop of this poison and he fell down writhing in pain and died from it. The Creator is the only one who can allow pain to come to you, for damage to happen to you. It is the work of the devil to destroy the things of God, but he has no power unless we give way to the devil. For instance You can only get an STD from sex outside bounds of God. 
When I realized but God was real I asked him to protect me and to give me more knowledge and he continuously answers those prayers, and he and mighty and miraculous ways answers the multitude of prayers that I&#39;ve made since that day back in 2015. I did not mean to get into the more Rough Side of Things, I was only meaning to be rough or mean about the government&#39;s involvement in stealing our tax monies to feed us poisons which send us to the hospital&#39;s which allow them to steal even more tax money for us. When you research all these systems the corruption and theft of money is so unreal that it alone will lead you to knowledge of the devil, that&#39;s without researching all the satanic Cults in the history of child sacrifice since the beginning of written human history and so on and so forth. I am not a crazy man, the truth is Stranger Than Fiction and God has made it so, so that it takes faith, a strong faith in God to come to understand the world and the plans in the Prophecies of the Ving who created the infinitude of this universe. Do I sound like one who is insane, or without a brain? Do I sound like someone who you should allow your government to force psychological drugs onto and put into a mental institution to change my thoughts so that he might try to break my spirit and take God from me? This is what these trolls continuously push, that my ideas are dangerous, that I should be force-fed pills to change my mind and shoved in a mental institution where no one can Hear My Cries or screams as they try to rape the mind of the innocent.... Is that not strange enough? That they are all of one mind when you really get down into it. The hive mind... I&#39;ve studied mysteries for quite a while and in depth. Please ask away. God bless you and guide you and show you signs of His existence and purpose for you. For the time is shortly coming where people like me will be removed forcibly from the people who do not know God, and that is when the end will surely come fast. As it written. Even so, come Lord Jesus. </p>

 Keep studying into me. I am an intelligence agent. For the highest source in existence. Far from Russia and the U.S. 
I am given Divine knowledge to reach out to the humble, innocent, and questioning souls who do not exhault themselves above God.

    <div class="md"><p>So God is a conspiracy huh? And it&#39;s geniuses like you who would try to have the world believe that all of this beautiful and perfect order of the universe came from a ball of nothing. A void-void. No blackness, no vacuum, simply non existence.  Your so ignorant that you refuse to see the story play out in front of your eyes. 
the odds for any single one of the steps that It would take to make a universe and all the perfect order and the perfect temperatures and the perfect creation of molecules that self-replicate. one of those single steps in the infinitude of steps that it took to get where we are, the odds for one of those steps happening without a Creator, are greater than you trying to find one atom on the first time hidden at random in the boundless space of this universe on the first shot. Then do it again then again then again. IMPOSSIBLE, BLASPHEMY.  </p>

<p>Pslams 19:1The heavens declare the glory of God;
    the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
2 Day after day they pour forth speech;
    night after night they reveal knowledge.
3 They have no speech, they use no words;
    no sound is heard from them.
4 Yet their voice[b] goes out into all the earth,
    their words to the ends of the world.</p>

<p>Romans 1:19For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.21For although they knew God, they neither glorified Him as God nor gave thanks to Him, but they became futile in their thinking and darkened in their foolish hearts. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools,23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images of mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</p>

<p>24Therefore God gave them up in the desires of their hearts to impurity for the dishonoring of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator, who is forever worthy of praise! Amen.</p>

<p>26For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27Likewise, the men abandoned natural relations with women and burned with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.</p>

<p>28Furthermore, since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, He gave them up to a depraved mind, to do what should not be done. 29They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and hatred. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips, 30slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant, and boastful. They invent new forms of evil; they disobey their parents. 31They are senseless, faithless, heartless, merciless.</p>

<p>32Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things are worthy of death, they not only continue to do these things, but also approve of those who practice them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read more books besides the story book you like to cite. Atheists don&#39;t argue that the universe came from nothing. It&#39;s simply that the evidence suggests it began with an explosion and we don&#39;t know what was before that yet (or maybe it&#39;s impossible to ever know).</p>

<p>Life is but a fraction the age of our planet, and our planet likely relatively young compared to the age of the universe. These infinitesimally small odds you speak of become inevitabilities on such time scales. And given the size of the universe as we know it and the odds likewise, it&#39;s unlikely we&#39;re the only ones who made it this far. There&#39;s little reason to believe there&#39;s anything special about humans or life on our planet in general.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on my phone so it&#39;s a bit tiresome to address all the ways your arguments are flawed. If you aren&#39;t blind to reason and haven&#39;t already blocked me I&#39;d be happy to continue this discussion when I&#39;m at a computer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, once again, all that your type has is name calling. And once again your type points and directs society to consider Christians as dangerous, obsessive, and to lock them in med wards and force psych meds on them... Your behavior and attitudes are abhorrent and filthy. Your righteousness is inverted. I do not take acid. 
I do however commune and talk with God. I pray to Him and He answers me in His Word, The Holy Bible. He also answers me by signs and coincidences beyond mere chance every single day. He also answers me through answered prayer. You are missing out on fellowshipping with the God who created everything... What do you get in return? The temporary ability to mock God, and act higher than Him? When your spirit gets called before that Almighty Being, what will you say? You are being ignorance, you have chosen to disobey God and preach that He is non existent. How utterly insane. 
Your hatred of God and His people will get you no where in the end Mr Mayer.... Seek His face today while He may be found. Tomorrow is not guaranteed.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one thing that I found from VAERS: from 2006 to 2012, the number of doses of the MMR administered was 137,420,710, with 26 cases compensated for vaccine injury. That makes the percent of vaccinated people injured approximately 0.00012%. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vaccines have always been a business. They&#39;ve just never been a very good business.</p>

<p>&quot;We were losing money,&quot; said Claude Vezeau, former chief executive officer at Montreal-based IAF BioChem International, Canada&#39;s largest maker of vaccines in the 1990s. &quot;All vaccines were losing money.&quot;</p>

<p>But all of that began to change with the first hint of a pandemic on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>The outbreak of H5N1 in Hong Kong in 1997 was relatively small - just 18 people who handled birds - but six of them died. Such a high death rate drew immediate attention from medical experts around the world. Fears of a much bigger death toll began to percolate at government levels.</p>

<p>Well, for one thing, he rakes in a lot of money off book sales. </p>

<p>List of books:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Horsemen of the Apocalypse: The Men Who Are Destroying Life on Earth And What it Means for Our Children.</p></li>
<li><p>Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent Over a Decade in Prison For a Murder He Didn&#39;t Commit.</p></li>

<li><p>How George W. Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Highjacking Our Democracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Two Activists Fight to Reclaim Our Environment as a Basic Human Right.</p></li>
<li><p>The Billings Collection</p></li>
</ul>

<p>List of articles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>CDC Knew its Vaccine Program Was Exposing Children to Dangerous Mercury Levels Since 1999</p></li>
<li><p>The Next President&#39;s First Task (A Manifesto)</p></li>
<li><p>Was the 2004 Election Stolen?</p></li>
<li><p>Deadly Immunity</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And a bunch more that share titles with his books.</p>

<p>Notice a theme? He makes a living off stirring up the fringe and off luring folks with his famous name.

    <div class="md"><p>So story time:  Someone I know apparently went on a date with a girl who created flu vaccines for the CDC.  She was kind of crazy and that&#39;s why he stopped seeing her, but apparently she disclosed to him the following:</p>

<p>She&#39;s young and has only been there a handful of years, but already in one of their vaccines someone had found some fairly obvious mutagens in the vaccine.</p>

<p>I guess how it works in those scenarios is that all the chemists/scientists/whateveryouwannacallem all will one by one review and confirm the finding, and she worked with something like 10 other people who all reviewed and all said that it was fairly obvious and yes it was present.</p>

<p>So they report this to their higher up, that there had been mutagens in the vaccine, and that person said OK.  Afterwards some people from even higher up came to that person and told them to approve it for release anyway and they basically were forced to release it for public use.</p>

<p>Apparently this sparked some dialogue among them and a few came forward and said this is not the first time.  One of those that came forward, seeing this happen again, started to dig and pry to see how/why/how often this goes on and apparently that person was found dead months later.  </p>

<p>She told him never to get the flu vaccine, but that other vaccines are safe and recommended.  Crazy stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CDC has 36 or 37 patents related to vaccines (can&#39;t remember the exact number but it was one of htose). It only licenses one patent related to vaccines through the NIH, for a molecule used in HPV vaccines. NDAs prevent the public from knowing what that the exact compensation is, but it&#39;s anywhere between $5.8 million and $118 million annually as per publicly available information on the subject. Not quite $4.6 billion, unless we&#39;re talking about over the span of 38.98-793.10 years.</p>

<p>The best anti-vaccine argument I&#39;ve heard about the CDC is that it is corrupt and essentially acts as a PR agency for companies that make vaccines. In particular for the flu vaccine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you &quot;believe science&quot; you are not being very scientific. Every single study ever conducted can only be discerned for its merit by someone trained and educated in science, and if you aren&#39;t, and you haven&#39;t, then you have zero reason to &quot;believe&quot; any study. What&#39;s more, if the study has not been repeated, it is worth exactly nothing unless a self evidently functional, recreatable technology has been made based on the conclusions of that study. This is why charlatan inventors of perpetual motion devices are not taken seriously, nor is their science. </p>

<p>Even if all that scientific work has been done to verify the authenticity of a scientific experiment, unless you recreated technology based on the conclusion made, you still have to use critical anlysis to arrive at a conclusion tegarding <em>how much</em> trust you ought to place in said science. A judgement call has to be made. Unless you repeat an experiment with your own two hands, or observe an experiment being repeated with your own two eyes, there is a judgement call that has to be made by you, the individual. That is what the philosophy of science makes logicslly clear. It is in no way scientific to &quot;believe science&quot; as you put it. In philosophy we call this &quot;scientism&quot; and it is spreading amongst the uneducated masses.</p>

All I&#39;m saying is I DON&#39;T know that. You&#39;re trying to act like an expert on vaccines, it&#39;s hilarious. You&#39;re the one trying to act high and mighty, claiming you know ALL the facts. I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t know all the facts. THAT&#39;S ALL. So calm your fucking tits. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Especially when there have been multiple Papers written which explicitly Target and disprove the statements made in the documentary in question?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you should calmly, rationally link them. Or you could just rant about how ANGRY YOU ARE!! Either way. Up to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot; but you are literally contributing to a problem that is going to result in people dying&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL HOW?!?!?! What the actual fuck is WRONG WITH YOU?! <strong>I&#39;M NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU DUMB FUCK</strong> My GOD. How many times do I have to say it?! All I&#39;m saying is that I personally don&#39;t know if vaccines are 100% BECAUSE I&#39;M NOT A DOCTOR AND I DON&#39;T KNOW. God you&#39;re intolerable. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me ask you one question. Even if you&#39;re right and vaccines cause autism, do you really think that is preferable to fucking polio?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NO YOU STUPID FUCK. I&#39;M NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER. I&#39;M JUST SAYING THE DOCUMENTARY MAKES A LOT OF INTERESTING POINTS. IT&#39;S AN INTERESTING DOCUMENTARY AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT</strong></p>

<p>OH MY FUCKING GOD. READ MY COMMENTS PROPERLY. You&#39;re assuming sooooo much bullshit about me and it&#39;s not making you look like a smart or rational person. </p>

<p>You have a lot of confidence for a very ignorant person - and I use the word with dual inference. There have been numerous studies of late exposing the corruption of scientific research. The majority of scientific papers are sponsored and those sponsors fully expect the research to come to conclusions favourable to the donor. I believe in science. REAL science. Trouble is, there&#39;s not much around anymore. This corporatocracy we now are in has corrupted even that. Money rules. So, please stop attacking others for their &#39;anti-science&#39; bent.

There is not a disenfranchised segment of the population that has been historically oppressed for their mental disabilities and treated like second class citizens because of their mental disabilities with the exception of the constraints their disabilities place on them from a strictly medical perspective.

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t need a flu vaccine. Old people and children do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The CDC has lists of who should receive the flu vaccines as a priority during a shortage. Those are the people that should get flu vaccines. Everyone else will be fine because sanitstion, immune systems, and the vulnerable are vaccinated. The fact is that modern medicine combined with healthy immune systems can defeat the flu. The antibody response to any disease is substantially greater than what you get with a vaccine. The literature is widely available. It&#39;s a firmly established paradigm in the study of immunology. There is one particular practice that worked with whooping cough and may revolutionize the science, but its application is not yet widespread, and has not been proven as an effective practice for other diseases. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4096845/#!po=5.03876">See here</a>. Notice the scientific literature even shows that the spread of whooping cough is exacerbated by the failure of the vaccination regimen devised just one generation ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being not sure means you actually believe that vaccines might be really bad. How can you not be sure when the mechanisms for a vaccine is so obvious?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because I have read the literature on the subject and I&#39;m left with a shadow of a doubt about whether it is safe, and for something that human beings are healthy absolutely don&#39;t need like the seasonal flu vaccine, I&#39;m good man. I would rather let my body build long lasting immunity.</p>

<p>This 2003 United Press International article gives some details on the conflicts of interest within CDC: <a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-Investigates-The-vaccine-conflict/44221058841736/">https://www.upi.com/UPI-Investigates-The-vaccine-conflict/44221058841736/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty fair to both sides of the debate going on at that time. It&#39;s long, but informative, and could provide a few leads for others here. I would like somebody to give more details about the royalties. We know individuals within CDC, at least when this article was written, make money from the vaccine industry through a variety of methods. As for the royalties paid to CDC, does that mean the CDC itself gets the money and uses it, or can individuals within CDC receive those royalties, or both?</p>

<p>Something else I noticed that is barely related to this topic is that some Universities also license out vaccines and receive royalties from them. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2008/09/12/google-general-electric-ent-tech-cx_mf_0912universitypatent_slide/#54a2fa4333a1">https://www.forbes.com/2008/09/12/google-general-electric-ent-tech-cx_mf_0912universitypatent_slide/#54a2fa4333a1</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>From one response I found online:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the CDC vaccine patents are a large portfolio of intellectual property on various aspects of vaccines, because the CDC does a boatload of research on infectious disease, which leads to vaccines. Eventually, they invent something, maybe finding the exact antigen on a virus that induces an immune response, and patent attorneys at the CDC file a patent on that “invention.” It protects the CDC from corporations or individuals who would rely upon CDC inventions, then patent it for themselves. So, the CDC (or any federal science agency, like the NIH, US Geological Survey, or whomever) has a portfolio of patents it can license to anyone who wants to pay for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The OTT reported in 2014 that they had earned royalties of about $138 million across all of the licensed technology from NIH. Remember, CDC technology is only a tiny part of the overall NIH licensing activities. Of that $138 million, 84%, or $116 million, resulted from OTT’s top 20 technologies.</p>

<p>But here’s where it gets interesting, only one of those top 20 technologies was CDC related – immunoreactive peptides for use in an HPV vaccine. Not the vaccine mind you, but just the parts of the proteins that would induce an immune response. Because of nondisclosure agreements, it is difficult to tease out the data of how much of that $116 million was associated with the CDC’s technology. But if we just make all top 20 products equal in value (and the OTT report made it clear one product got the bulk of that money, so this is a really high estimate), the CDC got $5.8 million for the HPV technology.</p>

<p>According to the rules of Federal Government, almost all of the royalties are plowed back into basic scientific research. And if you’re thinking, which I know the anti-vaccine types will be, that the CDC will prostitute itself for $5.8 million, well that kind of ignores a basic bit of information.</p>

<p>The CDC budget is over $7 billion, so this royalty makes up less than the 0.1% of the total CDC budget. Since people usually attribute ethics to others that they do to themselves, maybe Ginger Taylor will sell her intellectual ethics for $5.8 million, but what makes anyone think that the dedicated public servants at the CDC would? Moreover, there is little financial gain for an individual, just for basic scientific research to save human lives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), whose “debates” are public record, never sit around trying to maximize the value of the patents, because the value isn’t that high (which troubles me about the OTT’s efforts, but that’s another story for another time). The ACIP recommended Gardasil, not because the CDC would get 0.1% more money to pay for those micropipette tips or broken beakers or whatever stuff they use, but because Gardasil prevents HPV-related cancers and is extremely safe.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t gotten a flu vaccine in like 15 years, and my health is just fine.</p>
