<p>So do &quot;woke progressives&quot; people like James Clapper, &quot;woke&quot; Bill Kristol and David Frum and other people on CNN or MSNBC really care about children being tortured or killed?  </p>

<p>Did these people gave a shit when Iraqi children were being tortured, and seperated from their families and detained while their mothers wept in the middle of the night during a troop raid? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FV-ZDfWCMs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FV-ZDfWCMs</a>
Did they care when hundreds of thousands of Iraqis were starved to death in the 1990s and then the Washington Post has the audacity to say that it never happened like Walter Duranty denying the famine in Ukraine the 1930s.</p>

<p>Do liberals and never Trumpers look at the photo of that screaming child in Iraq and protested for her justice and for her family? Did never Trumpers ever &quot;whined&quot; about the gang rape of Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi in 2006 raped and murdered by U.S. troops? </p>

<p>Do liberals really care about foreigners and foreign children getting killed or tortured? Or is it now outrageous to be against it under Trump? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think all Trump supporters will give a damn about Iraqis but will liberals give a damn about tortured Iraqi children? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again.  Let&#39;s cut through the bullshit of your questions and get to the point.</p>

<p>Your line of questions are frankly, asinine.  You can strawman all you want.  Not only does it not accomplish anything for you, but it also helps others see exactly what your agenda is when trying to refute logical conclusions with ridiculous rhetorical questions.</p>

<p>Good try tho, bub.</p>

<p>But, to play along with your game...</p>

<p>How do you know everyone that has died has deserved it?  What makes you believe they deserved it?  How do you know?  Did you know them all their entire lives?  How are you making the assessment they deserved death?  Are you replying on the words of others to make your assessment?  What if they are wrong?  What if they are lying? Then, you would be wrong and misinformed.  If you were wrong, how would you know?</p>

<p>With your game of 20 questions, you&#39;ve never established your point-of-view but, because you&#39;re asking so many strawman questions, I can safely assume you&#39;re either of the opinion everyone in the history of ever that has died, in some way are not innocent and deserved it.  Until you establish your position, that assumption stays.  </p>

<p>Well, that... Or you&#39;re just trolololing.</p>

<p>Probably the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends.</p>

<p>Do you know which single human has has the greatest positive impact on the environment? Genghis Khan.  Why? Because he slaughtered millions of people.   Had he not slaughtered millions of people there would be 1-2 billion more people on the planet right now consuming resources on a planet with finite resources.</p>

<p>Perhaps a bunch of those people, had they not died, would have created a empire that would have made it impossible for western cultures and western empires to form, grow and dominate.  Perhaps that would have meant that you would not be here, that I would not be here.</p>

<p>Casualties of war happen.  Whether or not that is good or bad remains to be seen and depends.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the parable of the chinese farmer is a good analogy of this</p>

<p>A Chinese farmer gets a horse, which soon runs away. A neighbor says, &quot;That&#39;s bad news.&quot; The farmer replies, &quot;Good news, bad news, who can say?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The horse comes back and brings another horse with him. Good news, you might say.</p>

<p>The farmer gives the second horse to his son, who rides it, then is thrown and badly breaks his leg.</p>

<p>&quot;So sorry for your bad news,&quot; says the concerned neighbor. &quot;Good news, bad news, who can say?&quot; the farmer replies.</p>

<p>In a week or so, the emperor&#39;s men come and take every able-bodied young man to fight in a war. The farmer&#39;s son is spared.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a little better...  Maybe we aren&#39;t immediately done here after all.</p>

<p>Responding to your point : I can definitely have an opinion.  And that&#39;s the point. </p>

<p>The post title is &quot;Do Americans really care about foreigners getting tortured or killed?&quot;</p>

<p>I was born and have lived in America my entire life.  The question is geared towards an American opinion.  I provided mine.  I don&#39;t need hands-on, personal life experience with every single person that has died in the history of ever to believe that innocent people have died along the way.  The multitude of documented data (though all estimated) points to hundreds of thousands of innocent/civilian lives lost in the Middle East alone in the last 15-20 years.  Let&#39;s not forget about the Holocaust.  That number has been anywhere from 200,000 to 6,000,000.   </p>

<p>So let&#39;s say the data is off by, I&#39;ll say 99.999% which, lol no fucking way.  But for the sake of argument, it&#39;s off by that much.  There&#39;s still innocent/civilian casualties and that&#39;s far too many as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>But it is all relative.  And it is indeed a moral stance.  I&#39;m okay with that.  You provided a Chinese parable that&#39;s contextually relevant so, I&#39;m going to shoot-from-the-hip and create my own little story.</p>

<p>Jim came from a troubled background.  Between his alcoholic, physically abusive father and drug-addict, promiscuous mother, he really never had a good start to life.  His troubled life at home bled into his schooling and social interactions.  He became reclusive.  His mind and heart slowly filled with anger and rage.  He started bullying other kids at school, stealing candy from the store, and eventually decided he didn&#39;t need schooling and stopped going altogether.  His parents were none-the-wiser because frankly, they didn&#39;t want Jim and secretly hoped he would disappear.  One day, they got their wish.</p>

<p>Jim ran away from home as a young teenager and lived a life focused around hustling.  He lied.  He cheated.  He stole when he could.  No remorse.  No feeling.  No care.  As far as he was concerned, he was doing what he had to do to survive on his own.</p>

<p>He lived a difficult life and as the years passed, it became more and more of a struggle.  Living on the streets, wondering how he would get his next meal or where he would be able to sleep next were his only concerns.  One night, he made the decision that he was going to change his ways tomorrow, but tonight, he is going to do what he had to do in order to make it through the night.  So, he stole a woman&#39;s purse and used what he found to feed himself, clothe himself, and a place to get cleaned up and sleep for the night.</p>

<p>Fast forward a year later.</p>

<p>He&#39;s managed to secure a steady job, has his own place to live, a cat, and a budding relationship with Jan from the ice cream shop across the street from his place of business.  Things have turned around for him and life is going well.  He decided that things are so great with Jan (you know, because she helped him become the man he is today) that he was going to ask her to move in with him so they could take their relationship to the next level.</p>

<p>On his way across the street, Jim is struck in the head by a stray bullet, killing him instantly.</p>

<p>Was Jim an innocent victim or did he deserve to die because of his past transgressions?</p>

<p>How do you define innocent?  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t ask a question and clearly the people in power have been waging wars and bombing countries for decades with very few &quot;nays&quot;.  Anyone who votes to comb another country on false pretenses clearly doesn&#39;t care about foriegn children or their families.

    <div class="md"><p>I live in the US.  Saying we have been lied to is victim mentality, instead, we have to admit that WE BOUGT THE LIE and take some fucking responsibility.  The common man can change things at the local level, you get in office or vote people in at the local level and actually get involved in your neighborhood and community and if enough people start doing that the ripple effect will be much larger and reach national and beyond.  We still have free will and all the info we need at our fingertips and yet people prefer mindless entertainment.  Thats why it will always be a small group of minority controlling the idiot masses, the question is, will it be “our side” or theirs?</p>
