       Over the past 6 months my girl and I have noticed during our commute, the various talk radio shows we skip through all do the same thing.  During their interludes it tells Alexa to play their radio station.  We suspect they are hoping people leave the radio on at home for their pets, and are trying to trick Alexa into playing their station, creating more traffic.  The other aspect I've pondered is if they're trying to feed it advertising as well.  Anyone else notice this?

       Seriously, Alexa's are tremendously dumb devices. They only "hear" a handful of syllables that activate them from sleep mode. Then it actively connects to the internet to cloud compute what you are saying. They are so seriously dumb that the device doesn't even know if it is connected to the internet or not until it wakes up and tries to connect. If the Alexa is surveillance device it is a shittily designed one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason they often act spooky or come on at weird times is because they are only listening for those handfuls of activation syllables. And when it half hears you make an off hand comment it's voice recognition makes a best guess (usually a bad guess) at giving a relevant response. If Alexas actually had the natural language processing abilities peoe think they have they'd never act weird. They cost 40 bucks for a reason.

       For radio, this would have no impact on radio stations to have Alexa listening to them without them being home. Radio stations charge advertisement dollars based on their listenership. Their listenership is based solely on a Nielsen survey of a small sample of the listening area, over a very limited time.  Having extra radios playing your station does absolutely nothing.

       As an added benefit, yes. But they can’t quantize the actual number of listeners that those mediums pull in.  So ask yourself, do you really think salespeople in their pitches to clients say, “well, we have a way of turning Alexa’s to our stations therefore we are going to charge you more money”?  Tv stations, on the other hand, would benefit from this if there was a way of making Alexa turn the tv on and to a specific station.

       I have a hard time believe they can't quantify the amount of listeners they have streaming their show.  Also, I think it's about bolstering their numbers so they can say they have a broader reach in different markets.

       Why do you say they can't tell how many people are listening online? Of course they can.

       They can, but it makes no difference in advertising revenue. When “Flo’s Diner” wants to run radio ads, they aren’t worried about the person in Latvia that’s listening to the station. That person will never spend money at Flo’s and due to that fact, radio salespeople cannot use that as a reason to get a contract or more money out of a contract.

       I used to run radio stations and did so at the turn of the technology age. The biggest reason we used internet radio was so some of our clients were able to listen to us because their metal buildings wouldn’t allow clear, concise waves at all times. These weren’t small time radio stations.

       That makes some sense to me, I appreciate the answer. So why would a radio station care if the they're online if it means no profit and presumably some cost?

       Like we had discussed before—added value. There’s nothing about it that you can monetize.  Our cost to be online was about $30. We had all the equipment needed except for something the engineer needed to actually run the line to our server. Just being able to say you’re on I heart radio is some clout.

       Want a real good conspiracy about radio?  Look into voice tracking. I could be in a station in Virginia and cut voice tracks for a Colorado station and send them over the net. The Colorado station will play my tracks between songs and it sounds like I’m completely live from Colorado. It’s how radio stations cut their budget. That way you don’t have to deal with on air talent, just purchase a package. If the talent is good enough, the listeners would never know that they aren’t right down the block.

       Most likely this, imo they are just trying to "push the meme" of the product so it's more and more normal to "use" alexa for daily tasks thus subconsciously making people that were somewhat hesitant to buy it actually buy the product.

       If three radio was on, the only way the radio station could trigger Alexa is if it was on?? Right?  So if it's on Radio station No 1, why would that station need you to change station?

       Fm radio playing somewhere else triggers it. Or a tv advert. Or anything that isn’t the Alexa originally.

       I've seen this too, one of the presenters was self-congratulating themselves about the traffic they've been seeing thanks to Alexa and promptly goes on to saying "so play (station)" - "from whatever device you have"

       I work in radio and we do it simply for advertising to let folks know that they can stream the station(s) on their device. I have over 15 years on air in Seattle and work for one of the largest broadcasters in the USA.I'm an on air DJ .

       Sorry but the truth we are not hoping that you leave your radio on for your pet. We are not trying to trick Alexa or anything nefarious.

       Huh, because all the radio stations I listen to stream and are also on cable.  You honestly don't think they provide those numbers to advertisers as well?
