        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi everyone.  </p>

<p>I wanted to share something that occurred to me in meditation and research recently regarding the idea of getting ahead of one&#39;s self, or reaching for the stars while lacking an earthly foundation. I understand the content might be a little &#39;hippy-dippy&#39; for most, and get that - trust me. All I ask is that you suspend your judgement of that, as the message I wish to share goes beyond the initial &#39;method of discovery&#39; (ie: chakra meditations). If I&#39;m posting this in the wrong sub, I apologize. This isn&#39;t a post about meditation. It&#39;s a post about keeping one&#39;s sanity while on the path to discovery - something I think is very relevant to the content-seekers of this sub.  </p>

<p>So as I mentioned above, this idea came from some research regarding chakras that I was doing last night. My intent is to share this message, which I think applies to more than just &#39;chakra meditations&#39;, without pushing any sort of agenda. It is not my intent to encourage meditation or chakras or belief systems that are questionable at best.  </p>

<p>Regardless, starting from the content of the meditation, the general idea is this:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Many people seek to open their indigo-chakra, more commonly known as the &#39;third-eye chakra&#39;, in an attempt to access its alleged powerful and profound psychic benefits. Such alleged benefits start with refined insight, acute intuition, clearer and more lucid dreams, truth detection and sense of purpose. At the other, more &#39;awakened&#39; end of the spectrum are benefits such as auric-vision, true-foresight, ethereal-vision, telepathy, astral projection, mind reading, and mental-influence/control over others.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>While these benefits, real or not, sound awesome, too many people rush into this &#39;chakra&#39; without proper and adequate &#39;training&#39; or &#39;preparation&#39;. In simpler terms, they enter the game with the sole intent of opening their third-eye, solely for the allure of the potential psychic benefits, whilst lacking a fundamental foundation.  </p>

<p>This is not only wrong, but dangerous.   </p>

<p>There are 5 other main chakra points below the third-eye chakra, starting from around your genitals and leading up to your throat. Without proper &#39;grounding&#39;, (ie: exercising and communication with the first 5 chakras), the third-eye, while potentially opened, will be uncontrolled, unstable, unpredictable, and unhealthy to your mental state.  </p>

<p>For example, one may indeed experienced compelling foresight, strong intuition, or lucid dreams that seem to convey a message of some sort. But without established and well-trained channels (your other chakras), this information is unrefined. It could be wrong. It could be misinterpreted. It could be misleading. Vivid and intense lucid dreams, for example, could lead one to question their own existence in the waking state, if they themselves have no established grounding to this physical world. Intuition about a person or an up-coming event could be &#39;striking the wrong chords&#39;, simply because the channels through which this information is flowing is wild and untamed, like a river. Who knows where that boulder-like gut-feeling of anxiety is coming from, how far upstream did it fall into the moving river? In these instances, the third-eye may provide you with information, but without proper exercising and attention to the other chakras, there is no telling what that information really means, or where it comes from.  </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, the above is the realization I came to last night. By no means am I the first to have this idea, and I don&#39;t mean to claim that this is some original, new thought. Really, it&#39;s just the preface to what I want to say below. Applying this &#39;idea&#39; to the practical world, outside of questionable meditations, still has (in my opinion) some great, sage-like advice:  </p>

<p>I think we&#39;re all drawn to subreddits like this because we are searching for something. The &#39;truth&#39; seems to be the word tossed around the most, but I think that&#39;s just a working-title. For me, it&#39;s more of a sense of something &#39;lost&#39; - something once attained, but long lost and misplaced. A &#39;recovery&#39; of sorts.  </p>

<p>As we all search for whatever it is we&#39;re looking for, here - truth, a recovery, a connection, security in self - it is easy to lose ourselves.   </p>

<p>For example, being hellbent on uncovering what&#39;s really going on with UFO&#39;s is a passionate and fierce path, but it risks one losing onself in the process, distancing you from family, friends, and society.  </p>

<p>Metaphorically speaking, constantly looking to the clouds, the stars, and the moon, while earnest in curious in intent, leaves one more susceptible to walking into a telephone pole or being hit by a car, due to one&#39;s attention being elsewhere.  </p>

<p>More simply put: we are all hungry for truths and answers, but it is important to ground yourself. Do not take for granted the reality in which we live, the people we share this space with, the plants and the animals, the weather patterns, the &#39;laws&#39; of nature. Do not separate yourself from this world in your pursuit of the &#39;greater knowledge&#39;. Do not let it be a one-stop flight to mental or social isolation. Instead, build it as a bridge, or grow it as a tree - root yourself in your community, your friend circles, your families, your connection to this life, and go from there. Treading forward without an anchors, mental or spiritual, can be detrimental to your path and your purpose.  </p>

<p>Not only that, but fostering this sort of &#39;disconnect&#39; that seems to be common may stop your or hinder you from seeing evidence or clues that are actually right in front of you.  </p>

<p>TLDR: Keep your sanity on this ever-twisting path of knowledge by &#39;grounding&#39; yourself with your community, friends, family, or environment. Don&#39;t let yourself disconnect from the reality around you while searching for the reality you believe exists. They are not two separate places - they are one in the same - but treating them as separate realms will hinder your progress at best, and damage your life at worst. Tread carefully, fellow truth seekers.  </p>

<p>Take some time to stop and smell the flowers every now and then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps. Maybe if we&#39;re talking about the big &#39;ol <em>truth</em>, the one <em>truth</em> to <em>truth</em> them all, then I&#39;d agree - in this human, physical state, the true <em>truth</em> is beyond us, and by proxy, unattainable.  </p>

<p>But striving to the <em>truth</em> is just as noble, in my opinion. Its a refining of sorts. And while we may never be able to hone our mental blade to the atomic level of slicing in this life-time, we can still produce a sharp fucking blade that cuts through most of the bullshit, thick or thin. </p>

<p>I realize that&#39;s kind of a lame analogy, but I hope you get what I&#39;m saying.  </p>

<p>While you were living ignorantly, I was studying the blade..  </p>

<p>Nothing personal, kid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i appreciate you reaching out and telling us what you discovered through your meditation. Most people just discover things gor themselves and its always good to see others sharing knowledge of that insight they have gained whether it be experience, meditation, or education.   Unfortunately others can not understand what you have given unless they too have reached a discovery like that or can relate to your discovery in some way, like myself. You may want to redirect your statement in the form or a question in order to allow others to ask themselves the question and find their own discovery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;d seen your comment earlier this morning, and I&#39;ve been reflecting on it all day. I&#39;m not sure how I would word it as a question, though. Maybe something along the lines of....   </p>

<p>&quot;What are your priorities in life, and have you lost sight of them?&quot;<br/>
Or maybe more like, &quot;Do you ever feel disconnected because of how you see the world? Does it feel like you see it drastically different than your peers do?&quot;  </p>

<p>You know, I work as a teacher for young children, and I&#39;m constantly trying to refine my knowledge in ways that can not only be explained to my students more easily, but in ways that can let them ask their own questions and figure out their own path to the same destination, if you know what I mean.  </p>

<p>So, thanks a lot. And any insight on the matter would be much appreciated. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha. Honestly, that&#39;s a solid meditation. No spirituality or belief systems. Just a tried and tested way to calm and focus one&#39;s self.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>THIS. I am so lucky to have had a spiritual mentor come into my life at a time when I was seeking way too hard. She did not teach me anything, but instead took me places to find my place of grounding with no desire or thirst. It is so important. </p>
