        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a 45 year old male, enjoy my life, have 2 boys and tonight i wept a lot..
I watched the 9th episode of Band of Men, probably the best war programe ever made, and this episode is probably the best television episode ever made, despite the fact is is probably only a tenth of the reality of the situation, it is where they discover a concentration camp for the very first time, the horrors and evil.they encountered can never be properly shown in a TV show but God this is close, 10% close, but fuck.......
And today we have immigrant ships not allowed to dock in countries, enormous immigrant camps in Europe, immigrant chaos in America, there is NO LOVE FOR HUMANITY anywhere.
WE HAVENT LEARNT A FUCKING THING.
A generation gave their lives and souls for us, all for naught.
We only care about ourselves, where our next big TV is coming from, our next status car, the next extra bedroom house.
The throwaway generation
The corporate world domination
And for nothing more than money that, and let&#39;s be honest, in another 10 -20 years will mean fuck all anyway as the climate is going  to do for us all anyway. 
Tonight I weep, tomorrow I have had enough, tomorrow I am a voice, tomorrow I will cause change, 
One man says change and nothing, A hundred thousand men say change, then Change!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing is going to change in the world until there is inner revolution. World War 2 was a freakin&#39; horror show. Yes, people sacrificed and went through a lot of pain and suffering, and we call them &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot; If it wasn&#39;t for their efforts, the world would be probably like the way it is in The Man In The High Castle.</p>

<p>Band Of Brothers is very good, as is The Pacific (and even better is Eugene Sledge&#39;s book <em>With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa</em>, the best memoir of WW2 I&#39;ve ever read), but when one studies that war, everyone involved hit the lowest of lows in terms of value for human life. Civilians were massacred in the millions from carpet bombing, firestorms, nuclear bombs, and city fighting. The masters of war (Hitler, Hirohito, FDR, Stalin, Mussolini, and Churchill) brought a hell upon the earth. 6 men ultimately caused all that suffering. </p>

<p>I have a cousin who romanticizes WW2 and participates in reenactments of battles. All I can think &quot;what an idiot,&quot; that war was the worst thing that has ever happened in world history. It wasn&#39;t a fucking game. It was awful.</p>

<p>It will happen again, unless there is a fundamental change within the great majority the individuals on this planet. A move to an orientation in which the individual knows he is not separate from his experience. That the observed is the observed. That someone external to you is not separate. That he or she is you. This can only be seen when the individual throws off all the conditioning in the mind that distorts reality as it is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a tall order. But it starts with me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you think we should just let massive amounts of immigrants and refugees flood our country because you somehow connected Nazi Concentration Camps shown in Band of Brothers to todays current Humanity? </p>

<p>You completely overlook the challenge allowing immigrants just freely enter our country with no documentation, vaccinations and so forth. Ebola anyone?   We know nothing about them or their criminal backgrounds.<br/>
 You then blame corporations.  Which shows your stupidity.  The big corporations are the ones supporting immigration.  Flood the market with more employees - creates more competition and lowers wages.  Beats dealing with entitled millennials - right? Kills the middle class.  But hey let&#39;s just do it for the love of HUMANITY right?  Should we continue to send billions in aid to the countries people are leaving as well? How about paying the U.N. so they can fight human rights?   It blows me away how people can get caught up in the emotional tugs from a manipulation scheme without considering the economics or the bigger fucking picture.

    <div class="md"><p>Have fun getting shanked in your sleep. Anyone doing something as stupid has that has no experience living in the country these people are coming from. Sorry mate but I think you need to understand that economic migration is a thing and illegally crossing border is fuckin big time illegal. These people know what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s organized crime. Women and children  are used to let criminals go though with them. They sink their own boats killing women and children so that coast guards are forced to save them. You want to promote killing of children to let criminal children killers in? Really? </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the dream. They come and literally exprlect free house and money forever &quot;because we are so rich&quot; they say.</p>

<p>They expect to become rich coming here. When the situation is different from this, they think we hate them and remove things they deserve (because the rest of us got all of that for free!). They get highly upset and turn to criminality. After all they got nothing to lose and &quot;we fucked them&quot;.</p>

<p>I really thought your post was a joke because of how small minded it is. Do you understand why these countries are shit? It&#39;s cause the people are shit. Bring them here too quick and you&#39;ll get the same as them, difference is they can go back home and you just won&#39;thave a home anymore. Not with uncontrolled immigration of millions.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this. Would you let 3 billion people in your country? If your answer is no, tell me how you&#39;d pick the people that should go in, based on their need, education, social fit, background, etc or just law of the strongest and most willing to do illegal things to get in? Think about it real hard and stop fuckin using American war propaganda movie to get your perception on what is right or wrong ffs. Get the fuck off your sorry ass and go in those countries and see it for yourself. You&#39;re gonna be shocked. Try Niger or Sudan, just walk around there in the streets at random in a small village and see how long you last. Those are the people coming in.</p>

<p>Then last question for you. Why the fuck shouldn&#39;t we help them in their own countries? People coming in Europe and US are not fleeing war ffs. They are economic migrants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That programme isn&#39;t telling me anything other than the past.
The crisis IS caused by war, wars that are being fought for oil, AND NOTHING ELSE, these aren&#39;t country wars, these are wars for money and oil. 
They are causing the migrant crisis, if the west wasn&#39;t shopping for war and oil the world justaybe would be a better place </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, everything is our fault. Sorry trillions of dollars in aid isn&#39;t enough. I just have missed all of the oil wars going on in sub-Saharan Africa and Central America. It makes perfect sense why so many of the migrants are fighting age males. All of the women and children must be staying behind and fighting the wars. So brave. Don&#39;t judge their culture. I think it&#39;s a beautiful showing of their belief in true equality and progressiveness. Let the women and kids fight these wars that are taking place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because your heart sees a person who is sad. Your brain sees a person who has never been able to maintain his own home abandoning it the women and children inside of it to come live with you. Your brain is trying to tell you that your home is going to look like his in 20 years and your grandkids will pay for you being ruled by your emotions. In the end was it really virtuous to enable the behavior of people who can&#39;t create their own functioning society to come to your society and ruin it too? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All wars are banksters&#39; wars, so even those who sacrificed/risked their lives &quot;for freedom&quot;....it was somewhat in vain. Humans should not be fighting each other. Hippie or not, it&#39;s true. Warmongers should rot in prison or let them fight each other since they like war so much. Psychopaths. </p>

<p>Even mass immigration is artificial....corporations corrupt poorer countries, oppress the workers there and of course warmongers force people to flee their countries. The internet has become a pain in the ass for the freak elites because people can discuss such conspiracies more freely. But now they&#39;re trying to censor. Corporations, elite central banksters and secret societies rule our gov. Removing money from politics (I believe) would be a step in the right direction in getting the democratic republic back (or whatever form of democratic country you live in).</p>
