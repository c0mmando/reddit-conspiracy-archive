       Why did the United States secret service conduct an active shooter drill very shortly before the actual shooting in Parkland, Florida?

      <p>
       Is this something that the secret service normally does?

       Sounds extremely odd...

       Honest answer... Prepare, sometimes it might happen. It's another example of: dreams may come. It's not an issue with the dreamer, it's just a timing thing.

       We can help someone with depression/anxiety, we cant help MK Ultra victims who are brainwashed to kill. If you suggest that these events are more than just mentaly ill people you get attacked for "not believing" the person was ill. As if to say you didnt care about mental health issues. Where as its really about something more sinister people are avoiding.

       There was a flurry of terrorism response training prior to 9/11.  I had to sit through "response to terrorism, operations" in August of 2001.  A few years after the fact we found out that yes, they knew something was coming, but the classes were intentionally broad due to the fact they didn't know what.

       From "The U.S. Secret Service: History and Missions", prepared by the Congressional Research Service

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Summary
       </p>
       <p>
        The U.S. Secret Service has two missions—criminal investigations and protection. Criminal investigation activities have expanded since the inception of the Service from a small anticounterfeiting operation at the end of the Civil War, to now encompassing financial crimes, identity theft, counterfeiting, computer fraud, and computer-based attacks on the nation’s financial, banking, and telecommunications infrastructure, among other areas. Protection activities, which have expanded and evolved since the 1890s, include ensuring the safety and security of the President, Vice President, their families, and other identified individuals and locations.

       probably because theres no evidence, or even accusation that the SS held an active shooter drill shortly before the school shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course other than OP's statement, which we are supposed to just take as fact?
      </p>
      <p>
       The school itself ran an active shooter drill in early January, as they do every year. Maybe that is what he is thinking of, but unless OP can provide anything to suggest what his headline states is true, this is just Fake News.

       This one had me thinking if San Bernardino SWAT is a full time gig and if they are not on an op they are training, that is not true.  They train 36-40 hours per month, so 1/4 of the month SWAT is doing some type of training.  That kind of helps the odds of something just happening to go down while they are training.

       If you start digging into this you will notice that there are drills before nearly every major incident, and they just happen to be similar to the actual event. I'm not fucking around - I've kept tabs on this for many years and sure enough there's a fucking almost identical drill before almost any incident.

       Except this was not a Secret Service training thing.  It was an ex-SS guy who's kids attended that school and he just told the school they were vulnerable after he walked through the school...which I'm unfortunately pretty sure most schools are pretty vulnerable.

       To cause chaos and mayhem lol, idk how some people end up on this board. So your into conspiracies, but yet you're struggling to put together why the secret service would be somewhere that had foul play go on?

       do you even know who the secret service is, and what their intended purpose is?
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets get this straight for a second. OP didnt claim FBI, CIA local PD or anything. He said Secret Service. The same Secret Service with the MiB guys that follow the president everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were apparently at a high school running a drill? When have you ever heard of the secret service coordinating school activities?
      </p>
      <p>
       And on top of that, being in a conspiracy sub and all, you want us to just take some random persons word for it without providing a single shred of evidence or even suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it did happen, but something that shows it actually happened would certainly be a better discussion starter point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe OP meant the SS held an active shooter drill shortly before the Parkland shooting, but having nothing at all to do with Parkland and maybe not even in Florida.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is the case, his headline is sensationalized and misleading. If that is the case, this is not really surprising at all considering they probably run drills every single day...

        Wasn't an SS drill.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It was just some retired SS guy whose kids had graduated from that school and he did a personal assessment of the school and told them what he'd found.  No drill took place.  This posts purpose is only to spew misinformation out there, hoping people don't follow up on it, so that the conspiracy of false flag attacks on schools can be promoted.  I have no problem with people discussing false flag attacks in schools, but to portray something like this as evidence of something like that gets under my skin a bit.

       so in other words, completely nothing to do with OPs claim whatsoever? If this is truly what he OP is referencing, OP should delete this Fake News post and make a real post about why the fuck school did nothing after it was suggested by someone that they had major vulnerabilities.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Two months before the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High School, a retired Secret Service agent warned administrators that the school could be vulnerable to a gunman.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gates were unlocked. Students did not wear identification badges. A fire alarm could send students streaming into the halls. Active-shooter drills were inadequate, he said.
       </p>
       <p>
        The retired agent, Steve Wexler, said he made his point by strolling through the school with Post-it notes, attaching them to places his bullets or knife would land if he were an intruder. No one stopped him, he said.
       </p>
       <p>
        In an interview with the South Florida Sun Sentinel, Wexler said he was invited to analyze the school’s security and presented his recommendations to four staff members.
       </p>
       <p>
        [...]
       </p>
       <p>
        Wexler retired from the Secret Service in 2014 after 27 years with the agency. He was well-known among teachers at the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both of his children graduated from Stoneman Douglas, and he spoke regularly to classes about law enforcement searches and seizures and criminal deviance.
       </p>
       <p>
        He had offered in the past to make security recommendations. The district “finally took me up on the offer” in December when a teacher on behalf of the school’s security committee asked him to conduct a “site survey” of the campus. Was school security sufficient? they wanted to know.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wexler said he didn’t know what prompted the request. He said he printed out details about the school: its floor plan, bell schedule and an aerial map.

       My aunt is a teach, they had an an active shooter drill on the same day as Parkland too. When I told her that's crazy, she's like not really they have them every few months now. It's only a strange coincidence to you, because when we were growing up, they didn't need to do these kind of things in our schools.

       So many mass shootings and terrorist incidents have been preceded by some sort of drill that simulated an identical or nearly identical scenario.

      <p>
       On 9/11, the government was running drills simulating hijacked airplanes crashing into the world trade centers and pentagon.

       This one had me thinking if San Bernardino SWAT is a full time gig and if they are not on an op they are training, that is not true.  They train 36-40 hours per month, so 1/4 of the month SWAT is doing some type of training.  That kind of helps the odds of something just happening to go down while they are training.
