    <div class="md"><p>The words he&#39;s using are real words.  Aleister Crowley was a real person.  The rest is hyperbole and frantic scrambling to piece together a conspiracy with limited understanding of the subject matter.</p>

<p>Luciferianism is more of a philosophy than a religion.  Some cults might be described as Luciferian, like some cults are Christian.  But Luciferianism is not equivalent of Satanism or Demonology for example.  But both of those practices probably require believing a Luciferian philosophy.</p>

<p>And if by &quot;shady shit&quot; you mean &quot;he almost beat his ex-girlfriends to death&quot; then yeah, that&#39;s some shady shit.  I might think a Christian cultist murdered a piece of scum like that, but you&#39;d think someone who believed Luciferianism would want a woman beater on their side, not dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll clarify, since you did.  Aleister Crowley is a well known occultist.  That he is the most well known of all time is debatable.  Hyperbole is simply the way you used &quot;the most&quot; and &quot;the best&quot; and &quot;everybody knows.&quot;</p>

<p>Words are important, more important than you may realize.  Words have power, but hyperbole muddies the waters, it makes things less clear, and confuses the reader.  XXXtentacion knew this.  His words had to make sense to his audience.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to hate on your conspiracy.  You may be 100% right, I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;d have to spend some time looking into it.  </p>

<p>But if you&#39;re concerned with the visibility of your posts, be more clear, and provide at least links to clear examples of what you&#39;re talking about. XXXtentacion is a completely new name to me, so realize probably a good chunk of your readers have to play catch up to understand what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>And by frenetic or frantic, I meant that while reading your post, it felt like you tried to explain your hypothesis with about half the amount of words necessary for someone new to your conspiracy to understand or follow it.  It&#39;s okay, I&#39;ve done it, a lot of people do.</p>

<p>Also, find a way to show your connection to XXXtentacion without revealing enough information that someone could identify you.  I feel like you&#39;ve left a few too many clues that might put you in danger if you&#39;re right about a conspiracy.  </p>

<p>But I could be talking out my ass.  You do you.  I could just be projecting my frustration onto you.</p>

I think he fucked up by not having any security with him, I think he knew the guys that killed him. Why would drake kill this guy ? For what ? Because he supposedly stole his song and x exposed him ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your telling me the obvious I have inside knowledge I knew this too, but again you expect me to believe every celeb that died of suicide actually died from that? yeah no it&#39;s known the government paints murder as suicide to misdirect any future research into the case and they mostly end up getting stored in some portfolio somewhere as a cold case thats sealed. The old co owner of reddit(Aaron Schwartz)apparently hung him self which I know for a fact is complete BS and some ex hacking buddies of mine were in IRC chats with him and it was known the FBI wanted him dead because he poked his nose in private government servers and they were scared he stumbled upon very confidential documents so don&#39;t tell me just because williams was depressed automatically means he was more or less likely to have officially ended his own life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only motive I could personally think of was he dipped out on a movie deal because his own depression was getting in the way of his acting career and the director lost money so they killed him off(Theres probably a more important motive I personally couldn&#39;t tell you much on Robin Williams specifically) because if you watched family guy they placed a predictive programming episode with the Robin William clones and at the end of the episode Robin wWlliams dies, this episode just so happened to come a week or so before he died, it was clearly predicted and the only way they could of known he was gonna die is if the director of family guy Seth Mcfarland had access to the sacrifice list and im sure he does, if you notice every couple months 3 celebs randomly die in the news they kill them in 3&#39;s(skull and bones/other occultist groups that have pull in the music industry) I barely know much about Robin Williams the only reason I know what I do about tentacion is my girl lived near him and happened to know the same people he heavily associated with before death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t know xxxtentacion, but Anthony Bourdain was a particularly special soul to me who opened my eyes to a different way of seeing the world. He was a kindred psychonaut and fellow traveler. I knew who Kate Spade was in general.</p>

<p>But I maintain it isn&#39;t satanic. Demonic would be closer, but demons are actually higher dimension / density Service to Self (STS) entities. The sacrifices are literally food in exchange for power. Kate Spade and Bourdain were exposing child trafficking. I don&#39;t know that xxxtentacion had anything to do with that, but I hear he had entry of enemies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s a combination of both like I stated in my theory the new world order/skull and bones/illuminati/etc whatever term you wanna describe the superiors that the musical artist must listen to requires a blood sacrifice every couple months and you make this list depending on a list of deeds each artist commits during there career, good things cause them to go lower in the list bad things make them come up sooner in the list, I know about this list because 1. im an investigative journalist that digs my nose in places I shouldn&#39;t, yes I know it&#39;s risky before you tell me but I do it to help expose shenanigans that go on in this world and 2. I occasionally run into whistleblowers that are wise and contribute valuable knowledge and insight to my cause. Anyways on topic drake pissed them off because he must of did too many deeds they considered bad so his name was at the top of the list and prior to this drama going on he had ongoing issues with tentacion so because of his selfish desires to save his own ass he had tentacion sacrified extraordinarily early in this career because he didn&#39;t like tentacion anyways and he needed a sacrifice so it&#39;s a win win for the elites and drake. They need exactly 3 sacrifices every month or two in this case it was Kate Spade, Anthony Bourdain and the final sacrifice which was xxxtentacion, the final sacrifice was most likely going to be drake so drake was actually meant to die very soon but tentacion took his place since drake was pretty high up in this secret sacrificial list.</p>

<p>If you some how connect drake to that incident, coke deal, or bad karma, or body guard beef, anything, then i can get on board with this.</p>

<p>But right now, i stand at 2 occurence that are slightly related to drake. And im not interested in accusing some one based off of two incidences thay are slightly related. </p>

<p>After all, the odds are high that there are two incidence that i am some how slightlt related to even though i had nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>Im not ready to go make blind assumptions. The repercussions or stakes are too high. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re delusional if you thin this is scrambling or hyperbole first of all it&#39;s a conspiracy THEORY for a reason, it&#39;s not fact just a write up of what we know and were making conjecture based on information already given to us, we weren&#39;t on the crime scene for all we know drake was completely unrelated to tentacion dying but if you piece everything together it&#39;s known the music industry is involved in satanic cultures, theres millions of people on youtube that covered this most were investigative journalists, a lot were bored kids with a lot of time on their hands but you can&#39;t make this shit up, satanic dances? hand symbols? what are you gonna claim next that tons of these journalists imagined this and that there schizophrenic and that more then one person is magically wrong? you seem to be trying so hard to shoot down the truth but you&#39;re actually shooting in the dark iv&#39;e done plenty of research on this already but it seems you jumped on this thread empty handed making comments on something you barely know anything about.</p>
