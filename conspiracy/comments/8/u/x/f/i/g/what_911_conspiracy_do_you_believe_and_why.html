       It's not necessarily "stolen"oil. But the obvious one is look at, is the tens of billions Halliburton made. The largest sector to profit was the arms manufacturers. Overall trillions were made in the industry.

       Well you have the wrong subject. Again, the government is ruled by corporations. Also, it's not that simple. There are a multitude of benefactors from destroying the twin towers and invading Iraq some of them are Silverman, Saudis/Israel (and simulatenously weakening Iran's power in region - although Saddam was a Sunni - there's a larger war at play), Military Industrial Complex, Big Oil and the multiplier effect from this - Banks, Finance, Insurance, labor etc. These powers are nothing to sleep on. They rule the world.

       Yes. Search for the rise in opioid addiction in the U.S. since we invaded Afghanistan.  The pharmaceutical companies use all those opium poppies we're protecting to basically hamstring a chunk of the population.  And they make record profits all the livelong day while doing it.

       To say it was "orchestrated by the government" makes it sound like everyone who had an ID badge was in on it. That certainly wasn't the case, however, there are excellent reasons to suppose there were classified factions who planned to profit like Croesus from a "global war on terror."

       WTC building 7 collapsing at free fall speed from a roof fire. No impact, no damage from debris of other collapsing towers. 
Also plane crash site in pennsyvania had virtually zero wreckage left behind. Just a burning ditch full of garbage. Coroner reported he was shocked to find no bodies or human bio matter anywhere. He had to pack up and leave. The punch hole in the Pentagon had no wing damage that would match a plane. Just a clean hole punched through three layers of the building, which was coincidentally under construction months before to enhance structural reinforcement. Theres too many things but these three convinced me beyond a doubt something is not right. My opinion, it is no longer a "conspiracy theory".

       I don't know how to build a gun but that doesn't mean they don't work... the plausibility of something doesn't hinge on me knowing the inner workings of secret technology. I can make a guess and say about as much energy as a hurricane produces. Like the hurricane off the coast of NYC on 9/11 that no one talks about.

       You are a poor judge of what's possible and what's not. Have you ever seen a DEW shot from space? I think not. But we've all seen and felt and shot guns. No impossibilities to contend with.

      <p>
       What process of thought got you to DEWs?

      <p>
       Here's mine: look who made tonnes of money. Look at the leftovers. Draw as straight a line as the evidence allows. Weapons manufacturers, banks, opportunists of all walks of life stood to benefit greatly. Dynasties were created by that event. No impossibilities to contend with.

       No. Not even close. What's more likely to turn concrete into dust:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a secret directed energy weapon which no one can give the slightest detail or small scale example
or
       </li>
       <li>
        explosives
?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It comes down to this. What's more likely:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        something impossible (at this time)
or
       </li>
       <li>
        something possible 
?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If you're not even in the realm of the possible, it's definitely not science. So if your decisions are made from a place of a lack of knowledge, you're making an argument from ignorance. It's like Candace Owens denying the reality of climate change while acknowledging her total ignorance in the subject. How can you have a strong opinion about a controversy when you refuse to understand the factors involved?

       CD involving a group of international mercenaries, paid for by weapons manufacturers and abetted by the Cheney regime. Of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere in this plan, someone unconnected to Larry Silverman knew of his new lease on the WTC complex, and a combination of plans went into effect from the manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few secure meetings later and a team of high-level ex-military looking to get paid show up to work on elevators or infiltrate art projects located within the towers. They call in some favors with the guys at LLNL for some serious thermal bridge material, and they acquire some conventional materials as well. Over the course of 4-6 months, this group moves tonnes of material into the buildings and makes it all stick because this is the last score they're ever going to need.
      </p>
      <p>
       After radio detonators are in place in all the right buildings, they are told to look for the signal. The rest is history. No magic required. No "Super Death Ray," nor "massive, 4-dimensional hologram," nor a "clean nuclear blast". Just guys who would kill for money, and guys who would pay for murder.

       Were you expecting to see bodies to fly out of the plane Wilhelm screaming and landing on the front lawn? I believe they would of been literally cremated on impact.

       If you’re talking about inside the pentagon, there was a lot of people being taken out on stretchers.

       So every single piece of every single body on a plane that simply crashed into the ground is going to be complete incinerated upon impact? You must watch so many movies that your perception of how real life works is extremely skewed.

       But upon impact, the plane ejected no people or body parts? Not only are you claiming every piece of organic matter remained enclosed within the plane, but you're also claiming that every bit was completely consumed in fire. That's a forensically insane position to assert.

       Footage of planes was being broadcasted, it just didn't come with a disclaimer that "some images you are viewing may be simulated." I guess that would've been helpful, although it's not necessary for us to determine that the footage was manipulated in an attempt to deceive.

       There are only a handful of video clips showing the planes. Like 3-4 clips. They were obviously edited before release and the clip allegedly showing the second plane hitting the towers would've been edited as it streamed on a 10 second delay. Also, what eye witnesses?

       I believe the theory that the planes were digitally added to the footage that was shown; the fact that they didn't actually exist in physical space is corroborated by 1) impossible flight trajectory 2) impossible physics upon plane's impact and 3) people watching the area live did not report seeing any planes impact the towers, only explosions.

       Simple research would prove that a lot of people say they watched planes hit the buildings with their eyes, not on TV though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, do you think it’s plausible for so many be in on it without any information leaking out of it being produced and distributed to the news outlets?

       Who claims to have witnessed the event happen in physical space? Based on the clips I saw, people actually didn't see that. For example, when the second plane allegedly hit, there was a newscaster talking to a reporter in a helicopter who had a view of the scene from the sky. As the second plane hits, the newscaster is describing the action, but the pilot doesn't confirm that anything flew into the building. The newscaster was watching a tv feed whereas the pilot wasn't.

       NEAR Shoemaker passed 433 Eros in 1999, sending an audio signal back to Earth from 26.7 million kilometers. Because sound doesn't travel through space in outer space, it must travel through time, meaning the continuum is affected causing an event. With the speed of sound being ~ 1200km/h it takes 2.5 years for the sound wave to get to Earth, on the day of 9/11

       Yes. Search for the rise in opioid addiction in the U.S. since we invaded Afghanistan.  The pharmaceutical companies use all those opium poppies we're protecting to basically hamstring a chunk of the population.  And they make record profits all the livelong day while doing it.
