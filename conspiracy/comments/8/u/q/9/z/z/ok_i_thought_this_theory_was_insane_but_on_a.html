       I thought this theory was completely bullshit. Then I looked more into it... and I still think its probably bullshit. Although there quite a few weird coincidences I can't explain...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, this part of the song is clearly about sending nudes... but it also obviously has a double entendre. Drake and most good rappers are known for these. Look how this verse ends:
    "Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Also this part of the song repeats "(Skrr)"... the only other part of the song that uses "(Skrr)" is when he says 
    "Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)"
A TEC is a TEC-9... a semi-automatic pistol. Immediately following the gun makes it clear that "(Skrr)" represents a car pulling up/shooting. Look up "(Skrr)" it is literally gang slang for a car pulling up/shooting. Strange that it is only at these two parts of the song... and that a car pulled up and shot X. Also strange that in his music video Drake has a couple gunshot sounds for when the speakers blow...
      </p>
      <p>
       "SMS" is short for send my shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       One meaning of "triple X" is obviously "XXXTentacion", play the song on Spotify and even there you will see that in the lyric description it says this is most likely an XXXTentacion diss. 
You can also hear "x...x...x" whispered before this part of the song.
      </p>
      <p>
       The part in the song leading up to this has nothing to do with sending nudes to his ex. Instead it is about someone trying to "check him", which is a double entendre for challenging him as the king and also for accusing him of something (X said Drake stole his song, X said Drake's mom has an STD, X may have told Pusha T about Drake's baby).
    "You tryna check?
      </p>
      <p>
       The next part is a threat about how this is real life and there are real repercussions (getting killed?) for trying to check Drake.
    "This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess"
      </p>
      <p>
       Drake is acting like something evil took over him and made him do something cold.
    So what's next?
    Jump up out the bed like I’m possessed"
    ...
    Got a lot of blood and it's cold"
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole song is about sending shooters and ordering a hit. 
     "I'm upset
      Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect"
       ...
     "They keep tryna get me for my soul (for my soul)" [This could also hint "they" tempted him to lose his soul by ordering a hit]
      </p>
      <p>
       XXXTentacion was shot in the heart, that is why he did not bleed out significantly and instantly slumped after being shot. There was no visible shots or blood in the video of his deceased body slumped in the car. Witnesses saw him get shot below the neck/on the chest. 
    "That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)"
      </p>
      <p>
       He was shot multiple times in the chest, even after being hit in the heart. Witnesses heard multiple gunshots. Lack of bleeding signifies that he was already dead before the rest of the shots, or at the very least the shooters knew he was already dead. When you get shot multiple times in your center of mass it is typically because someone wants you dead, not just to rob you.
    "Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Drake had major beef with XXXTentacion. Drake is close with real criminals/killers. Drake wants to appear tough. Drake's label owner Birdman has even been accused of ordering a hit in 2015 by one of the attempted murderers after he was caught. During one of his concerts Kanye said that Jay Z and probably other big names have shooters (he mentioned Drake right before Jay Z, Drake's next album has Jay Z on it). One of X's last live videos is him anticipating his death and basically saying goodbye. X also posted online that if anyone kills him it is Drake. Weird coincidence? I think its just a coincidence.. but sure there is a small possibility.

       Listening to drakes album “Scorpion” and I overheard this bar while reading this. The track “Talk up ft. Jay-Z” 2:43  Jay says “ya’ll killed X let zimmerman live”. X died as recently as June 18th and I know for a fact Jay-Z just dissed him on The Album “Everything is love” that dropped the day prior to X’s death. Did they settle that bad blood and collab on a track in that short period of time? Maybe I’m reaching but I have a feeling X’s death was premeditated and I just cannot shake the thought since it infiltrated my head.

       That bar literally has nothing to do Nas and all to do with drake..  In 2015 Drake turned down the opportunity for independence and co-ownership in TIDAL for a $19 million contract with Apple Music. In December 2017 Drake joined Lil Wayne on his remix of Hov’s “Family Feud.” In his verse Drizzy declared he would require equity in the company if he was sign with Apple again—something Hov had offered him the first time around with TIDAL. Instead of working with Jay to grow their own Black-owned company together, Drake signed with Apple—“the man” -Rap Genius. Not sure why an artist on Nas’s tier would come to Jay-Z for a deal lol but this is all speculation. Just interesting to think about

       You also have Soulja Kidd, who claims he had nothing to do with the shooting in the area at the time of the shooting, with a pistol that matched caliber X was shot with posting pictures of it to social media within a 10 minute walk. Also matching the original description circulating that the shooter had a red mask. His Instagram is full of suspect shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       He reps "XXX" and is from Broward County and claims he has never heard of XXXTENTACION in videos on Instagram, which seems completely bogus.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's also been popping up at various record labels and recently posted a picture alongside Birdman.

       This is retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       SMS has to do with text messaging. 
XXX has to do with sending a nude pic. 
Shooting below the neck specifies that he’s sending a dick pick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Implying that normally he aims for the head which would be like a sniper shot or just a really good shot. That implication ties in with the way he dominates other rappers. The metaphor being that sending a dick pic is the only time he shoots(takes a picture) below the neck and that any other time - shooting in the head or dominating other rappers is his normal course of action.

       All I’m saying is drake is no stranger to these tactics. He probably has goons on his payroll who handle his “problems” for him. So it’s not completely out of the Realm of possibility that he had X dealt with. Especially if X had provided some info to Pusha T in regards to the  Story of Adidon diss. Just food for thought..

       Not sure if this has already been said since this thread is all I’ve read about this theory so far, but I would think “I’m upset” might be pretty blatantly referring to one of XXX’s latest tracks “Sad!” Not to mention that the
       <a href="https://youtu.be/iAeYPfrXwk4">
        music video

       is quite ominous considering how soon X died after its production. Chilling shit.

       Yeah, it sure gave me some goosebumps. Imagine making some kind of art that delves into the notion of your own mortality. Then imagine facing death almost immediately after. If that were me, I’d have truly felt that it was just my time to go, and almost accept it as some sort of cosmic destiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       But given my general obliviousness, I’ll probably be just thinking about how aliens probably made the pyramids and then suddenly get run over by a bus. Not nearly as beautiful in the grand scheme of things. Then again, at least I’m alive now to appreciate the significance of XXX’s kismet detachment from this mortal coil. Man I’m high.

       When half your hits are soft ass R&amp;B love songs that you yourself sing, you have to put shit like this out there to keep up the image that you’re this hard ass gangster. We know that ain’t you Drake. We know deep in your heart, you’re still on some “Best I Ever Had” shit.

       While you do have a point it is no secret that the streets and music industry are very intertwined. IE (Tupac &amp; Biggies murders) .  If you believe that Drake does not have the resources you’re mistaken. The music Industry is a very shady business indeed and I wouldn’t be surprised if he met and hired some goons in his 6+ years of dominance over the radio.

       Oh I fully believe that Drake has guys that roll with him that will shoot for him. If not him directly then definitely from his label. Lil Wayne and Birdman continue to pull his strings from behind the scenes. Speaking of Weezy, where the hell has he been lately? He goes from maybe the biggest rapper of all time, to absolutely no new music ever? Where’s the Carter 5? I do believe he’s doing some production these days, but he’s noticeably missing from the public eye.

       That street bragadacio of rap always annoys me. Unless you're a scummy dumb as rocks violent halfwit you're considered a pussy, you're considered to be less of a man. Too bad the Native Tongues stuff in the mid-90s never took hold, too bad that gangsta rap became the de facto face of rap.

       Give us an example of these other conspiracies mumble rappers make up? This theory has a lot of evidence. Don't write it off cause its funny to you or cause other rappers make dumb things up. You're only limiting your critical thinking.

       Yeah, but he could have dropped he early june, and if he did get X capped, he waited for the whole "X" thing to die down a bit before he dropped it. All the memorials, funerals and vigils are done and he dropped his probably, last music video. No better time for Drake to come in and drop an album and try to make people forget about X.

       Can't tell if sarcastic but I'll bite. Marvin's Room is my favorite out of his old stuff. He was actually sued for that song by the girl he seemed to have wrote it for, because as you can hear in the song he used her voice in their phone calls as samples without her permission

       Could XXX have put a hit on Drake for 50k for duping his song?

      <p>
       But eventually updated it to 100k?

       Could that be what the chorus is referring to?

       I wasn't offended. What you wrote wasn't offensive it was just totally unnecessary and therefore annoying. I didn't understand why you felt the need to post about how you don't care about the thread. Fucking innocuous.

       Not even close. You basically said you don't care about the thread because you don't find it interesting. Well then it's not for you and you voicing an opinion like that is literally pointless. Nobody cares that you don't care.
