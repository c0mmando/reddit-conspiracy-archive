        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So as I&#39;ve been following the revolving door in the Trump White House, I&#39;ve noticed a ton of recent staff picks have all been talking heads from Fox News.</p>

<p>Examples are;</p>

<p>Rudy Guilani
Larry Kudlow
Ronny Jackson
John Bolton
Bill Shine
Andrew Napolitano (rumored to be next SCOTUS pick)</p>

<p>These have all been hardly the best qualified candidates, but rather people that Donald Trump is watching on TV and I guess assuming there the best qualified??</p>

<p>Is the President&#39;s bubble that small that he has been deduced to picking Fox News hosts for top positions in his adminstration? This is not normal for any president in modern history</p>

<p>Is he that isolated that he only chooses people he sees on cable news to work for him?</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with you on this. It seems the American political system has devolved into nothing more then a popularly contest, giving a platform to those on cable news a seemingly advantage over the rest, I just find it incredibly hard to believe that the best choice for the country, is a talking head on Fox News </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, from what Judge Andrew Napolitano says on TV, I think he&#39;d be a loyal SCOTUS pick, but it seems Temp
Trump is basing this decision on what he sees  on Fox News, and nothing more.  When it comes to brass tax, he&#39;s a Libertarian who believes in the right to abortion at any stage, and is open to same sex marriage, which are two of the most urgent demands of conservatives.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how he will advance the conservative agenda, and really I haven&#39;t seen any substance from Judge Napolitano, other then that I&#39;ve seen on Fox Business Channel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a rise in functional autism. I have been noticing this and pointing it out for about 12 years now. Watch the behaviors and logic of people. It looks like autism.</p>

<p>A very mild example: Pay attention to how people are driving lately. They use their cars as an extension of their emotions. You can literally see body language in the way people are driving lately.</p>

<p>There is a lack of emotional control, extreme responses to stimulation, serious communication deficiencies, lack of bonding capabilities, etc...</p>

<p>All signs of functional autism.</p>

When I see Brennan and Hayden make these statements against POTUS, it does restore some hope in me that Trump is legitimate in &quot;draining the swamp&quot;, but Trump seems increasingly more likely to be recruiting hardcore NEOCONS that spit their vile world view frequently on Fox News, then he does appear to be &quot;draining the swamp&quot; </p>
