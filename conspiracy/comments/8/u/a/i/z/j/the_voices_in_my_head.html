       Weren't really voices. This is my experience. Ever since I can remember I was always different from my peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started out playing baseball, real active and real fast on my feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always heard my conscience speaking to me. Was it a dif voice? Did I hear a voice at all? Or did I feel and receive the communication from something or somebody else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of anything I just said, for the first time ever a few weeks ago, the "voice" or the message I'm receiving (feels like the same as before, like the voices in my head) except I hear them coming from one feet to the left of me or diagonal and the left.   This is what I'm trying to discuss, has anyone ever heard voices or felt like they've been a TI, and have you received any "upgrades" since initially being targeted?
      </p>
      <p>
       This question is for anyone who thinks they have been tracked by either a group of people, company, government, etc...

       Go see a medical professional. Start there. There are lots of conditions that don't show any other symptoms but affect the person(s) mentally. Could be something that even happened while playing baseball. If you do think you're a target of some sort I would try to understand why you would be one in the first place. If you don't have a decent explanation for why that would be. It's probably something going on in your noodle.

       Hahahaha the first time I experienced this was after getting hit with a baseball. Very good!

       I have gone to medical folks. I can't get into it right now but the last time I went to pick up my "meds" was right after a 51.50.... CVS said that my insurance wouldn't cover the new medicarion... the last medication made me fly into a whirlwind of emotions that my doctor told me under no circumstances do I take that drug again. So she gave me a new rx... that is the one they said they couldn't fill. It was for serequil.... why wouldn't they fill it? I won't say what drug they tried to keep me on. Anyway I declined their meds and have been feeling better ever since.

       you're getting targeted by the 5G towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you live near a military base?
      </p>
      <p>
       Try building a DIY Faraday cage in your room and see if it stops. If not and you do live near a military base, call them and ask to speak with whoever is there in charge of the tech are, higher up management, and tell them their tech is interrupting with your household and to aim their tech elsewhere. (Be nice and dont be a dick when you call. Also, you may have to call a dozen times before it stops. Always write down notes who you talked with, and offer to send some donuts in gratitidue for them stopping)

       If it doesnt stop inside a faraday cage it's in his head...
      </p>
      <p>
       And calling the government and telling em all of this could result in a judge ruling it's best for his own wellbeing to be committed.. This is horrible advice; it's hard enough for people in this position to get help. Let him atleast go at his own pace... Otherwise it'll just be proof to him people are out to get him.. That doesn't help OP.

       he can get a cheap throw away burner phone off ebay and call them, not use his real name, and say its targeting his block.

       There was a user here 2 years ago who had the same issue, lived near a military based, called them 12 times over the course of 2 weeks, and all the voices went away because it was coming from their tech

       Youtube videos do not equate to solid proof.. Look at facts; OP was given meds that had negative influence on his mental state. The medication that he was then put on is not covered by his insurance. Said medication was Seroquel which just so happens to be a anti psychotic/mood stabilizer.. But it's devices doing it to him? While he stated he was given medicaton that had wrong effect on him? Come on now... Apply logic.

       im not saying its not seroquel. It very well could be. But if the voices started before the seroquel, then it's the 5G and/or targeted military psy ops near by

       No, this is just wrong. He hasn't been able to take seroquel since it's not covered by his insurance. The seroquel would help with these type of thoughts.. It aint certain that it's 5g if it started before or  after he took those meds. Much like psychedelics medication can also trigger certain episodes.. Which he might have experienced before aswell. You clearly do not know anything about the subject and are spreading false information, that's pretty dangerous if you ask me. I hope OP sees a professional cause this type of nonsense ain't helping him. 
And please, it wouldn't be the first disinfo to reach top spot on this sub... That aint proof...

       call the airforce base, but be super nice and friendly, ask who you are talking to (write down his/her name) and ask if there is an upper management you can talk to or someone in the tech division.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell them their tech (just say frequencies or radio waves they use) is disrupting your household and causing sleep issues and issues with your technology and thought patterns.

      <p>
       (dont mention anything about voices). Just say that its only at your house, but when you go down the street, everything is fine.

       Dont give them your address, just say nearest street corner. Only give your address if they are adamant about it.

       Also, you haven't looked up or read deeply into dylan roof, batman shooter or any of that stuff (b0mb making, gun building etc)?

       Is a constant ringing in the ears at all times since early childhood a symptom?  I've looked everywhere I can medically, been tested for tinnitus, but have perfect hearing, which doesn't happen with tinnitus.  It's always the same frequency and always the same volume.  It doesn't bother me particularly, except that I don't know what causes it.

       Are you into any new age mysticism type stuff (Meditation, Astral projection, Hypnosis etc) or entheogens (DMT,  Ayahuasca, Slavia etc)?  If so these things open you up to unclean spirits.  These spirits dwell inside you and their thoughts become your thoughts.  You will kind of just know it wasn't your thought but it can be very hard to tell if people aren't aware of these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple examples from Scripture:
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 11:24  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 11:25  And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luk 11:26  Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an example of meditation for instance.  When you "clear your mind" you are making room for more unclean spirits to inhabit your body which is their home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a guy who had an entire legion of unclean spirits (devils) in him.  You can see that they actually do give people supernatural power in some cases.  In Witchcraft they do Sorcery (pharmakeia) to "fill their chalice" which is their body with devils so they can have more power over the world.  It's not "the force" that's doing anything for them, it's just these spirits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:3  Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:4  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:7  And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:14  And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar 5:15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.

       You have been given this life freely to do with it what you want but your answers are in Scripture.  There is no such ting as being a TI it's torment from the spiritual realm.  You can clear it up by getting right with God and though prayer and fasting:
      </p>
      <p>
       Mar_9:29  And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above verse is removed from many counterfeit modern Bibles because it instructs us in spiritual warfare and the Devil doesn't want people to know it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get right with God you need to repent and belive the Gospel that was given to Paul:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you are unsaved simply rebuking them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can have an effect when you are dealing with a TI experience or voices in your head.  Give it a shot sometime.

       my experience has been different .. thank god the voices stopped but mine were more harassing .. at first they used to voices of people i knew (friends/family) and they used the guise of  trying to "help" me, or try to help uncover "truth" .. i realize now they were turning me paranoid delusional and it ended with me being on a 3 day involuntary  psych hold multiple times .. once they realized those tricks didnt work it just turned into pure harassment / torture (non-stop chatter, stupid comments, trying to make me feel bad for my thoughts etc) .. they also tried making me feel certain feelings, implanting thoughts, physical sensations .. eventually i like to think i beat them at there own game and just stopped responding, but tbh i dont know why it stopped, but it didnt really stop just the voices did, but i know theyre still there, i still get random ringing in my ears sometimes i know theyre there but fuck them i no longer let them influence me .. to anyone out there affected stay strong we will beat this
