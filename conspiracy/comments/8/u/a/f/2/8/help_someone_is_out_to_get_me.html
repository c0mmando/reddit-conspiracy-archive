       i’m going to start this off with the whole back story.
So it all starts the end of my junior year, i recently just broke up with my controlling and manipulative girlfriend. The day i left her i hung out with another girl from out of town and my ex found out and was cussing me out and threatening me, i just blew it off. Junior prom rolls around and i still have to go with her, anyway my friend was throwing a party and was inviting all the cool people keeping it low key. Apparently my ex was asking him about the party saying she wanted to go and was asking for details. (keep in mind my ex was never into partying and was actually quite against it) We all get to the party secluded way out of town and in the middle of nowhere, mid beer pong game i hear a loud speaker yelling, “Nobody move” i went to run into the woods but the whole party was surrounded by at least 15 cops. So everyone gets mips a couple got busted for weed and went to jail. The next week there’s an article in the newspaper about it stating that a group of “concerned parents” called in the party because they didn’t want to get anyone hurt apparently. I forgot to mention my ex’s family was usually pretty nice but were highly involved in the community, and befriended people of high authority within the town. it was a clear sign who called in the party and it was huge deal at school but fast forward to a more important part of the story. Before i would like to state that i do drink and smoke quite occasionally and my ex knew that and told her whole family. Anyway i was driving home one night from a friends like any other night and i still pulled over from a cop sitting on my drive home (where i’ve never seen a cop) i was going the speed limit but he still pulls me over. The cop asked if i had been drinking ( i have not, before this i only smoked at my friends) he asked to search the truck i refused but he insisted because it “smelled fruity” well he searched found weed and took me to jail. this was a big deal for my parents who were really disappointed. i’ve been on probation since January and get off in july. Recently i’ve had a strong paranoia of such things, but w good reason to believe it. my town is very small and nothing big ever happens or changes, but recently we have just attained a new drug dog for the police. another thing is the speed limits out to my house have recently changed and those have stood there forever. The scariest part to this is my girlfriends little brother yelled at me while i was at their house the last time and told me there was a cop at my truck, i instantly got super nervous but went outside and the cop drove away. i’ve been keeping my nose clean somewhat and never carry anything in my truck, but still i feel like this is all building to something to where my ex’s family and the cops are working trying to catch me in big trouble. i will answer any questions y’all have for me.

       There's plenty of the rest of your life to smoke.  Trust me.  I'm an otherwise responsible adult nearing midlife who still smokes.  Bills get paid, fun is had, no record to speak of.  When you find yourself in my position, it's after realizing that responsible smokers don't stand out, and then the paranoia really disappears.

       Stay clean. If you have any plans to leave for college or anything, stick to that, and don't foccus on anything else. If you don't have plans to leave your town in the future, you can't do much other than wait for it to all blow over. Which, in small towns, is likely to never truly go away. STAY FUCKING CLEAN, don't do dumb shit, never drive too fast, too slow, or with anything illegal in the car. Keep your nose to the grindstone and make preparations to leave eventually.

       I know how it goes, I grew up in a very strict county, where weed crumbs would get you sent to jail. Stay safe.

       Cops target HS age kids. It's just how some of them operate. It's a lot easier to trick a kid into saying something stupid or get caught in a lie than an adult who may have been through those situations before. It's a dick move, usually pulled off by a dick cop.

       A lot of criminal lawyers do free consultations. In this case, you know who 'they' are. Getting things on record is your friend.

       that girl probably told people you beat her or some shit. trust your gut. if you feel shit is funky then it probably is. lay low for awhile and don’t put yourself in a position to be exploited. (weed crumbs in the car, smell of alcohol on you, etc.)

       OP should especially learn to control emotions.  I was explosive as a teen, which could have gotten me in a lot more trouble than it did.  If cops are scoping him, learn to think clearly, because anger and fear make you stupid.  I recommend mindfulness meditation.  This can be as simple as hiking and giving full attention to nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, be cautious of the ex's friends.  The girls in my HS were devious af to one another.  Also, don't talk to the ex unless you have to as part of class or something.  She seems like a typical teen clinger, but with the danger of having a family with connections (even if simply local).

       Question:  Are your parents from the town, or did they move there?  Were you born and raised in that town?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I ask is because I grew up in a town my parents weren't from, and was always treated like an outsider even though I went to school with my classmates from preschool on.
