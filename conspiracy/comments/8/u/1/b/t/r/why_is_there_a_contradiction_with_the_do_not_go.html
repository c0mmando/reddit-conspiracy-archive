       So supposedly I have to love and create connections in this life and to cherish my family, but there in the moment of death I am supposed not to follow the light and ignore my loved ones? This shit is as illogical as your regular religion.

       Its a fucking documentary and instead of assasinating the brothers who wrote the movies guess what happend?
      </p>
      <p>
       SUDDENLY both the  brothers are trans "women" .
Think about it for a second , either they can kill you or they can MK ultra your head and make you swap gender. I would rather choose death.

       Reincarnation is bad (as subjective as bad is) according to Buddhism/Hinduism. This cycle (Samsara) is supposed to be broken. Only then ones soul (again their view of soul is completely different than Judeo/Christian) is free (Nirvana)

       This is also seen in Gnosticism

       Who the fuck claimed any of that? You just took the word battery and just thought The Matrix as if it was the first piece of media to put it in those terms. Shows how easily you are manipulated, thinking the movies "come first" then the theories rather than the movies being made precisely because mental giants like you will think everything that happens in a Hollywood movie is immediately just a story.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I wanted to make you NOT believe in some ancient secret, I sure as fuck would make a big budget Hollywood movie about it so cattle like you would think it's just a movie concept.

       I'll add to your point that there are two schools of thought in Buddhism: Theravada (little wheel) and Mahayana (big wheel).
      </p>
      <p>
       The theravadist seeks liberation for him or herself (I'm simplifying here) whilethr mahayanist has a concept called the bodhisatva who after enlightenment and freedom from reincarnation, voluntarily chooses to re-enter the cycle fully awakened to help others.

       2Co_11:14  And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire New Age system is a false light.  It's all Satanic and meant to get you to die sin your sins without the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ which is the only thing that can save you.  Nothing you do in this life can save you.  Only what God himself did for you in the flesh of Jesus Christ.  Repent and believe this to be saved:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       I'm 100&amp;#37; sure it's right otherwise I wouldn't even bother to tell anyone.

      <p>
       Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
      </p>
      <p>
       Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rev 21:8  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to avoid the second death is to have the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ via repentance and belief in the above gospel.  God isn't playing around.  He's as disgusted by a single lie as we are by a child molesting murdering pedophile.  He has no problem pushing sin with eternal torments just like we have no problem punishing child molesting murderers.  We like to compare ourselves to each other and not to a perfect holy God who can't tolerate any sin at all.

       That's why it's called "witnessing."  Those of us who have gone through the quickening of the spirit and the transformation of the mind though Jesus Christ bear witness to you.  I'm sure I'm not the first nor the last that will.  If your flesh dies before you repent, God will go over every moment of your life that he reached out to you by any means (nature, thought, witnesses, etc) and show you have you willfully rejected his grace and forgiveness.

       Yes you keep replying with quotes as though they hold weight, that's why it's called "sarcasm". Those of us who have seen this control system at work make light of those who are serious in their attempt to impose their beliefs on others through fear. The harder you try, the easier it is to spot. Can I have some more irrelevant quotes now please?

       This explains why you are so confused.  The entire reality you believe in is false based on lies TPTB have indoctrinated you with since childhood.  The reason they lie about this stuff is to try to discredit the Bible.  Hopefully you can figure it out someday.  "Outer space" is a complete hoax.

       Agreed.  That's why all the religions of the world, even the fake ones that claim Christianity tell you what you must do to attain salvation.  The truth is there is nothing you must do and in fact nothing you can do.  It's already been done for you by God himself who came in the flesh of Jesus Christ.  Your common refrain response is due to all the straw man false religions that are stood up for you to knock down.

       The idea that God waits a few hundred thousand years before sending down his message is pretty retarded. You can't cite a book written by Shephards two thousand years ago as proof of anything.

       Soul trap to keep us enslaved here.  Who knows.  There is some very compelling circumstantial evidence for reincarnation, as well as very, very odd details regarding our moon may be an artificial satellite (amongst other oddities, see the book who built the moon?).

       I can’t say I am 100% convinced, but it’s a very interesting theory.

       I have heard about the link between the Moon and reincarnation but I'm interested to know how such a link was established. Also Saturn.

       go to yt and search john lear . he talks about the moon being an artificial satalite that pulls your soul out at death. and sends you back to the next available body suitable for your experience.

       I find it confusing too but maybe not a contradiction. Supposedly archons (or whatever they are) can shapeshift or something. If anyone has more info, I'd like to know.
