        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I consider myself pretty left-wing. I’m an anarchist. Doesn’t get much more anti-establishment than that. I’ve found myself utterly exhausted with the hypocrisy of the Left in the US. When Bush was in power, the media covered Code Pink and various other anti-war groups, and when Obama gained the presidency, suddenly, those very same undeclared wars were now legitimized and the anti-war movement floundered. It’s disgusting. Nobody has any principles.</p>

<p>The trouble with the “Left” in America is that they’ve been subsumed into the lukewarm, centrist Neoliberal-Neocon Ivory-tower corporatocracy complex. We really need a term for those people that encapsulates everything that they are. Look at how many words I just used to describe them. Some call them neoliberals, but that implies that their beliefs are liberal or related to the enlightenment, which they are not, and attacking neoliberals makes you look like you just hate liberalism period. Some call them neoconservatives, but that’s just another mask they wear. The only common theme amongst them is that they have a lot of intellectuals in their ranks who are trying to shape public policy and steer it away from the interests of the common man.</p>

<p>Ivory tower... perhaps Ivorians. No relation to inhabitants of the Ivory Coast. All the connotations of smug elitism and filthy lucre. I like it. I’m gonna start calling them that from now on. Ivorians. They’ve struggled so long to escape definition, and that’s how they’ve amassed so much power, by being invisible parasites wearing other ideologies like a maggoty meat suit.</p>

<p>You can easily recognize Ivorians by their agenda:</p>

<p>-Money money money. Money is God, and anything done in pursuit of it within the law is permissible.</p>

<p>-Seize control of academia. Worm your way into the heads of college grads by drip-feeding them Keynes and Friedman, and for the ones you can’t actually use in your inscrutable hierarchy, brainwash them with Lacan, Derrida and Foucault and use them as shocktroopers and meat shields.</p>

<p>-Erode concepts like morality, natural rights, and true, honest values and replace them with doubt and moral confusion. Poison strong cultures from within to soften them up and make them easier to control and exploit. Characterize the backlash as irrational, reactionary paleoconservatism, especially if the ones complaining are left-libertarian heretics. There is no right or wrong, only the dictates of the enlightened few.</p>

<p>-Big gubmint is good as long as it does exactly what the aristocracy wants. Corporations are people, too, and they deserve the biggest welfare checks.</p>

<p>-NGOs, think tanks and charities are the perfect way to conceal your wealth and spread your influence across borders while appearing progressive. Use that influence to unseat and replace institutions that work against your interests. They’re also a great way to turn yourself into a sacred cow and escape criticism, even though you operate exactly like a pirate and a bloodsucking leech.</p>

<p>-Endless undeclared wars for shady financial and business reasons, camouflaged as humanitarian interventions. Piss on representative democracy. If the UN says it’s okay, it’s okay. Send those with initiative and force of will off to fight and die and maim themselves, and leave the decadents at home to pollute the political sphere.</p>

<p>-Muh horseshoe theory, muh rationality. If it’s in RationalWiki that means it must be true. Expect everyone to be as rational as you are. If they fail your litmus test, classify them as subhuman animal filth. Habitually fail to grasp how ironic this is.</p>

<p>-Don’t have an actual, recognizable ideology. Exploit and use everyone. If the pendulum swings right, infiltrate and ingratiate yourself with the good ol’ boys clubs of private industry. If it swings left, blow smoke up the ass of intellectual city-dwellers and make them feel needed. Populism is good if it ultimately elects people who will give you tax breaks or subsidize your operations. Ignore the demands of the wider public unless such ignorance would create an unacceptable amount of unrest.</p>

<p>-Don’t have principles. Everything is just another job. Just business. Ideologies and strong beliefs are for little people. They are simply another weakness you can exploit. Other people’s lives are nothing more than a game to you.</p>

<p>-When caught, never take responsibility for your actions. Lie, prevaricate, blame the Other, some convenient boogeyman. Absolve yourself of all guilt automatically. After all, you’re the chosen ones. You can’t possibly be wrong. If the public disagrees, stir the pot by inflaming tribalist sentiments. Use the chaos to conceal your money-grubbing behavior. Behave exactly like a looter after a natural disaster.</p>

<p>Ivorians. These insufferable plutocrats are everywhere. A lot of the right-wing populists in the US would actually benefit from Far-Left ideology. More unionism, universal healthcare, cheap higher education and a strong safety net would benefit the poor rural-dwellers immensely. But instead of recognizing this great mass of rednecks and blue-collar workers as a valued proletariat lacking representation, the Ivorians shun them for lacking the proper intellectual credentials. That’s where you get smug, sneering garbage like Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment.</p>

<p>The establishment Left in the US is completely unrelatable to the needs and interests of common people. They alienated us. They drove prospective voters away. It’s not Russian trolls or racist bigots. It was the New Democrats and their slithering Ivorian puppetmasters. They have only themselves to blame.</p>

<p>Left-wing, Right-wing, we have a common enemy. It’s the Ivorians. For God’s sake, these lunatics are right there, staring us in the face, running off with all our money, sending our children to fight and die for insane reasons, and we don’t even have a <em>word</em> for these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because with the Republicans, you knew exactly what you were getting into. The Democrats campaigned on an anti-war platform and then pulled a bait-and-switch and bombed Libya into dust while arming Wahhabist nutcases in Syria. The hypocrisy and lack of principles is obvious, but nobody bothers to point it out. Oh, and don’t think I let Trump off the hook, either. He campaigned on an anti-interventionist, isolationist foreign policy and guess what? He’s dropping more bombs than his predecessors. No matter which party is in power, the security state carries out the same agenda with the blessing of the plutocrats and their guileless puppet politicians. I’m just hard on the Left because I expect better from <em>us</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot here I agree with, and a lot I disagree with.  That&#39;s part of the reason why I and many other far lefties (i&#39;m personally more of a social democrat than an anarchist myself) are trying to take back the Democratic Party.  The fight is far from over, but if you look at the victories of Democratic Socialist Ocasio-Cortez over an establishment hack in the Bronx, and Ben Jealous&#39;s victory over another neoliberal stooge for the nomination for the Maryland Governorship, we ain&#39;t out of the fight yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Social Democrats had a good thing going. That’s why the Ivorians bought it. I don’t mean bought it as in they started believing in it. I mean, they actually ponied up vast sums of money and... <em>bought</em> it, like they were shopping for clothes. That’s how the money-grubbers operate. They pick through ideologies like a yuppie picks through a clothing rack at Men’s Wearhouse. Their constituency is just another meat-suit for them to wear.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party is a lost cause. The Sanders snub should’ve made that obvious. The only way to take it back now is to have enough money to <em>buy</em> it back, and by the time you can do that, you’re already an Ivorian yourself, bathing in swimming pools of neocolonialist ivory right at the tippy-top of your ivory tower.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the Democratic Party is a lost cause.  I think perhaps the party&#39;s leadership, especially Chuck Schumer, is a lost cause.  Ocasio-Cortez rejected corporate money.  She had far less than her opponent.  She used a combination of digital advertising, and hard grassroots campaigning.  You don&#39;t need the money you used to need to take it back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Way, way, off in the lower-left corner. Left-Libertarian, Anarcho-Transhumanist. End the drug war and private, for-profit prisons. End the corrupt central banking system and the ceaseless wars. End the neo-imperialism and colonialism and think of ways to help the third world instead of sabotaging them like we are now. Dismantle the corporatocracy. </p>

<p>Basically, I see transhumanism, the automation of labor, and the abolition of practical scarcity as an inevitable consequence of technological advancement. </p>

<p>I do not trust the powers-that-be to use that technology wisely.</p>

<p>Humanity is at a crossroads. In another 50 to 100 years, the wage laborer will be obsolete in industrialized, first-world countries. There will be robot servers at restaurants, robot cashiers, robot auto-docs, driverless cars will make taxi drivers obsolete, factories will be totally automated. Endless, abundant wealth, produced without human intervention and without paying armies of workers. At the same time, climate change will create enormous social upheaval and spread disease and poverty across the equator. Implausible heights of opulence will exist side-by-side with terrible depths of squalor. Humanity will flee towards the poles. There will be wars, starvation, endless struggle.</p>

<p>We have two paths we can take.</p>

<p>We can choose the path of compassion, looking at ways to replace governance with automation, allocate resources equitably, minimize the influence of money on politics and perhaps even abolish the price system (if wage labor is obsolete, we’d have no need of prices any longer) and allow for people to freely modify and improve themselves with open-source, transparent technology that they personally control. People would have complete ownership over their minds and bodies, and we would work together to build great arcologies to weather the coming storm and beat back nature’s ravages.</p>

<p>Or, we can go the way we’re currently going, which is a neo-feudalist corporatocracy where big business eventually replaces the role of government in society, wealth is concentrated ever more greatly and in fewer and fewer hands. The wage laborer is obsolesced, shunned, and disenfranchised, pushed to the sidelines, perhaps even medicated Brave New World-style, or modified with an emotional suppression chip to go with their neural lace, so they come to love their oppression and never think to resist it. Humanity is suppressed, shut out, the wealthy withdrawing into smaller and smaller fiefdoms and gated communities while the greater mass of humanity is strangled and starved. While the sea level rises and we all drown, the plutocrats float away on their artificial island mansions, tended to by their armies of robot butlers, laborers and and security guards.</p>

<p>Technological progress can and will be abused by the rich and powerful to perpetrate monstrous crimes against humanity, unless we start thinking about the sort of future we wish to live in, right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do see that it’s what TPTB want. That’s part of the reason why I’m a transhumanist. If and when I am augmented, I wish to be the one holding the key over said augmentations. The way things are heading, we cannot stop them. They will take people and experiment on them in hidden black sites and off-grid clinics anyway. We must master this technological leap before they do. We must turn it towards our purposes and away from theirs, or our freedoms will be irrevocably torn from us. It won’t just be used to limit, monitor, and mind-control the proles. The wealthy will use this technology to make them and their progeny unstoppable. Picture the brilliance of one well-educated human. Now, picture if they could stuff a hundred times the capacity for memory, creativity, intellect and data-correlation into that one person’s head. Their value to the economy would be immeasurably more than anyone else’s. They would have no reason to hire a hundred employees if they could do the mental labor of a hundred by themselves. With but a thought, they could delegate tasks to armies of drones, and if attacked in public? Well, their personal bots would devour the offender like locusts. I don’t want <em>that</em> to be our future.</p>

<p>I don’t think our humanity is anything particularly special or worth defending. We all die and rot eventually. Hell, we’re the ones who can’t seem to keep lying, cheating and misleading one another. If we could become better, more empathetic versions of ourselves through technology by sacrificing some of the worst parts of “humanity”, it’s seems like a fair trade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you in that we don’t need some bullshit government to cuddle us when we are down (ripe with corruption, and misspending every dime we give them), but I have seen far too much, “fuck you, I got mine.  You go get yours”, to fully buy in to volunteerism.  Too easy to close the door on our fellow man.  No?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand the ideologies I&#39;ve mentioned. In no way am I obliged to help you, if I do not consent (ie. Voluntaryism - voluntary interaction/transaction). So, in a words: &quot;Fuck you, I have my own, you get yours&quot;, is completely applicable to the ideology. Humans are naturally good, though, imo... so, they will help, as long as you do not trespass against them (ie. Non-Agression Principle). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Full communism ---- center ---- full anarchy</p>

<p>Actual anarchy is not a lefty position, what people call anarchy today is just edgy teens who are being fed communist ideology while being told it&#39;s anarchy.</p>

<p>Pretty fucking silly of you ask me.  It would be more accurate to call it revolutionary communist idealists.</p>

<p>from my understanding, left-side is big government. right-side is little/no government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The exegesis of your word is parallel to Moldbug <em>cathedral</em>.  </p>

<p>Ivorian does not have much of a ring to it. <em>Fascist</em> kind of sounds like <em>shit</em>. That is a ring.  </p>

<p>The other day I was listening to a podcaster who I like and respect and they said their ad revenue is down to 1/80 of what it was before they got onto the fake news hit list. No warning. No process. No appeal. They just took this list of websites out and shot them. Like one of Napoleon&#39;s generals got pissed at the Moscow rioters and just lined a bunch of them up and shot them.  </p>
