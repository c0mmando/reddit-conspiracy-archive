Tweeting at all hours of the night insane things, many people are distracted by his tweets and will never have time to look into flat earth. Also no one has been able to prove the curve of the earth, besides the usual suspects who are not to be trusted. IE government agencies. It&#39;s funny because most people have no problem accepting that the government lies, but when it comes to NASA and worldwide conspiracies, it&#39;s just too much to handle. Well not for me! Hello Globe Believers! I&#39;m not here to debate, just to let you know, we are still here and we don&#39;t believe we live on a globe. Have a nice day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I was asking a legit question, how do flat earthers explain that experiment? Why the burden of proof is being flipped back on me I don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>As for the experiment, from what I understand Eratosthenes used a shadow cast by a tower in Alexandria to calculate the angle of the sun to the tower. It was the summer solstice, when the sun is not directly over Alexandria but at a nearby site it is directly overhead. Using the distance between those locations and the angle of the sun, trigonometry can be used to then calculate the circumference of the earth and thus it&#39;s average curvature.</p>

<p>Whether you believe the story of Eratosthenes (and the modern recreations of the experiment) or not is up to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They respond with first assuming the earth is flat. Then they use the pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance from Alexandria to the sun. That&#39;s where they get the 3000 miles from. </p>

<p>Obviously, you can&#39;t use the pythagorean theoren when one side of the triangle is a curve. But... that&#39;s flat earth for ya.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll explain anything you&#39;d like in detail but first Do you trust the US government? or it&#39;s subsidiaries? Probably not, yet you believe everything they say about the earth being round, despite no independent data or photography showing the earths curvature. The earth is 24k miles around allegedly, how is it that I can see objects fully, obscured, reliably, that should be observed by the earths curvature? Ship goes over horizon, disappears:Zoom in and it reappears! There have been mountains photographed from 200 miles away, yet that should be thousands of feet below the horizon. Why doesn&#39;t the moon&#39;s shadow behave like any other spherical object with a shadow cast upon it (The shadow projects as a S-Curve as it covers any sphere: TEST this yourself, or simply google shadow on sphere). Ask yourself this, does the explanation for tidal locking really make sense? Finally there are NO repeatable, demonstrable experiments showing Mass Attracting Mass: Only theory and mathematics.</p>

<p>Look at Nasa and their moon mission, how is all the data recorded on reels lost?

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, Eratosthenes&#39; experiment uses relatively basic math. May be he didn&#39;t actually do it 2000 years ago, maybe they made that up, but the math still works.</p>

<p>A modern recreation of the test was done in 2015. It had a larger margin of error but was also over a much greater distance. Here&#39;s that paper (behind a paywall sadly, but you can see the absract):</p>

BUT YOU CAN&#39;T, if you actually do the research everything you think you know turns into a fairy tale about space. Legit buddy, I know it totally sounds ridiculous, i understand that 110%, because, since the time we were only able to see and hear we were told we live on a hurling sphere in space. Space is literally the baby blanket for 90% of humans out there and we&#39;ve been lied about it. </p>

<p>You obviously have not done any testing yourself, just take it on faith of others. Your last statement proves that, literally.</p>

<p>I work with microwave transmission dishes that need line of sight to be capable of performing at peak efficiency. Check out the new record for longest ptp shot, it&#39;s over 300km. This is absolutely not possible on a globe earth, whether it&#39;s pear shaped, perfectly round or whether &quot;atmospheric refraction&quot; take precedent with these frequencies, it is not possible. These radios need line of sight, even with the 1700m height you will still have curvature of over 1900m, this is your heliocentric data and its flawed... But these frequencies cannot shoot THROUGH any water or land mass. You put your tiny pecker in front of this dish and she ain&#39;t gonna work, so sorry bud, no curve.</p>

<p>Just fathom the idea that you are wrong for two hours, put your ego in the locker and all the &quot;science&quot; bs you have memorized and take faith upon, you will come out with an overwhelming feeling of distrust for your beloved heliocentric model. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best part about this is the abhorrent disregard for historic facts proving the earth was round. Around <strong>500 B.C.</strong> Pythagoras posited the earth was round due to the terminator line (the line created in between the shadow and the light on the moon). In the next 70 years Anaxagoras used the lunar and solar eclipses to enhance and &#39;prove&#39; pythagoras&#39; idea. <strong>350 B.C.</strong> Aristotle declared the same thing. He believed this because as latitude increases, the angles and distances between constelation and the stars therein shifted accordingly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t prove anything to doubters and naysayers over the internet and I don&#39;t really want to waste my time trying - but here&#39;s a short list of some of the most pertinent evidence, take a look if you want.</p>

<p>Look into Airy&#39;s Failure, Sagnac experiment, James Bradley and his experiments on stellar aberration, Michelson, Morley, and Gaille and their experiments that prove the earth doesn&#39;t move or rotate on any sort of axis.  These are generally suppressed and misinterpreted by mainstream sources - and of course they&#39;re not taught or talked about in most schools.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, no, I&#39;ve already learned about the history of the claims of gravitational theory and all the holes - sorry, it&#39;s bunk.</p>

<p>I dispute that this weight difference is real and measurable - there are many confounding factors in this test.  How would a shift in gravitational force not affect the scale as well?  This test of measuring a weight is absolute nonsense - the variables are not isolated and there are many, many other confounding factors.  </p>

<p>Gravity is another useless abstraction that has no basis in reality - no one can prove that it&#39;s real.  The principles density along a density gradient explains everything we observe.  Please stop misleading people about a fictional force and claiming it&#39;s reality - it is not - and it certainly isn&#39;t scientific.</p>

<p>em·pir·i·cal  (ĕm-pîr′ĭ-kəl)
adj.
1.
a. Relying on or derived from observation or experiment: empirical results that supported the hypothesis.
b. Verifiable or provable by means of observation or experiment: </p>

<p>Well I know the earth isn&#39;t spinning because when I jump I land in the same place I jumped from. I also know it&#39;s not a globe since only nasa can take pictures of the curve. Also, Fish eye lenses.  Yes foreign space agencies are all under control of nasa. Do some research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you 100%! The US government has how many trillions in dollars missing in the last couple years and they are making space force, another multi billion $ a year feat to scrounge up some more funds from hard working tax payers? It&#39;s absolutely crazy, I wish the people would take their blinders off, set their ego&#39;s to the side and go with a mindset of maybe I was lied to, at least for 2 hours to do some critical researching for themselves instead of falling back into their claimed &quot;science&quot; which is pure fantasy, speaking of space of course.</p>

<p>Seriously though, Occum&#39;s Razor is the worlds way of reality, so I can&#39;t really blame the people for trying to protect what they&#39;ve been told since they were tots. Heliocentrism is a baby blanket to the offspring of this world.</p>

<p>Oh, globies, why are you all following a Pagan worship..? Helios the sun God is the stem of your whole model and how it was created in your fantasy &quot;science&quot;. YOU GUYS AND GALS ARE MOSTLY BLIND TO THIS AND IT&#39;S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, no, I&#39;ve already learned about the history of the claims of gravitational theory and all the holes - sorry, it&#39;s bunk.</p>

<p>There is no scientific experiment that has ever been devised that proves that matter attracts matter based on mass alone - this is an empty, baseless claim that&#39;s rooted in philosophy and not observational scientific experiment.</p>
