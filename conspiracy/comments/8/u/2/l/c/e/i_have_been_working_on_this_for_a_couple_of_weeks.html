       Right. Just being a cop is a conspiracy, let alone all the fucked up shit they participate in. It is why cops are tested for stupidity. If you are working in "law enforcement" and you had half a brain and a moral compass you would kill yourself.

       when “good cops” don’t report what the bad cops are doing because of the Brotherhood in Blue, they are just as bad as the actual power abusers because they allow this perpetual battle to wage forward against the very people who pay their salaries and “pay” for their fancy toys.
      </p>
      <p>
       the whole justice system is a joke. it begins with incentivizing high crime rates so that the police can fund their departments, allowing them to be an integral part and the beginning of the cycle of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       it wouldn’t make sense the police would actually want to stop crime because that means no money and free drugs flowing into their pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       the vast amount of research that indicates that imprisoning people only adds to the problem and makes it worse for the youth who then turn to criminal activity INCREASING THE CRIME RATE is red flag number one and i don’t know how people can ignore this very basic fact.

       Yup! A 'good' cop that doesn't speak up against the 'bad' cops is just as bad! If they do, they get serpico'd. Ergo, no such thing as a good cop.

       I've had good and bad experiences with cops where i live.  Most of the 'bad' from when i was a stupid kid, or at least looked like one.  Most of the good later.  There's a lot of youth aggression towards police since there's a natural authority resistance in that age bracket.

       Dude.. you are the problem 😂. As soon as someone comments about a different experience with police than you have, you immediately pull the “you have white privilege” race card and go off on your own little victim mentality/ poor me rant lol. Grow a pair and stop being a fucking bully to people with different views that you. The whole “feel bad for me” thing gets really annoying to read.  People like YOU are DEFINITELY the problem bud :)

       You were saying...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         I don't buy into the whole white privilege nonsense.
        </em>
       </p>

      <p>
       Neither do I, FWIW.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, I suspect that further investigation would reveal that the astounding race and sex disparities shown above
       <em>
        (we didn't even touch on age groups)
       </em>
       in LEO actions/reactions is largely predicated on the
       <strong>
        <em>
         threat level as perceived by the LEO
        </em>
       </strong>
       , which in turn is based on
       <strong>
        A
       </strong>
       ) behavior of individuals;
       <strong>
        B
       </strong>
       ) situational conditions (location, time, activities of bystanders, etc), and;
       <strong>
        C
       </strong>
       ) prior history of interacting or witnessing interactions with persons that fall into various categories (as described above).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, utilizing such perceived parameters to assess potential threats in a given situation could be (and has been) called "prejudice" and "profiling" and "racism" and much worse, but it is an inherent part of nature - a survival instinct that is present not only in humans, but in most higher life forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consciously or subconsciously, we ALL make decisions based on similar assessments on a daily basis. EG: You are alone, returning to your car in a largely deserted parking garage late at night. The doors of two elevators open at the same time - both going UP - where you need to go. Inside one elevator are four young black men; in the other, are three elderly Asian women and two young children... Which group would you be inclined to
       <em>
        "join for the ride"?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, above you said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         "Perhaps your attitude is the problem."
        </em>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You're partially correct, but the reality is that judgements are NOT only based on the  "attitude" and behavior of any given individual, rather, they are -- and MUST ALSO BE -- based on the "typical" attitudes and behaviors of all others of your sex, race, age group, and more... as perceived by those with whom you and I and
       <em>
        all of us
       </em>
       interact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature sucks at being politically correct.

       That was a bit much. Not your comment obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sincerely, I believe you are very fortunate in regards to interactions with police. I have seen the local force's change in attitude over the past twenty years. The older guys tend to be polite to me, but in the past 15 years, I have only had a handful of positive or neutral interactions with them. The younger ones around here are very aggressive and tend to overstep their bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm told I look young for my age, but being called "son" or "kid" by cops in their twenties is usually a bad outlook for the interaction for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, the response to you was unwarranted. Though I must admit I'm jealous of your fortune with the topic!

       Yup! A 'good' cop that doesn't speak up against the 'bad' cops is just as bad! If they do, they get serpico'd. Ergo, no such thing as a good cop.
