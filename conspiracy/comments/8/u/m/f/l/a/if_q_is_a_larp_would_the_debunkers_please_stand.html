Trump has always been establishment in their experience, so anything connected to him is oligarchy. That is about the single solid rebuttal of note, for Q.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I&#39;ll step up.</p>

<p>Being intentionally vague, while also not&quot;commanding&quot; followers, the Qultists have become increasingly misled. What was once &quot;Where we go one, we go all&quot; has become &quot;Where we go one, all but anyone on the left side of the political spectrum goes&quot;.</p>

<p>Warping motivations has led to a demonizing of the entire democratic party and anyone who supports them, as if they were all complicit in a child trafficking ring. </p>

<p>Nevermind the fact that truly no promises have been kept, and the continual moving of the goalposts by followers, any reasoning and logic will not help them to see what is either a PSYOP or a troll. </p>

<p>This can become a dangerous &quot;faction&quot; (for lack of a better term), if the group becomes radicalized, seeing as how they view half of the country as enemies, who hope for a bitter pill that the democrats will suffer while trying to swallow (if it all comes true)</p>

<p>This is my own interpretation of the matter, also I&#39;d like to say <strong>I have no party affiliation</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for reading. I&#39;d love to know what you think about what I&#39;d said here, OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you! I seek out analyses of Q inconsistencies, to begin approaching equilibrium in this scenario. Saying &quot;if&quot; is merited but those I notice so far are not alarming. My open question is what harm is truly done? Isn&#39;t increased interest in American politics good? Some noobs are rabid anti-D, but maybe they&#39;re psych cases, which every sub culture harbors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that increased attention to the politics of America is a good thing. However, we need to watch out for polarization and us-vs-them mentalities. This is the main thing that both sides need to work on. If we can&#39;t work together then we have no hope. <em>And how can we work together if the other side insults and de-legitimizes the the other side?</em></p>

<p>I say they are free to do as they please, up until the point where they start planning violence against their domestic enemies <strong>(if this should ever be the case, which is doubtful)</strong></p>

This is the biggest obstacle I think people can&#39;t get past.  They go on the board, and they see one shill saying anti-Semetic things, and now in that person&#39;s mind, ALL of them are anti Semitic.  Q specifically states it&#39;s not about left vs right, and that some people on the right are just as guilty.  He said to watch people stepping down from public office, and not seeking reelection.  Also to keep an eye on CEO&#39;s CFO&#39;s, and other high level executives of major corporations.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without someone leading them, they are left to their own interpretations of vague phrases. More people means more of a chance of some radical joining up and taking a position to suggest things that others could agree with and follow. You can see this happening with the level of emotional language in their community today as opposed to several months ago. Give them a couple slogans such as &quot;These people are sick&quot; and &quot;There are no coincidences&quot; and you have a group that could see change in only one way: the rope</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great Awakening hasn&#39;t been a community for 7 months.  It started off on 4chan, then moved to the ocho.  Also on Reddit, there was CBTS and a couple other lesser known subs, and then GA became the main one.

    <div class="md"><p>Well..couple of things I guess.  First, Q actually said that.  That Obama would claim Kenyan citizenship.  I&#39;ll be the first to admit some of these things are hard to believe, don&#39;t get me wrong.<br/>
Second, that post doesn&#39;t have any hate for any democratic people.  These people are discussing with the presumption that it&#39;s A: It&#39;s true, B: the Q thing is real, and C: Obama did some bad stuff while in office.  There is some talk about capital punishment, but it&#39;s in the context of alleged crimes of treason against the united states.  Honestly, you could probably find much better examples to illustrate your point.  Lastly, again it&#39;s not about left vs right.  Disparaging Obama does not equal disparaging the democratic party.   There will be some people who take an extreme view in any group of people, of course.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Q specifically states it&#39;s not about left vs right</p>

<p>Q refers to Obama as &quot;Hussein.&quot;  Not exactly intended to appeal to Democrats.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about BHO, but imagine if a left-wing &quot;Z-anon&quot; appears, leaking Deep State secrets and professing to be &quot;saving the nation&quot; but calls Trump &quot;Donnie&quot; or something similarly intended to demean.  Q only seeks &quot;national unity&quot; under a right-wing agenda, and has zero loyalty to the U.S. Constitution, which is explicitly <em>anti-&quot;Trust Me&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>Q also lies.  <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/147146601/#147175452">Q says the Pentagon is &quot;not corrupt&quot;</a>, when the real truth is that <a href="http://archive.is/WjFaw">the Pentagon is connected to every Deep State event from JFK to 9/11 to Satan-worshipping child sex pedophile rings.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree it&#39;s not Democrat friendly.  However he&#39;s not singling him out for being a Democrat.  That&#39;s his actual middle name, Hussein.  While I see where you&#39;re going with your analogy, Q would have had to call him &quot;Barry&quot; or something.<br/>
To your quote, he doesn&#39;t specifically mention the Pentagon.  Other than that, I see a few entries regarding the Pentagon directly: He refers to the Pentagon audit (in a good light), he links an article about the Pentagon killing &quot;life log&quot;.<br/>
So this is interesting, you believe all of the stuff Q is talking about, but you have a problem with Q specifically?<br/>
Not being a dick, honestly I slept very well when Obama was in office.  In fact, if you asked me 4 years ago I wouldn&#39;t have said I was a Democrat.  If you pressed me and did the whole if I gave you a million dollars to choose a party, I would have chosen Democrat.  Now, not so much.  However, the thought of me referring to myself as a Republican is just so...ewww.  So take that for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, I&#39;ve been ignoring the whole Qanon thing for the better part of the last year.  I didn&#39;t know it had morphed into what you described.</p>

<p>I also have no party affiliation, and what I saw back then was promises that predictions would come true, with plenty of evidence at the time that Q was just giving out handjobs to his followers because if the predictions did come true, he&#39;d be some kind of savior/prophet.</p>

<p>The whole thing stunk of a charade.</p>

<p>Now, if it&#39;s a LARP, it should be presented as such.  I used to LARP in the 90s, and it&#39;s dangerous not to inform those not involved that it&#39;s simply a game.  In a LARP, there are in character and out of character actions.  So if it&#39;s a LARP and they&#39;re insisting it&#39;s real, then they deserve what they get.  Roleplaying is not meant to endanger people.</p>

<p>My current view is much as yours.  It&#39;s a either a psyop or a troll.  If I were a gambling man, I would bet on the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t that cognitive dissonance, when you&#39;re so invested in your world view that proof of the contrary would make you crack (at least temporarily)?</p>

<p>Nobody likes to be the butt of a joke.  That&#39;s why I keep searching for truth.  One source is just one source, and if you can&#39;t verify it, there&#39;s no telling if it&#39;s misinformation or not.  It&#39;s better to assume you&#39;re not getting the whole story and ask questions which will lead you to the real answers.</p>

<p>I know for many, reading an abstract is a chore.  Internet sleuths should study investigative journalism and ethics if they really want to get to the bottom of things.  &quot;Theories&quot; are great and all, but without any proof, it&#39;s not even a theory, but a hypothesis.  And I love this sub as much as the next person, but I don&#39;t stop with one post and consider it the end all, be all.  I find other sources and purposely look for contradictory reporting.  Then you can start to determine what is true and what is opinion and what is wishful thinking.</p>

We already know it&#39;s happening, this is just a way to make people look into things more. </p>

This is not that.</p>

<p>Also, there is a very anti-war vibe in Q. It is about neutering the deep state and allowing peaceful resolutions. Q is not friendly to warmongers or their profiteers. They are on the enemies list.</p>

It can be bad thing if it is done for the wrong reasons, and against the best interests of the people, as it has been many times in recent history.</p>

<p>However, regime change can be good if it is the will of the majority of the people and would be in their benefit. Hypothetically speaking, imagine that the government of Iran is in bed with TPTB/NWO whatever, and that they are oppressing the people. I know several Persians who came to the US during the Revolution, and they say that Iran was a much better place before all of this happened.</p>

<p>Finally, I think most of us can agree that we don&#39;t want boots on the ground, and we would like to intervene as little as possible, assuming regime change would actually be a good thing. </p>

<p>The U.S. has helped to overthrow so many democratically chosen regimes and then tells U.S. citizens that those regimes were communist dictatorships.  The truth is those leaders would not bend to the will of U.S. financial interests, so we call those interest &quot;national security concerns&quot; and then sell weapons to their enemies.  That&#39;s why ISIS exists in the first place.  We radicalized Islamic leaders in the 80s, and they&#39;ve been growing ever since.  Shit, Britain did the same thing to India by introducing Islam and then fomenting conflicts between them.  India was set back at least 100 years by the British Empire.  They stole their resources and destroyed their world trade.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t quite fair to use our past history of meddling as an example of the intentions of this administration if we are going about world peace in an entirely different fashion, is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is if you believe that it&#39;s the deep state and other unnamed groups running the show and not the administration or congress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, look at the people foaming at the mouth demanding impeachment right now - how much have they profited from war in their lifetimes? Christ, Bill and Bush are best buddies now that help each other with their damn socks! Pelosi, McCain, Feinstein. Why is anyone believing anything but the opposite of these warlord&#39;s opinions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  Hypocrites one and all.  They are all neocons and neoliberals.  Their foreign policy is identical (kill &#39;em all, put a puppet in place, make great deals for the oligarchy).  They only differ on domestic policy because that&#39;s the only thing Americans really pay attention to. Push identity politics on everyone, then watch your little puppets dance and fight with each other instead of realizing that the oligarchy is fucking everyone underneath them.  And if someone underneath is sufficiently powerful to make trouble, they either bring them into the fold, bribe, blackmail, or kill them (either professionally or literally).</p>

In the last post that I think was Assange posting as &quot;Q&quot;, he posted, &quot;will be offline&quot; in one of his messages. The next day, Assange&#39;s internet is cut, then, 2 days later, &quot;Q&quot; posted his page had been compromised so it was moved from where it had been for a while. And there were many ways that &quot;Q&quot; and Assange seemed to speak the same way. Also how he would tell people to dig in the Podesta stuff. He wouldn&#39;t just come out and say what <em>he</em> found.  It was just too many similarities and coincidences for me. Mainly the internet being cut and his page having to move. That is a big one to me. Then add that over the past few months, a lot of people have said the content is different, people are trying to profit from it, people are coming out saying that it is a group of people posting shit, etc.... Nothing like this had happened until Assange&#39;s internet was cut. I think people knew it was him and once they realized he wasn&#39;t coming back online, they took it over. </p>
