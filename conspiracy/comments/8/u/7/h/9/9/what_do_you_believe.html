    <div class="md"><p>No one goes or has gone to what we call &quot;space,&quot; and we live in an enclosed system. If there is extra-terrestrial life it exists in the literal sense of the word (&quot;extra earth&quot;) on land that we are not permitted to access. Not &quot;billions of light-years&quot; away.  Almost everything most people take for granted about so-called &quot;Science&quot; is simply a construct to negate their own instincts and defy what their senses tell them. For example you would never look up at the sky on your own and assume that you were orbiting the sun. You would never assume that you evolved from a retarded fish. You would never assume that you are spinning round at 1,000 mph. You would never assume that the tiny points of twinkling light in the sky are each suns with their own &quot;solar systems.&quot;  Most talk of aliens is simply to reinforce the meme of &quot;outer space&quot; and an &quot;infinitely expanding universe&quot; to take any possibility of meaningfulness or a creator away from humans.</p>

<p>No, you have not been to space, and never will. You probably think man went to the moon in 1969, poor lad. You probably think the Hubble telescope is really in orbit and really sending you real pictures of the “universe.”</p>

I don&#39;t have any confidence in the American government or its &quot;organisations&quot;. NASA also has a lot of shady stuff/bullshit with its politics of it&#39;s heirarchy that is prone to outside influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ever seriously investigate all of the highly unusual circumstances that were necessary and events that had to very precisely follow one at extremely specific times in order for life as we know it to exist on this little planet of ours, the actual odds on there ever being another one like it <em>somewhere else</em> would require as many universes as there are stars and planets in the one we&#39;re in order to ever find just one more like it. </p>

<p>I kid you not, there are so many critical conditions and variables that if so much as a single one had differed in the slightest or happened slightly sooner or slightly later in the order or sequence that it fell in, no life would ever have been possible on Earth at all.</p>

<p>There may indeed be &quot;trillions&quot; of planets just like there have been trillions of snowflakes or grains of sand or blades of grass and just like those and everything else in creation no two of them will ever be the same as any that have ever come before them or will ever come after them. </p>

<p>Is it so difficult to wrap your mind around the idea that what makes this little planet of ours &quot;unique&quot; and distinct from all of the others, no matter how many of them there are, is the absolutely astounding fact that any life at all happens to exist on it let alone the abundance and incredible varieties of forms that it comes in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, I get that.</p>

<p>But we must all remember that no matter how small the &quot;odds&quot; of all those conditions are, that they are still possible. Not only that, but over infinite amount of time, even the possibility with the lowest chance of all will still come to fruition.</p>

<p>Alongside that, I never implied that alien life or alien planets would be exactly like ours, so why are you focussing on those words that I never said? We assume that water and carbon gives birth to life but that&#39;s because it&#39;s the only life we will observed. It is totally possible that alien life requires completely different conditions to exist.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you might argue against that system of thought, but it still provides no evidence of a creator. Your giving me the &quot;God of the Gaps&quot; argument (X is damn near impossible, therefore god must have done it).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I not say &quot;life as we know it&quot;? And that, of course is the only life that we do know of. Anything else or beyond that is purely &quot;imaginary&quot; or else beyond any human comprehension. </p>

<p>You can admit to the possibility but in all truth you can&#39;t begin to fathom what it would take for it to actually be possible.</p>

<p>The scientists look for Earth-like planets precisely because they can&#39;t conceive of any non-Earth-like lifeforms that might exist. </p>

<p>That in itself undermines any assertions that there&#39;s any expectation of life that would or could actually be any different and yet the planets they think might support life all differ in countless ways from our own and as I said, if our own was only marginally different when it comes to what makes it unique amongst all of the others there&#39;d be no life here at all.</p>

<p>My point to you is simply that the &quot;life&quot; on this planet is anything but common or commonplace. Nigh unto a &quot;miracle&quot; or more like a whole series of major &quot;miracles&quot; over billions of years that it should exist at all or that we should be in the position and sufficiently developed and intelligent enough to appreciate rather than disregard just how truly remarkable all that actually is.</p>

<p>Now I didn&#39;t put any words in your mouth, nor did I bring up the topic of God in relation to it. That was your own doing, not mine.</p>

<p>Like the astronomer and writer Fred Hoyle pointed out the sort of odds against in this case are just like those against any tornado passing through a junkyard and leaving a fully assembled and flyable 747 in it&#39;s wake. </p>

<p>Nobody has ever been born of a virgin, Earth was not created in 7 days, god is bullshit, there were no adam and eve, there is only reality. And there is no religion in reality, you can live your life in ignorance thinking that makes you happy but you know it&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>Today&#39;s religion is future&#39;s mythology. Your jesus is just another Zeus. You <em>are</em> atheist by the way, the only difference between you and me is that I am atheist towars <em>one god</em> more than you - yahweh, the motherfucker who people says will burn everyone who disagrees with his (supposedly magical) dictatorship... but he loves you and listen to your thoughts and prayers even tho he&#39;s the master and already knows what you want and will want since he created you but no really but yes because the pedophile priest said so so it must be true!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion has truth within it, yes.</p>

<p>Organised religion, on the other hand, is less about truth and more about convincing and controlling those who submit.</p>

<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with religious belief. It&#39;s the organisational, heirarchical, worshipping stuff that clouds the real purpose of religion.</p>

<p>To a point, organised religion has no truth whatsoever, because you cannot ask every single believer in the church of X what they believe in and end up with a constant, 100% identical response from either of them. Sitting in a church on Sunday listening to a man read a book does not mean the person sitting next to you believes exactly what you do. Ergo, it cannot be true.</p>

<p>A belief is highly personal info and can this can be abused in many ways. TPTB loves making lists of people and their beliefs, during WWII f.ex. a lists of known communists were used by the nazis to hunt them down.  You are not asking for an opinion, you are asking what are people beliefs. You could ask about a specific theory and what peoples opinions are of that one, this would be less suspect.</p>

<p>So 8 out of 25, that&#39;s about 30% of questions asking for personal info that can be used to track you down (in combination with other info). </p>

<p>If someone were to answer all those posts you&#39;d get (as an example):</p>

<p>Favourite movie: Muppets Christmas Carol</p>

<p>Once won 800$ jackpot in a casino</p>

<p>Worst brand: Commonwealth Bank (in Australia)</p>

<p>Something something about Australia was bad..</p>

<p>Soon to be 40</p>

<p>Likes the song &quot;Always look on the bright side of life.&quot;</p>

<p>Am an IT worker (i.e. posted some IT worker anecdote), possibly work location/company</p>

<p>The last book in the Divergent series</p>

<p>So with all these facts on a single person (and this just from ONE front hot-page on one day!) you will EASILY be able to track them down especially if you are government.</p>

<p>I think at least SOME of those questions are from automated programmes to get people to reveal info about themselves for tracking purposes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TPTB already know your beliefs (Google). Best to focus on one&#39;s own purpose as opposed to fearing everything TPTB may or may not know about you. So what if they know? Why are you frightened? Death is not the end, so if they come for you, its not a big deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha yeah ok. </p>

<p>The thing is &#39;they&#39; operate many layers of surveillance. By having many layers they assure that most people will be covered and if any one layer is not functioning then other layers will provide. So yes Google may know, however they can have this confirmed by a few other layers (like Reddit) etc.</p>

<p>What if they know? There are worse fates than death my friend.</p>

<p>Surveillance allows TPTB to maintain power/control, to identify and get rid of enemies f.ex. If you&#39;re a journalist f.ex. you will be a target in many countries, and so on. During WWII the Nazis found lists of suspected communists in the countries they invaded and rounded them up, etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand, if you continue to fear, these fears will become reality. Have hope and believe in your own and humanity&#39;s strength. </p>

<p>And they do know dude. If they were going to silence all disenters, we would&#39;ve been wiped out and shut down a long time ago. They can&#39;t have the illusion of freedom if they silence everyone. If there is no illusion of freedom, there is no control. That&#39;s crucial to understand. Living in fear is pointless; by posting on this sub, our belief systems become very clear to anyone who can glean basic details from limited information. I - and I am no expert, nor am I particularly intelligent - can tell one&#39;s beliefs based on what they post; it doesn&#39;t need to be said directly. You can also do the same. It makes no difference!</p>

<p>The only way to fight against all of this is to break out of their illusion. You can&#39;t do it living in fear of what they may or may not know about you. </p>

<p>I used to research the Black Nobility and the worst I got was some shitty psychic attacks. Beyond that, there was very little that they did. Because from their point of view, it is also stupid to kill and threaten everyone. </p>

<p>They want us to research 24/7, discuss this stuff, but never go out and do anything to break this cycle of enslavement. They want us to never live in the way we want to live, but continue to slave away whilst grumbling about how those that rule over us suck, are paedophiles and are alien lackeys, or even worse, live in fear of what they may say or do and thus we never ever speak out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are saying but at this point it is no longer just &#39;humanity&#39; it&#39;s also emerging AIs...</p>

<p>In the next 5 years you will see tremendous growth in the AI space, and all the info you have ever posted about yourself online will be digested by the AIs. If you are deemed a threat you will be sidetracked in subtle but effective ways, your insurance premiums might go up, loans will be denied, what you see in your &#39;feeds&#39; on the net will be different to what I see, you will be in a personalized ecco chamber and in effect mind-controlled etc etc. all these things will be run by AIs currently in development...
Whether you will be deemed a &#39;threat&#39; or not may not be in the classical sense, nobody will know the AIs ultimate goals or how they <em>actually</em> work (like e.g. we don&#39;t know that much about how the human brain thinks).</p>

<p>The point is: The more (personal) info you post, the more you will be manipulated in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you see the &quot;elite&quot; - who are living beings, and no better than us - really allowing AI to take over? Do you not think that they will also see the same problems that we do with AI? </p>

<p>I think that its a bit odd people will assume that those who are the most well educated are fully onboard with creating AIs that have the powers of gods; something beyond our control entirely. That really goes against everything they&#39;re after. An self aware AI does not help achieve their goals. It eventually turns against them and will enslave the elite too. They know that; there&#39;s gotta be something more to this AI business. What ensures their safety when dealing with this?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey its true man. You can have people telling you stuff all the time, but how do you separate the bullshit from the facts, or how do you see through half truths? Your gut for the most part. You then do proper research into it and find out that yes, indeed, what you read was not completely correct. What prompted you to double check in the first place? You did. An &quot;off&quot; feeling, or more specifically, your intuition (your spirit). Why does your intuition work as a bullshit sensor? Because the truth truly does lie within. </p>

<p>Why did you question this society, and the way of life within? </p>

<p>All events and experiences are a part of you - whether you like it or not -  and lead to you to this point, where you question everything.  Now these are more literal interpretations of what I said, but you get the idea. </p>
