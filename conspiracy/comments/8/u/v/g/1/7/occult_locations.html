    <div class="md"><p>NorCal is a center of power for the occult.  San Francisco has the Bohemian Grove building.  Pelosi owns Goat Hill Pizza, on a hill not called Goat Hill.  The Presidio is where Aquino did his dirt.  LeVay eventually had his Church of Satan in SF.</p>

<p>Sonoma County has the actual Bohemian Grove.  The airstrip just off River Road (on Airport Rd) is a notorious trafficking spot, mere miles from the Grove.  (You reading this NSA, etc?  Yea, we know.  And we watch.)</p>

<p>Napa County is well-known for having a corrupt CPS system, and once housed the Church of Satan and Anton LeVey&#39;s mansion (in a small unincorporated area called &quot;Sanitorium.&quot;  The Rothschild&#39;s have a winery called Opus One, right in the middle of the valley, and it is a sunken pyramid missing the capstone.</p>

<p>Esalen Institute is up here too, a known CIA-cult-New Age operation.  A lot of the 60&#39;s music scene people ended up in NorCal too, Wavy Gravy runs a huge compound for example.  Not saying all them are occult, just likely that some are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to Google it for more details, there is a ridiculous number of missing persons cases, and the states are on top of the list for highest amount of serial murders, highest amount of UFO sightings, it has the highest amount of depression and mental illness, but aside from the various social complaints...Let&#39;s get into the bizarre occult and secretive phenomena..</p>

<p>You have Bohemian Grove in NorCal in the region famous for MK-ULTRA(And all the shady business around it), the LSD culture(I&#39;ll touch back on that in a second)</p>

<p>Oculus Anbuis, Bohemia City, Bohemia Mountain(as well as numerous locations named after this place) in Oregon. Across this state you have countless owl statues, owl imagery(Funny enough, in my town, David Lynch who later went on to make Twin Peaks with the famous &quot;Owls are not what they seem&quot; motif actually filmed a movie called Dune with some of the actors from Twin Peaks. In my town, we have owl totem poles, owl statues, the outskirts of our town is called &quot;Minerva&quot;, we have things like &quot;Bull Island&quot;, I have countless screenshots of strange features in weird nook/crannies of the city like &quot;abandoned&quot; stages in the middle of a grove tucked away in the forests of Minerva, I have screenshots of so, so many businesses with over occult themes and symbols, and my list just keeps growing..I had a job that allowed me to get a window into the inner workings of the town and see first hand where and how the big money moves, and it was always within the regions and associations I&#39;m talking about..Within my workplace, we had numerous people who went to famous owl themed Universities(I would prefer not to get into too much detail for my own sake), we had owls everywhere, the number &quot;18&quot; everywhere, 18 windows, hexagram shaped drains, pentagram awards, the people who ran the business were all deeply involved with everything from the Freemasons to the Soroptomists, The Elks and the Moose Lodges, nearby synagogues....This same county where all this is was where Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters home, as well as the stomping grounds for the Grateful Dead. I honestly have so much more to say on this place, but this is getting extreme, so I&#39;ll wait. My point is that the established, rich hands in my area alone are super awake to the occult, like more than I ever saw when I lived in other states by far.</p>

<p>This whole region was where the &quot;Gold Rush&quot; went down, and countless rich hands from Bohemia traveled out to get rich. Bohemia is where the Illuminati originated(Hence the owl symbols and common names like Bohemia and other more obscure occult symbols and motifs that I won&#39;t bother getting into but are also found freakin&#39; everywhere). Families like the Trumps first traveled out here to make their fortunes. They were involved with all of the secretive societies like the &quot;Synagogues&quot; and Freemasons. Trump for example ran a brothel and lied about his family&#39;s history for a very long time. (His family that moved out here by the way all married Jews and moved to Jewish neighborhood in New York, being from Bavaria and being Jewish, hence Trump&#39;s great grandmother Katherina <em>Kober,</em> puts them in the same region, time and &quot;religious&quot; group that formed the foundation of the Rothschild global banking system and Zionism, which explains the numerous awards that the Trump and his father have won for their work supporting the creation and maintenance of Israel..)I&#39;m not trying to pick on Trump or the &#39;Jews&#39; in particular, it&#39;s just a good example of how the money and powers were getting involved with this region from it&#39;s very inception, laying the ground works for what&#39;s happening now..</p>

<p>Like everything from Silicon Valley to the major tech hub in Seattle, Washington. It&#39;s the hub of this new tech beast, coincidentally. For a very long time, the West Coast has been seen as the cesspool for all things New-Age, mysterious, overly regulative, modern, etc. Hence Californiazation, etc. With the sprawling nature from NorCal to Alaska, it&#39;s the perfect home for the shady....</p>

<p>I&#39;ll stop myself now, but can keep going on if you want to discuss further...This place is outrageous...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, that would be awesome!  I found your post super interesting and it would just be cool to see the photos.  Especially the ones with abandoned stuff in the Forrest’s (even in a non-conspiracy way that sounds cool because the pacnw is beautiful In a haunting way).</p>

<p>Your post also made me think of an old NatGeo magazine from the 70’s I inherited in my grandparents collection, it had an article about the Oregon coast and a bit of interview with Keesey.  The photo spread was him looking out a window on the foggy coast and said something like “There are spirits in this place, you can feel them and see them.”</p>

<p>Obviously on the surface it references native Americans, and I do wonder how much the owls may have to do with them rather than Minerva, but it adds a new layer when I read your post.</p>

<p>Anyway, cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, I&#39;m pretty familiar with the tribes(There&#39;s another interesting conspiracy theory regarding them..The rich ones are powerful and are not usually very much related to the natives to put it simply..) and the owl symbolizes &quot;death&quot; up here! That was how I first saw it, which seemed pretty freaky, but once I saw the district outside the city called &quot;Minerva&quot;(which remember, in mythology is symbolized with an owl, but there are also other symbolically named places in town, all other symbols of Moloch coincidentally), it was like perfect timing because at the time, I was learning about some other stuff that made me go off on a hunch and investigate further. That was when I noticed that within my county, there is a &quot;Bohemia Mountain&quot; and an abandoned ghost mining town with local urban legends around it called &quot;Bohemia City&quot;, and like I was saying, a lot of nearby schools, libraries, etc are named &quot;Bohemia&quot;, after seeing so many owls associated with the town elite, I took special interest to the giant owl totem pole I had been seeing in front of the Elk&#39;s Lodge(And there are other, smaller ones conspicuously placed throughout the city). By the way, the street with the pole and lodge are on a really suspicious street with other business with occultist mystical symbols that seem to be aligned with each other, addresses, etc, but that&#39;s probably a story for another time. There are many other streets, buildings, mascots, whatever like it. It all seems to point to Moloch.. This county I live in is the largest, most populated one north of San Francisco where the Moloch/Owl worship goes down at Bohemian Grove, the celebratory event of the Bohemia Club..There are some really rich and famous people living here..And the population is not at all large, it&#39;s just apparently a popular spot to hang out or retire. I can draw so many connections from this city and the owl symbol to a much larger secretive society...It&#39;s so interesting you say that quote from Kesey, I&#39;d never heard it before, but coincidentally, David Lynch who filmed Dune(My town has so many posters of this movie) here, went on to make Twin Peaks, and in it they this about the woods of the PNW: &quot; There&#39;s a sort of evil out there. Something very, very strange in these old woods. Call it what you want. A darkness, a presence. It takes many forms but... its been out there for as long as anyone can remember and we&#39;ve always been here to fight it.&quot;. Coincidentally, the &quot;bad guy&quot; of the show is named Bob, which according to the writer is derived from Ba&#39;al, which is another name associated with Moloch...(By the way, speaking of street or building names, MLK also means Moloch, I kid you not)...<br/>
Another strange coincidence was after I posted that comment earlier, there was an episode of X-Files on BBC America that I was watching where they were talking about how the major villainous aliens had a secret space ship cloaked in the woods of Oregon. Just an odd coincidence if you ask me!  </p>

<p>By the way, the pictures I&#39;m sending aren&#39;t going to be very epic or breathtaking...Just crappy narrowly framed pictures, but I do have a lot of great photos of the beauty out here...It&#39;s both majestic, and as Kerouac later referred to it as in Big Sur, sinister. I felt it the first night I moved out here...It&#39;s completely mysterious and you can feel it in the air like nowhere else I&#39;ve been before. I&#39;ve never shared this story before, so I feel compelled to talk a lot, sorry about that hahaha.</p>

<p>By the way, sorry to keep you hanging, I&#39;m getting a lot of the pictures together, but I have literally thousands and thousands to sort through, and I want to make sure I&#39;m not missing anything, so probably in the next half our or hour I&#39;ll have the album ready.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Beverly Hills, Ca. </p>

<p>There are pyramid capstone sculptures at the entrance of the biggest talent agencies in Hollywood.</p>

<p>I’ve seen pyramid / capstones / checkerboard floors / Masonic design all over the homes in the most exclusive areas of Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>At the CAA headquarters in Century City bordering Beverly Hills there is a pyramid eye capstone in the layout of the building design which you can see from above (google it)</p>

<p>These things are out in the open however I’m still not privy to the insider treatment. </p>

<p>The secret club Masonic stuff still seems to be amongst just the top teir of the industry but if you recognize occult symbology you notice all over Los Angeles &amp; Beverly Hills studios, talent agencies, production companies &amp; homes of the super rich here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like <strong>real occult</strong> (since you mention England) as in <em>henges</em> and <em>mounds</em>?  That would be the Mississippi Delta and the old south.  Louisiana has the oldest mound and henge sites in the USA (look up Poverty Point) which are contemporary to Stonehenge and some of the other Neolithic sites around the world.</p>

<p>Or if you mean like modern occult mason shit, probably DC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Detroit has a lot...old stuff, from the 1900s-30s...lots of Spiritualist meetings around the city documented by books and newspaper archives of the time. Aleister Crowley visited in the old Park-Davis pharmaceutical company, on the banks of the Detroit River, during one of his 2-3 visits to Detroit. The Baphomet statue installed in 2015 by the Satanic Temple (more a political group, but still), etc.. Otherwise I&#39;d bet my money on Los Angeles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes, I&#39;m pretty familiar with the tribes(There&#39;s another interesting conspiracy theory regarding them..The rich ones are powerful and are not usually very much related to the natives to put it simply..) and the owl symbolizes &quot;death&quot; up here! That was how I first saw it, which seemed pretty freaky, but once I saw the district outside the city called &quot;Minerva&quot;(which remember, in mythology is symbolized with an owl, but there are also other symbolically named places in town, all other symbols of Moloch coincidentally), it was like perfect timing because at the time, I was learning about some other stuff that made me go off on a hunch and investigate further. That was when I noticed that within my county, there is a &quot;Bohemia Mountain&quot; and an abandoned ghost mining town with local urban legends around it called &quot;Bohemia City&quot;, and like I was saying, a lot of nearby schools, libraries, etc are named &quot;Bohemia&quot;, after seeing so many owls associated with the town elite, I took special interest to the giant owl totem pole I had been seeing in front of the Elk&#39;s Lodge(And there are other, smaller ones conspicuously placed throughout the city). By the way, the street with the pole and lodge are on a really suspicious street with other business with occultist mystical symbols that seem to be aligned with each other, addresses, etc, but that&#39;s probably a story for another time. There are many other streets, buildings, mascots, whatever like it. It all seems to point to Moloch.. This county I live in is the largest, most populated one north of San Francisco where the Moloch/Owl worship goes down at Bohemian Grove, the celebratory event of the Bohemia Club..There are some really rich and famous people living here..And the population is not at all large, it&#39;s just apparently a popular spot to hang out or retire. I can draw so many connections from this city and the owl symbol to a much larger secretive society...It&#39;s so interesting you say that quote from Kesey, I&#39;d never heard it before, but coincidentally, David Lynch who filmed Dune(My town has so many posters of this movie) here, went on to make Twin Peaks, and in it they this about the woods of the PNW: &quot; There&#39;s a sort of evil out there. Something very, very strange in these old woods. Call it what you want. A darkness, a presence. It takes many forms but... its been out there for as long as anyone can remember and we&#39;ve always been here to fight it.&quot;. Coincidentally, the &quot;bad guy&quot; of the show is named Bob, which according to the writer is derived from Ba&#39;al, which is another name associated with Moloch...(By the way, speaking of street or building names, MLK also means Moloch, I kid you not)...<br/>
Another strange coincidence was after I posted that comment earlier, there was an episode of X-Files on BBC America that I was watching where they were talking about how the major villainous aliens had a secret space ship cloaked in the woods of Oregon. Just an odd coincidence if you ask me!  </p>

<p>By the way, the pictures I&#39;m sending aren&#39;t going to be very epic or breathtaking...Just crappy narrowly framed pictures, but I do have a lot of great photos of the beauty out here...It&#39;s both majestic, and as Kerouac later referred to it as in Big Sur, sinister. I felt it the first night I moved out here...It&#39;s completely mysterious and you can feel it in the air like nowhere else I&#39;ve been before. I&#39;ve never shared this story before, so I feel compelled to talk a lot, sorry about that hahaha.</p>

<p>By the way, sorry to keep you hanging, I&#39;m getting a lot of the pictures together, but I have literally thousands and thousands to sort through, and I want to make sure I&#39;m not missing anything, so probably in the next half our or hour I&#39;ll have the album ready.</p>
