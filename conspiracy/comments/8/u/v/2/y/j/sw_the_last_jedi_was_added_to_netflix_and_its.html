       The last time this happened we lost star reviews and got stuck with the thumb up/thumb down system. I wouldn't be surprised to see some kind of aftermath if the 1 star reviews keep pouring in. I'd at least expect some press about the "vocal minority" back at it again (damn daniel).

       Nice, thanks. I didn’t like that movie at all. But I think it’s an interesting case study of the divide between fans and critics. The disparity between the two in this instance may have broken the faith so many place in the coveted rotten tomatoes score. It’s telling how nearly every Disney movie receives a fresh rating despite the content of the film. It’s just another form of mainstream media manipulation. Through rotten tomatoes we are being told what we enjoy. It is only through avenues such as this Netflix user scoring that we are allowed to see how people really think about a film. Thanks for sharing.

       Got an IM today from a friend who finally watched it. He was like, "OK, I heard it was bad but this was horrible. Just horrible. Like the director handed the script to his kid to write and his kid hated his dad and was sick of Star Wars so he tried to ruin it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Disney's Lucasfilm is in full-fledged meltdown. All the side movies stopped. Indiana Jones 5 pulled from the schedule. Perhaps next we'll see Spielberg's arrest? Clock's ticking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like some kid who hated his dad got to write the script and wanted to destroy everything

       Yeah this movie is getting shredded because it objectively sucked ass. It had nothing to do with "subverting expectations" or "promoting feminism", it was just a very poorly made film.

       Sorry but that's naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad movies happen but does anybody seriously believe the changes in TFA and TLJ were unintended mistakes? Disney didn't spent 4B USD that some "feminist" at Lucasfilm would have the chance for an
       <em>
        uncontrolled
       </em>
       ego trip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who hasn't grown up with SW and would have developed an idea of what worked and what not that personal self correction during production shouldn't have stopped the worst mistakes?
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO K. Kennedy just executed the decided strategy. Disney is run/works for the social engineers. With Star Wars and Marvel they just bought the tools to implement their goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general goal is to destroy and rebuild the structure of the western societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As "meta" as this sounds but what is Star Wars? One of the most important modern myths which influenced the mind of mostly juvenile (white but not exclusive) males. It provided the archetypes of heroes fighting successful against the "the empire", an authoritarian system.
      </p>
      <p>
       People in these movies had a moral code. SW is like a modern Merlin/Arthur, Norse gods or Nibelung tale which created the background for the western civilisations.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you destroy these kind of memes and archetypes? By completely subverting them and destroy the essence for the intended audience. People should really look closely at the archetypes Disney created with their SW movies. These aren't accidents.

       Don't get me wrong.  I am 100&amp;#37; aware of Disney's brainwashing agenda, and Star Wars is definitely part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't think the movie sucked because of its message or themes.  I think the movie sucked because the acting was terrible, the script made no sense, the humor was off point, the special effects were poorly executed, and the cinematography boring as hell.  It was just a bad movie all around.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're right, it wasn't a mistake.  They made it bad on purpose.  Their intent right now is to drive out the established Star Wars fanbase (almost everyone), and encourage the formation of a new fanbase that will eat up anything they make simply because it offers a feeling of moral superiority.  They don't want anyone thinking critically about what they're doing.  The SJW stuff is just a defense mechanism.  If someone says the movie is bad, they're immediately labeled a racist/sexist/whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully it looks like this experiment failed, but it's unfortunate that Star Wars had to die in the process.

       Had a laugh reading this...when TFA came out, I wrote this post on r/movies that strangely disappeared without any notice from mods that it violated rules. Warning: it's pretty long
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm writing this post for the true fans who may have had their hearts ripped out by the latest travesty: Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I recently revisited the original, theatrical trilogy for the first time in many years, as an adult with maturity and fresh eyes that changed my experience and gave me a renewed interpretation that I'd like to share with you. Now, I'm not presenting this as the definitive, intended meaning behind Star Wars but simply the way I have internalized it and the way its message has revealed itself to me, personally.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Star Wars was more than a space opera. It was more than special effects and elaborate costume design. It was an experience and like all great stories, it was rooted deeply in allegory, with many layers of subtext to be interpreted by the viewer, if they choose. We're introduced to our protagonist, Luke Skywalker, on a desert farm planet, working as a farm hand to his uncle who raised him. We see his dissatisfaction and desire to escape his mundane life for bigger and better things as he longingly gazes over the plains at the distant suns of Tatooine.
       <br/>
       From this information, we can draw parallels to the end of the agrarian culture of our grandparents and great-grandparents and the rise of the Industrial Revolution. The desire for a "better life," to trade our self-reliance and survival for the entertainment and comfort of a more "advanced" civilization. We reject the hard work and sacrifice of our ancestors just as Luke complains to Uncle Owen about doing his chores.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The theme of "chance" is prevalent throughout the series but for this instance, we'll focus largely on A New Hope. The idea behind the philosophy of "chance" or "luck" is mysterious and part of the universal energy we take for granted. Initially we see that Uncle Owen doesn't even want to purchase R2-D2, which would result in he and C-3PO being split up and concluding our hero's story before it begins. Seemingly, by sheer chance, the R2 unit that was intended to be purchased is damaged and malfunctions on the spot. This crucial moment is overlooked by all characters involved because in the immediate future, it holds no true significance and yet, this one circumstantial event alters the course of every single person's life that is involved.
       <br/>
       When R2 runs off and leads Luke to Obi Wan's home, we hear of the "Rebellion versus the Empire" for the first time. Obi Wan even describes the conflict as "some damn fool idealistic crusade." leading us to believe that this battle is about some moral virtue and righteousness. He explains what The Force is, that it is an energy field created by ALL living things that binds us together and that a Jedi is a being who is in tune with this life force, that they embody and harness it's power for good.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The political subtext regarding the Empire is laid out pretty clearly in dialog. Grand Moff Tarkin indicates that the last remnants of the Imperial Senate have been swept away, leading us to believe that the Empire's goal is galactic dominance or, in our reality, a one-world government. The tool of this Empire is largely found to be technology. We hear Darth Vader instruct another general not to "be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed" and that "the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of The Force." This would indicate the underestimation of SPIRITUAL power in the face of technological power. "I find your lack of FAITH disturbing." These men believe in nothing more than worldly power, they've rejected the idea that there is something bigger than themselves in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       When Luke is confronted with the choice to leave Tatooine, which we are shown VERY clearly is his primary desire, to help Obi Wan in fighting this New Galactic Order, Luke makes excuses that are extremely reminiscent of citizens in our own political climate. "I'm not going to Alderaan, I've got work to do. It's not that I LIKE the Empire, I hate it but...there's just nothing I can do about it right now." Suddenly, the character is submissive and rejects the idea that he has personal responsibility to fight for his beliefs.
When Luke and Obi Wan find the Jawa cruiser and they have been slaughtered, Obi Wan advises him that Sand People are NOT responsible for this attack..."but we are meant to think they did." This reference to a "false flag" attack that could just as easily have been written off as an unfortunate and unpredictable incident. When Luke finds that his family has been murdered by these same powers and that he has lost everything, he realizes that all the things he thought were more important than standing up to this power, are meaningless. This is the catalyst that drives the hero to fulfill a destiny that he isn't even aware of but the factors behind it are CHOICE and the realization that your choices can be stripped away by fate.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       The element of perceived chance is most notable in the film's primary character objective, the destruction of the Death Star. We're told how difficult this mission will be to the point that Wedge Antilles comments in the briefing room "that's IMPOSSIBLE, even for a computer!" This shot is emphasized as something that can only be executed with extreme precision and as Obi Wan tells us..."in my experience, there's no such thing as luck."
When the rebels attack the Death Star, many pilots are killed, including some of Luke's friends (IIRC), there is loss of life and people are voluntarily sacrificing themselves in what Han describes as "suicide" due to the seemingly impossible nature of confronting such advanced and precise weaponry. Yet, in another instance of chance, the humble Rebel spacecrafts are "too small" for the targeting computers to be effective, giving the Rebels just one, little glimmer of hope (I wouldn't even call it advantage).
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       When Luke switches off his targeting computer, members of the Alliance question whether he is okay. As I watched the film this time, I tried to imagine one of those big, round light-stopper games in game rooms, where one light spins around in a giant circle and depending on when you hit the button, you can win a measly prize or hit the jackpot when you get it JUST right. The numbers on the targeting computer quickly dialing down to ZERO and sounding an alarm when it estimates that you should pull the trigger.
Luke switching off his computer is the equivalent of trying to hit the jackpot in one of those games, with a blindfold on and...oh yea, if you don't hit it the first time...every single person you know will die. Pretty high stakes to go out on a limb and use "feelings" to get the shot off; but this is the whole point. Our intuition, our gut feelings, these things are gifts from a consciousness that we are all connected to. Things we can tap into when we are open and allow ourselves to be used as a vessel for good.
       <br/>
       Han shows up just in time to give Luke the split second of relief and confidence he needs to get this "one in a million" shot off, proving that no matter what the odds, no matter how hopeless it looks for the underdog to stand up to the power structure...sometimes all it takes is one stone to be cast that can crumble an Empire. Our technology and everything that we think we KNOW is irrelevant to the concept of our spiritual and conscious selves. Darth Vader turned to the dark side because he chose to use his powers of intuition and spiritual connection for worldly power, essentially "selling his soul."
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       All these reasons and more, are what made Star Wars such a powerful experience in my opinion. When philosophical and spiritual concepts meet art, it can be powerful and penetrate so much of what we see, because deep down, it speaks to our human consciousness. This concept is what has been missing in every iteration since and has been ABSOLUTELY dissolved in the newest film. Star Wars is about our appreciation of the natural world and our ability to defend against it's destruction by political and corporate powers (this is what I believe all the Trade Federation disputes are referencing in the prequel trilogy). The Force is a manifestation of the gifts that we all have when we allow ourselves to reach that true potential and reverence.

       Unfortunately, they want to change the character to Indiana Joan so I don’t have much faith that Indiana Jones will be treated any differently than Star Wars.

       Yeahhhhh......I'm not buying any of this, no affront to you. Let's read between the lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's ONE source for Jonathan Kasdan being hired to replace David Koepp: Collider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collider's source? No one they'll say. "Multiple sources." In other words: Nobody who would go on the record. At a moment when Lawrence Kasdan's kid is seeing his career in flames after "Solo"'s catastrophic failure at the box office, causing the whole "Star Wars" franchise to be re-examined by Disney.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://collider.com/indiana-jones-5-jonathan-kasdan/#images">
        http://collider.com/indiana-jones-5-jonathan-kasdan/#images
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This reeks of desperation. Here's a more likely scenario: Kasdan gets two friends to float this rumor--because that's all it is--so Collider gets dual sources and can say "multiple." They actually don't give a shit if it's true or not, because they know it will bring a bazillion clicks. Other publications like Variety then run with it because it's been reported elsewhere and they want the clicks too and can't afford to lose them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you want to know the reason Variety didn't report it to begin with, which would've been the Hollywood publication of choice? Because the story probably got floated to them first and they didn't believe it and the gossip had to move its way down the food chain. Past the #2 choice, Hollywood Reporter, and the #3 choice Deadline.com. Collider is maybe top ten.
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw this exact same scenario play out a couple weeks ago when Jared Leto saw his Joker role slipping away. There were a ton of stories about
       <em>
        two
       </em>
       Joker movies getting made, that Leto was going to star in and produce one, and so on. Then the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       story drops a few days later: New Joker movie with Joaquin Phoenix. And then a couple days after there's news of Leto actually being cast in some Marvel vampire movie (that probably won't get made either, but helps Leto save a little face).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all desperate maneuvering by insecure fucked up narcissists trying to cling to a last piece of driftwood, not really understanding they're all about to get swept over a waterfall.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Indiana Joan, I can't imagine them being so stupid to try and turn the next Indiana Jones into a woman after the Lara Croft reboot tanked. And the female Ghostbusters tanked. And "The Force is Female" Star Wars spin tanked. And Hillary Clinton tanked.

       I’m not sure about Kasdan. I’ll have to check my links but my point was that the movie hasn’t been placed on hold. It’s supposed to start shooting in 2019.

       I'll reach, for OP: Cultural Marxism cannot be critiqued out in the open, and once open platforms will be shut down if it becomes too much of a platform for citizens to openly discuss what's going on; examples being Bill Nyes erasure of biological sex, promotion of underaged sex, and minimization of heterosexuality. Another would be when that Ghostbusters remake came out, plenty of upset to make it seem like critique came only from sexists. Another example would be when rotten tomatoes actually snuck in positive reviews from marvel movies into the stack for the last Jedi (or was it Solo? Both did terribly) once reviews came pouring in pointing out a lack of respect for the source material and lack of depth or weight to any of the new characters and their universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So our media is switching to a more brazenly force fed "indulgence" with no room for critique, or to decide for yourself, or to even see if others might agree with you. This is what you get, and you'll LIKE it.

       I believe so. "The force is female", killing off all modern common western heros and tropes - we weren't all Christian, or all white, but we all loved Han, Lando, Luke, and the like. Now they've turned our common cultural icons into embarrassing shadows of their former selves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black men especially can't be allowed to have strong masculine role models so they turned Lando into a pansexual robot fricker. It's weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       But white men too, Luke was turned into a bastion for hope and the notion of salvation into a desperate proxy fighting coward.

       This is spot on, and you went a lot deeper than my post intended. The surface level conspiracy that I was attempting to get at is that Netflix removed the star rating system due to the feedback on the Amy Schumer special. This is indicative of the inauthentic cultural shift towards inclusivity being driven by corporations. We are all one, but when corporations come in and force it down our throats, it comes off as inauthentic.
