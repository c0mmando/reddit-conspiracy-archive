       The real reason for posting this though is for people to notice just how many of the links, especially youtube videos, are no longer available when you go to click on them.

       No you can't. You can only find roughly a couple dozen photos which came from the crime scene file released by the CT police. The school was riddled with asbestos, which is likely why the school was closed in the first place. When this took place is unknown.

       If you've got some links to the "thousands of photos" available online, I'd be interested in seeing those.

       Sure.  Someone has been compiling thousands of photos, parent-teacher newsletters, articles and the such provin Sandy Hook was an operating functioning school leading up to the shooting.

       Ok, first of all, sites specifically created to “debunk” the theory don’t count. If it was an active functioning school, I’m talking about links from BEFORE the shooting happened. Ya know, back when the web traffic for the site was at 0.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, there is absolutely no proof that, just for example, those Halloween pictures are from 2009. For all we know, they could have been from 2001, and no one would know the difference. The clothes all look a little outdated to be 09 IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that’s what you meant by the “thousands” of available pictures, then that is incredibly weak.

       LOL!   What about sites/Facebook posts specifically created to promote the theory?  New rule!  They count either.

      <p>
       The website links thousands of news articles (to outside publications) with scans of newspapers, videos, thousands of pieces of corroborating evidence.  They have links to outside pictures and local papers with pictures.   They have video.  They have timestamped proof of when the photos were taken.

       And you can confirm that it was taken in a classroom in the particular building that happens to no longer exist anymore?

       No amount of pictures would change my mind except for pictures of the victims or Lanza actually entering/inside the building.

       The idea that the school was closed isn’t even important to me. The questions I have about the event go far beyond any one specific “theory” that you nitpick and provide some debunking site that makes a reasonable explanation for it.

       the CT police forensic photos also show Rose of St; Lima posters on the wall of the closed/fake 'SHES'
      </p>
      <p>
       SHES was an adult medical 'school' part of Fairfield, not a school for children.

       SHES is very interesting.  Lot of fuckery for sure.  I'm not sure what actually happened that day and my gut tells me kids did die.  That being said I do have questions for example....
      </p>
      <p>
       Who were the two men running through the woods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wont numerous FOIA requests be granted (I have suspicions the reasoning is they dont want crazies harassing the families)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was Sysco sending invoices and shipments to a school down the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why were numerous houses like almost all around the school paid off and had a zero balance?
      </p>
      <p>
       For a Upper Middle Class community that school was seriously run down.  I wouldnt think that would be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who ordered the porta poties and when did they order them?
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flip side so much of the "evidence" people use in this conspiracy is flat out trash.  Like easily debunked nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all I can understand why people would believe what they would believe with SHES because it really is insane all the way around

       Brilliantly put.

       Honestly, as trivial as it sounds, even the fucking porta potty invoice would settle a lot of this shit, yet for
       <em>
        some reason
       </em>
       they were gag ordered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not confident enough to say either way if anyone died that day, but I’ve seen enough evidence to not think either scenario is crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point is that we are rapidly losing any potential evidence to convince anyone. The implications of which are very 1984ish.

       go look at the aerial footage of the generator container with roof pipe work on it by the shed.

       this was powering the closed down "SHES' for the exercise/drill/event.

       ask how the CT state police can breach a shed door in the afternoon (aftrnoon shadows),
      </p>
      <p>
       and the first responder Newtown cops can run past an open shed door in the morning at 9:50am or so.

       I reckon when tptb really want to push an agenda they aren't getting enough traction on they always start trotting out kids getting killed/maimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the Syria saga for instance, they weren't getting enough traction so started spreading the Assad is gassing kids story with related horrific imagery.
      </p>
      <p>
       As humans we are by and large programmed to protect kids so by pushing these stories they are pushing some very primal buttons.
