<p>If you are familiar with the narratives on Tg in general and the way gold plays a central role in the Annunaki narratives - perhaps you can see the interesting correlation too?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-investigation-of-nanoparticles-of-golds-fatality-effect-on-toxoplasma-gondii-parasite-in-an-in-vitro-study-2472-1212-1000172.pdf">https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/the-investigation-of-nanoparticles-of-golds-fatality-effect-on-toxoplasma-gondii-parasite-in-an-in-vitro-study-2472-1212-1000172.pdf</a></p>

<p>Background: Toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii which is an obligate intracellular parasite with worldwide distribution. The use of nanoparticles is of the methods which have recently been applied in the anti-parasitic studies and have showed the acceptable results.</p>

<p>Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-toxoplasma ability of gold nanoparticles in vitro.</p>

<p>Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, the concentrations of 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1000 ppm of
gold nanoparticles at different times </p>

<p>Results: The percentage of live tachyzoites was decreased with increasing of time from 30-180 minutes and
increasing of the concentration of gold nanoparticles from 100 to 1000 ppm. The best results were obtained in a
concentration of 1000 µg/mL; so that it was able to destroy 100% of tachyzoite in this concentration.</p>

<p>Conclusion: The results showed that gold nanoparticles are able to effectively reduce the tachyzoites of T. gondii and it can be considered as a viable alternative to treat the toxoplasmosis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Egyptians did eat it. There have been excavated sites which were essentially factories to make monoatomic gold. Huge piles of it are found in some sites. The Egyptians believed it nourished their &quot;light body&quot; and was key to overall good health.</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/images/nLFrmN">https://goo.gl/images/nLFrmN</a></p>

<p>In the pic you can see the cone shapes on the hands. That is piles of monoatomic gold. They also made little cakes out of it and consumed it that way. They were obsessed with the stuff.</p>

<p>A modern take on it (using an  EKG to monitor brain activity) is that after consuming it, it will balance brain activity and have both hemispheres of the brain working in harmony. Interesting stuff. I have seen it heavily down voted when mentioned before in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh, I definitely watched a couple different guys get hooked up to machines to monitor brain waves. I can&#39;t seem to find the videos right now. Really weird.</p>

<p>From what I recall, the effect was virtually instantaneous. The left brain activity dropped, the right brain spiked and they were very closely balanced +/-</p>

<p>I know this is purely subjective and not scientific at all but I had purchased some from a &quot;reputable&quot; vendor (yes, I know...)</p>

<p>Anyway, I took a few drops and put on some of that binaural audio at I think 432hz with my $400   Sony production headphones. I listed for about 20 minutes and my eyes started rolling back in my head and twitching like I was experienced full on heavy REM sleep. </p>

<p>LOL holy shit haha. Is it as spooky as you wrote it (did it hurt)?
Also, how would you know you&#39;re really listening to 432Hz?
What happened after the eye rolling?</p>

<p>What if someone is right hemisphere dominant? Do they become more logical/grounded? Did you experience any effects on cognition? </p>

I still have some left and I&#39;ll definitely confirm myself. I was just super excited to try it that the exact frequency wasn&#39;t really that important at the time.</p>

<p>I&#39;d consider my left hemi dominant but I can meditate and feel a difference in my perception/thought patterns.</p>

<p>The only real effect I felt was one of a deep state of rest, like I woke up from a great night&#39;s sleep even though I was listening for an hour tops. I have read that the more that is consumed, the greater the benefits/effects are. It slowly builds up in your system over time. </p>

<p>For anyone considered it, please do your own research and conditioner your options.</p>

<p>The reason I tried it with the music was because I believe the pyramids had many uses, one of the uses was changing our vibration through the amazing harmonics. For example the red pyramid.</p>

<p>There were other reports that there were blue skinned remains of Egyptian Pharaoh&#39;s. And of course Egyptian gods such as Amun, Anhur and others had blue skin. I have read that the Egyptians did consume gold, silver and possibly get copper  I believe Osiris had green skijjjû</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have read, the few people the MSM can showcase with Argyria drank large amounts of improperly homemade colloidal silver. They made it with tap water instead of distilled water. I make it at home with distilled water but I don&#39;t really take it internally, I mainly gargle with it or use it in my netti pot. A lot of people use colloidal silver all the time but yet the MSM has not ever reported a heavy outbreak of thousands of cases of Argyria. All they ever showcase is that same old Papa Smurf guy. Makes me believe it is just fear mongering to suppress something that may have medical value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the Egyptians as well as the Sumerians, Jews and others consumed it. Jews called it manna. Other names for it are ORME, ormus and a few others. I&#39;ve said I&#39;m not an expert on the topic, I was just curious to see if I could feel anything after talking it.  I&#39;m positive I&#39;ve watched lectures about the product so there&#39;s info out there if you look for it. It&#39;s not like taking a hit of acid where you trip hard for 12 hours.  just calmed my brain down and felt really relaxed until I added music to the experience.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not trying to sell anyone anything. I was just posting my personal experience with it. What you do with your life is up to you, I don&#39;t care either way. But there is plenty of research available if you decide to look into it. Best of luck!</p>

<a href="http://www.halexandria.org/dward816.htm">http://www.halexandria.org/dward816.htm</a>
&quot;Hudson has made some interesting correlations with information in ancient history where he thinks white gold powder was not only discovered, but used for certain spiritual transformations. (..) Hudson has stated that ingesting these elements and fasting for forty days, creates a magnetic field that repels other magnetic fields (could this be a method for protection against fourth dimensional parasites?)</p>

<p>If non-corporal greater parasites were a reality, they would be a universal reality, and as such, even advanced non-earth cultures like the Anunnaki would be forced to go though excessive means to find a remedy of them, even exhausting their own planetary supplies of mono atomic precious metals? And then traveling to other places like earth to find them?&quot;</p>

<p>Wow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Found an interesting walk-through here: <a href="http://www.monoatomischesgold.de/en/home.html">http://www.monoatomischesgold.de/en/home.html</a></p>

<p>The Hebrews called it “Manna” or “Bread of God”, the Egyptians “Tear from the Eye of Horus”, the Indians “Vibhuti or Bhasma of Gold”. In alchemy it is considered as “Calx of Gold”, which helps to transform the “lead” of the human mind (the ego with its negative, dense structures) into “Gold” (the Divine Soul).</p>

<p>• It is a superconducter at room temperature, shows characteristics of energy production and can receive, save and release light/information/energy without loss.</p>

<p>• Its electrons bond with the anti-electrons and form opposite momentum light-bands that rotate around the oval nucleus (see figure).</p>

<p>• Simultaneously it creates a light Prana-Vortex that is spiraling along a double helix through the atom nucleus and equates kundalini energy.</p>

<p>• It creates an independant zero magnetic field (Meissner Field) around itself, which equates the Mer-Ka-Ba of humans. Mer-Ka-Ba is the light body of human beings (from the Egyptian: MER = light-bands bonded together and rotating in opposite directions, KA = energy of life and spirit, BA = soul / MER-KA-BA = Spiritual power of life and soul melt together and form a unity that creates light-bands that rotate in opposite directions and surmount space and time).</p>

<p>• Monoatomic Gold only exists to 5/9 on the physical level.</p>

<p>• Pure Monoatomic Gold levitates on the Earth’s magnetic field.</p>

<p>• It doesn’t wear off and its function and its durability is everlasting</p>
