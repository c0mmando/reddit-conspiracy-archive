<p>ASHINGTON – As Henry Kissinger predicted soon after the 2016 election, Donald Trump’s “transition from being a campaigner to being a national strategist” has been seamless. Much like the change Barack Obama underwent in 2008, where “anti-establishment” campaign rhetoric and promises became a thing of the past and a “status quo” neoliberal/neoconservative agenda was adopted in its place, Trump’s transition has led to a resurgence of power and influence among Washington’s most notorious neoconservatives and a continuation of many of the policies that he had once railed against.</p>

<p>Trump’s decision to assume the mantle of George W. Bush should have angered his base, as his promises to “drain the swamp” of the nation’s capital ring ever-hollow amid the ascension of the worst of Washington’s cesspool to powerful positions in the Trump administration. However, such anger among Trump’s base has failed to materialize en masse. Instead, the anger has largely been diverted and redirected, thanks to an internet phenomenon known simply as “QAnon.”</p>

<p>QAnon began last October when an anonymous account began posting in the internet forum 4chan – and later the related forum 8chan — and claimed to be a well-positioned source in the Trump administration with “Q” level security clearance. Notably, Q emerged just as war with North Korea seemed imminent, coming just as Trump met with military leaders and warned that it was “the calm before the storm.” Q’s first posts were in direct reference to that statement, placed under a thread titled “Calm before the Storm,” and the mysterious figure’s subsequent posts are collectively known as “the Storm.” Qanon has been promoted by prominent figures on the Trump-supporting right like Sean Hannity, Roseanne Barr and Alex Jones, among others.</p>

<p>Since the phenomenon began, the posts of the anonymous “Q” have engaged in the construction of a parallel reality — one where Robert Mueller is actually investigating Hillary and Bill Clinton; several other high-profile, corrupt Democrats will soon be shipped off to Guantanamo Bay; swamp monster John Bolton is actually “cleaning up” Washington; and Julian Assange of WikiLeaks has been “rescued” from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.</p>

<p>The reality constructed by QAnon has ultimately unfolded much like a fictitious spy novel, one that details a “secret” counter-coup by the Trump administration against the so-called “Deep State” that Trump – in reality — has dutifully served ever since winning the 2016 election. Despite QAnon’s having been proven wrong repeatedly, its following remains large and the phenomenon itself remains influential.</p>

<p>Robert Martin, a documentary filmmaker whose series “A Very Heavy Agenda” delves into the nefarious political influence of the neoconservatives, told MintPress that QAnon is the “perfect wish-fulfillment conspiracy snowball” aimed at conservatives, adding that it has worked to “rehabilitate some of the most tarnished and scary neocons to all of a sudden be heroic figures.” Among the figures who have been promoted by QAnon as heroes resisting the “deep state” include Blackwater founder Erik Prince, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Mayor of New York City turned Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.</p>

<p>In fact, Martin asserted that QAnon appears to be an evolution of a proposal once put forth by Cass Sunstein, a close confidant of Barack Obama, who had urged the government infiltration of anti-government and anti-establishment groups and, as Salon noted at the time, would manipulate such groups in order to increase citizens’ faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of “conspiracists.”</p>

<p>Martin asserted that QAnon has manifested as a means of “purposeful disinformation made to distract or control conspiracy movements,” going so far as to call for “military control” to stop the “deep state” all while being promoted by influential news organizations among Trump supporters at the behest of the White House.</p>

<p>Indeed, the White House specifically asked Alex Jones to have his Infowars Washington bureau chief, Jerome Corsi, report extensively on QAnon postings and interpret them for the Infowars audience. Since late last April, both Jones and Corsi have claimed that the Q account was “seized” by the “deep state” and is no longer credible. The times being what they are, however, QAnon still attracts tens of thousands of followers, many of whom have rejected Infowars in favor of QAnon posts.</p>

<p>Pushing regime change in Iran
However, this past Tuesday, QAnon took a step in a new direction. Instead of past QAnon posts, which have sought to portray Trump’s actions that are clearly in support of the establishment as “anti-establishment,” these posts sought to cultivate support for something that has yet to take place but has loomed on the horizon for months. On Tuesday, QAnon called for regime change in Iran.</p>

<p>Just after midnight, the Q account posted “Free Iran!!! Fight Fight Fight Regime change. People have the power. We stand with you.” The post was not Q’s first reference to Iran, building off previous Q posts that warned simply that Iran was “next.” Those posts first emerged just as Iran hawk Bolton was set to join the Trump administration. However, Tuesday’s post was notable for its explicit call for regime change in the Islamic Republic, just weeks after covert U.S.-brokered regime change in Iran had become official U.S. policy.</p>

<p>Given the influence of QAnon, this shift is particularly concerning. One of the reasons it is concerning is that it is based on disinformation often circulated by proponents of war with Iran. Qanon posts assert, for example, that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the Iran nuclear deal, was not about nuclear disarmament or preventing a military conflict, but instead a greedy money-motivated plot planned by the Clintons and carried out by Obama. The money given to Iran after the deal by the Obama administration is used as evidence for this assertion, even though that money was the sum of Iranian assets that the U.S. had seized years prior when it imposed sanctions on Iran, something Bolton himself helped to accomplish while serving the George W. Bush administration.</p>

<p>Another related lie recently propagated by QAnon is that Bolton is fighting the “deep state” — by helping “clean” the White House and rid it of “disloyal” staff that are obstructing Trump’s mythical fight to free the country from the yoke of its shadow government — urging Trump supporters to “follow Bolton.” Since then, some Q enthusiasts have even taken Bolton’s frequent readjustment of his large glasses as a “sign” that he is part of the supposed counter-coup.</p>

<p>As MintPress has reported at length, there is perhaps no figure in the Trump administration who embodies the “swamp” more than staunch neoconservative Bolton, who is well-known for distorting intelligence and information in his pursuit of regime change and the destruction of “rogue” states. Bolton’s top target for regime change is Iran, which he recently promised would see its government fall before the year was over. Bolton openly supports and has received tens of thousands of dollars from the Iranian terror group Mujahedeen Khalq (MEK), which has next to no domestic support in Iran. Most concerning of all perhaps is that Bolton’s current regime-change policy calls for military action to effect regime change if all else fails, a policy that could well lead to another disastrous war that will make the 2003 invasion of Iraq seem insignificant by comparison.</p>

<p>Regime change in Iran is diametrically opposed to the “Make America Great Again” mantra that espoused ending foreign entanglements abroad in order to improve the country’s domestic situation. A war in Iran would not only waste vast amounts of American taxpayer money, it would do nothing to help the situation of the average American worker, instead enriching the weapons manufacturers – including those in which Trump personally owns stock. However, QAnon’s increasingly insidious influence is linking the myth of a heroic counter-coup with the myth that regime change in Iran is what the “people” want and is good for the Iranian people and the world.</p>

<p>Martin asserted that the recent QAnon posts seem to be aimed at preparing Trump’s base for a war they would normally not accept. He told MintPress:</p>

<p>QAnon appears to be slowly grooming millions of people on the internet who had normally been skeptical of pro-government narratives in the past to ‘trust the plan’ — aka trust everything Donald Trump is doing including hiring dangerous neocons who want to overthrow the government of Iran.”</p>

<p>Given QAnon’s foray into fostering support for regime change abroad, the recognition of the phenomenon as a psyop that preys on the wishes and emotions that Trump as a candidate cultivated in his supporters seems inevitable, particularly as it has begun claiming that all concerns over a looming war should be ignored. Instead, Q urges followers to “trust the plan.”</p>

<p>Allowing long-standing neo-conservative policies and posturing for war to masquerade as an uprising against the “deep state” and “a draining of the swamp,” QAnon has turned reality on its head by manipulating a desire among many Americans for an end to Washington corruption. It is arguably a modern psyop like no other.</p>

<p>“Trust the plan”: Getting folks to support policies they hate
It may seem odd that an anonymous account with claims of top security clearance – but no evidence to support that claim – has convinced thousands of Trump supporters to continue to back the president and even praise him for neocon-inspired policies, U.S.-backed regime change among them, that they would have reviled not long ago. This narrative twisting, however, is hardly unprecedented.</p>

<p>Under Obama, many of those on the left, who had placed their hopes for reform on the charismatic senator promising “change,” willfully ignored Obama’s continuation and expansion of Bush-era policies such as torture, the prosecution of whistleblowers, drone strikes and imperial wars abroad. Those who rejected the reality of Obama’s policy instead asserted that the only way to ensure that the long-promised “change” could manifest was if more corporate-funded, establishment Democrats were elected.</p>

<p>For many of those supporters, Obama himself was never to blame for – as Cornel West famously asserted – being a “Rockefeller Republican in blackface.” Even now, many on the left have placed Obama on an even higher pedestal — as Trump seems, superficially, to be his polar opposite, despite expanding many of Obama’s worst policies. As was the case with many on the left under Obama, it is now easier for MAGA enthusiasts to assert – with Q as “proof” — that Trump is still the candidate of 2016 instead of admitting that they have been had.</p>

<p>The same ignorance as benighted the Obama-rationalizing left can now be seen among Trump’s supporters, with calls to elect even more Republicans to Congress, despite their current majority in both houses, as the way to manifest Trump’s “populist” manifesto he touted as a candidate.</p>

<p>Thanks to QAnon, Trump will continue to remain blameless in the minds and hearts of many of his supporters, as those who blindly follow the “Gospel of Q” will continue to “trust the plan” no matter what Trump does, even if it results in a devastating war with Iran that kills millions of innocent people.</p>

<p>“Trust the plan” is the sequel to “Hope and change.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You love posting this alt right propaganda piece whenever someone asks for evidence of Q. I know it gives you a warm fuzzy feeling inside to have your narrative spun in an edgy way and with emotional music but anyone who watches it that isn&#39;t already a believer is going to dislike it. It&#39;s a circle jerk ad and doesn&#39;t really say anything other than what people with your bias already believe.</p>

<p>TL;DR- you should post something that actually has an argument in it instead of an alt right campaign video.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, I&#39;ve been on record as saying that Q is probably legit, but you are correct.  Unless you already kinda agree with some of the stuff the video says, it&#39;s a tough sell when they talk about criminals and show Hillary Clinton at the same time.  They are good at meming, but no so good at making things subtle.  Tough tough sell.</p>

<p>Whenever there is mania/hysteria for/against any rallying point, there will be pushback.  Natural crowd psychology.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe &quot;Q&quot; is a Larp.

However, I think that Q stuff shouldn&#39;t be discussed on r/conspiracy.

Another thing that was sloppy on Q&#39;s part was he posted a heavily edited video of Obama speaking about &quot;the new world order.&quot; Even his supporters were like &quot;...uhh why did Q post this video if its blatantaly very heavily edited bullshit? This isnt like him.&quot; But then of course comes the folks that are like &quot;disinformation is useful. Q wanted us to see how easy fake news can be made, so we&#39;ll see through it in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>Theres absolutley nothing anyone can do to convince a Q follower that it&#39;s all bullshit. Just like you cant talk someone out of their religion. Eventually they&#39;ll figure it out. It could be many years from now, but eventually they will find out that Obama and Hillary arent going to Gitmo. And sooner than that, they&#39;ll find out that Mueller was definitely not working with Trump. That will be a tough blue pill to swallow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see them every single day here. </p>

<p>These accounts are really good at what they do. They make massive accusations and are like bulldozers, refusing to even acknowledge another truth may be real. When you try to talk to them they detail the conversations into semantics and vague replies about no one has proved them wrong.</p>

<p>They come in waves and seem to appear most often on posts where the comments with dissenting opinions have more upvotes than the post itself. They regularly make vague claims about brand new accounts, or long dormant accounts with low karma, as all shills, BUT only when the tide of opinion is not in their favor. It&#39;s common here to see 30 day old accounts calling out &quot;the shills&quot;. Or claiming wildly untrue things, lately I&#39;ve seen the claim that anti-pedo stories never get any traction in this sub, despite them getting hundreds of upvotes and comments on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The change in this sub over the past few years has been jarring. Outrage is generated with low hanging fruit and is unbelievably carried over into a pro-gov&#39;t without question.</p>

<p>The point here doesn&#39;t just stand, it is our reality and it is what has occurred to the conspiracy movement. It&#39;s very scary to think it may continue to scoop up willingly followers who distrust everything, except for what they think someone anonymous with insider info is saying. QAnon is brilliant propaganda, and the most terrifying movement I have witnessed firsthand. </p>

<p>When will it stop? What is it&#39;s goal? What beliefs is it pushing? Why does no one take it seriously, except those who see evil behind every corner and in every shadow?</p>

<p>I think you can flip this around as well, <em>It&#39;s very scary to think it may continue to scoop up willingly followers who</em> trust <em>everything (from mainstream news sources)</em>.  At this point it&#39;s very obvious that almost all mainstream news sources are propaganda outlets a reasonable chunk of time.  I don&#39;t even think that&#39;s up for debate among the conspiracy theorist crowd.</p>

<p>I think Q, Benjamin Fulford, etc. provide a very valuable service to people.  They open up potential alternative explanations and behind the scenes activity.  Does it mean that it&#39;s right?  Of course not, but I don&#39;t think people who follow Q are any more likely to be gullible than those who don&#39;t follow Q.  I also think the idea that Washington DC is a festering swamp of corruption is highly accurate and was widely believed before Q or Trump came along.  One of the things I find most interesting is that I think regardless of who you trust for information, all roads lead to the same place:  The people need to restablish control over the government and ensure that politicians are doing our will and not acting in their own selfish interests.  Secret groups that are trying to subvert the government need to be brought out into the open.  Audits need to be done to ensure that our tax dollars are being well spent, no more trillions of dollars going missing.</p>

<p>I really hope these people (many of them who identify as conspiracy theorists) realize they&#39;re being conditioned to essentially support the current administration religiously.</p>

<p>The architects of the &quot;Q&quot; project are playing on the hope and desperation for some kind of a &quot;savior&quot;, and they&#39;re propping up Trump as that savior.  </p>

<p>This creates a rift within our culture that ultimately holds us back. We need to be critical and skeptical of the government, not get tricked into relying on them or believing they are &quot;on our side&quot;. </p>

<p>In fact, Martin asserted that QAnon appears to be an evolution of a proposal once put forth by Cass Sunstein, a close confidant of Barack Obama, <strong>who had urged the government infiltration of anti-government and anti-establishment groups and, as Salon noted at the time, would manipulate such groups in order to increase citizens’ faith in government officials and undermine the credibility of “conspiracists.”</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;d be winning and I&#39;d be a believer if what Q said, actually was real. It&#39;s a fantasy to promote support for the government that you should be against, instead, Qultists are buying what they are selling hook, line, and sinker. </p>

<p>It does. Means the sub is ran by shills. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. I call you claiming Q is a product of that a fake news. It makes zero sense for Q to be a deep state psy-op, it would be the worst one ever imaginable if so. Literal digging of their own graves. That makes sense, to shills such as you.</p>

<p>But it is real. You claiming it&#39;s not means nothing. Actually, on contrary, it further solidifies that Q is the real deal, since this sub is just utter garbage &quot;lately&quot;, pure censorship, just the shit that deep state loves doing :)</p>

<p>Just writing that Q has been proven wrong means nothing. That&#39;s also something people have learned by reading Q drops. Facts and proofs are important, and you got none. </p>

<p>This is a new government. The anti-establishment one. Which is why you are against it. Which is why this sub has made a 180° around the elections :)</p>

<p>Qultists is a cute term. The GA mods sure worked hard to make that sound not so ridiculous, unfortunately. But that&#39;s just the outcome of Sunsteins methods.</p>

<p>The thing is, these lame attempts have nothing on Q, because those are the real and raw intel drops.</p>

<p>I know I said I&#39;ve ended my time here above, but I had to clarify your weak attempts. And it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re accustomed to dragging people deeper into your web of zero-facts. So I&#39;m pulling out for real.</p>

<p>Bye and you&#39;ll lose, soon. Good luck getting a real job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q is so obviously a LARP that it shocks me that people take it so seriously. What? The Republicans have control of all the branches of government, Trumps enacted several campaign promises of his, but there’s still a Deep state that prevents Trump from making “high profile arrests”. Trump is a saint that can do no wrong despite his ties to Epstein that always go unmentioned, immigrant children disappearing into the arms of traffickers, and more. Q is so overwhelmingly Pro Trump so what he says should always be called into question. </p>

<p>Not to mention Qs target demographic.  It’s all anti government theorists and boomers. I.e. A good portion of Trumps base. The perfect propaganda tool to placate both and keep them oblivious to obvious pro establishment actions N.Y. Trump like the fact that we’re still propping up the war economy around the world, the overwhelming actions taken in the favor or foreign and elite interests, and the corporate capture of our regulatory bodies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(1)  &quot;Q&quot; has stated over &amp; over that we should &quot;just trust&quot; his selected &quot;White Hats.&quot;</p>

<p>Trust is not a basis for government.  The U.S. Constitution flatly demands mistrust, Checks &amp; Balances, and separation of powers.</p>

<p>(2)  &quot;Q&quot; has stated that the U.S. Military, and specifically Military Intelligence, is <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/147146601/#147175452">&#39;the only part of government not corrupt.&#39;</a></p>

<p>Previously covered in this subreddit:  <a href="http://archive.is/WjFaw">Military intelligence (including Lt. Col. Michael Aquino), the Pentagon, and the U.S. Military were at the center of a nationwide series of Satanic pedophile scandals</a> that were personally covered up by Rudy Giuliani.  That&#39;s just one example of Pentagon/MILINT corruption.</p>

<p>(3)  No &quot;sex trafficking&quot; politician or political party has the multi-Trillion Dollar budget of the Pentagon, nor has the worldwide networks/facilities/resources/reach.  Actual victims of the Franklin Scandal, Dutroux &amp; others have pointed at U.S. military bases as the ringleaders.</p>

<p>(4)  Whenever I see &quot;White Hat&quot; and &quot;Black Hat&quot; thrown around, there is a partisan agenda happening.  &quot;Gray Hat&quot; is never seen discussed.  Whenever you see &quot;Either/Or&quot; choices being set up, there is a psychological operation to polarize.  <em>You</em> are being set-up.</p>

<p>There are many other examples in the &quot;Q&quot; writings to indicate a sophisticated psychological operation, from the 1st-grade writing level (frequently one-word or two-word bite-size sentences) to the Cult 101 <a href="https://psychologenie.com/the-concept-of-love-bombing">&quot;Love-bombing&quot;</a> in which praise is showered continuously upon loyalists &amp; &quot;unity&quot; is constantly reinforced, and questions are forbidden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another wall-of-text about this. So much time &amp; energy spent on this anti-Q effort, I find it fascinating. Why would average Joes who just think the Q phenom is &#39;lame&#39; spend so much of their time on this?! It just feels like a campaign to me.. which in turn makes the Q thing at least seem like it&#39;s more than meets the eye. I personally could give a crap either way, I am quite literally an &#39;unconcerned observer&#39;. But these new efforts to counter the Q info seem pretty heavy-handed &amp; of course full of vote brigading which is clearly on display whenever these massive walls-of-text appear, which I&#39;ve noticed are usually part of more organized &#39;efforts&#39; to discredit this thing or that thing. I still remember the walls-of-text from the Project Gladio guys trying to make Snoden look like a CIA agent lol.</p>

<p>Like I said, just fascinating to watch unfold.   Please, do carry on! (<em>munches popcorn</em>..)</p>
