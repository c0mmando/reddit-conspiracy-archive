    <div class="md"><p>This is precisely the point. For instance a cursory search through British Government&#39;s Land registry records will show that a large percentage of landfills that have been closed in the last 50 years have been bought up by a number of small land holing companys. A little further digging (no pun intended) reveals these land holding company&#39;s are owned by subsidiary of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think using the term Unobtanium is causing the confusion. I&#39;m assuming that your overall hypothesis is that <em>something</em> will be mined from landfills in the future... Something different from modern day oil deposits. We can tell now that, over time, potentially valuable hydrocarbon deposits will form within old landfills. The unique mixture of elements may effect the overall composition of the hydrocarbon deposits, so your hypothesis can&#39;t be ruled out completely.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to metals/heavier elements, the environment required to create new chemistry simply isn&#39;t available on Earth. The heavier elements will remain in their current form, or slowly decay into a more stable isotope. In order to manipulate atoms of that size, you need something like a star, or even better: a supernova.</p>

<p>In short, if anything new or unique comes out of modern landfills, it will consist of the carbon-based building blocks we already have available to us. There&#39;s really no possibility of new elements forming, or heavier elements changing (minus half-life decay).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The metallic elements will tend to stay in the exact form they enter the landfill except for oxidation, which in covered landfills should occur at a relatively slow pace and which occurs at a different rate for all materials - Iron for example oxidizes fairly quickly, whereas aluminum oxidation forms a thin layer of aluminum oxide that protects the underlying aluminum from oxidation.</p>

<p>Simple organic materials are broken down by anaerobic bacteria which is why some landfills are used to source methane. </p>

<p>More complex organic materials, specifically plastics, actually have to wait for evolution; some plastic-eating bacteria have been discovered, but for the large part locked deep in a landfill these materials have nothing to degrade them and may be recognizable in 100,000 years. </p>

<p>The only thing that could change all this would be getting subsumed by the earth due to geological activity, at which point the metals would eventually work deep enough (and therefore hot enough) to be combined with other materials forming raw ores. All materials not metallic or concrete will at this point be reduced to basic elements. This process takes millions of years, however.</p>

<p>Any new exciting &#39;super resources&#39; at this point will likely be created in a lab. The most interesting metallic stuff centers around attempts to produce high temperature superconductors and line fusion reactors.

    <div class="md"><p>I once read a near future post apocalyptic novel where a plot was that a survivor colony was making themselves wealthy by mining a landfill for discarded construction materials. They were using salvaged lumber and nails as trade currency.</p>

<p>So, mining landfills for refined alloys and rare earth metals would be a thing, but basic industrial era goods we take for granted would be much more valuable in an &quot;after the fall&quot; scenario. </p>

<p>Another point he made is- you can pump an oil well dry, abandon it, come back 30 years later, and it is producing again</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont have any hard evidence myself; its more anecdotal evidence by guys that worked in the oil drilling industry longer than what i did. Some of the guys worked on workover rigs, which went in &amp; serviced/ refurbed old abandoned wells and they often said they oil would start producing again, long after the water injection/ pressurization had been completed to get the last skerrick of oil out.</p>

<p>There are many wells up in the North Sea that were abandoned 30- 40 years ago, that are now producing again, so there is something else going on- even through porous ground, you would get a large amount of oil flow through 40 years of time- these guys were saying old wells started producing (depending on well), 300- 1000 bbls a day again</p>

<p>They used a machine with an Auger to &quot;drill&quot; down through the fill. They found meat from the meat shortage in the 1970&#39;s (like it had just been bought, due to lack of oxygen), readable magazines &amp; newspapers going back to the 1950&#39;s, all kinds of interesting stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern day landfills process waste utilizing heavy equipment. Mainly 40 ton compactors that chop, shred and waste thereby removing air from it. Spread and compact, 4-6 passes over the waste. Proper processing yields material that resembles chipper material.  Airspace is what landfills sell.  The more they can break down the material and compact, the longer the life of the landfill. Metrics are based on pounds per cubic yard, which we refer to as density.  Landfill mining does exist, but its more for metals. You wouldn&#39;t find any useable lumber or really any types of materials of use after it had been processed.  Metals would be an exception.  </p>
