You should get a VPN or move far far away if you want to get your privacy and freedom back. There are many <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/357982/does-the-end-of-net-neutrality-mean-i-need-a-vpn">articles</a> about this current situation and possible future perspectives.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I mean the government is complicite in the sense that they turn a blind eye to the crimes their rich friends do, but propaganda isnt comming from the CIA so much as from thinks tanks and other NGOs trying to nullify the spirit and independence of free people. </p>

<p>I believe their great project is the destruction of the individual and the birth of a super state. Engineered society and a true class system between those with power and those without it. They want to criminalize religion, family, personal or local soverignty, independent thought, or unsanctioned information. They want to rank people based on usefulness to the superstate. They want to destroy culture for the sake of homogeny. </p>

<p>This is why there is so much pushback against populism, and nationalism People reject the notion that they cant make decisions for themselves. The reason enviromental laws and such havnt been implemented successfully enough to control global warming, is simply because there hasnt been a pro liberty, pro population control party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We mostly agree -- I just think big corporations / oligarchs and government are integrated. And I also think global warming is not human-caused, but rather a manifestation of the Great Year -- &quot;seasons&quot; of the solar system, if you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are definitly cooperating. The rich basically select people to finance that they can use. They use their media and PR machine to keep people straight and to blackmail them.</p>

<p>However global warming is absolutley atleast strongly influenced by humanity. We really should be entering ng an ice age right now, but we have made the atmosphere so thick its holding its heat. The idea of our current rate of climate change being natural, and that humanities huge impact on the biosphere isnt causing tempetures to rise, doesnt make sense. It is a point made by energy companies through their media, and political empires, to ensure the dominance of oil.</p>

<p>The only real solution is to put a limit of 2 or 3 children per peraon until the population stablizes at around a billion or so. When we get an orbitible ring, space elevators, and robotic terraforming, industrial swarms in the next 50 years or so, we can start spreading beyond our planet.</p>

<p>Wr are taking energy out of the enviroment at a fair rate. This rate is increasing every day. We a destroying our fertile land because we are putting such a syrain on it by trying to feed billions of people. Not to mention, oil, precious resources like metals, and energy dense matter that can be used without much energy or processing being done.</p>

<p>If we are smart we can solve the problem now, and not have to deal woth the effects, however in another century, at our current rate, our population will exceed 10 to 15 billion n around the same time we run out of easy to get resources, all the while experiencing total, global ecosystem collapse. Billions upon billions will die of starvation, and exsposure. We really need to reform our political, and economic systems.</p>

<p>I envision a new world were liberty and local soverignty are the prime political philosophies. Simple treaties are in place with basic rules like. All parties embargo countries that dont agree to basic enviromental laws like a limit of three genetic children per adult.</p>

<p>We also need collectivised industry that is run by patent extempt robotics for the benifit of humanity as a whole. This collectivied industry should be so large a part of the economy that people primary income is derived by a negitive tax rate.</p>

<p>All laws should be on the local level only except for a very few. The government should protect the rights of people, and property should be privately held and developed. There should be a natural aristocracy, but the rule of law should be sacred.</p>

<p>If a politician is corrupt. He sgould lose his rights to protection of the law. If a person kills a political person, and can prove he is corrupt, he should walk. All localities should be allowed to choose their own commisioners, to set up or run the local government. These commisioners ahould be elected every so often, and the local people can choose what system they want from lazze fair capitalist, republic, to a collectivised, nanny state oligarchy. The state can handle commerence, and infastructure. </p>

<p>The details dont matter exactly. The federal government is almost impossible to influence and change. It is also easy to corrupt by foriegn influence and money. It tries to rule vastly different people with a common set of laws. It throws culture away in pursuit of homogeny.</p>
