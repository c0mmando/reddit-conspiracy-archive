        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-06-27 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/UTEN5.html">UTEN5</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me get this straight, out of the 1,500,000,000 people in the world who believe in Islam there&#39;s 50 countries that are majority Muslim. Of those 50 countries, we&#39;ve halted immigration from 5 of them (Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen) mainly those whom have bad if not non-existent way of identification or vetting. There were 6 countries originally but the country of Chad decided to improve their country&#39;s way of identification thus allowing us to properly vet them and now they&#39;re allowed to enter. </p>

<p>Oh and 2 non-Muslim countries are also included in the ban (Venezuela &amp; North Korea)</p>

<p>How is it a &quot;Muslim&quot; ban if 45 of the 50 Muslim countries aren&#39;t banned and allowed to come to the country? </p>

<p>How is it a &quot;Muslim&quot; ban and include 2 countries that aren&#39;t Muslim at all?</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+Muslim+countries+are+there&amp;amp;oq=how+many+Muslim+countries+are+there&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.10654j1j4&amp;amp;client=ms-android-att-us&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+Muslim+countries+are+there&amp;amp;oq=how+many+Muslim+countries+are+there&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.10654j1j4&amp;amp;client=ms-android-att-us&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome-mobile&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8</a>)</p>

<p>Looks like out of the 45 Muslim countries NOT banned, trump has business ties to ONLY Turkey, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 
 (<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/politics/trump-foreign-businesses/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/politics/trump-foreign-businesses/index.html</a>)</p>

<p>So saying that he didn&#39;t ban other Muslim countries bc of his business ties is completely misleading if not intentionally dishonest. </p>

<p>Lastly, If  we were the big meanies that hated refugees then I would assume these  countries have the most refugees fleeing from them?? </p>

<p>The top 5 countries world wide having the most refugees fleeing are in order:</p>

<p><em>Syria
Afghanistan
South Sudan
Myanmar
*Somalia
(</em>currently in the travel ban)</p>

<p>Only 2 of these countries are in the &quot;travel ban&quot;. In fact the US took refugees in from the other 3 countries!! </p>

<p>So it doesn&#39;t meet the &quot;anti-Muslim&quot; narrative and it doesn&#39;t meet the &quot;anti refugee&quot; narrative. It seems to me if I show up at any airport and TSA cannot properly identify me, I&#39;m not going to travel. Any 7 of those countries can implement proper identification protocols (like the rest of the world) and they&#39;ll be removed from the ban like the country of ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡© Chad managed to do since April. </p>

<p>This media&#39;s lack of transparency, integrity and desire to chase the almighty dollar is turning this country to shit. Instead of the truth they want you to think the whole 350 million (or mainly anyone whom you disagree with) US population in the country hate all Muslims and refugees. </p>

<p>If these policies were 100% against Muslims and refugees like the media claim than We wouldn&#39;t accept people from 45 of the 50 Muslim countries or would we accept people from 3 of the top 5 refugee fleeing countries plus dozens more countries (see link below). These both completely counter and obliterate the media&#39;s narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is they won&#39;t even actually bother installing a middle east wide travel ban save for talking about it. Judging for the us government, if Trump had actually bothered with a middle east wide travel ban, we will see huge riots by antifa or illegals and it would be lifted in a few days. </p>

<p>Also, they import refugees from Mexico, pakistan or east/west africa, and rarely from the middle east.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never registered Republican and by no means defend trump. I simply don&#39;t trust the corporate media and haven&#39;t since the invention of the internet. Every time I see a headline I have to spend 5 min researching to see the truth. I typically try to avoid the crazy 20% of the left and the crazy 20% of the right and live in the middle. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking at it objectively. It seems that it&#39;s countries that literally can&#39;t ID their citizens. Again, try getting through an airport with TSA with illegitimate ID regardless of religion. </p>

<p>As a business as big as the &quot;Trump&quot; name that employees thousands of Muslims worldwide and wants Muslims to use his businesses it seems like a horrible business decision. You&#39;re a world wide brand why would you alienate 1.5 billion people. I don&#39;t believe it. Why would he lose millions, if the argument is it&#39;s to &quot;profit&quot; from this move? I just don&#39;t get the media&#39;s push to paint these things so inaccurately other than to drive traffic through their site</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are racist movements growing across Europe, and really the whole world. Maybe heâ€™s tapping into that at the expense of a segment who might have already been avoiding his businesses because heâ€™s American?</p>

<p>And really, Iâ€™m not here to attack his travel ban, Iâ€™m just pointing out how odd it is to have so many people defending him on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, of all places. If anythingâ€™s a conspiracy, that is.</p>

<p>&quot;Total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.&quot; Turns out it wasn&#39;t the whitehouse.gov site but Trump&#39;s campaign site, although it was still up after he was elected and inaugurated, and was only taken down after Spicer was asked why it was still up (in &#39;17) - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-the-united-states/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/07/donald-trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-the-united-states/</a></p>

<p>Both statements were cited by lower courts who overturned the initial bans, citing Intent. Bottom line seems to be they wanted (want) to do a full Muslim ban but can&#39;t, as that&#39;s unconstitutional. The resulting travel bans were the best they could manage. </p>

<p>Donald J. Trump Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(New York, NY) December 7th, 2015, -- Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country&#39;s representatives can figure out what is going on. According to Pew Research, among others, there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from the Center for Security Policy released data showing &quot;25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as a part of the global jihad&quot; and 51% of those polled, &quot;agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Shariah.&quot; Shariah authorizes such atrocities as murder against non-believers who won&#39;t convert, beheadings and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans, especially women.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump stated, &quot;Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. If I win the election for President, we are going to Make America Great Again.&quot; - Donald J. Trump</p>

<p>I actually agree that Trump&#39;s executive order doesn&#39;t amount to a Muslim travel ban, but I think it&#39;s disingenuous to pretend that Trump himself hasn&#39;t only expressed a desire to enact a travel ban but has literally referred to his order as a travel ban. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right.  I misread the date.  He was his cyber security advisor at the time of that quote but he was not the press secretary.  </p>

<p>Trump said ban on travel from middle eastern countries who harbor and support Muslim extremist.  He most likely said Muslim countries because they are Muslim countries but if you read the Executive Order it is very clear.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how past communications or statements matter when the Executive Order that went to the Supreme Court had no such language. Why does it matter?</p>
