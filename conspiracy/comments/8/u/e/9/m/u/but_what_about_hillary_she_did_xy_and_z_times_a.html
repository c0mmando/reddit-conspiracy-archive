       Yeah, what about her? If you have proof, put her in jail and no the law doesn't put people in jail for email servers nor deleting them without intent to distribute the information to a different party.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about Obama? Well, if you have anything you can go on, put him in jail for all I care. They didn't put Bush in jail for lying to the American people and creating a whole Texas sized mess. I doubt that anything is going to happen. It wouldn't be in the president's interest to jail his predecessors unless he wants the next one to go after him.
      </p>
      <p>
       This tactic of defending the president of the United States using his predecessors and his opponents is fine. I just say, what about them? If you have evidence and can beat a lawyer in court without resolving to "deep state". Do it. Otherwise it's not a real defense and it looks silly using it in defense of a president of which I have on video lying to me from the beginning.

       Obama and HRC are important to those of us on the Left who are working on changing the Party from the grassroots. They are part of the Neoliberal problem. That's why they are still discussed. They are endorsing and passing old staff to a new generation of corrupt Neolibs in races across the country, including such high profile names as Kamala Harris and Deval Patrick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't ignore HRC and O if we want to actually turn the Party Left. We gotta knock those dinosaurs out of their positions of influence, and everyone who supports and benefits from those positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       HRC, Obama, Tom Perez, DWS, Kamala Harris, Deval Patrick, Corey Booker, Joe Kennedy III...they all work together, believe in the same corrupt, Neolib/Neocon worldview, and must be seen as one entity if we are to take the Party from their cold, corrupt hands.

       No, I want to kick out the centrists who currently contorl the Party. I know I ain't changing O's or HRC's pov. I want them

       I direct your attention to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, a card carrying member of DSA and Democratic Socialist who is only 28 and just beat Joe Crowley, 4th highest ranking Dem in the HoR, in his Primary in NY14. Change will be forced upon these Party dinosaurs.

       The best bet for a true leftist party is to create one. A real leftist policy against the two capitalist corporate parties.

       Creating a Party is far harder than
       <em>
        taking

       one, which is only a matter of organization at the grassroots. And I'm not planning on "tricking" anyone lmfao. Bernie and people like Alexandria are quite open and clear about their intentions.

       They are "democratic socialists" who are hardly left. And "left" is a matter of economic policy over a view on SJW culture.

       None of them say anything real leftist like nationalize oil and the means of production of it. Since we pay tax dollars for war and deals with muslim countries. Gas should be free to everyday American citizens. All I want is a full tank to go to work bro. Also let's collectivize farms again. So that everyone can eat for free if you are an American citizen. Just present your ID at the checkout and remember... be temperate. There's enough food for everyone.

       Bernie has a house in Vermont he's owned for 30 years and has a mortgage on. He has an apartment in DC, and his wife Jane recently received an inheritance and with it they bought a vacation home. Not all that insane when you look at the

       Bernie's Presidential campaign recieved no lobbyist money, unless you consider Unions like the Nurses Union a lobby, in which case, guilt as charge. Lol.

       Wrong. True Left takes an approach to both because it realizes that you can't have Social Policy w/o Economic Policy. Try to keep up.

       You can't have true Socialism or post-scarcity Communism without first creating the culture of Socialism necessary to maintain it. This is what Social Democracy and Dem Socs are all about.

       No I'm absolutely sure she felt perfectly comfortable telling, not just her boss, but the president "no".  Totally probably gave enthusiastic consent to be sodomized by a cigar.

       Maybe she did give, "enthusiastic consent". Because it's never enough to get consent. How do you know? She's interning and blowing presidents.

       Laws very by state, but ultimately sexual assault is all about consent. Some states could consider Bill and Monicas situation as rape since he was in a position of authority. (A very high position)
      </p>
      <p>
       According to
       <a href="https://www.rainn.org/articles/legal-role-consent">
        https://www.rainn.org/articles/legal-role-consent
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Relationship of victim/perpetrator: Was the alleged perpetrator in a position of authority, such as such as a teacher or correctional office?
      </p>
      <p>
       In an article for Vanity Fair, Lewinsky wrote she now realizes that her relationship with Clinton "constituted a gross abuse of power."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Sure my boss took advantage of me, but I will always remain firm on this point: it was a consensual relationship,"
      </p>
      <p>
       Lewinsky says she now sees that her relationship with Clinton was full of "inappropriate abuse of authority, station, and privilege."
      </p>
      <p>
       She definitely gives mixed signals and suffers ptsd from the entire ordeal. I don't think it's too much of stretch to classify it as rape. It being a national political controversy has obviously obfuscated the matter.

       It just says or, or both. That part.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the thing is, is context and nuance. Hillary was technically in possession of top secret clearance which would privy her to that information but apparently not how it's stored. What if she asked the president and he said yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, I think you can see the nuance in it. I believe that if you really went zero tolerance on the law then yes, she could be fined and unable to run for president over storage of emails but I highly doubt jail time nor will they go after Karl Rove for doing the same thing with the RNC when Bush's Republicans "lost" 3 million emails.

       Pointing out its a misdemeanor...what does that have to do with our original conversation? Gross negligence doesn't require intent...it's very simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you keep accusing me of unstable behavior/reactions in your comments? I do not see where I've said anything that justifies you to do keep doing that..I already told you I was making a joke on your username...but you seem to be intent on painting me as some type of unhinged person who's not capable of having a rational dialogue.

       First you have to get to the bottom of actions Comey and Lynch in the cover up.  Once that is fully uncovered and measures are taken for accountability then a new investigation must be started on Clinton's crimes.

       It is no secret she committed crimes. She was using a personal email server to bypass the FOIA system and the records keeping act to hide her actions from public scrutiny. And in doing so she violated laws concerning the handling of classified material. Then when a subpoena was issued for the emails she violated the subpoena and obstructed justice by destroying evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       These crimes are all well known. But Clinton was so entrenched in the deep state corruption that her cronies tried to pull off a cover up.

       Trump has stopped the dismantlement of our country's sovereignty that was being done by entwining treaties. Trump has stopped the dismantling of our country by restoring it's boarders.

       Having the American government make everything free for me and my fellow citizens sounds like a way better deal than Trump calling himself a genius for being born rich and people cheering him for it. My tax dollars go to conquering the world. Why can't all of us get a free truck with some gasoline and say, $100 a week to get some food.

       Everytime I see this stuff, I always imagine someone saying it for Obama and the reaction people would have to it. If it makes me laugh, it's gotta be true. The problem with a two party system is the ability to obstruct the other's agenda effectively. So pick your poison. Want capitalism or capitalism lite?

       She's literally doing this same exact thing herself.  She's putting herself out there.  Personally, I couldn't care less.  I'm not a fan of the whataboutism, it doesn't go anywhere...except when the person is literally egging it on.

       Honestly, that reaction by her is way better than anything. The hag says nothing, CONSPIRACY, she says something, CONSPIRACY.

       Yet Trump gets unapologetic free reign to say what he wants whenever he wants.

       Honestly it's just funnier and funnier everytime I look at that tweet. Of all the people to buttery males it's Comey.

       Having the American government make everything free for me and my fellow citizens sounds like a way better deal than Trump calling himself a genius for being born rich and people cheering him for it. My tax dollars go to conquering the world. Why can't all of us get a free truck with some gasoline and say, $100 a week to get some food.

       Everytime I see this stuff, I always imagine someone saying it for Obama and the reaction people would have to it. If it makes me laugh, it's gotta be true. The problem with a two party system is the ability to obstruct the other's agenda effectively. So pick your poison. Want capitalism or capitalism lite?
