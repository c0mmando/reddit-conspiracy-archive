       Many Americans hated Obama as much as the liberals hate Trump.  For 8 years republicans put up with him.  They didn't organize protest, start riots, throw hissy fits or anything.  Especially, they didn't shit all over their own reputations.  Before they can govern a country they have to be able to govern themselves.  The republicans showed restraint for all 8 years and now the republicans will have to show restraint for decades to come.  It's the liberals own damn fault.  Get over it, get a life, get a job before the good ones are all taken.

       People have to be liberal to hate Trump.  A guy from New York who played a rich asshole on TV?  A close personal friend of the Clintons?  The guy who hasn't brought the troops home or lowered my taxes, or  ended the drug war, or stopped civil forfeiture?  Yeah, fuck that guy.  And fuck the lot of 'em supporting this permanent war.

       I think "the lot of 'em" covers most everyone.  But OK I play along did Obama take all the guns and sent us to the FEMA camps?  No I don't think that happened.  Invade Iraq?  No I think only guys named Bush do that.  But yes Obama has most of the negatives I listed for Trump, except being from New York.  Not that I have anything against New York outside of the Yankees. And I don't hate them completely, since their greatest star is a hometown hero.

       Do a quick Google search of abortion protests, gay marriage protests, 2nd ammendment advocates, the glenn beck rally, obamacare protests, etc. Its genuinely hilarious if you think conservatives were super polite and sat on their hands for 8 years while Obama was in office.

       There were definitely protests but the ridiculousness is off the charts with some of these people. Protests are natural and expected but shooting Congressmen (Scalise) is not. Obama's press secretary was never tossed out of a business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly disliked Obama but wished him and the country the best. I did not vote for Trump nor Obama (I'm a Ron Paul person) and I definitely don't agree with him on a lot of things but damn, I know people who are losing their minds, cutting off friends for voting for Trump. I have former students had their homes vandalized because they had Trump signs in their yard. I know anti Trump extremists that try to socially shame pro Trump students and professionals via doxxing and harassment. I never witnessed this shit happening among friends/acquaintances during Bush or Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see it as simply a liberal thing. The media absolutely hates him and doesn't hide it. There is plenty to criticize him (and all our leaders) on but damn, shit it ridiculous. I don't agree with him on everything but I want him and our country do improve- we have so many problems and it's awful to have to hide being proud of something significant like the North Korea thing because people are unhinged. People and media were not this ridiculous during obama. I can't talk with my father in law because he thinks Trump is literally hitler- simply mentioning his name transforms the mood- it's weird.

       I think what people dont realize is it's also the guy. Hes basically trolling over half the nation every day or so. Hes saying super controversial shit almost all the time.  He does a really good job at keeping his fans cheering and his opposition outraged. It's like his entire persona is playing a bad guy from the WWE.

       Loving every minute of what?  You make the point very clear here.  This is about personal feelings you have, that made you feel inferior, and you attempt to use baiting tactics and protests to put a bandaid on those feelings.  The truth is that you are sending American jobs overseas, incurring incredible taxes on what would be free trade, eliminating protections against nuclear weaponization by those who wish us harm, and slowly crippling the already overburdened American economy because your feelings were hurt.  Fuck your feelings mate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you enjoy it, but if you had half a brain you'd realize you are the one being played.  Your own crisis made you look like a wounded baby deer, lost and afraid, and you've walked right into their trap - too stupid to even realize you were the prey all along.

       Wounded feelings is all of it.    You are not really lucky.  I have a job and a life.  You can't even begin to counter the claims I made because you know they are correct, therefore you immediately jump to trying to hurt other peoples feelings in the same way your feelings were hurt.  I'm just not emotionally driven in the same way you are.  I'm driven by the objective reality.

       Oddly enough, you sound no different then the reaction people give when they start selling products in a pyramid multi-level marketing scheme.  You say, dont fret the details, because youre loving every minute! But despite the fact that your close friends wont say it, everyone knows youre only doing it because you are desperate.

       See how desperate you are?  You have no ability to begin to defend the policy, or complete lack of policy, of this administration.  You likely dont even understand it.  You just want to say that you are loving it in the same way someone would try to pretend that their feelings arent hurt by saying "I'm fine!"

       I'm assuming by loving every minute of it you mean that you love it when your president calls out the free presa as the enemy of the people and white conservatives force their way into business centers and gun down journalists, killing them outright.  Isnt that what you fucking mean?   You LOVE THAT DONT YOU.  You love watching people getting brutally murdered in their place of work just because you dont want anyone to be able to say anything you don't like about the president.  Just say that instead because thats precisely what you mean and everyone knows it.  You love watching Americans die at the command of the president.

       There were definitely protests but the ridiculousness is off the charts with some of these people. Protests are natural and expected but shooting Congressmen (Scalise) is not. Obama's press secretary was never tossed out of a business.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly disliked Obama but wished him and the country the best. I did not vote for Trump nor Obama (I'm a Ron Paul person) and I definitely don't agree with him on a lot of things but damn, I know people who are losing their minds, cutting off friends for voting for Trump. I have former students had their homes vandalized because they had Trump signs in their yard. I know anti Trump extremists that try to socially shame pro Trump students and professionals via doxxing and harassment. I never witnessed this shit happening among friends/acquaintances during Bush or Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see it as simply a liberal thing. The media absolutely hates him and doesn't hide it. There is plenty to criticize him (and all our leaders) on but damn, shit it ridiculous. I don't agree with him on everything but I want him and our country do improve- we have so many problems and it's awful to have to hide being proud of something significant like the North Korea thing because people are unhinged. People and media were not this ridiculous during obama. I can't talk with my father in law because he thinks Trump is literally hitler- simply mentioning his name transforms the mood- it's weird.

       I think what people dont realize is it's also the guy. Hes basically trolling over half the nation every day or so. Hes saying super controversial shit almost all the time.  He does a really good job at keeping his fans cheering and his opposition outraged. It's like his entire persona is playing a bad guy from the WWE.
