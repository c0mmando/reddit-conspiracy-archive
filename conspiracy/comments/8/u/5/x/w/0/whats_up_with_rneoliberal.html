       <a href="/r/starterpacks">
        /r/starterpacks

       , and I noticed that they have a daily discussion thread with thousands of comments in it every single day but only a few upvotes. I rarely see this amount of comments even at the top of /All.

       I also noticed that
       <a href="/r/centerleftpolitics">

       (who also posted in starterpacks) does the same thing but with less comments.

       But why do these threads get roughly the same amount of comments every day?

       They are probably 99% turff, What is being done is the creation of a false "public," dialog record, this as if there is no record of the fakery itself. Non verifiable users plus copy-cat and near copy-cat  comments.

       They want to extinguish progressives from the Democratic party.
      </p>
      <p>
       They feel like Bernie Sanders &amp; his mass of followers that registered as Democrats are a threat to them staying on the corporate lobbyist gravytrain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long term establishment Dem incumbents would rather lose junior seats &amp; the presidency to Republicans than risk progressive gaining even more steam &amp; taking their senior positions which means big corporate bribe money for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They went so far in Nevada that the Dem party executive board members elected themselves to those positions "For life". Essentially they either die &amp; the other members reappoint the new replacement or the member relinquishes their position to an approved member.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did this by an early vote held before the Nevada "Democratic" Convention.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DNC is trying to rewrite history &amp; pretend 2015/2016 never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were caught funneling donations from the state parties to the Clinton Victory Fund in the hopes that if she was elected they would get it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also allowed Clinton a loophole around election fundraising laws.

       Except these are daily threads, not weekly, and do you mind linking the ones you've seen that also regularly get over 4,000 comments per day?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, this sub has a featured documentary thread with just under 300 comments after 5 days. That seems pretty normal to me. 4,000-5,000 comments every single day does not seem normal. Especially on a sub that small.

       That is weird. I'm too lazy but a check of a few poster's record should show if that thread is all they do or not. But if it's so obscure, how do they all know about it? I suppose it might be referenced off a Twitter feed or something else external.

       I don't think they're organic. I'm (real) center left but I see shady topics on r/centerleftpolitics like "why America needs more immigrants" NO, I sympathize with victims of economic oppression and war, but mass immigration has NEOLIBERAL and NEOCONSERVATIVE CORPORATE GLOBALIST ROOT CAUSES (corporate jobs outsourcing, corruption and war forcing people to flee). If you're a real center left person, you would not allow such bullshit (unless you're ignorant/not woke). Of course I don't blame immigrants for bullshit the elites do but let's not let elites get away with it. Kill the root causes without hurting immigrants. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for r/neoliberal, well the whole ideology is a shill dream. Fake ass sub, no one likes NEOliberalism (it's so fucking close to corporate fascism). Well except ignorant self identifying "conservatives" who fell for Fox News-style new wave "conservative" talking heads on TV that just push NEOliberalism re-packaged as regular "conservativism". Lib and con meant something different decades ago, I think closer to centrist, not far right corporatist bullshit. There was more balance back then (FDR/JFK).

       Bernie and Hillary's platforms were super close.  How do you reconcile one being 'centrist' and the other 'far-right'?

       Also many Nordic countries embrace free market capitalism in the same manner Hillary does, perhaps even more so, given their reliance on oil reserves.  What about them do you consider 'centrist'?

       In the shortest explanation, Hillary was a warmonger NEOcon and wallstreet NEOliberal shill with corporate superPACs. Corporate media falsely gives the impression that they're both left wingers (just because of a few similar social issues), and falsely implies Trump/Clinton are polar opposites, when in fact they're fairly similar in having crap corporatist and interventionist policies and donors with conflicts of interest.

       These are just buzzwords lmao.  I would definitely not call her a neoliberal since she's not very pro-free market (domestically).  She radically differs from the neoliberal school of thought from the Reagan era, so I have no idea why you have connected the two other than by thinking of 'neoliberal' as a cussword for 'not a socialist.'

       I agree with people here that its probably used to age accounts, but I think there are defiantly real shills in there as well. Maybe they are training shills on this sub to then use around reddit?

       The reason the discussion thread is downvoted is that the sub started as a spinoff to
       <a href="/r/badeconomics">
        /r/badeconomics
       </a>
       , where it's tradition to downvote the discussion thread. This has a view reasons but was mainly to stick it to the mods, which were very strict in their enforcement of the rules.
       <br/>
       The tradition was continued in
       <a href="/r/neoliberal">
        /r/neoliberal
       </a>
       , but as the sub grew larger than /r/ BE, because it was more focussed on memes, and not so much on the technical analysis of random Reddit users, the DT grew, toom and therefore, there were more comments in the DT.
