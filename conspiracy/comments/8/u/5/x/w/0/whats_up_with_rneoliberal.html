<p>They feel like Bernie Sanders &amp; his mass of followers that registered as Democrats are a threat to them staying on the corporate lobbyist gravytrain. </p>

<p>Long term establishment Dem incumbents would rather lose junior seats &amp; the presidency to Republicans than risk progressive gaining even more steam &amp; taking their senior positions which means big corporate bribe money for them.</p>

<p>They went so far in Nevada that the Dem party executive board members elected themselves to those positions &quot;For life&quot;. Essentially they either die &amp; the other members reappoint the new replacement or the member relinquishes their position to an approved member.</p>

<p>They did this by an early vote held before the Nevada &quot;Democratic&quot; Convention.</p>

<p>The DNC is trying to rewrite history &amp; pretend 2015/2016 never happened.</p>

<p>They were caught funneling donations from the state parties to the Clinton Victory Fund in the hopes that if she was elected they would get it back.</p>

<p>It also allowed Clinton a loophole around election fundraising laws.</p>

I&#39;m (real) center left but I see shady topics on r/centerleftpolitics like &quot;why America needs more immigrants&quot; NO, I sympathize with victims of economic oppression and war, but mass immigration has NEOLIBERAL and NEOCONSERVATIVE CORPORATE GLOBALIST ROOT CAUSES (corporate jobs outsourcing, corruption and war forcing people to flee). If you&#39;re a real center left person, you would not allow such bullshit (unless you&#39;re ignorant/not woke). Of course I don&#39;t blame immigrants for bullshit the elites do but let&#39;s not let elites get away with it. Kill the root causes without hurting immigrants. :) </p>

<p>As for r/neoliberal, well the whole ideology is a shill dream. Fake ass sub, no one likes NEOliberalism (it&#39;s so fucking close to corporate fascism). Well except ignorant self identifying &quot;conservatives&quot; who fell for Fox News-style new wave &quot;conservative&quot; talking heads on TV that just push NEOliberalism re-packaged as regular &quot;conservativism&quot;. Lib and con meant something different decades ago, I think closer to centrist, not far right corporatist bullshit. There was more balance back then (FDR/JFK).</p>

Corporate media falsely gives the impression that they&#39;re both left wingers (just because of a few similar social issues), and falsely implies Trump/Clinton are polar opposites, when in fact they&#39;re fairly similar in having crap corporatist and interventionist policies and donors with conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>These are just buzzwords lmao.  I would definitely not call her a neoliberal since she&#39;s not very pro-free market (domestically).  She radically differs from the neoliberal school of thought from the Reagan era, so I have no idea why you have connected the two other than by thinking of &#39;neoliberal&#39; as a cussword for &#39;not a socialist.&#39;</p>

<p>Sounds like a good way to fuck America.  Wall Street is essential to the wealth that America as a whole has accumulated.  &#39;Fuck Wallstreet&#39;, like Bernie, is just a populist meme.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty sure Obamacare is expensive cronyist and neoliberal profiteering garbage</p>

<p>Oh, okay.  Glad your personal opinion on an extremely huge piece of legislature with huge consequences for the entire country can be boiled down in one sentence.  I feel like there&#39;s a pattern here...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your neoliberal sub is trash, pure establishment puppetry. We know there&#39;s a shill brigade. Enjoy reaganomics, which destroyed the middle class, just so greedy fuckers at the top can make a few more $$$.</p>

<p>All I hear is REEEEEEEEEEEE.</p>

Slap on the wrist was about Shillary&#39;s attitude towards banking regulation.
Lol Chavez&#39;s state capitalist authoritarian government, which you call no capitalism, which you also call socialism, interesting strawman.</p>

<p>Is that neoliberal urine trickling down yet? All I see are millions of poor people in a supposedly rich country. We both know this conversation is a waste of time, because you&#39;re fake and your ideology is twisted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the discussion thread is downvoted is that the sub started as a spinoff to <a href="/r/badeconomics">/r/badeconomics</a>, where it&#39;s tradition to downvote the discussion thread. This has a view reasons but was mainly to stick it to the mods, which were very strict in their enforcement of the rules.<br/>
The tradition was continued in <a href="/r/neoliberal">/r/neoliberal</a>, but as the sub grew larger than /r/ BE, because it was more focussed on memes, and not so much on the technical analysis of random Reddit users, the DT grew, toom and therefore, there were more comments in the DT.</p>
