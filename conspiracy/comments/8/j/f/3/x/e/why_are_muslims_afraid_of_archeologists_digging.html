       Personally I think it’s because they know Jerusalem ain’t there’s. History tells us that’s where King Solomon’s Temple is. And if ANY remains of the Temple was discovered shit would go Nuclear even more than America finally declaring we move the Embassy to Israel’s true historic capital. So why are Muslims so afraid of History? Especially when they control every corner of the Middle East EXCEPT the area controlled by the Jews.

       Interesting I’m from Haplogroup M172 according to the Nat Geo Test. And the path it showed is the same route as Haplogroup X but it didn’t declare me as being from Haplogroup X and even said I have Phoenician in me. Which probably explains my grandfathers obsession with Boats which comes from the Phoenicians as they built some amazing ships.

       Destruction of ancient heritage is the calling card of Mystery Babylon. The Saudis answer to their creators: the British Crown. As the current seat of global freemasonry they are the latest in a line of oligarchy parasites dating back from the time of the Babylon Empire. So whilst commendable you’re ire is somewhat misplaced - it’s fruitless to blame the pawn for the moves of the player.

       It also explains why Iran won’t Attack Jerusalem despite them always talking shit about destroying them. If the Temple Mount gets destroyed you will have to clean up the ruins and the Israeli Government will find the remains of the Temple of Solomon

       Also, if I understand prophecy, the day will come when Israel is going to have to drop everything and run for their lives.  Someone will get the balls to try to wipe them out again.  If that's the case, where will America be?  Turned against them of facing our own demise?

       America will be brought to it's knees by TPTB to support the deception that America is Mystery Babylon (my theory).  The Antichrist will come to power after the catching away and drive Israel to the mountains (Biblical prophecy).

       Perhaps it belongs to no religious sect and really is just the old Fort of Antonia, a Roman fort and not the Temple Mount at all. So why are the Hebrews afraid to address this bit of History? Probably because it places the temple all in a pile of rubble just like Jesus said - not a stone would be left standing.

       We know that Muhammad was jealous/impressed by the monotheistic religions of Jerusalem when his matriarchal wife sent him on a trade mission there.  After he returned from the region he started trying to copy the success of the Jews and their holy book.  As a matter of fact the Quran assumes the reader is familiar with the Jewish and Christian literature and doesn't bother to even copy the borrowed parts such as the forbidden nature of homosexuality.  No where in the Quran does it mention homosexuality being wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tendency for Islam to try to overwrite other religions Genesis of ideas and even their holy sites is why so many other religions have issues existing next door to Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the kaaba is just a recycled pagan holy site that existed before Muhammad was even born.

       Counterpoint: It is very thoroughly maintained throughout Islam’s teachings that it is a follow-up to the teachings of prior prophets, and is an improvement upon existing doctrine. Also, yes, the Quran does not frequently take an overt position on homosexuality, but it does have the story of Lut, and there’s a pretty logical follow-through from its explicit outline of who can marry whom.

       This is actually really fundamental stuff that is more or less fully agreed on, the disagreements are on legalities and methodologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m afraid your knowledge in this regard is not equal from my knowledge, from what I can plainly read, and from my own decades of immersive experience studying Islam. I am simply pointing out something you said about my religion’s most fundamental doctrine that is misinformed and inaccurate. What you wrote, however, is interesting and coherent.

       Oh. You’re following the exact same falsified propaganda that’s inundated social media in general - I don’t know what to tell you besides that this is simply not true. I would direct you to sources but have a feeling you would not want to read them.

Why do you prohibit what God has made lawful for you, in terms of your Coptic handmaiden Māriya — when he lay with her in the house of Hafsa, who had been away, but who upon returning [and finding out] became upset by the fact that this had taken place in her own house and on her own bed — by saying, ‘She is unlawful for me!’, seeking, by making her unlawful [for you], to please your wives? And God is Forgiving, Merciful, having forgiven you this prohibition.” Tafsir Al-jalalain on verse 66:1

       I'm sorry your prophet was a crazy person.  You know Muhammad himself was convinced he was talking to demons and not God until later. He was most likely correct with his initial instinct.

       It is quite literally about the consumption of honey, and not sex. Muslims are well aware of the misinterpretation because of how frequently it’s been spread around as of late - simply writing that it’s more commonly accepted doesn’t make it so.
      </p>

       Sorry, but while I understand your reservations as someone who was agnostic for a considerable length of time, you are absolutely consulting falsified information.

       Point is - I think you should actually read the Quran before commenting on it based on a rudimentary acquaintance, or scouting for interpretations off unverified sources. That in sum is what I really wanted to say.

       When you say misinterpretation you're acknowledging that the verse is real, just not being interpreted correctly.  But here is the thing, the whole book if packed full of shit like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Muhammad's 6 year old wife a misinterpretation?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is killing apostates a misinterpretation?
      </p>
      <p>
       And does it even matter when Muslims themselves apparently are interpreting incorrectly as well.  Since they do all those things in real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Misinterpretation or not it's affecting everyone's reality.  But in reality we all know it's not an interpenetration, it's just an embarrassing quote from the Muhammad warlord, founder of the religion of peace.
