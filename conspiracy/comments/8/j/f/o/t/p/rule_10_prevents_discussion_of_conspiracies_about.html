<p>I&#39;m not saying this is what this post is attempting to do, but.....</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself, but I personally have never had bad experiences with the mods on this sub. I try to be civil in conversations whenever possible, yet I can understand how certain heated conversations can devolve into insults, especially when you have people attacking you, following you, insulting you,... or even all of those things combined (which I have seen is sadly the experience for some users here).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m generally in favor of rule 10 existing as it prevents discussion from boiling down to baseless accusations, ad hominem fallacies and &quot;shooting the messenger&quot; rather than responding to the actual content of the message.</p>

<p>But you do make a good point here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been around long enough to have seen plenty of threads that go against one or multiple moderators survive, and many that didn&#39;t get far before being removed.</p>

<p>I do think that it&#39;d be good to have an open and frank conversation about several of the more high-profile moderators, but I don&#39;t see how this could be reliably done with this rule in place in this form. Again I approve of the general idea of the rule, but it prevents important conversations from taking place as well.</p>

<p>Several moderators are active in the subreddit while maintaining a moderator role. This creates a conflict of interest. It is also evident that certain narratives are being pushed by certain moderators.</p>

<p>As other users have pointed out, a large part of what is and isn&#39;t considered under rule 10 is at moderator discretion, and conducting yourself in a proper manner while writing an honest and frank critique is a good first step, but there is no guarantee that it&#39;ll be tolerated, and I think that needs to change.</p>

<p>I approve of your message, OP.</p>

<p>Now how to fix this is a more difficult component. I think it could be an interesting concept to have the next major sticky post be on the topic of community feedback, where the moderators ask the users of their gripes and critiques with regards to how the subreddit is run. I however do not expect the moderators to concede to such a request, but if any read this, please do feel invited to create such a thread.</p>

<p>In the scenario that that doesn&#39;t happen though I think it&#39;s important to continue creating threads like these. As long as the phrasing is mature, well-composed and factual, it /should/ not be removed.</p>

<p>(un)fortunately, depending on perspective, Reddit is not a democratic system when it comes to the governance of its subreddits. All we can do is apply pressure within the bounds of the rules, but I worry that one day those bounds will become too tight for voices like these to speak up. This is something we should remain vigilant of.</p>

<p>The mods here have never been above reproach.  They&#39;ve been fiercely criticized on numerous occasions, and have been exceptionally transparent in their moderation activities. </p>

<p>This subreddit and its mods pushed reddit admins for features that improve moderation transparency, like public moderation logs.  </p>

<p>Dissatisfied with how censored reddit has become, mods of this sub (myself included) wrote bots and operated <a href="/r/uncensorship">/r/uncensorship</a> and <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>.  Just look at the side-bar in &quot;Moderator Transparency&quot; for more examples.  Show me another subreddit with 650k+ subscribers operating with this level of transparency.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a new thing, either.  We implemented this 4+ years ago!  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> moderators were pioneers in this area - no other subreddit operated with that level of openness and transparency of moderator actions. </p>

<p>Great, take it somewhere else... You think having a rule to keep meta posts from attacking the Mods, while having dedicated subs who like to fuck with this pace, isn&#39;t a good idea????  I honestly think most meta posts should be removed, focus on honest conspiracies... And if you think there is a conspiracy amongst the ranks of the mod team, then take it somewhere else... Try go posting critiques on r/politics or news about the moderators over there, good luck, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ikx7g/hey_rpolitics_i_have_a_question_for_you_guys/">it use to be allowed</a>... But it distracts from the purpose of that sub... So take it else where, no one&#39;s stopping you.  </p>

<p>Great, take it somewhere else... You think having a rule to keep meta posts from attacking the Mods, while having dedicated subs who like to fuck with this place, isn&#39;t a good idea????  I honestly think most meta posts should be removed, focus on honest conspiracies... And if you think there is a conspiracy amongst the ranks of the mod team, then take it somewhere else... Try go posting critiques of the mods at r/politics or news, good luck, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ikx7g/hey_rpolitics_i_have_a_question_for_you_guys/">it use to be allowed</a>... But it distracts from the purpose of that sub... So take it else where, no one&#39;s stopping you.  </p>

<p>Huh, I thought you would have been shocked to find out the mods had removed a post containing evidence of the mods talking with selected users about how to run the sub. Instead you tell me the post shouldn&#39;t be here and bring up r/politics as if it has anything to do with the topic at hand.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: If you honestly care about discussing conspiracies, you should recognize circle jerking about the mods is the last thing you want on this sub... And I say that as a long-time subscriber.</p>

<p>Lol so talking about the mods means someone doesn&#39;t honestly care about discussing theories?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: I&#39;ll say this since I&#39;ve become a mod here, the amount of BS these guys &amp; gals put up with is unimaginable.  I had no clue until a couple months ago, and the amount of shit I see spit at us in mod mail is astronomical.  I show my wife every Saturday morning when we wake up, how many times I&#39;ve been called &quot;faggot&quot; since we went to sleep.... Or want to rape And murder our children (I don&#39;t show the wife that)... And that&#39;s the norm... Yes, there is probably biases, we all have them, but to pretend we should allow constant attacks on our mods is utterly ridiculous IMO.  Like I said, take it somewhere else.</p>

<p>Why would I be shocked?  I couldn&#39;t care less about those leaks or what people think of conclave.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, my view on moderating has changed a lot over the years and especially since I&#39;ve become a mod.  I have come to loath the meta drama bullshit and think it has no place on the sub and is a complete distraction.  With that said, I think we should be criticized for our actions, we all have biases, bad days or don&#39;t see thing it from another perspective.  I just don&#39;t think it should be on the forum at this point... I use too, sure, but for the amount of shit I see being sent into mod mail, it&#39;s all a distraction imo and should be dealt with out side.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure, although I don&#39;t think any other sub, especially one as controversial as ours, has opened up dialog between the users and mods on how we should manage the sub.  I&#39;ve even proposed we open conclave to the public after each discussion so we can have our discussion manipulation free, then make it private when we have another convo.  I&#39;ve seen plenty of subs ruled by mods with little to no regard for what the community has to say, and think conclave is gift imo.</p>

<p>It was a post about Childish Gambino&#39;s womanly physique. Something that I noticed off the bat and while I might be a Baphomet worshipping androgyne myself, I&#39;ve got no problems discussing and correcting people&#39;s incorrect assumptions. </p>

<p>Reddit is a controlled narrative and the mods here aren&#39;t exempt. If someone is posting hateful videos regularly with vitriolic comments and no attempts at a civil discussion, then you can start to censor them. But that wasn&#39;t evidently the problem. It seems more like the mod in question simply wanted to deter any conversation about sexual morphology altogether. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who&#39;s argued against moderation for years, and ironically is a mod now, I don&#39;t mind rule 10.  There are so many people/subs whom would love to fuck with this place, especially if we allowed meta posts that attack the mods, It&#39;s an essential rule imo.  There are plenty of subs that would love to help someone rub one out, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s censorship, and your free to take your gripes there.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re generally free to discuss that here, but there&#39;s two things that I don&#39;t think should be tolerated in any sub: </p>

<ol>
<li>Discussions about the moderators infesting threads that are devoted to other conpsiracy theories</li>
<li>Discussions about the moderators taking up an inordinate amount of the /hot or /new queues. </li>
</ol>

<p>At the point where either of those two are broken, the sub doesn&#39;t function well, and it makes it harder to have conversations about the subject matter this sub is for. </p>

<p>A post like this? I say go for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the mods that we know to be involved in conspiracies? Are we going to be banned for discussing that? Is the fact that <a href="/u/jamescolespardon">/u/jamescolespardon</a> is a male sex worker now censored? If he is going to be pushing his degenerate agenda to legalize prostitution it should be known that he has a vested interest in its legalization. Zir is hiding behind &quot;workers rights&quot; and their position as a mod and not coming clean that they are in fact a high end male escort.. It&#39;s just sketch! Whatever.

I have received bans for most lamest of reasons from randomest subs. Like I referred to an image on thathappened, of a fat lady as land whale and got a one day ban XD just because it prompted a discussion by some snowflake. So you know, they are now policing by orders of snowflakes regarding mildy offencive comments that arent even in subs that have culture of snowflakes....</p>

<p>People have sent the mods images of them moderating unfairly using the mod log to back it up. They were muted and made fun of. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The mods here have never been above reproach.  They&#39;ve been fiercely criticized on numerous occasions, and have been exceptionally transparent in their moderation activities. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve been called a troll for bringing up issues with moderation, they have a secret sub that select users who seem to be immune to bans get invited to.</p>

<p>I genuinely dont see how you can actually monitor the mod log and come to the conclusion that their biases do not interfere with fair moderation. </p>
