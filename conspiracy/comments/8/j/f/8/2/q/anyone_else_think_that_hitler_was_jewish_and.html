    <div class="md"><p>I really hope your post was honest in nature and not disguised anti-semitism (which it closely resembles), so I&#39;ll honor it with a straight answer: there is literally no, and I mean 0, chance of this having been the case.         </p>

<p>Not only is the &quot;protection&quot; that the jewish community receives nowadays insignificant in comparison to <em>6 million lives</em>, there&#39;s simply no feasible way Hitler could/would have planned so far in advance and considered all the possible outcomes. I&#39;m sorry, but to anyone who believes in this theory, you might as well be preaching that doctors advise drinking water as healthy only to put brainwashing substances in it. It&#39;s beyond illogical and plain ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Germany was not punished enough after WWI, not even by the vengeful French (due to Sedan), that&#39;s why we&#39;ve got Hitler, along with the hypernationalistic military creating conspiracy theories that they were winning the war, it&#39;s not like the tanks and infantry of the Entente would have blitkrieged into Germany in 1919 with thousands of tanks and heavy artillery.... The Entente should have gone full 1945-style occupation, German military should have been beheaded like Japan&#39;s in 1945.</p>

<p>And Dresden was a legitimate military target, stop believing Göbbels&#39; speeches, look up the inner reports of the nazis where you can see the real casualties. And remember Warsaw, Rotterdam, Coventry: &quot;The Nazis entered this war under the rather childish delusion that they were going to bomb everybody else, and nobody was going to bomb them. At Rotterdam, London, Warsaw, and half a hundred other places, they put that rather naïve theory into operation. They sowed the wind, and now, they are going to reap the whirlwind.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if Hitler was Jewish but either way, it&#39;s possible that the elites used Hitler as a way to establish the non-Biblical Israel, created in the 20th century. A country that has a corrupt zionist government that treats Palestinians like shit. It could have been some force that doesn&#39;t particularly care about &quot;Jews&quot; but about imperialism. German cross thing looks like the Templar symbol. Coincidence? I&#39;m not knowledgeable on these matters but all wars are banksters&#39; wars. No one was innocent IMO.</p>
