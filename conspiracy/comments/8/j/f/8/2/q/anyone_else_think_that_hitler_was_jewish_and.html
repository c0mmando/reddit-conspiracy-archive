       It’s just a theory of mine, possibly far-fetched to some, but I’m interested to see if anyone else has thought this too. The way I see it, if my theory is correct and Hitler was the man I believe he may have been, 6 million (or whatever the number may be) Jewish deaths is a small price to pay to ensure that Israel is one day set up in a position to dominate the world.

       I really hope your post was honest in nature and not disguised anti-semitism (which it closely resembles), so I'll honor it with a straight answer: there is literally no, and I mean 0, chance of this having been the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only is the "protection" that the jewish community receives nowadays insignificant in comparison to
       <em>
        6 million lives
       </em>
       , there's simply no feasible way Hitler could/would have planned so far in advance and considered all the possible outcomes. I'm sorry, but to anyone who believes in this theory, you might as well be preaching that doctors advise drinking water as healthy only to put brainwashing substances in it. It's beyond illogical and plain ridiculous.

       I've been to Germany this January, visited Dachau myself, and that's the number I remembered, and a quick look at Wikipedia proved me not far off. And I gotta tell you - visiting the camps, actually seeing the Nazi apparatus in person and how everything was run on the inside, I don't believe the number to be incorrect in the slightest. It's entirely disgusting.

       How so? Are you denying that Israel is protected right now? They’re doing as they please. Can you really not see a possible connection there?

       There's a difference between acknowledging Israel gets special treatment.... And flat out saying Hitler was secretly jewish and killed millions for future-proofing against criticism to the ideology he spent his entire life to force out of existence.

       You are right Israel is completely protected.

       There is zero evidence of the holocaust. Hitler was a multi decorated war hero from WW1 who had some of the most difficult assignments there were.

       Germany was not punished enough after WWI, not even by the vengeful French (due to Sedan), that's why we've got Hitler, along with the hypernationalistic military creating conspiracy theories that they were winning the war, it's not like the tanks and infantry of the Entente would have blitkrieged into Germany in 1919 with thousands of tanks and heavy artillery.... The Entente should have gone full 1945-style occupation, German military should have been beheaded like Japan's in 1945.

       And Dresden was a legitimate military target, stop believing Göbbels' speeches, look up the inner reports of the nazis where you can see the real casualties. And remember Warsaw, Rotterdam, Coventry: "The Nazis entered this war under the rather childish delusion that they were going to bomb everybody else, and nobody was going to bomb them. At Rotterdam, London, Warsaw, and half a hundred other places, they put that rather naïve theory into operation. They sowed the wind, and now, they are going to reap the whirlwind."

       I don't know if Hitler was Jewish but either way, it's possible that the elites used Hitler as a way to establish the non-Biblical Israel, created in the 20th century. A country that has a corrupt zionist government that treats Palestinians like shit. It could have been some force that doesn't particularly care about "Jews" but about imperialism. German cross thing looks like the Templar symbol. Coincidence? I'm not knowledgeable on these matters but all wars are banksters' wars. No one was innocent IMO.

       I don't understand your comment, but yes, current estimates of jews, roma and other minorities persecuted are of around 6 million lives lost to mass extermination.
