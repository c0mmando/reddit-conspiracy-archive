        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I came home today after a rough day at work and went out on the deck to enjoy a post-work beer and wax philosophical.</p>

<p>In the midst of my reverie I got a text and after, while my phone was out, checked in on Reddit. Ten or so minutes later I realize that I&#39;m just infinitely scrolling down, reading titles, but not having any thoughts of my own.</p>

<p>This is when it occurred to me that between Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, and the like we can all endlessly scroll through content. On one hand this is a great thing. On the other hand, I find I can&#39;t have my internal monologue while scrolling. It&#39;s as if we&#39;ve all chosen to replace those precious moments with our own mind with other people&#39;s content.</p>

<p>I understand it, I&#39;ve long had the theory that, more than anything else, humans crave novelty. We are ever on the hunt for new sights and sounds and ideas. This is obviously a benefit as it drives innovation and creativity. But it seems a terrible waste that, in the digital age with unprecedented access to information, we&#39;ve so quickly resorted to supplanting our own thoughts and visions with those of others.</p>

<p>How does this relate to conspiracy? It seems to me that our thoughts are less our own than ever. By replacing our own unique inner monologue with a flurry of headlines it&#39;s easier for what seem to be our own ideas to actually be regurgitations of the thoughts of others. </p>

<p>The real kicker? That like most human blunders this is not a constructed plot but something we&#39;ve done to ourselves.</p>

<p>At the end of the day though, we all live in a golden age of information dissemination. The world is a beautiful place no matter how dark the shadows. Peace and Love</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first of all- kudos to your for taking some time to listen to your inner self and write up something, for those of us staring into the black mirror to stumble upon. Funny how that works- right? You highlight a very real issue, and contribute a great piece recognizing it, but it also <em>contributes</em> to the issue by adding to the &quot;infinite scroll&quot; of content.</p>

<p>Anyways, I think that the issues you describe are easily remedied if one has the self discipline to do so- though that is far easier said than done. Social Media is a fucking plague and should, in my opinion, be avoided at all costs. If someone needs to get hold of me they can text or better yet call- I don&#39;t need a snap message or a Twitter DM or an FB Messenger app etc;</p>

<p>Disconnecting from technology is important for the very reason you highlight- it allows us to connect with <em>ourselves</em>. This doesn&#39;t mean completely disconnecting from tech forever- but the longer the better, and as little as possible the better. Again- easier said than done.</p>

<p>Those are just my thoughts on your post that I stumbled upon in my own infinite scrolling, sipping a beer after a long day of work.</p>

<p>Stay safe out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I do agree with sentiment of not using the meat of most social medias, what difference would it make if you get texted or snapchatted? Shouldn’t the real difference be if you want to make contact at all make physical contact? It just really makes you think is it just social media to blame, the little computers in our pockets altogether, or just people with no self-control leeching the negativity out to others. I’m aware enough to not NEED Instagram or Facebook or Snapchat to get through the day, but does that mean I should just actively put out everybody in my life who has yet to learn what’s really important and what’s not? (And I’m only 19 so that would be seriously be around 95% of the people I know of)</p>

I am grateful for being in the older generations that feed our brains by SEEKING information... so in the modern flood you are less likely to simply be a victim of the ever-scrolling newsfeed</p>

<p>I am not so sure it was completely innocent though.... speicific actions have been designed into the apps and software to  mimic addictive behaviours....   </p>

<p>being 100% aware of your actions, and the reasoning behind them helps a lot.  Why did you jsut pic up your phone??? was it because you wanted to or caus eit rang a bell an dlike pavlovs dogs you immediately had to pick it up???</p>

<p>self awareness is the key - imo</p>

<p>This is such a key concept. One of my favorite points in one of my favorite lectures by Daniel Ganser, wherein he discusses the importance of self-directed education instead of mindless consumption of &quot;the news&quot;. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgkQXJ3mugY">link to particular talk on 9/11 and empire</a>)</p>

<p>back in the day before these sites and the internet, some MF&#39;s were posted up all day in the library, book stores, always buying more, always seeking more info, now it just digital, and we can self direct our expansion of knowledge (And I personally learn something new every time I visit this sub)</p>

<p>At any moment, we have free will to unplug and have our own thoughts and experiences, and its important to have a healthy relationship and not become addicted to too much seeking. I am certainly guilty of spending too much time on this sub</p>

<p>One counterpoint: I feel that actual new ideas are rare. They tend to be variants of things others have done, said, or thought. So, for most people, more access to more ideas is the best many people can hope for. This is a golden age for them. </p>

<p>But those that can have thought, well they need to carve out time to think. And in this time, that is damn hard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should rephrase. It&#39;s more that my appreciation for history is largely the result of his podcast. He doesn&#39;t talk about military formations or go on endlessly about political negotiations, instead he focuses on the human element, what it&#39;d be like to be an everyday soldier or citizen thrust into a global conflict. He&#39;s also so clearly passionate about the subject that it makes me care, even if it&#39;s a topic I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be interested in.</p>

<p>The Hardcore History series on WWI, Blueprint for Armageddon, is hands down the best audio content I&#39;ve ever listened to.</p>

I like the theory that the middle ages is at least partially fabricated, so some pope could rule in the year 1000 when really it was only around 400ad. But beyond that I&#39;m not all that familiar nor does the theory entice me that much.</p>

<p>If anything, I ascribe to the theory that human history is much longer than we currently have records of. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve collected a wide array of inputs that I rank and prioritize based on the themes and memes of the day and week and use social media (think of it like a second tier of information sharing, where if you see what is being amplified, and by whom, a more true picture presents itself most of the time).</p>

<p>Learning how to read Form 990s is something you can do in a weekend.</p>

<p>All of them - unfortunately.  Some yoy can subcontract out (it&#39;s the American way) and others required more effort (like seeing the darker side of the information war behind the curtain here, for example). But you, like all others, is a valuable input for me.</p>

<p>So I <em>thank you</em> for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still have what most people would consider tortoise-speed internet, and I must say I somewhat prefer it a lot of the time. Sure, it&#39;s annoying if I want to watch HD video, but on a site like reddit, the brief pause of a couple seconds as the page loads gives a bit of respite for my own thoughts to have a chance. Reminds me of dialup in a nostalgic way. You used to have to make conscious decisions about what pages to load, as each hyperlink was a time investment just to load.</p>

<p>I certainly notice the difference when I&#39;m on a fast connection. I click and the next page is loaded before I even recognize that its loading. In such a way, my thoughts feel much more <em>led</em> or <em>coaxed</em> in certain directions, rather than my own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw in an <a href="/r/interestingasfuck">/r/interestingasfuck</a> thread earlier, on a post of a dude making a painting. He was painting upside down, and I had no idea what it was of until he spun it around, and added the final touch.
It was super cool.</p>

<p>A comment or said “ya know, painting upside down just doesn’t do it for me anymore.”
And I’m sure the comment was light-hearted and meant nothing more than that.</p>

<p>Still, I couldn’t help but feel similar to you (at least I think).
That this person, and really anybody with a computer or smart phone, can just flick through all these <em>amazing</em> things, all the accomplishments of humanity. Beautiful scenery, you name it.
How can someone <em>not</em> feel underwhelmed after a while?
I know that’s not the case for everybody. But still.
I can see how “novelty” is ironically becoming even more of its own definition. </p>

<p>The endless scrolling is mostly why I deleted most social media, I’d just scroll through a bunch of mindless shit and posts I did not care about, seemed overwhelming.</p>

<p>Thats not to say the internet doesn&#39;t have some great content.</p>

<p>I also find that I think about books a lot, I stop between chapters and reflect. This is key, I&#39;m describing what I perceive as the danger of a constant stream of content without breaks, like chapters or page breaks, to snap us out of the haze.</p>

<p>I think it is important that everybody put aside time to let the thoughts flow, and this is why i despise FB (because people grow to fear their own minds) but i&#39;m not sure if it would ever be possible to lose such the ability for such mindless thought - sure you could give yourself a complex and lose it due to the fear of the idea of losing it (anxiety) but i don&#39;t think it is permanent - so i&#39;m not worried.</p>

<p>The real kicker? That like most human blunders this is not a constructed plot but something we&#39;ve done to ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no, we all signed up willingly, but there were strong social pressures to do so. Just like alcohol, smoking, automobiles, pornography and similar habits people adopt, it&#39;s often pushed by people for their own self-interest, ignoring the negative externalities.
The people peddling these things <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked">know that they are addictive</a>, but given the unregulated nature of software products, they can kinda do what they like.</p>

<p>Smartphones are the extension of the <a href="https://steveblank.com/secret-history/">military industrial complex</a>, often technology was developed for dual use. E.g.  Phones make for great tracking devices for intelligence organisations, yet offer a great benefit of being able to communicate with others, or CMOS chips, allowed smartphone cameras to be, but also very useful for surveillance programs.</p>

<p>Governments pick winners, and in the case of many nations, advanced technologies have been predicted decades earlier with the sociological implications also considered by think-tanks.
Infinite scroll is yet another great tool to suck attention out of people to make sure that they think the right things, it has it&#39;s unintended consequences, but it&#39;s a great boredom sapper.
It&#39;s just like television isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason is most dystopian films have television like things, a bored group of people are dangerous, that&#39;s why so many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/21/books-interview-david-graeber-the-utopia-of-rules">pointless jobs exist</a>, it&#39;s about making sure that the neo-liberal consensus is maintained and that existing structures of power managed for the benefit of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superclass_(book">super-class</a>) is maintained.</p>

<p>Things can be re-structured for the better, but often there is covert/overt inflitration of any group which threatens this hegemony.
There is a reason many activists and thought-leaders have had sudden deaths or get assassinated by lone-wolves, senseless acts of violence do happen but timing should make many suspicious.
People will always rally around those with powerful visions of the future, they don&#39;t have to be practical, real or even a physical possibility, but you can get followers when people drop their individualism and give themselves up to a group. Only when you see many in the middle-classes giving themselves up can real change happen.
But many shy away from power, especially on the left. It&#39;s a dirty word and the imposition of it is seen as inherently bad.
Those who have fewer qualms about the terrifying possible consequences of revolution and power will win out, and there will always be a group motivated to take control in any chasm. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling, read some books, think about your biases and reduce your inane scrolling. But think about some of the benefits, anyone can learn about most things via Khan Academy, research scientists have access to all academic research via Scihub, families can communicate very cheaply across borders, communities can form too. It&#39;s a tool, treat it like such.</p>

<p>Also look at DT and twitter, it&#39;s like they made 180 characters tweets possible before Trump for a reason...  </p>

<p>Also 180 characters is not enough for delving into information or news, but it is preferred to keep dumbing us down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe but we willingly and gladly participate because were were pulled into it by smart and devious marketers who are experts on how to use human behavior to their advantage.</p>

<p>Why are there so many MMO browser games out there (many thousands)? All free too. Is it because, out of the kindness of their hearts, they want to make us happy? All those games are basically the same. And every single one of them is trying to bind the user/player to them so he will spend as much time on them as possible. Just like the social media which are trying to commandeer the users&#39; attenttion, focus and thoughts.</p>

<p>The infinite scroll makes me laugh, and removes my boredom.</p>

<p>The infinite scroll conditions us, to be more ideal, more in line with the infinite scroll&#39;s perfect consumer.</p>

<p>Thanks to the infinite scroll, I no longer need nature or social interaction to balance and stimulate the natural release of dopamine, for the infinite scroll will guide my release as I partake in its essence.</p>

<p>The infinite scroll comforts me, as I no longer have to have my own thoughts, no longer having to deal with putting together pieces of information about our world.</p>

<p>Some say we are mindless drones, but no, we are followers of the infinite scroll. Join the infinite scroll&#39;s goodness, and you will be removed of your old-fashioned needs and wants. Endless funny videos, Gifs, and useless DIYs and cooking videos all in your grasp. </p>

<p>Let your child be baptized in the infinite scroll, for fear not, whether now or later, you WILL be a part of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that anything can be abused. What I was trying to lay out was not an indictment of the internet itself, but rather an observation that the ability to scroll near infinitely through content was not adding to my internal thought, and instead seems to replace that inner monologue. This may not be the case for you or anyone else. People staring at their phones to avoid awkward silence or boredom takes on a darker nature when it&#39;s not just an escape from the outside world but potentially an escape from their own thoughts. </p>

<p>You say self discipline and willpower is all you need, and that&#39;s true, but it can be difficult to muster 24/7. Similarly, one could exclaim &quot;everything in moderation!&quot; and claim to have solved the woes of the world, sadly it&#39;s never that simple.</p>
