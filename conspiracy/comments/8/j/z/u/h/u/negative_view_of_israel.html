       I have been on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for over a year now and have enjoyed every bit of it. It is an area where we can all come to think critically about issues and events to find out the truth! However, with the recent events that have been taking place in the Middle East, namely Israel and Palestine, this subreddit seems to be very anti-Israel's side on any issue that seems to pop up. I have been following most of the stories that have come through news sources as well as
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and see a very negative view on anything Israel does. It was recently confirmed that 50 of the 62 Palestine citizens that were killed were Hamas members and three of the others were linked with Jihadist organizations (I will leave links of the stories down below). This subreddit has always been willing to look at both sides to stories and make rational decisions based upon the facts, yet with this issue I feel negative opinions/ straight up hate towards Israel. So my question is, why is this? We cannot simply allow our emotions or personal bias to seep into seeing the final outcome of situations. If anyone is willing to explain why there is such a negative view of Israel in this subreddit, I am all ears. Just from my point of view I do not feel that the right approach to figuring out the current crisis between the two nations.

       Israel is one of the few places in the Middle East that has an insane amount of human rights and freedoms, I don't quite understand what they are violating? Nations have taken and stolen land from one another since the beginning of time. Can you explain?

       look at the link. im at work don't have time to unpack it all.

       i will say, just because it has been the norm (fight for territory etc) doesn't mean it should stay the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       although palestine has not got it's own state they are still entitled to some of the land which was sectioned off for them after ww1 israeli civs have been moving into the territory and basically 'taking it over'

       I don't know what yhe answer is but I know both sides are lying. And I think it's Hamas and the Israeli elites driving this endless war. And this forced ghetto engagement is immoral and cruel Israel should he required to do better or we should cut funding or use it to help the Gaza and West bank set up infrastructure.

       I read an autobiography of an ex-Hamas guy.  Wish I could remember er the title bit im too tired.  It was a heart breaking and memorable story. He showed how both sides manipulate the young and basically get them killed.

       Well if I was lobbing Molotov cocktails from my couch at the neighbors house I might get invaded by police.
      </p>

       I know the Israelis sent a warning out not to approach the gates or whatever and that is like a dare to Hamas. And innocent Palestinians get caught in the cross fire.  Seems to me sometimes Hamas really works for the Israeli war machine making sure no peace can be brokered by either side and that the worst on both sides get to killing each other.  The Israeli leaders that want killing get a win win and can have an excuse to terrorise women in their homes as a response.

       you know if i were an empire that had been around for a few thousand years and people got wise to my schemes and symbols, i'd maybe think about creating another group of people who used the same kinda symbols, and breed them into being a "bad guy" that i could then blame on all sorts of things.  i'd pay the leaders of "team bad guy" well and provide them with protection as long as they'd go along with setting up the rest of their folk to be fall guy.  i'd indoctrinate them since youth in all sorts of bullshit and insulate them from criticism or even the tools for handling criticism - and i'd reinforce this mentality by using the excuse of racism.  and then i'd go back to my home, well away from "team bad guy" and hang out in my position of privilege that's been that way for hundreds of years.  i might even eat some haggis, yorkshire pudding, drink some scotch, and hang around with my unnecessarily violent asshole culture laughing at the retards who can't see the setup i've arranged.  hahaha!  jokes on them i'd say.  they'll never notice the big eyes, the hair colour, the symbols that have lasted thru egyptian times ;)  they'll never trace the history i'd tell myself.
