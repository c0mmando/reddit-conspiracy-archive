        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I find it hilarious that for as long as I can remember any criticism of Israel would get you branded an anti-semite.  I myself was often accused as such, but suddenly it&#39;s perfectly okay with everyone, news outlets and radio shows.  Go ahead! It&#39;s open season on Israel now! I have zero problems with anyone criticizing Israel, I encourage it!</p>

<p>What exactly changed?  The only thing I can really see that changed is the existing deep state (pro-trump) lost the bid for the 2016 election and now everything it falling apart.</p>

<p>This is the best universe.  The instability that Trump has caused in the western power structures in beyond doubt.  You don&#39;t have to like the guy, I could care less if you do but you can&#39;t deny how much bullshit is being exposed during this time of instability.</p>

<p>I fucking love it.   </p>

<p>All of a sudden Kim Jong Un was being complimented during the winter games, then he starts hatching a deal with Trump (better hate him again!). Israel is no longer the Media darling it was. Suddenly we love domestic spying, and this Logan ACT back and forth is also hilarious.</p>

<p>Fucking classic!</p>

<p>All you have to do is cheer for the guy and beg him to legalize marijuana and he&#39;d probably do it.  Seems like an opportunity squandered to me.  A populist president responds to popular outcry.  Instead we have people denouncing him and wearing pussy hats.  LMFAO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of hole you&#39;ve been living in but criticism of Israel has always been perfectly okay .</p>

<p>Overly vociferous criticism has often been unfairly labelled Anti-Semitism, and yes some people have a far too sensitive response.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean that some of the loudest criticism of Israel isn&#39;t bigoted in its nature and expression. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t know anything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Reagan&#39;s chief spokesman today called on both sides involved in the violent protests in Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip ‘to step back from confrontation,’ which he said is damaging ‘the self respect and world opinion of the Israeli people.’”</p>

<p>“He said the effect of the occupation ‘also damages the self-respect and world opinion of the Israeli people.’”</p>

<p>You said it was literally unheard of until a year ago.</p>

<p>I showed you a quote from the White House thirty years ago. </p>

<p>What makes you think nobody cared?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Reagan on Israeli incursions into Lebanon.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In a letter to Prime Minister Begin, which follows Israel’s August 4 ground assault on West Beirut, the president complained that his ‘words fell on deaf ears’ and pointedly warned that ‘the relationship between our two countries is at stake.’ This followed a White House meeting at which the issue of whether or not to impost comprehensive sanctions against Israel was debated.</p>

<p>I mean I&#39;d prefer we don&#39;t support any of these Mideast nightmares but if we must pick sides I&#39;d rather side with the state of Israel than the multitude of head choppers.</p>

<p>You think one cannot be a gay Christian in Tel BV Aviv and live better than in Iran?</p>

<p>That&#39;s just not true to say though, is it? </p>
