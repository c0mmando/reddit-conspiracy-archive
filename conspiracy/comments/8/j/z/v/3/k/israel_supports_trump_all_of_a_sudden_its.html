       I find it hilarious that for as long as I can remember any criticism of Israel would get you branded an anti-semite.  I myself was often accused as such, but suddenly it's perfectly okay with everyone, news outlets and radio shows.  Go ahead! It's open season on Israel now! I have zero problems with anyone criticizing Israel, I encourage it!
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly changed?  The only thing I can really see that changed is the existing deep state (pro-trump) lost the bid for the 2016 election and now everything it falling apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the best universe.  The instability that Trump has caused in the western power structures in beyond doubt.  You don't have to like the guy, I could care less if you do but you can't deny how much bullshit is being exposed during this time of instability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fucking love it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of a sudden Kim Jong Un was being complimented during the winter games, then he starts hatching a deal with Trump (better hate him again!). Israel is no longer the Media darling it was. Suddenly we love domestic spying, and this Logan ACT back and forth is also hilarious.
      </p>

       Fucking classic!

       Trump is a puppet of the Zionists and he doesn't even realize it. They put his face on a coin and had his name plastered all over Israel to get him to move the embassy -- and it stroked his ego. He's not playing 4D chess, he's playing checkers

       Why aren't Americans taking advantage of his ego?

       All you have to do is cheer for the guy and beg him to legalize marijuana and he'd probably do it.  Seems like an opportunity squandered to me.  A populist president responds to popular outcry.  Instead we have people denouncing him and wearing pussy hats.  LMFAO.

       What I don't get is how people can't see past their own blinders enough to notice that, at the very least, their is a major rift in the global Deep State. To see a full fledged propaganda attack
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       Israel is pretty remarkable.

       It's crazy they bend themselves into pretzels outcrying then praising then scoring over and over. I'm loving it in some ways and scared in others that they can lead the blind sheep even while jerking their noses back and forth.  Luckily more people seem to be waking up.

       I don't know what kind of hole you've been living in but criticism of Israel has always been perfectly okay .
      </p>
      <p>
       Overly vociferous criticism has often been unfairly labelled Anti-Semitism, and yes some people have a far too sensitive response.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that some of the loudest criticism of Israel isn't bigoted in its nature and expression.

        President Reagan's chief spokesman today called on both sides involved in the violent protests in Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip ‘to step back from confrontation,’ which he said is damaging ‘the self respect and world opinion of the Israeli people.’”

         In a letter to Prime Minister Begin, which follows Israel’s August 4 ground assault on West Beirut, the president complained that his ‘words fell on deaf ears’ and pointedly warned that ‘the relationship between our two countries is at stake.’ This followed a White House meeting at which the issue of whether or not to impost comprehensive sanctions against Israel was debated.

       for people that socially identify with their sexual orientation, which is insanity however you look at it, instead of "hi, i'm a doctor/teacher/whatever to be proud of", it's "hi i stick my dick in other men's assholes..." it's utterly retarded and it doesn't elevate them... otherwise lots of homosexuals in Damascus, they just don't socially identify as such because they have more important aspects of themselves to broadcast... they are doctors/teachers/whatever before they are gays... arguing that isreal is superior because you can openly tell people where you stick your dick, twisted as hell man

       but you are implicitly supporting isreal when you associate the wahhabi hords of head choppers, which isreal indirectly threw at Libya and Syria through its network of sayanim, with the people contrained inside the gaza landlock under total control by israel for decades... of course they want a fight, they are desperate enough to engage with their shitty weapons against the multi billion goyim funded army of their slavemasters... fuck you too man!

       I think Israel's policy of shooting protestors en masse, and being proud of it, might have something to do with it.  Netenyahu and his Likud thugs figure that having Trump's support for whatever atrocities they commit gives them carte blanche to increase their genocide plan.

       Pretty great post. It's funny too because it's all true. Trump being elected has exposed the entire planet. A year ago the "deep state" was a conpsiracy theorist nutjob idea, and now the MSM openly talks about it as they try to make you believe that
       <strong>
        <em>
         their
        </em>
       </strong>
       people inside the Deep State are the good guys instead of fighting it and denying it hahahahah.

       President Obama was at best Republican-Lite. I supported him over the alternative. His eight years in office will be considered a standard for future Presidents. We can do much better, but Obama is an educated and honest man.

       Apparently you are the one who was fooled. Obama will go down as one of the worst presidents in history. He conned you into believing in Hope and Change. His signature achievement was Obamacare which has only made our healthcare industry worse and more expensive.

       Trump has solidified "worst President in history". There is no getting around that one.

       As regards the ACA, letting the for-profit sickness exploitation industry write legislation was a mistake. It should have been a modern universal healthcare system.
