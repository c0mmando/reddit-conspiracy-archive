    <div class="md"><p>For many people, a chewable tablet or gummy works better psychologically because they&#39;re not &quot;pill-poppers&quot;.</p>

<p>There are lots of great foods with vitamin C, but explain to me how you&#39;re going to ensure several hundred milligram several times a day to account for tissue saturation and it&#39;s half-life. Pauling did an analysis on this issue in the book I mentioned above. It&#39;s unreasonable to expect anyone to get a good amount of vitamin C from diet alone. It&#39;s then how you define good amount. It&#39;s a very interesting discovery if you&#39;re up for it. <em>How to Live Longer and Feel Better</em> should be at most any library and certainly you can get it online for cheap. </p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to answer questions and debate about it, but really, the choice to just read on your own about it is what&#39;ll do it for you. Pauling was a genius. If you&#39;ve studied college level sciences, you&#39;ve studied his work whether you knew it or not. He won the most prestigious award in the world twice in two completely different areas. One of his messages to humanity was, <em>Take your vitamin C.</em> </p>

<p>It&#39;s a safer substance than table salt. </p>

<p>Animals that make it in their livers make it in gram quantities.</p>

<p>It&#39;s necessary for strong collagen and your body is made out of collagen. Your veins and arteries are made out of collagen. Atherosclerosis is the repair job for weak collagen. </p>

<p>Your immune system depends on vitamin C. You just stop getting colds when you take the right amount consistently. And that&#39;s just the top of the iceberg for immunity. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just a simple little molecule that&#39;d made from glucose except we seem to have lost the ability to make it. We need it in gram quantities to thrive and we need more when we&#39;re sick, whatever the sickness may be. </p>

<p>For about a dollar a day you can improve your health and extend your longevity. You just have to put a bottle where you work, one where you eat at home, and one by the bedside. Take one in between breakfast and lunch, one in between lunch and dinner, and one before bed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry. I must have missed that part. In that regard, then, I agree 90% with what you&#39;re saying. I would just be wary of taking a chewable tablet or gummy to get your Vitamin C. Those can be heavily processed and have a composition of preservatives or additives that you shouldn&#39;t be ingesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wrote a comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8jzlv1/_/dz421ul?context=1000">over here</a> and maybe I can think of a few more things! </p>

<p>It&#39;s really good that you&#39;ve started and important to keep at it like a ritual or habit. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been studying this for a long time and there&#39;s one thing I&#39;m not 100% convinced on, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s evidence to suggest it&#39;s actually harmful, but I much prefer to take vitamin C apart from food. If you think about its antioxidant properties, it&#39;s also sometimes a pro-oxidant, and one of the things it can do is activate iron to cause some pro-oxidative damage, especially to fragile polyunsaturated oils, like fish or flax or other nut/seed oils. So I prefer not to take vitamin C with meals and other supplements, other than antioxidants that complement it, taking with grapeseed extract these days. </p>

<p>Ideally, I&#39;d take 300mg four times a day for maintenance. But if 2 500mg doses work better, then fine. One big dose is ok too, but probably better to split it up. You want to maintain tissue saturation but you probably also want to work it into your life however it fits. Any amount of vitamin C supplementation taken any which way is better than relying on diet alone.</p>

<p>You really can&#39;t mess it up. Take too much and it just gets flushed out. There&#39;s really no toxicity - it&#39;s so safe that it&#39;s most effective when injected. Basically the opposite of toxic. </p>

<p>1000mg/day is pretty decent for maintenance, imho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you prefer chewable or supplement pill form Vitamin C?  I like chewable since its probably good for the interior of your mouth.  During the winter months if Im not feeling well, I will usually dose 1000mg twice a day.  I have not heard of any negative effects of taking it with meals, but I do both.  I feel like taking it right before bed could be beneficial as well.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right about the absorption in the mouth, I believe. The only thing you&#39;d have to watch is the sugars in the teeth. </p>

<p>Right before bed is ideal because we do most collagen growth/maintenance/repair while we sleep, iirc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there is not, HOWEVER there is a concealed hidden CAUSe of many diseases. Sugar causes diabetes, which is at epidemic levels and has all kinds of horrible side effects including reduced resistance to infection, which often results in gangrene, blindness and so on, as well sugar causes high  cholesterol, emotional /mood issues, obesity, and so on. </p>

<p>I spent some time researching aloe vera. You can buy food grade aloe vera gel at many supermarkets or health food stores. If this was a drug, it would be the fucking holy grail: it stimulates the bowel encouraging movement, it speeds the healing of skin damage, it boosts the immune system, it helps to treat dry skin/scalp problems, burns/sunburns, and much, much more. It&#39;s kind of crazy how many positive health effects it has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say it&#39;s a simple no there isn&#39;t. History seems to show that your best bet is to maintain a healthy balanced diet and lifestyle as much as possible. People may argue meat causes this, carbs cause that and so forth and in some way, shape or form in certain cases they may well do so.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not designed to live forever, do what makes you happy and live the best life possible with the hand you&#39;re dealt. I don&#39;t buy into any of the don&#39;t eat this, don&#39;t do that and make sure you pop x amount of this everyday noise that we hear. There isn&#39;t and never will be some exact science for there&#39;s an immeasurable amount of factors that can and will dispel a certain belief. How often do we see a study that comes out saying, &#39;bla bla x amount of times per week shows this or that benefit&#39;, only for a couple of years later to read it&#39;s now thought to be the opposite or only applicable in an x,y or z situation.  </p>

<p>Dead after 50 happy years vs dead at 90, the majority being filled with stress, worry and unhappiness about lifestyle choices and life in general? I know which of the two I prefer and who I would consider the winner at life.          </p>
