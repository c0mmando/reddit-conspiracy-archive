<p>Anyways, recently bought a home and my new neighbors recently sold their house. I was curious to see their price range, so I went to zillow.com and checked it. Now, what is interesting, is I bought my property for 50k underneath the REPORTED selling value. Now this is not the zillow estimate, but the actual sold on date I bought it price.</p>

<p>It seems to me that my realtor overvalued the house to inflate the neighborhood properties and boost his commission. </p>

<p>Who do I contact to report this? If this is true, then zillow is actively manipulating the housing market, and we know where this leads. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just kinda how this shit works. Zillow works with what they&#39;re given- if the numbers are fudged when they get them, they&#39;ll be fudged when they report em too. Zillow is just an aggregate site.</p>

<p>Something else developers do when gentrifying a neighborhood, for instance, is buy old houses and flip them- common stuff. But what they&#39;ll do next is &quot;sell&quot; the house to a friend of theirs (a fellow flipper/developer) for an infalted price, so that it is then reported and raises the property values of the neighborhood. The money doesn&#39;t really switch hands as one thinks.</p>

<p>Also, a lot of these house flippers aren&#39;t one offers or Middle Class people trying to move up in life- they&#39;re multi-million dollar businesses in a multi-billion dollar industry.</p>

<p>Long in the short of it- the housing market is fucked. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As stated in other comments, you should stay away from all of the real estate websites like zillow. The information is often incorrect, they are relatively unregulated, and you don&#39;t need to look any further than their business model to see why. They make their money on how much traffic they get to their website and then how much they can sell said traffic to real estate agents.</p>

<p>Also, if you ever have a complaint you feel is legitimate your state should have a real estate commission whose purpose is to regulate real estate agents. Contact them to report a complaint. All agents have a license number which can be looked up through the online database</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably due to 1 of 2 things. Zillow reports the data that was submitted to the tax assessor. This data is supplied by the closing agent. If you requested a homestead exemption it is possible that 1) the assessor reduced the transactional value by $50k or 2) the closing agent (attorney, title co or escrow co) completed the forms by reducing the homestead value. Its not a scam, its not a conspiracy and it is probably saving you a lot of money on your property taxes. If you want to know what happened, go to the assessor and pull the deeds and transfer recording documents. You can even tell the assessor that you want to pay more taxes and your home should not be homesteaded. They will allow you to declare a higher value. You can also appeal and pay a lower value but you need a compelling argumebt and may need to go to a hearing. Regardless, Zillow is not accurate on a lot of info. Its just a website like wikipedia or reddit. </p>
