       I was in GT. Very little memory of doing anything productive. At the time, I came to the conclusion the program was bullshit, a way to fluff the egos of school board members by admitting their very average kids into a "prestigious" program. One of the few things I do remember doing was brainstorming ways to sell a food additive that was known to be harmful (Olestra, it turns out).

       In CA, it's the STAR testing.

      <p>
       Guy I went to school was a genius, with scored really high as a kid, and the CIA showed up at his family's door and offered to take him into some special CIA-academy for super-bright kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parents left it up to the kid, kid decided he wanted to stay with his friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure the guy works for the CIA now. Bumped into him one time and asked him to his face straight up, and his reaction told me everything I needed to know.

       You're an alt account of his. You reaction tells me everything I need to know.

      <p>
       My point is that "his reaction tells me everything I needed to know" isn't a source of information, especially coming from a guy making up stories on the internet. The comment is honestly pretty stupid and should be derided as such.

       Saw the guy, it had been a long time. He was telling me about how he's a professor in one of the -stan countries (wigwams and yaks).
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked him, 'Hey man, do you work for the CIA?' (because we had all long suspected it...there was no reason he would be a professor of english in a -stan country...he majored in aeronautics engineering or something)
      </p>
      <p>
       My guy (who has one of the worst poker faces in the world): Completely shocked expression on his face, like I had just told him his dick was hanging out of his pants, 'Uh, well, um...you know, even if I did, I wouldn't be able to tell you, right?'

       I was a professional tutor for a long time, but it was still kinda shocking when I saw for the first time that the testing they use for the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth (CTY) is called the SCAT test (school and college ability test).  Something tells me they could have gone with a slightly more innocuous name.  I went to the CTY a while back, and it's crazy to me that it's gotten so huge, to the point where they even make test prep books for it!
      </p>
      <p>
       I tutored a kid that went there two years back because he was getting to the national level of Math Counts and I did that ages ago.  Honestly, he was much smarter than me, and he learned some really interesting tricks and ways to approach problems that I never had seen before.

       Umm, I attended this.  You take a test, you get a high score, you get to live in a college dorm for 3 weeks and take college classes.  It was a basically a place for nerds to have their first kiss away from the high school jockocracy.

       Not really, and the program is FAR different from student to student.

      <p>
       I went there for a whole summer in a very small class with only a few other students.  And I also didn't live in a dorm.  The guy who taught my class was actually the guy who originated the program, too.

       Yeah, that last sentence of his pretty cringey too.  When I went, there were zero girls, and the kids there weren't looking for love.  We were all way too focused on math.

       I will say that the method of instruction was excellent and helped me greatly when tutoring, and I sorely wish that I had gotten more education like it throughout my youth.  Basically, they were extremely laissez-faire but really helped you to work as FAST as possible while still not ruining the eureka moments of problem solving.  Self-discovery is the key to internalizing knowledge, and they were playful with problems and dropped sly hints when needed.
