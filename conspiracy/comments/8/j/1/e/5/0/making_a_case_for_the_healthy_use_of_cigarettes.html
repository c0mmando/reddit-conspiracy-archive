        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The case for cigarettes.</p>

<p>We all know the &quot;bad&quot; that cigarettes cause.  Bad for the lungs.  Heavy metals and toxins.  Etc.</p>

<p>But no one ever talks about the potential good.  Potential good in cigarettes?  You must be joking!  Nope.</p>

<p>For one, nicotine is anti parasitic.  Organic crops are often sprayed with nicotine (nicotinamide) as a natural pesticide.  Is there a chance that nicotine fights parasites within the body?  Very likely.</p>

<p>For two, nicotine is anti-inflammatory.  As we all know, inflammation is the cause of most illness.  Does the anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine keep you feeling better?  Very likely.</p>

<p>For three, vitamin b3 is called nicotinic acid.  That&#39;s right, it&#39;s almost identical in molecular structure to niacinamide.  Is it possible that that by smoking cigarettes you&#39;re getting vitamins?  Sounds funny, but it&#39;s very likely.  Look up vitamin b3 and see all the benefits.  Everything from helping your body metabolize carbohydrates and fats, to helping with mental disorders like schitzophrenia.</p>

<p>But we all know people who smoked and got lung cancer.  Isn&#39;t that proof that cigarettes are harmful?  Possibly.  However, the 2 oldest people who ever lived were both smokers.  If cigarettes were definitely 100% harmful, it seems less likely that the 2 oldest people on record would be smokers.  I wonder if you&#39;re healthy in every other aspect of life (diet, happiness, activity level, social life), then perhaps cigarettes are not as harmful as we think, maybe perhaps even beneficial.</p>

<p>And as a conspiracy theorist, it&#39;s certainly interesting that the government is working towards getting people to quit.  They were all about telling people to smoke back in the day, but now it&#39;s for sure going to kill you.  Given what we now know about the anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory affects of nicotine, a part of me wonders if cigarettes are keeping people healthier than they would like, and they know it, and that&#39;s why they want everyone to quit.</p>

<p>Now am I suggesting that everyone start smoking?  No.  I think that if you&#39;re able to keep the parasites out by eating lots of garlic or spicy foods, and you make sure not to eat leftovers, and practice clean hygiene, and if you&#39;re able to keep your inflammation down by eating only whole unprocessed foods, then you are probably doing good.  However, if you&#39;re already a smoker, perhaps working on the other aspects of your health might actually be more beneficial.  Eat fruits, vegetables and meat.  Avoid processed foods, and anything fried in unhealthy oils.  Just try it and see how much better you feel.</p>

<p>Neonicotinoids are (associated with pollinator mortality.)[<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/european-agency-concludes-controversial-neonic-pesticides-threaten-bees">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/european-agency-concludes-controversial-neonic-pesticides-threaten-bees</a>]</p>

<p>Perhaps nicotine, if isolated and delivered intravenously, could serve as an anti inflammatory but several studies have conclusively shown that (cigarette smoke causes chronic inflammation.)[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261116/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3261116/</a>]</p>

<p>The plant may have used, but cigarettes kill nearly a half million Americans each year. The corporations who sell them have know about this since the 1950s at the latest and are knowingly peddling death. This conspiracy has been documented for decades and the tobacco companies confessed, under oath to the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My argument isn&#39;t that neonicotinoids are a good pesticide to use.  It&#39;s merely that nicotine is effective at killing parasites.  The fact that it&#39;s strong enough to kill something as large as a bee even strengthens the argument.</p>

<p>You might be right about cigarettes causing more inflammation than they fight.  I just noticed that nicotine was anti-inflammatory, and started speculating.</p>

<p>The fact that the oldest people were both smokers seems to indicate that perhaps they&#39;re not deadly in every case.  What this tells me is that maybe those with ill health are harmed from cigarette use, but others not so much.</p>

<p>Correct. You can have a genetic predisposition for cancer or not, along with cancer causing behaviors or not. We don&#39;t know the ratio or which genetic markers open you up to cancer but it does seem likely that some people are just genetically lucky as hell and are immune to cancer. Look at those people who are <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/09/21/224506556/in-life-man-immune-to-hiv-helped-scientists-fight-virus">immune to HIV/AIDS</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think, it&#39;s all the additives and chemicals they add in cigarettes and the tubes that make them so carcinogenic. Cannabis smokers don&#39;t have an increase in lung cancer, so why do tobacco smokers? It&#39;s the additives. I personally, roll my own tobacco smokes and buy fresh and unmolested tobacco and tubes.</p>

<p>Transitioning from name brand pre-rolls, to roll your own was quite hell. The question is why? My conclusion is, it&#39;s all the shit that gets added into it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s anecdotal, but, yea... I feel better after making the switch years ago, and it definitely saves money. A carton costs me a fraction of the price rolling my own, than if I was going to buy a pre-rolled carton. You could literally save 80 bucks, depending on where you live. I also found, I smoke less. Win-win, all around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh huh! So that&#39;s what the shit is called. It or something very similar is also added to cigarettes over here. Implemented under the guise of stopping bush fires. So not only are smokers vile but they&#39;re also firebugs apparently. I totally agree that is does affected the flavour in a negative way.</p>

<p>Europe have been spared the weird flavour so far as I know at least, plus whatever negative health possibility&#39;s it may or may not contain. Enjoy the fact you can light a smoke, place it in the ashtray, get distracted and come back to nothing but a pile of ash while you can. In between your summer days spent lighting bush fires of course!</p>

<p>Decades of science have linked smoking to cancer. Not fake science, real science but real scientists. What happened to Wayne and so many others during the filming has nothing to do with that science. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right that radiation exposure is almost certainly resulted in Wayne getting cancer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just lung and heart disease. They now say smoking causes back pain, orthopedic problems, failure of surgery,  failure of pharmaceuticals to work, you name it. Got a problem thay fail to fix, it&#39;s because you smoked. My daughter smoked 1 cigarette after surgery  over a 2 week period and they blamed that on the sutures failing and whole thing coming apart.  They blamed my grandmothers scoliosis and various other back problems on smoking. They blame pain meds not working on smoking, saying smoking is the source of pain and pain meds won&#39;t work properly until smoking is stopped. That&#39;s just a few examples.  I&#39;m not saying smoking isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s not the root fo all medical problems and madical failure, as people that do not smoke have some of the same health problems.  If they it&#39;s really the root, and raises the cost so much, why isn&#39;t chantix free, or at least covered? They us smoking as a way to cover their own butts and blame the patient. </p>

Smoking causes a lot of complications, especially in injuries, stop blaming the doctors and start putting the blame on who deserves it: the smoker. My tax dollars or insurance premiums shouldn&#39;t increase because your daughter or grandmother refuses to quit smoking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just from a chemical perspective, many compounds/substances can be very similar in chemical structure, yet have VERY different effects. Especially in the human body. </p>

<p>I think it’s also important to note that we have receptors in the body that are literally called “nicotinic receptors.” That’s what the neurotransmitter that helps us move our muscles binds to (acetylcholine). So just because b3 is a nicotinic acid doesn’t mean much.</p>

<p>Also, I think the government would want us to keep smoking to make money off nicotine taxes. That’s just my two cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>20year 20-30per day smoker myself. 
I surprisingly? don&#39;t actually know anyone that&#39;s died of lung cancer(touch wood).
Truth be told with the lifestyle I and some of my friends have lived along with acquaintances we&#39;ve met along the journey I think a lot of us are expecting something else to beat a smoking related cancer to the punch. But you just never do ya?!</p>

<p>I actually haven&#39;t considered the idea that possibly smoking perhaps outweighs the supposed negatives in a conspiratorial sense. Thank you for the food for thought! We&#39;re the new age lepers, supposedly a massive drain on the public health service according to my governments bullshit rhetoric, no one but especially those in power put any effort into lies anymore we&#39;re all so beaten down and listless. In 2014 Australian smokers contributed $8billion to the economy and cost the healthcare system $320mil and $150mil in bush fire control. Us filthy, dirty fucks payed 17 times as much as we cost! </p>

<p>The plan in place to get us to quit has been tax increases each and every year for it must be at least the last 4 years now. Something like 10% or thereabouts. A packet of Peter Jackson 40&#39;s(a higher end brand) are now $46.50 AUD at the supermarket which historically been the cheapest location to purchase them from. </p>

<p>Chop-chop(illegal tobacco) is becoming more prevalent, certain places will sell 100 rolled tubes for around $30. 1kg of chop-chop from the place I know of is $200 or so from memory. It&#39;s a bit rough in my opinion, lacking those 3000 other chemicals and all in treated tobacco haha. Illegal under the counter cigarettes are obviously becoming more popular via shipping container importation, Marlboro Gold 20&#39;s and similar retail for $15. The individual can import their own from places like Moldova at a cost of around $60 for 10packs of 20, it&#39;s hit and miss with customs and being something that size it isn&#39;t really concealable, they charge 71c per cigarette when you receive you customs letter seizure if you decide to not forfeit them.</p>

<p>I hate the hypocrisy of the whole charade. In my opinion they should let people do as they please with their own body, whilst that will never happen then at least be fkn reasonable, I think we would gladly accept a price of 65-75c per fag as we have all been conditioned now with high pricing BUT BUT BUT, being this is sold as it&#39;s all about them being worried for smokers health then perhaps fucking show it I say. The can get a bit of mongrel about them, grow some balls and say lighters out folks. They should immediately remove their grubby claws off the tax excise, invest millions in relevant programs plus quit smoking aids and quit the lying bullshit rhetoric just for once.</p>

<p>Certainly couldn&#39;t hurt anyone with time on their hands who&#39;s looking for and adventure, to investigate what the state and federal laws are in regards to cigarette importation and max penalties of which are never given out of course, then going through relevant court cases to see what the going rate of time served is. Moldova and those financially crippled East Euro countries are $2AUD a pack. What&#39;s to bet some of those in government positions of power with connections to customs and the docks are up to their neck in the industry doing exactly what I&#39;ve just said. What&#39;s good for the Goose is good for the gander though eh!</p>

<p>I personally think that there&#39;s something about cigarettes that they don&#39;t like.  Perhaps it absorbs radiation or because it kills parasites.  I&#39;m not exactly sure.  I&#39;ve quit smoking 3 times and ended up with symptoms that I don&#39;t have when I smoke.  Makes me wonder.</p>

<p>Also, the few people I have known with lung cancer actually got it 3-5 years after they quit.  Kind of strange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no disguising the fact it is indeed pretty brutal mate. 
Whilst you walk away with a carton at home that same $40 will net you a packet of 40&#39;s and 4x 600ml plastic bottles of coke out of the fridge at the checkout over here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never actually tried to quit myself so I haven&#39;t had that experience. A doctor would obviously be your best bet on that one. At a guess perhaps it could be your body just going through withdrawals and rthus eadjusting to the lack of toxins and poisons it&#39;s used to. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if one of the symptoms was finding yourself coughing up excessive phlegm? It&#39;s probably being suppressed by regular smoking and then it goes into a state of shock where it starts to loosen up and break off perhaps. Other symptoms I would hazard a guess at could be more perspiring than previously whilst doing the same actions followed by chills, headaches, body aches and a general lethargic feeling. Thankfully for anyone quitting the fags it doesn&#39;t match the pain of heroin withdrawals but on the downside they do say cigarettes are actually harder to quit than heroin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually those things do happen when you quit smoking, but I consider those benefits.  The symptoms I got each time I quit was persistent cold sores and anxiety.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if the cold sores are caused from radiation or a virus, but cigarettes suppress them for some reason.  </p>

<p>Not sure what causes the anxiety either, but it&#39;s greatly increased when my diet isn&#39;t right.  When I&#39;m drinking more soda and coffee, things like that.  Cigarettes suppress that too for some reason.</p>

<p>As far as being harder to quit.  Heroin is definitely harder to quit.  Never was able to quit that without being forced.  Cigarettes I was able to quit 3 times, but only after a hard determination that I was done.  You can&#39;t &quot;kinda want to quit&quot;.  You just gotta be like &quot;I&#39;m done&quot;.</p>

<p>I was definitely more motivated and had more energy after quitting, and the lungs cleared up too.  But cold sores and anxiety was persistent.  </p>

<p>I wonder what the cigarettes are protecting against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve sparked some past memories about one of the lads in what was, and still is, the solid group of 10 of us that all met in an all boys high school waaay back in the mid 90&#39;s. Obviously a lot have families now, live in different location&#39;s around the world and all that jazz that comes with age, but irregardless of the time gap between catch up&#39;s, nothing ever changes and we all just pick up like we only spoke yesterday. </p>

<p>Anyway...fuck dude, you&#39;ve cracked me up man. We would mercilessly rip into the one of us that would occasionally have a cold sore pop up with a few names we come up with, it was juvenile but fuck it was funny. Cold sores are actually the herpes virus mate. HSV-1 or HSV-2 or something like that. Cold sores are really quite common its just not something you want on your dick of course! Zovirax or anything similar clears that up. Having a cold, windy weather conditions and stress and anxiety are all triggers.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve never tried hammer. I&#39;ve got a good friend who  shared with me not long after we met that she was on the suboxone program after being hooked for a couple of years. I would never have guessed it if she hadn&#39;t told me. But my one lame story was having an 8mg strip one night, my god was it horrific tasting! I ended up just talking shit all night into the morning and I was adamant I&#39;d be going to work, I was def not 100% fit and healthy but I can always pull myself together when required, she was adamant I would not be going anywhere! Me being totally oblivious to just how fucked I was I guess. Anyway....hours after I&#39;d taken it out of nowhere I had to rush to the bathroom to throw up, I got to the door and it was all over, from the doorway to the toilet it must be close to I guess 15ft,  I hit the opposite wall above the toilet about 6ft up it and I stand at 5&#39;11. Never, ever,  have I experienced such force and power. And the pinned eyes, holy shit. That&#39;s been it though dude. I would for sure visit a proper opium den if I was ever around the golden triangle though.</p>

<p>Mate, I take my hat off to you for being able to get off the hammer. My friend had a bit of a relapse a couple of years ago, she would always come over and hang out and this one particular night she couldn&#39;t stop moving her legs, seemingly frustrated and just looking not healthy. I was sick of her fucking moving about over on the other couch so I just come out and asked and yeah she admitted to having reused a few times that week which was around 12months after she weaned of the subs to be totally clean, admitted to being a lil dope sick and being fully aware that it wasn&#39;t a road she couldn&#39;t go down again, withdrawals after a few times in a week will be a far better option than what would follow after a full blown 6months solid run of being on the nod. My memory of what I witnessed over the few days or week she went through it was really quite tame being it wasn&#39;t someone going clean after years. But the leg aches and frustration from not being able to get comfortable looked to compare to those random times that for whatever reason you have a restless night trying to sleep, tossing and turning, with a lil sleep here and there and generally feeling jacked off and angry about it. Totally nightmare material to be stuck in that situation and state of mind for hour after hour for days on end knowing full well that the whole pain and suffering can vanish with the simple action of stepping out and scoring. The warm, soft blissful cloud I&#39;ve heard about certainly does sound amazing! Hell, no one in the world ever has used heroin and said nah, its shit and over rated. </p>

<p>&quot;But cold sores and anxiety was persistent.
I wonder what the cigarettes are protecting against.&quot;</p>

<p>My guess is simply the anxiety should perhaps be considered one of the negatives of quitting that will require one of the longer blocks of time for it to become a positive. Without knowing the time frame of being an active smoker before quitting and how long in time it is before you took it up again. Perhaps have a think about when, where and what it is you&#39;re doing when you feel the anxiety come on. Maybe you&#39;ll find there&#39;s a correlation that its a spot, situation etc where perhaps in the past without being consciously aware of it you would engage a cigarette which subsequently mask the anxiety feeling. The cold sores.....least of your worries man and easily fixable.

<p>Again though, full respect for getting off it mate, if you can do that there isn&#39;t much else out their that given the opportunity you can&#39;t conqueror.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t take much credit.  I went to Federal prison for selling weed and cocaine, and was forced to quit.  I doubt I could have ever done it on my own.  Especially since I was making several hundred thousand a year selling drugs.  If I would have ran out of money I might have been able to quit, since I never would have stole or done anything crazy to get more.  So I can&#39;t take credit, as if I used my willpower to quit, when really I had no choice.  It ended up being the best for me.  Especially since I had a crazy girlfriend who I couldn&#39;t shake.  She found someone else while I was in prison, so I was freed from that addiction as well.  She was great in bed but off her rocker.</p>

<p>I know that some cold sores are a form of herpes.  I&#39;ve heard that some are not though.  Mine were always inside the mouth, and I heard the STD type created bumps outside the mouth.  Either way, smoking cigarettes got rid of them completely.  Perhaps it is the parasite/microbe killing aspect again.</p>

<p>I speculate that the anxiety is caused from radiation.  From the microwaves, from the cell phones, from the WiFi.  I don&#39;t have proof though, just speculation.  One of the reasons though is the studies done on grounding.  Supposedly when you&#39;re in contact with the bare earth, barefoot, or touching it in some way, it removes radiation from the body.  After reading this, I would sit outside barefoot at least 20 minutes a day.  Afterwards I would feel so calm and relaxed.  So if grounding removes radiation, as when I ground I feel relaxed, then perhaps the anxiety is caused by radiation.  That&#39;s my theory anyways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a theory as well. The unemployed local community hall volunteer pantomime usher needs a job asap. His contributions online are devoid of any value or substance of which are two key traits that encourage and promote discussion. Instead it merely highlights the fact everyone else now has to remain on high alert in case he forgets to breath and requires a few chest compression punches.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, in the reality we all live in, there&#39;s a chance via no fault of your own other than the most inconsequential decision of day might see you in the wrong time at the wrong place. Extreme example I admit but the shit happens to someone somewhere. </p>

<p>If my day comes before 50, then so be it. I don&#39;t think anyone could say I didn&#39;t do any living in those years. I could probably write a book at this stage as there&#39;s no shortage of friends of both sexes who live admit to living vicariously through me and the fkn wild up&#39;s that are as vertical as the downs! Maybe we only receive a predetermined amount of heart beats on the day we&#39;re born? Maybe some of us are aware of a certain fate yet not if that makes sense. I only say that because death by 50 would frighten the shit out of most people absolutely. Fact is, if I had children and a wife it probably frighten the fuck out of me to. </p>

<p>I think my only fear of death is that it may not be the end. That we may be eternal beings and must do all of this again. All I can say is please lord, let no such thing be true, A world that resembles 1984 and Animal Farm which is seemingly the end goal........fuck that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For a month or so I used nicotine patches while I slept (I was using them anyway, just kept them on).  I had read that &quot;vivid dreams&quot; was a side effect, and I was going through some tough things in my life.  Perhaps, I thought, I could use it in some weird therapeutic way.  I can&#39;t begin to explain the wild rides we have when we sleep.  </p>

<p>I saw people I hadn&#39;t seen in years like no time had passed, family, old friends, lovers I had nearly forgotten about.  I told people that died how much I loved, and missed them.  I often think of one I had where I could fly.  I kept going up, and up.  I was just energy I guess, and I was leaving all this, the earth, fucking floating in space going as fast as I wanted, as fast as I could think.  It was amazing, the first time I really felt absolute freedom.  It was all in my head, but it seemed so real.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know this for fact, but I suspect nicotine somehow enhances your ability to remember things, or enhances memory.  It does this whether you are asleep, or awake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wanna kick those dreams up into a whole other level?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a quit smoking aid called &#39;champix&#39;, I presume it&#39;s available in pharmacies worldwide. It did possibly require a prescription from memory around 8 years ago when I knew two mates that tried it at the same time when we we&#39;re all working together. It&#39;s a fucking wonder drug from what I&#39;ve witnessed. Generally pharmaceuticals all list common similar and serious side effects but seemingly people suffering from them is a higher probability on this shit.</p>

<p>You take it as directed and continue smoking and then like magic it will one day click it&#39;s fingers and next thing you just don&#39;t feel like cigarettes anymore. The guys I know reached about day 3 and 4 respectively and upon lighting a smoke, they both described it as just a &#39;yuck&#39; feeling and threw them out. </p>

<p>The possible side effect though. It was sorta funny witnessing all  this, and of course we&#39;d hang shit on one and other but one of the boys described being lethargic and suffered from being so blocked up we had to swing by a chemist to purchase laxatives at the end of week on the way back from being out on site but that was about it. </p>

<p>The other lad suffered from these nightmares that got progressively worse as the week wore on and even though the feeling of wanting cigarettes had completely gone, if the nightmares hadn&#39;t subsided by the end of the weekend he said he was done with it and burning the things. The poor bugger looked like dog shit on Thursday, all wide eyed with these dark arse bags under them but come Friday morning the poor fucker looked terrible and totally rattled.  Man....the nightmares he spoke of eh. Shit was well beyond any Hollywood slasher/horror film that would be R18 and see a mass release that I know of. Macabre, horrific, gruesome, evil, sadistic shit involving family, people he played junior footy with the he hadn&#39;t seen in or thought of 20 years along with primary school class mates from 25+ years, pets, loved ones, literally a seemingly random cast of any one of the thousands of people we all meet in life he described it as. He for one couldn&#39;t believe the clearness and detail in the recollections and how he himself would be the relevant age also and the total randomness of it all. He admitted to waking up in if not tears then a state of pure terror on numerous occasions and as the week progressed he said he was becoming increasingly worried that maybe there was something actually fucked up inside him. The dude&#39;s just one of the lads, he had his funny little ways of doing things that would frustrate everyone at times, as we all do though, happy go lucky, a mans man type of guy, loved fucking off for a surf, would help anyone at any time without question, always had a smile on his face, could shit stir just as well as he could take, loved a beer and overall just someone who&#39;s whole persona was genuine and of good intent, the type of person your proud to to say your mates with really. It&#39;s a wonder drug that works for sure but I&#39;m a bit scared of it which is unlike me but, after that week of what he went through, fuck that. I was suggesting all day that he should fuck the pills off and go back to the docs but it&#39;s a bit of a common course of action here to reply with, &#39;ah, she&#39;ll be right mate, it&#39;ll be no worries&#39;. He really wanted to quit the fags and bizarrely just as soon as the nightmares began they vanished the following night. 8 years on and his still totally cigarette free half in fright of potentially having to deal with the &#39;champix&#39; dreams. The shit is bizarre.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Native Americans had been smoking tobacco for ages when the Europeans arrived on the American continent. The argument “yeah but they’re savages who used to die at 30 so one didn’t have time to develop cancer anyway” is unconvincing I find.</p>

<p>But this is true: it is a relevant question. If the populace’s health is <em>most definitely not</em> on the central planners’ agenda, why do they (seemingly) do everything in their power to make people quit smoking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the smoke itself, no matter what you are burning, has preservative properties. (in the same way that dry beef jerky lasts for decades, but fresh saturated beef turns starts smelling after 1 day in the sun)</p>

<p>Of course, using dry leafs and bark for their light-grey smoke from organic material, not the thick black smoke from inorganic  plastic chemicals.</p>

<p>Smoke stops pore inflamation and calms your sinuses, which prevents restricted airways, improper nasal breathing and eye/head aches.</p>

<p>But could all of these be attained without smoke inhalation? Without it reaching the lungs? Is shallow smoking superior to intensive smoking?</p>

<p>I think it has its uses, as long as you dont turn your lungs into lung-jerky, dryness and sterility can kill bacteria, no argument there, but life itself is symbiotic with bacteria and inflamation is part of the process of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I presented very valid reasons for thinking there might be beneficial effects to smoking.  The reason I even mention it is because I&#39;ve smoked and yet quit 3 times in my life.  Once for 7 years.  I had more health problems during the 7 years I didn&#39;t smoke than the rest of the time when I did.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t negatives to smoking, there are.  But it sure seems like there are some hidden beneficial effects, because I felt the difference personally.  I went and researched it and found out that there are health benefits to nicotine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you having health problems while you aren&#39;t smoking is not a correlating study.  What other bad shit were you doing for those 7 years?  What bad shit did you do before them that caused the bad things that happened during them?</p>

<p>Do your research, smoking IS bad for you.  Nicotine does have a few positive health effects, however it has a fuckton of negative ones.  </p>

<p>As far as feeling better while smoking...of course you did...you are on chemical stimulants...taking meth you feel better while you&#39;re on meth too...that shit is also bad for you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more apt to believe personal experience than random studies.  I personally experienced more health problems in the 7 years I was a non-smoker than the rest of my adult life combined.</p>

<p>Now granted it could be because I was eating alot more when I wasn&#39;t a smoker.  I&#39;m not sure.  Or it could be that microbes and parasites play a larger affect on health than people realize.  Cigarette smoking, while coming with it&#39;s own harmful effects, could be keeping microbes and parasites at bay.</p>

<p>Cigarette smokers are less likely to get Parkinson&#39;s disease also.  What is it about cigarettes that helps protect against this?  That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to figure out.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s lazy to just deem them harmful without exploring the positive effects that are clearly there in cases of things like Parkinson&#39;s.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking at the potential benefits of nicotine to combat particular diseases or health conditions...then I get that...but smoking isn&#39;t the way to dose yourself if you want to be healthy.  </p>

If you think I&#39;m wrong you can start smoking again and tell me how you feel in a few years. The same thing happened with my great aunt, when she was smoking from 20-35 she had very little health issues, but when she stopped she slowly started noticing her body&#39;s increasing health issues, she eventually died from lung cancer directly caused by her smoking. You may think smoking can be more beneficial than it is detrimental, but you&#39;re wrong, your body starts to crumble in later life.</p>

Guest Author - DawnEagle Summers</p>

<p>Tobacco is the Sacred Herb of the East. Tobacco was a gift to the Europeans from the Natives, when they arrived in this country. Sacred Tobacco that is used for prayers and ceremonials is not the same as the tobacco we commonly use today. The common cigarette is not sacred, nor is the tobacco contained within it. The original type of tobacco and the sacred herb, are of a different variety, or plant, than is commercial tobacco. Preferably, one should grow one’s own tobacco for ceremonial uses. If you must use commercial tobacco, look for tobacco that is grown naturally, using no chemicals, and is packaged in bulk, not in the cigarette form. </p>

<p>In the East, we send Prayers to the Great Spirit in the smoke of the tobacco. Eagle takes these messages to the Creator. We also honor Eagle with Tobacco.</p>

<p>We burn Tobacco when we say our prayers, and in Ceremonials, as our prayers are contained in the Tobacco’s sacred smoke. Using Prayer Feathers to fan the smoke upwards is one way of sending our prayers to the Creator in the smoke of the Tobacco. These Prayer Feathers are usually from the Eagle, however, due to Eagle being sacred to Natives, and a protected species, other types of feathers can be substituted. The feathers’ purpose is to connect us symbolically with the spirit of Eagle, to further ensure that our prayers reach the Creator. Whether we use Tobacco, Eagle Feathers, or any feathers at all, our prayers will be heard if we are sincere, humble, and speak from our hearts when we say our prayers. It is the intention behind the prayer that is the most important ingredient when speaking with the Creator of us all. Therefore, Prayer Feathers can be any type of feathers or none at all. Always offer Tobacco to the winged one who donates their feathers to you.</p>

<p>Offerings are made of tobacco, when we harvest the gifts of Mother Earth, or when we seek knowledge from her any of creatures. When we harvest herbs in the wild, we offer tobacco to the plant from which we harvest. When we wish to enter the woods, we seek out the oldest Standing Person, the Grandfather of the Forest, and ask his permission to enter. We then offer him tobacco to honor him, and thank him. He may choose to let us pass or not, but either way, we still offer tobacco!</p>

<p>We also use Tobacco to give thanks for all that we have received, and for everything that is on the way to us. We know that our prayers are being heard, and all that we need is already in the process of being manifested in our lives, because we have faith in the process, in ourselves, in the Universe, and in the Creator. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;More than 50 years after the discovery of reduced mortality rates in patients with Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) who smoke cigarettes, researchers may be on the cusp of opening the door to nicotine-based treatments that could help ease symptoms of the disease.&quot;</p>

<p>Smoking cigarettes isn&#39;t really worth it if you&#39;re slowly killing yourself, even if you have Parkinson&#39;s you <em>could just take fucking nicotine patches</em>. Cigarettes are not good for you in any way, even if you happen to have Parkinson&#39;s you could take nicotine instead of fucking slowly killing yourself...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve quit smoking 3 times and ended up with symptoms that I don&#39;t have when I smoke.</p>

<p>What symptoms would those be?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no disguising the fact it is indeed pretty brutal mate. 
Whilst you walk away with a carton at home that same $40 will net you a packet of 40&#39;s and 4x 600ml plastic bottles of coke out of the fridge at the checkout over here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never actually tried to quit myself so I haven&#39;t had that experience. A doctor would obviously be your best bet on that one. At a guess perhaps it could be your body just going through withdrawals and rthus eadjusting to the lack of toxins and poisons it&#39;s used to. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised at all if one of the symptoms was finding yourself coughing up excessive phlegm? It&#39;s probably being suppressed by regular smoking and then it goes into a state of shock where it starts to loosen up and break off perhaps. Other symptoms I would hazard a guess at could be more perspiring than previously whilst doing the same actions followed by chills, headaches, body aches and a general lethargic feeling. Thankfully for anyone quitting the fags it doesn&#39;t match the pain of heroin withdrawals but on the downside they do say cigarettes are actually harder to quit than heroin. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, but the statistics on Parkinson&#39;s aren&#39;t a single study.  There&#39;s obviously a protective effect there.</p>

<p>And my personal experience does matter.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m forced to trust someone else&#39;s experience.  I&#39;m trusting my own.</p>
