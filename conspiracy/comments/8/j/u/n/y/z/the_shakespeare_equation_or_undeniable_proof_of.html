        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A man named Alan Green has spent over 12 years attempting to crack a code that Shakespeare has left for us.</p>

<p>The best introduction to his work is an incredible elucidation of sacred geometry, mathematical constants, and geodesy on the Shakespeare Sonnets cover page.</p>

<p>The video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY">here</a>. I <em>highly</em> recommend watching the video, but if not, there are four dots and two lines placed serruptiously on the page. When they are connected, they make multiple right angle triangles, a pythagoraen triangle, and their ratios encode <a href="http://imgur.com/a/bNImI">12 fundamental constants.</a> The constants are encoded by simply ratios of the triangle lengths, and all to an accuracy of at least 3 decimals. Golden sections, squaring the circle, and more are all present as well.</p>

<p>For those who want to check the math, the measurements, and the possibility that this could come about by chance, <a href="http://www.tobeornottobe.org/math">here</a> are PDFs for you.</p>

<p>The end of the video is astounding, and I don&#39;t want to spoil it, so <strong>spoiler alert.</strong></p>

<p>The cover has properties laid out similarly to old maps, with a G signifying the Earth, and NE for coordinates.</p>

<p>When you measure two of the angles in the triangles, by N and e respectively, for north and east, you get the Great Pyramid <a href="http://imgur.com/a/8R7by">coordinates within 300m</a>. Longitude is 99.99%, Latitude is just about 99.999% accurate, while longitude <em>which hadn&#39;t been yet been &#39;discovered&#39; [actually hadn&#39;t been released, the Empire had military superiority to keep after all]</em> is about 300m off, or 99.9999% accurate.</p>

<h1>Implications</h1>

<p>This practically <em>proves</em> that advanced esoteric information was given to Shakespeare, and most likely passed down - it pretty much points out that the source of this knowledge was ancient egypt.</p>

<p>Remember, the most influential western thinkers that basically birthed western thought spent time learning in Egypt.</p>

<p>Plato studied at the Temple of Waset for 11 years; Aristotle was there for 11-13 years; Socrates 15 years Euclid stayed for 10-11 years; Pythegoras for 22 yeasrs; Hypocrates studies for 20 years.</p>

<p>I run <a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a> - the work of Nassim Haramein which essentially proves an ancient unified global civilization had also intimate knowledge of physics - sacred geometry such as the flower of life literally symbolizing the structure of space at the planck scale. </p>

<p>It&#39;s looking more and more like Graham Hancock is completely correct - there was an ancient, advanced, globe-spanning civilization that had high knowledge, and perhaps after catastrophe, encoded their knowledge in stone monuments and passed down secrets in mystery schools for millenia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... That actually really makes me want to try it out myself by mapping out <em>all</em> the triangles from the points on the Sonnets cover page, and then compare it to mapping out the triangles from 8 completely randomly placed points on a page, and seeing if I can derive the same mathematical constants. Then to really science it, try it at least 2 more times.<br/>
I&#39;m seriously interested in this esoteric Shakespeare theory, and I haven&#39;t actually seen anyone debunk it yet. I&#39;ve only seen people say similar stuff to what you said - that it&#39;s practically a given that you can derive those numbers regardless of where the points are simply due to there being so many available angles. It would take a bit of time/effort though... So don&#39;t expect me to report back later today haha. Maybe on a weekend soon though... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>just playing devils advocate here, but I&#39;m working on a graphic novel and I find it rather enjoyable to hide clues about the story &quot;in plain site&quot; while writing/illustrating it.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I tend to agree with you here. I like to write and create music and art, and I love to include information that hints toward deeper ideas. People create art to make a point. Especially authors. It&#39;s not like people pump out stories simply for the sake of fame without any ulterior motive. And Shakespeare wasn&#39;t even famous in his day! A lot of his work only got recognised after he died. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well no, because the message in my personal art and music is more about bringing these esoteric ideas more to the forefront of consciousness and utilising them more in daily life. Though this is behind the pretty sounds and pictures I put it with, of course. Context is everything. If someone noticed the esoteric references in my music/art and then attributed that to me being part of the illuminati, simply because of the references, then that&#39;s lazy. If someone notices them, then really listens to what I&#39;m saying again while bearing that in mind, it becomes obvious that it&#39;s not about secrecy. It&#39;s about positive utility. I wish I could link you something but I just don&#39;t have anything online at the moment. I only recently got myself some recording equipment, so hopefully in the coming months I&#39;ll be able to get all my stuff online. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mathematical cherry picking to discredit greatest writer of all time? Have any of you ever read Shakespeare? He&#39;s not Francis Bacon, nor was he a mathematician. He was a theatre writer that was incredibly gifted with words and played with words and combinations of words ALL THE TIME. His vocabulary is/was unrivaled. Hence you can probably bend the numbers anyway you want. For instance the &quot;speed&quot; sonnet gets measured in metric units. The &quot;earth&quot; sonnet measured in standard units.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Problem with this is, all of these samples are taken circa 1612 and after when he likely had syphilis.</p>

<p>Another problem I have with the Shakespeare conspiracies, is that there seems to be a cognitive dissonance about it.  On the one hand Shakespeare is Francis Bacon, or a Bacon type, or even a group of those types--an all knowing entity who knows the secret math of the universe, AND knows how to write damn-good poetry to boot.  On the other hand, he is an illiterate drunk farm-hand that never stepped foot near the theatre.  Those are too wholly disparate to reconcile.  Maybe it so goes that the former party uses the identity of the latter party for purposes of disguise and anonymity.  If so, why this one particular man?  Why not just attribute it to Christopher Marlowe, the heralded genius of the time?</p>

<p>Another issue I have with this so-called genre of scholarship:  clear and plain ignorance of the history of literature.  Never do I hear a mention of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the man who made Shakespeare a god to the western world.  Never do you hear about Donne or Swift or Spenser.  All of which were geniuses in their own right, either an influence on or influenced by Shakespeare.  Were they &quot;in on it?&quot; Is all of human literature just a secret code concocted by lizard people to tell only the worthiest of humans how the world actually works?</p>

<p>Maybe, just maybe, a man who invented half the words we use today, a man that lived in a time pre-dating Samuel Johnson&#39;s dictionary which standardized ENGLISH and more importantly to his discussion, standardized ENGLISH spelling, maybe that man enjoyed playing with words and letters, maybe even including how to spell his name.  Maybe, just maybe, that man was pointing to the fluidity of the sonic values of the English language, and maybe he was pointing to the absurdity in the new and unfamiliar but necessary convention of attributing arbitrary shapes to absolutely represent those sounds. Maybe.  Maybe not.  But I think y&#39;all&#39;s Shakespeare Conspiracy scholarship has a lot more work to do before any real Shakespearean gives it credence. </p>

<p>Hancock might be a taaaaaad too into artifacts and things, and not enough into old texts, thus missing Anu, Anubis, etc.  Perhaps lacking synergy (lots of these researcher lack synergy)?</p>

<p>Now that I am pondering... all his work is on the Saturn/Venus/Mars/Earth axis.  No mention of Sirius at any point.  I&#39;ve seen all the major presentations and most of the little 10-15 minute videos, but maybe I&#39;ve missed Sirius.  One would think with all the attention paid to the celestial bodies in his works that Sirius, given how prominently that system is featured in cultures, would have gotten some air time.  Curious.</p>

<p>He never struck me as a David Icke-type (flooding disinfo, misinfo, and real info all together).  Do you feel there is misinfo in Hancock?  Disinfo?  Or lack of info?  Does one need dis- or mis-info to be a limited hangout or could lack of synergy also qualify one for limited hangout?</p>

<p>Neither. I think he&#39;s a disinfo agent. He wins our trust by giving up some seemingly sensitive information -- that is, civilization is much older than we&#39;re told -- but conceals the really important stuff -- Sirius and the Great Year / Yuga Cycle. Classic limited hangout.</p>

<p>This proves that the ancient builders at least had knowledge of other monuments’ precise locations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or it’s a coincidence, since those actually happen a lot in a complex world. At any rate, since the premise (above) is flawed, this doesn’t prove anything at all. </p>

<p>That being said, even though my heart wants to believe there’s something to this, my inner skeptic says you’re bound to find seemingly meaningful patterns in random places if you look hard enough and go through enough things.  If you’ve seen A Beautiful Mind, then this is the exact scenario that plays out.</p>

<p>How do we know this isn’t just a coincidence?  Is there anything Shakespeare said or left behind that indicates we should look at this particular piece of paper for mathematical patterns?  It’s just too seemingly random for me to not have some lingering skepticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did just that.</p>

<p>First, I considered his explanations during the AMA. Alan had a strong rebuttal for <em>every single criticism</em> levelled at his work. He was more than happy to explain, clarify and go into great detail with anyone who asked.</p>

<p>Then I checked those workings for myself — and it all checks out. It’s all on <a href="http://www.tobeornottobe.org/math">his website</a> and the notes explain the boundary criteria clearly.</p>

<p>The killer point though, one which absolutely every critic seems to miss, is that the tolerances required to obtain these specific 12 constants to three decimal places,  the values for which emerge in sequence one after the other, are only achievable if the dots and lines are <strong>precisely</strong> the size found on that specific version of the Sonnets title page.</p>

<p>Not only that, the constants — all 12 of which also emerge when taking the shortest possible path through the vertices of the Great Pyramid — are revealed as a chain of dependencies. It is not possible to find them all in isolation, as some depend on the emergent circle, or on emergent angles from intersections that are not directly marked on the page.</p>

<p>I was one of his strongest critics at the start of the AMA. Over the week he was answering questions I flipped completely. These patterns were encoded on purpose, of that I have no doubt. As to the consequences, I don’t know. The provenance of the title page is the next step in this mystery for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been digging into ancient civilisations and I believe 100% that a major, advanced and intelligent civilisation existed before humans of any kind. I also believe that many of our religions or stories come from (mis?)translated texts from the previous civilisation that our ancestors discovered.</p>

<p>I also believe this civilisation got their arse to mars before another cataclysmic event on Earth.</p>

<p>Then I started to think about david Icke.</p>

<p>He&#39;s right man. Clever dinosaurs came before the human civilisation.</p>

<p>Most, if not all conspiracies involving ancient tech, hidden knowledge, our real history and the truth of Mars can be &#39;answered&#39; or at least given more sense if we accept that lizards roamed this planed for 100&#39;s of millions of years. Yet we are expect to believe that primates ruled for a million or so years before they spat us out?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is quite evident that William Shakspere could not, unaided, have produced the immortal writings bearing his name. He did not possess the necessary literary culture, for the town of Stratford where he was reared contained no school capable of imparting the higher forms of learning reflected in the writings ascribed to him. His parents were illiterate, and in his early life he evinced a total disregard for study. There are in existence but six known examples of Shakspere&#39;s handwriting. All are signatures, and three of them are in his will. The scrawling, uncertain method of their execution stamps Shakspere as unfamiliar with the use of a pen, and it is obvious either that he copied a signature prepared for him or that his hand was guided while he wrote. No autograph manuscripts of the &quot;Shakespearian&quot; plays or sonnets have been discovered, nor is there even a tradition concerning them other than the fantastic and impossible statement appearing in the foreword of the Great Folio...</p>

<p>Scores of volumes have been written to establish Sir Francis Bacon as the real author of the plays and sonnets popularly ascribed to William Shakspere. An impartial consideration of these documents cannot but convince the open-minded of the verisimilitude of the Baconian theory. In fact those enthusiasts who for years have struggled to identify Sir Francis Bacon as the true &quot;Bard of Avon&quot; might long since have won their case had they emphasized its most important angle, namely, that Sir Francis Bacon, the Rosicrucian initiate, wrote into the Shakespearian plays the secret teachings of the Fraternity of R.C. and the true rituals of the Freemasonic Order, of which order it may yet be discovered that he was the actual founder. A sentimental world, however, dislikes to give up a traditional hero, either to solve a controversy or to right a wrong. Nevertheless, if it can be proved that by raveling out the riddle there can be discovered information of practical value to mankind, then the best minds of the world will cooperate in the enterprise. The Bacon-Shakspere controversy, as its most able advocates realize, involves the most profound aspects of science, religion, and ethics; <strong>he who solves its mystery may yet find therein the key to the supposedly lost wisdom of antiquity</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m inclined to agree with Manly P. Hall&#39;s analysis, at least in part, that he (Shakespeare) was using a pseudonym, had incorporated esoteric symbolism into his work reflective of an individual initiated into the mysteries, likely a Freemason and Rosicrucian of his era, possibly a member of the secretive Order of Unknown Philosophers, and may very well have been none other than Francis Bacon, if not Edward de Vere or Dr. John Dee. I suppose the jury&#39;s still out on that one.</p>

<p>It may not have always had no atmosphere. Besides, if the planet has low gravity and no magnetic field, doesn&#39;t that point to a huge cataclysm?</p>
