        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there&#39;s a new advert for some beer, I can&#39;t tell you what brand it is tbh as I saw it when I was staying in a hotel. I don&#39;t watch T.V.</p>

<p>As a side note, I watched T.V. for the first time in maybe 5 years and level of advertising is just...wow. How can people not see this for what it is?</p>

<p>Anyway, predictably this beer advert repeats a stupid phrase which makes no sense to me. The phrase is &quot;dilly dilly&quot;, whatever the fuck that means and just as predictable as the ending to a Michael Bay film I saw and heard many young lads celebrating and cheering over Dilly Dilly. Without having any background to what it Is or what it means, these young airheads were chanting it verbatim for most of the night.</p>

<p>I mean, do advertising companies have to try anymore when this level of dross influences the idiots so easy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have a question.  are you more annoyed at it from a language cop perspective and you think it sounds stupid? (it does in fact sound stupid)  are you angry that a corporation is behind this, and you&#39;re more of an organic type?  you&#39;d be ok if there was a dilly dilly using crowd and this had grown around a seed of something.  but fuck it since it&#39;s a mainstream shit ad for mainstream shit beer you are offended enough by the notion already gtfouttahere?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good question, I like it.</p>

<p>I would say a tiny bit of all of those combined, they go towards the annoyance. In reality though, it&#39;s seeing how easily people can be fooled with something so [insert word here along the lines of silly, easily manipulated, careless with their attention]. If it&#39;s that easy to make people chant commands at will like that, then imagine what people could be pushed into doing using subtle tactics and a little bit of pressure.</p>

<p>I suppose the dilly dilly thing hurts the humanity inside of me. To know that we haven&#39;t changed from having buzzwords implanted into our minds that can cause us to do what is intended. Luckily in this case it&#39;s just buying beer. What if it was a command to kill all Christians, protestants, Catholics etc. </p>

<p>To think that we haven&#39;t evolved in over 500 years really saddens me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.</p>

<p>This seems like another Americanised advert trying to target an audience they know nothing about.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey Junior, let&#39;smake an ad for the UK, those guys love getting &#39;pissed&#39;&quot; <em>American sniggering</em>.</p>

<p>&quot;Good idea, Larry. They want something strong, like a bud light, because they can handle their beer&quot;.</p>

<p>I see people swapping to micro-brewery type ales and craft like you say. Big brand beer seems to have had it&#39;s day in a lot of areas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Advertising Person here: we all hate it.</p>

<p>My best guess is the strategy is to create ‘stand out’ - it’s a phrase that you would only hear in the context of these ad campaigns.</p>

<p>It’s a lazy way to create ‘stickiness’ and resonance with an audience across multiple platforms - it also works in print because the phrase looks weird. It’s a technique typically used when there is no product USP worth talking about. You’d then get that trigger again with in store or in bar media - you see the phrase and recall a Bud Light. Another example in the drinks category is making a campaign with a specific drink order that you’d remember at the bar - like ‘So Co Le Mo’ which was Southern Comfort and Lemonade. </p>

<p>Bud has history with this technique and trying to orchestrate a ‘social meme’ - remember the whassup?! Campaign? It becomes a cultural thing that implicitly reminds people of the advert, and so product. That was good and effective, this is annoying and too obvious. </p>

<p>Some campaigns deliberately create annoying adverts because they become ‘top of mind’. This is most important for products in a marketplace that has very close competitors with little differentiation outside a brand. Best UK example would be comparison sites like ‘Compare the Meerkat’ or ‘Go Compare’. You use them rarely, so you have to create lasting stand out. When you come to the point of googling a comparison engine, you are more likely to remember the thing that annoyed you. </p>

<p>Hope that helps! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for that breakdown from the horses&#39; mouth, so to speak.</p>

<p>This is part of the grudge I have against this type of advertising; it&#39;s lazy. Some phrases might cheese me off because it&#39;s direct from advertising or a marketing campaign and I can see how some of the ads deserve a little respect for their cleverness. This dilly dilly is, as you say, a lazy way to implant a trigger for bud light.</p>

<p>On the flip side of the coin, the KFC apology is some of my favourite marketing in the world. An empty bucket that had FCK written on it. Clever, cutting and completely honest. </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note how few ads seem to actually advertise their product these days. It&#39;s become less about convincing people your product is superior and more about presenting something that will stick in their head. A product of how depleted our attention spans are I suppose. </p>
