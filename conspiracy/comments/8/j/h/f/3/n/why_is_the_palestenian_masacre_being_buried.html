       Because our greatest ally can do no wrong! While the rich zionist scumbags celebrate their embassy, soldiers are mowing down thousands of unarmed civilians, including women and children out by the border. Its genocide, but because Israel is doing it, they get a free pass.

       Imagine if Russia brutally murdered dozens of peaceful protesters in an open air prison. Imagine if China did this. What would media coverage of that look like?
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the media coverage of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989">
        Tiananmen Square protests of 1989
       </a>
       . If the media was covering this matter correctly and not burying the lede, coverage of this ongoing massacreing of Palestinian civilians would get that kind of coverage. People will be talking about this for decades just like the Tiananmen protests, but the corporate media is doing the bare minimum just so people like you can defend their bullshit and say "no, see, they're covering it!"

       That it is getting buried.  I was listening to NPR on my way home last night and they were talking about it for a bit.  They interviewed our ambassador to Israel in the morning and he stated that Israel has handled the situation just fine and with restraint, then they couldn't get him to make a comment after even more protesters were murdered later that day.  So it is definitely out there, but in my opinion could be getting covered even more.

       If it was Russia, Syria or pretty much anywhere else...they would be playing the clips of protestors being shot as they lay on the ground praying. It would be on TV 24/7 with the pictures of the dead children. So yes I agree it's not getting covered enough. It is being mentioned by the news in the most minimal way possible.

       It is minimal, but I think part of that is that no politicians are really talking about it or willing to interview about it.  It took someone at NPR being in Israel to get a statement from our ambassador and then they wouldn't respond again after more deaths were reported.  There is quite a bit of disturbing coverage of it from various sources, but you can only show the same content with little to no commentary from people in important positions before viewers get bored.  What I would like to see is some news agency give a damn and cover this sort of thing until the average viewer starts to understand that the Israel/Palestine thing isn't so one sided as our politicians make it seem.  I'm not going to hold my breath though.

       Sorry friend, this wasn't up for debate. I was referring to actual videos of them sniping Palestinians as they are praying on the ground with their heads down.  Want to tell me again I am wrong?

       Was that Canadian Palestinian doctor who got shot trying to breach a fence to kill civilians?
Can I get video evidence of the people who were shot cutting through a fence?

       Fuck Hamas. But the IDF knows rules of engagement and what they are doing is illegal.

       Watched the whole video, still don’t see it. Wants to show evidence credibly and sources al jazeera LOL u might as well ask Hamas which videos you should and shouldn’t use. Also perhaps you should join the military and see about your precision when there’s 10000 violent protestors.

       Yeah there being shot as they pray at 48 seconds. I bet that doctor who got hit was fake too? Are they fake videos or "it's hard to have precision" which excuse are u going with?

       There are fake videos, idk if that one for sure was .. have you seen the guy with the crutches? I’ve caught videos of Al Jazeera providing half truths and I’ve compared them to the full videos. Al Jazeera does that all the time. It doesn’t mean 10k people violently charged the fence but if there’s 50 people and amongst 50 , 10 are hurling stones, And Molotov cocktails and then it happens to be that 11 or 12 we’re injured then what do you expect israel to do to protect themselves? Except in this case there were 10,000 protestors who brought little kids in hopes they would get hurt. 60 people were killed 52 of which were Hamas members. Do Israelis have to die for you to justify israel defending itself?

       It's not being buried, our media outlets are doing their best to push a deadly narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hamas is using the "useful idiots" to die for their cause and even more "useful idiots" to report on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real conspiracy here is that a terrorist organization has convinced poor people to die for nothing all the while, the media outlets are complicit in their deaths by reporting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's not being buried, I've heard so much about I'm sick of it. One of the Hamas leaders even bragged this weekend about how he was going to use these people as a weapon.
