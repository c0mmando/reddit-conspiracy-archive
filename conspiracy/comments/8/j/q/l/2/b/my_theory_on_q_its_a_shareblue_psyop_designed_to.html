       Nothing about q is real

       And by buying into q conspiracy theories trump supporters will end up defending the very people working against trump. Because "its all part of trumps 4d chess"

       People like sessions get defended because "trust trump" becomes an excise to divert away from asking real queations.

       Hmm. That IS interesting
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally noone even had any IDEA that trump was even TRYING to do anything with north korea or iran until cnn reported it a few weeks ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how could q have known?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is absolute proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to prove im actually q
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill make this prediction
      </p>
      <p>
       Within a short time trump will have a one on one meeting with kim jong un himself. I know because i work with trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also (and this is because im q) i know for a FACT that soon. Very soon. Trump will cut funding to planned Parenthood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noone else could know that. Only a high level trump person could know that.

       Are you going to back up your claim that the_donald was discussing Trump meeting with Kim back in November? Would love to see your source on that.

       We were discussing it before november. U can check.

       Its ridiculous

       But some people have this innate need to feel like Donald Trump is 100% in control. Combined with the need to feel like they're special. So they believe this idea to the top level agent in the government is communicating to them specifically on a white supremacist message board because they're special. And this top agent just confirming that every single thing that happens in the entire world is all part of Trumps plan plan

       Not really sure what you’re getting at, Q anon is often discussed at the_donald. Memes and links have originated from /pol or 8chan since the sub started.

       The mental gymnastics necessary to continue your delusions is quite scary. You have not provided a single source for any claim you have made, and have replied multiple times to individual comments.

       An in depth debunking of Q is needed with anything false that has been posted.

       General speculation without concrete examples mean nothing.

       It's only been speculated that's what the Q stands for. Other guesses are Q from Star Trek and Q from the Bond films. I don't think there's hard proof of the true origin of the name one way or the other.

       Actually, it's the equivalent of Top Secret (TS) for the Dept of Energy. Officially speaking, there is no "higher" level than TS, however there are an unknowable number of acknowledged and unacknowledged keyword referenced programs, which could simply be thought of as bodies of information carved up in very specific ways. Some keyword programs
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_White">
        aren't so secret
       </a>
       , while others will never be known. In many cases, you're going to find all of your classified details right in the public. It's the map that ties them all together that's classified.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mention of "Q" clearance really bothered me initially since my tickets come from a DoD background and its much less common. The questions that Q has managed to string together in the course of over 1000 posts that lead to public information...almost like a map, show that he has access to a level of data that is uncommon for most people.

       VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis said Tuesday he has thought about when it might be time to "take leave" of his flock — a cryptic comment that could hint at another papal retirement down the line or a suggestion to other bishops that it's time to go.

       Yes. Because the top level govt guy chose YOU and only YOU to share his secret info.

       Hes trying to "get people prepared" and "spread the word" by posting vague cryptic messages on a white supremacist message board that nobody uses.

       He uses 4chan cuz its Anonymous. Because if the fbi tried to figure out who he was theyd be stumped because they go off usernames.

       They dont have any high twch ways of tracing people. Its all uaernames and 4chan doesnt have those.

       I don't think that tone is necessary or helpful. They're agreeing with you that it's suspicious that Q has made outlandish claims that appear to have been proven false. Soon, this Pope prediction will probably be proven to be bullshit too.

       How would you know that was fake? Because it was an epic fail? I've been following this Q thing and that sub for months now. Hes predicted big shit to happen about once a week. Its fan fiction. Absolutley nobody has been arrested except for a bunch of Trump guys. Its hilarious. Not Podesta, not Huma, not Hillary, just Trump guys.

       Because that one is the most direct, blatant, over the top prediction, which is not the same style as all the others. It looks more like someone’s attempt to pretend to be Q, make outrageous claims that are brazenly false, and then have everyone point to that as an example and say “See??? Q is full of shit!!” in order to discredit any legitimate posts in the future.

       And have you even bothered to follow the Awan case, or the NYPD and the FBIs case with Weiner’s laptop, or
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       besides the Muller investigation? Things are happening, people are resigning, being fired, pieces are moving.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a conspiracy theorist, you seem to be pretty dead set on closing the door to any possibilities other than what you’ve already decided is the case. Why bother caring about it at all if you don’t think it’s real?

       There definitely seems to be a suspicious amount of Q hate going on around here lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve seen enough examples of more than just general speculation and happenstance for it to be complete nonsense. But I’ve yet to see a set of examples of Q being wrong, or lying, or other things that would discredit him. All I see is a ton of people “just not believing it” because of reasons like “you don’t have to be a genius to fake posts like that”. Examples, please.

       My suspicion is genuine, why would anyone expect us to trust POTUS or Rudy Guliani or Mueller or Sessions? reminds me of how many of these were complicit in the 911 cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eric Prince's interview on Breibart was possibly the most interesting thing I ever heard. Why would a mercenary provider of the spooks call out HRC's gang? hmmm...smells like a counter coup false flag and control demolition of something or possibly the entire collapse of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q is a pysop, not just a LARP. Which makes me wonder, What exactly is the intended outcome of making the US government class eat itself? who is making this decision to 'pull' it?
      </p>
      <p>
       What was the insurance policy? FBI's, Anthony Weiner's?
      </p>
      <p>
       How will they mask this controlled Demo of the US?

       I doubt Q psyop is as benign as the poster would like to hope it is. I think it is much more sinister.

       Ehhhh I’m not so sure anymore. Ever since I started reading some of the posts on r/greatawakening, it really looks like there are definitely insiders posting anonymously out there. Yes there are posers and larpers, but I’ve seen enough posts get pretty specific about events that have been happening to believe that it’s not just a shareblue psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, the more attention people like Q get, larp or not, the more likely other insiders will think about jumping in.

       Lol I’m sorry, but this is one of the most speculative and inaccurate gish gallops I’ve ever seen. The author of that post is speaking about this topic with the same certainty that they mock he opposing side for having towards Q. The first half is straight speculation, and the second half is about the bullshit claims that we already discussed in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that’s your best “debunking”, and that is what you’re basing your conclusions on, then you are going off of just as much faith as those who follow Q’s post. You WANT it to be fake/psyop/larp just as much as they WANT it to be legit. Neither of you have any real proof for anything, so the fact that anyone is speaking in absolutes is just ridiculous.

       It'd be strange if shareblue was behind this PR campaign, but I agree that Q is actually a public relations campaign. The goal is to keep conspiracy a minded people engaged and supportive of Trump. The goal is to trick "conspiracy theorists" into blindly supporting the crimes of the government when we'd otherwise be united against their bullshit.

       I don't think that tone is necessary or helpful. They're agreeing with you that it's suspicious that Q has made outlandish claims that appear to have been proven false. Soon, this Pope prediction will probably be proven to be bullshit too.

       It's only been speculated that's what the Q stands for. Other guesses are Q from Star Trek and Q from the Bond films. I don't think there's hard proof of the true origin of the name one way or the other.
