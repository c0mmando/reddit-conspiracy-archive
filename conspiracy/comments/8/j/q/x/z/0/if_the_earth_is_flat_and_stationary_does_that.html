<p>I&#39;ve heard of time travel depending on relativity, but is there another way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many forms of time travel. Let&#39;s start with the wormhole. Two black holes are intertwined. You than accelerate one to a high % of the speed of light. This will slow time in the accelerated black hole. You could than traverse back in time, but only as far as the moment of being intertwined minus the aging of the accelerated one.</p>

<p>In simple terms. You cut a piece of paper in two and put one half in a super fast rocket on a round trip. After the trip you tape the paper together which now consists of different age you can cross over.</p>

<p>The counter. The presence of mass would destabilize this connection if it does form, thus unable to exist.</p>

<p>Secondly, tachyonic particles. Tachyonic particles are very possible in the math of current theory. In fact the only reason we think they don&#39;t exist is we believe quantum fluxtuations would trigger tachyonic condensation before a tachyonic field hit negative mass. Nothing contradicts tachyons existing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t know. However, hawking radiation is a form of time travel. A virtual pair of particles is created by quantum fluxtuations right at the boundary. One particle excapes which means the other particle that falls back has to have negative mass, and thus be tachyonic, which lowers the mass of the black hole when it falls in.</p>

<p>Tachyonic particles are faster than the speed of light and thus can cause time travel. Though there is debate over relative efects of tachyonic particles which woukd interfere with information travel faster than the sped of light. Specifically local effects vs global effects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s simple.  For time travel to exist at any time it must exist at every time.  Imagine Rome.  I&#39;ve never been there, so it is currently a place without me.  If i go there it will forever be a place i influenced.  Small, grant you, but i will be a part just from my minor interactions, even with just a waiter as i order wine.  As i asked for that glass who&#39;s to say that waiter didn&#39;t miss a chance to meet his future wife?  The implications of time travel are so dangerous that even if it were possible, it would be outlawed and destroyed upon discovery of it&#39;s tampering.</p>
