       According to Eric Dubay, since the Earth is the Flat center of the universe, relativity does not exist. Now, if we take the premise that relativity is not real, does that mean time travel is impossible? I've heard of time travel depending on relativity, but is there another way? I know this is somewhat science but considering that I've seen a lot of time travel in movies in wondering if the elites might know something about travel that the sheeple don't.

       No, I simply want to have a discussion without being attacked. This topic is about time travel, not flat earth. I use the word premise to have a discussion and hold off the attacks. It's basically a way to avoid debate. But unfortunately I can't even have that. Mentioning flat earth gets attacked no matter what. Even if you try to avoid it because a bunch of assholes get paid to derail the topics.

       There are many forms of time travel. Let's start with the wormhole. Two black holes are intertwined. You than accelerate one to a high % of the speed of light. This will slow time in the accelerated black hole. You could than traverse back in time, but only as far as the moment of being intertwined minus the aging of the accelerated one.
      </p>
      <p>
       In simple terms. You cut a piece of paper in two and put one half in a super fast rocket on a round trip. After the trip you tape the paper together which now consists of different age you can cross over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The counter. The presence of mass would destabilize this connection if it does form, thus unable to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, tachyonic particles. Tachyonic particles are very possible in the math of current theory. In fact the only reason we think they don't exist is we believe quantum fluxtuations would trigger tachyonic condensation before a tachyonic field hit negative mass. Nothing contradicts tachyons existing.

       Don't know. However, hawking radiation is a form of time travel. A virtual pair of particles is created by quantum fluxtuations right at the boundary. One particle excapes which means the other particle that falls back has to have negative mass, and thus be tachyonic, which lowers the mass of the black hole when it falls in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tachyonic particles are faster than the speed of light and thus can cause time travel. Though there is debate over relative efects of tachyonic particles which woukd interfere with information travel faster than the sped of light. Specifically local effects vs global effects.

       Well, it's simple.  For time travel to exist at any time it must exist at every time.  Imagine Rome.  I've never been there, so it is currently a place without me.  If i go there it will forever be a place i influenced.  Small, grant you, but i will be a part just from my minor interactions, even with just a waiter as i order wine.  As i asked for that glass who's to say that waiter didn't miss a chance to meet his future wife?  The implications of time travel are so dangerous that even if it were possible, it would be outlawed and destroyed upon discovery of it's tampering.

       I think he means if time travel were possible, we would be seeing time travelers. I thit it more likely that would just spawn another universe where changes would be sort of possible, but not let you alter your own original timeline.

       yes this is how i've always thought of it. influencing/changing the past creates a new alternate reality, such that the traveler jumps realities to the desired point in time instead of jumping time within a single reality.

       For there to be a reality that needs you to jump in is flawed.   You were sent for damage control from either an earlier time travel fuck up or to stop a fanatic that thought something should have happened a certain way.  Or...it would be possible to be so advanced you are to observe without our knowledge.

       Multiverse Theory is already established in Mathematics. So I'm not really following you when you say that the premise
       <em>
        a reality needing your presence

       is flawed.

       Multiverse is not a concept I agree with, so that may be where we aren't seeing eye to eye.  I belive this is the only universe.  I belive it's huge, and expanding, but this is it.  I belive there are MANY elements we have to discover.

       Time dilation is a fact.  If time moves slower for person A, and faster for person B, then person B will "time travel" forward with respect to person A.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is fact, not opinion.  The best example being that time dilation has to be accounted for in GPS calculations.

       Just imagine the scenario where you're skeptically talking to someone about 9/11 being pivotal to the new Pearl Harbour for PNAC, and they say jokingly, "you're one of those flat-earthers aren't ya?"..

       So it's not about your individual beliefs, it's about sustaining the attention of people IRL and gaining incremental footholds in credibility so that useful information might be spread.

       Isn't there a sci-fi sub to discourse in, where you can freely treat science and truth as a novelty?

       This is not IRL. It's the Internet. You're acting as if I'm trying to make some change to the scientific community. I'm not. Some people don't believe in aliens, and according to NASA, they haven't been discovered. So what is happening in this topic is the equivalent of people attacking someone saying "if aliens are real, what powers would they have" and refusing to acknowledge a potential truth and speaking as if it was true for the sake of discussion

       How is it you figure that a bunch of people who have wired themselves to sniff out bullshit and then theorise about insidious plots, are going to treat your ideas as sacrosanct and not "attack" you, when in truth, they're no less full of holes and deception than the average propaganda piece or moronic psyop?

       Multiverse Theory is already established in Mathematics. So I'm not really following you when you say that the premise
       <em>
        a reality needing your presence
       </em>
       is flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       are you meaning concerning your specific example, or time travel theory in general?

       Multiverse is not a concept I agree with, so that may be where we aren't seeing eye to eye.  I belive this is the only universe.  I belive it's huge, and expanding, but this is it.  I belive there are MANY elements we have to discover.
