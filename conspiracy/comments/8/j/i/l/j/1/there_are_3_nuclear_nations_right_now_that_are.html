       While we are told day after day that it's Iran, North Korea, and Russia that endanger peace, this is simply not true. I am no fan of either of these countries regimes either, but these are not the countries that are starting the most potentially dangerous conflicts. These are not the countries that have an alliance that has more military might than any other alliance in human history. Now, their alliance is not simple and not as close-nit as, say the Israeli/Nato/Saudi alliance, as India still considers Russia a strong ally, but the nature of geopolitics and diplomacy can shift very rapidly when there is a lot at stake, and right now, there is. The Powers That Be are pushing towards more global conflict, more perpetual war, and more empire. The United States is expanding it's nuclear arsenal and updating their nuclear battle plans for more potential uses. This is real. We are at great risk of nuclear annihilation now than we ever have been before. The US, Israel, and India have many similar enemies, they greatly enjoy their supremacy of their respective regions, and it's obvious that they would do anything to maintain their power. Anything. We are in very dangerous times, and I feel like people don't discuss this aspect of current events very much. India and Pakistan have been engaged in the longest nuclear cold war in history, and everyone just pretends it isn't even happening. Israel's illegal obtaining of nuclear weapons has started a nuclear cold war in the middle east, and you can bet Saudi Arabia will soon use the destruction of the Iran deal as an excuse to start obtaining nukes too. And the USA, of course, the ones who started all of this at the end of WWII, most definitely cannot be trusted to be responsible with their nuclear arsenal. If the world ends in nuclear fire, you can almost guarantee it will be the fault of at least one of these countries. It's terrifying that it's so easy to recognize three nations that easily have the potential to end all life on Earth. What's more terrifying is how passive about this fact everyone seems to be.

       Is it wrong to acknowledge the danger of these three nations and their nuclear arsenals and their consistent warmongering? I'm not telling people to panic, but it worries me that we don't discuss this more.

       Russia, China, US, UK, Israel, et al... are all controlled by the same puppet masters. You're playing into their game, by not realizing this. Let me know when any other country actually says/presents that 9/11 was an inside job (to name one).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know when Russia removes it's holocaust denial laws. Let me know, when any country backs out of UN drug treaties (Treaties trump Domestic Law(s)).
      </p>
      <p>
       None do, and none will. Why? They are all controlled (International Law - Rome). Good cop, bad cop. How people do not see this, is beyond me.
      </p>
      <p>
       By all means, talk about it. But, IMO, it's the equivalent of people squabbling about who won, or should've won America's Got Talent.

       If that's true, then he may very well be a deep state puppet.

       the budget of the bjp (demagogue pm modi's right wing party) in 2014 election was comparable to obama 2008 budget. Today, the last state held by the big rival party (which is also corrupt af, just like dems and repubs in usa 2 party system) was snatched away by bjp. i think even more terrible times are imminent now.

       plus a VAT like tax called GST was next introduced, both combined have broken the back of innumerable businesses, the overall atmosphere is like a bad recession, but the obviously corrupt paty keeps winning. I think the elections are a total fraud, but massive media propaganda ensures people don't smell the con. The other big corrupt party that's losing is part of the same team, i think they're deliberately fucking up in order to give complete consolidation of power to their so-called rival. Educated able non-corrupt people elected ministers are going extinct. I don't know what to make of it, except every cell in my body wants to desperately move out of this country, but can't because no money. Oh God, if only i had gone through with the purchase of 10 bitcoins i almost made in 2012 and held onto them. That way my one way out and i missed it.

       Just think. In all these years are we to believe no one has fired a nuke? With all the tension and possession of these weapons by “belligerent” nations, the only time we’ve used them is on Hiroshima and Nagasaki for no reason, the effects look just like the other Japanese cities which were fire bombed, and no one has launched one since?
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplest explanation is that nukes are merely a Sword of Damocles, a fictional construct, and don’t exist in the way they have been described.
