       Did you ever notice?  Every rich person on earth can't shut up about social justice, income inequality, and oppression.  Why?  I mean, according to the traditional mantra, the rich are evil people who only care for themselves while the rest of us peasants dutifully serve them.  Yet, you look at youtube or any organization today and, without exception, every rich person supports a socialist, support the poor, welfare policy.  Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do these rich people not realize that socialism means, literally, that their wealth will be taken away to support the poor?  I mean, are they stupid or something?  Why would they support a cause that could mean doom for them?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer, of course, is that, no, they are not stupid.  In fact, they are the smartest people on the planet.  It is YOU they are duping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout history, one pattern remains.  That pattern is this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Wealth accumulates to a certain population.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The rest of the population revolts when they are too poor
       </li>
       <li>
        They kill the ones with the wealth
       </li>
       <li>
        They redistribute the wealth
       </li>
       <li>
        The cycle starts anew
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So what is the best plan for this cycle to stop repeating?  Convince the poor that you are on their side.  Convince them that if you support the rich, they will give you enough bread crumbs to survive.  hmmm....
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you need convincing that the rich ARE NOT progressive or that they even care about the poor?  Consider this.  Bezos is worth at least $100 billion.  If he donated 90% of his wealth to start programs to make this country better, he would still have enough money to last multiple lifetimes.  But does he do so?  Nope.  Does ANY billionaire do what they preach?  NOPE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be fooled.  These rich are only saying they support the poor and the oppressed, simply because they want to stay rich.  Afterall, are you going to protest against Zuckerburg when he has donated $100 mil to public schools in Newark?  They realize that the only way to stay rich is to make the rest of the population complacent.  And the best way to make sure they are complacent is to say "Hey, bro, I'm on your side".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, am I advocating a rebellion against the elite?  Absolutely not.  I am a capitalist at heart and always will be.  These guys got rich because they worked hard and they deserve it.   I'm merely saying, don't be fooled.  These rich guys?  Yeah, they don't give a crap about you and never will.  Don't be fooled.

       You denied the fact that that Palm Beach police discovered 2 cameras in Jeffrey Epstein's home.  Instead, you claimed "Q" made it up.  Sounds like you are a pedophile yourself.  Waste of skin.

       Well socialism does NOT mean that the rich will be forced to give all their money to the poor. Wealth would be better distributed but the rich will still be rich, the poor still poor. The gap would be much less and hopefully poverty could be eradicated. Not all rich people lean that left. Although it is food for thought that the wealthiest people in America who have more than they will ever need to spend, want wealth more distributed and less poverty.

       if the wealth had their wealth redistributed then why do royal family lines exist?  why do monarchies exist?  why are the same class of people in the same roles and this lasts for centuries?  your model is flawed.  what actually tends to happen is that the ruling groups create a fallguy over a period of years/decades, initiate a false flag such that most people accept the fallguy canard, crush the fallguy amidst public cries of reform, gain a small window where the public is sated and thus not interested in policy, and some other puppet is put back in charge.  same as it ever was.

       They're talking about how some wealthy people are deep in the Democrat club. They're talking about how the wealthy elites make use of controlled opposition to convince poor people that they should support billionaires rather than desire to knock them down a peg. They're saying not to trust billionaires who claim to be for "social justice", because they're really just trying to keep us on their side so we don't come for them and their hoarded wealth that they use to subjugate us.

       You just hear more from them because the media attacks anyone that is even neutral conservative.   Just look at Kanye, he said like 2 sentence about conservatives and got bashed on twitter and called crazy by the media.   Also Hollywood has created this liberal = the moral high ground narrative,  so people in the spotlight risk not being seen as having the moral high ground if they speak against liberal narratives in the media.

       Billionaires aren't leftists. Leftists advocate things like the working class seizing the means of production by force. The billionaires are the ones we workers would be seizing the means of production FROM. They are in opposition to leftist goals empowering the working class. Leftists want universal healthcare for all, they want the government to spend more money on social programs, and they want billionaires to be taxed more heavily to cover the cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Liberal" Democrats are NOT leftist. Being in favor of allowing same-sex marriage is not what defines a "leftist".

       It's because "social justice" costs them nothing and wins them everything, and if anything, improves trade by insulating commodities from boycott. So they pay lip service to the .1% of the US that is transexual, and in exchange they are granted billions of dollars in government contracts, tax breaks, and financing.This is why the Democratic party is broken beyond repair.

       Original Poster, read the work of historian Antony Sutton. He wrote a wonderful book called "Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution" that documents how the rich in the West financed the Communists.
      </p>
      <p>
       His conclusion wasn't that they were "Communists," per se. But
       <em>
        like Communists
       </em>
       monopoly capitalists like centralization and "captured markets". Western financiers backed Lenin and Trotsky because they were given no-bid contracts for Russian lumber, Russian oil, Russian wheat, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bolsheviks were also receiving bonds from Western banks, through Olaf Ashberg (the so-called Bolshevik Banker) in Sweden. To pay for these bonds, the Bolsheviks were murdering the upper middle class and wealthy, liquidating their assets and sending the proceeds to the Western bankers to pay for these bonds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while the poor in Russia were being told that the Bolsheviks were killing the rich to "redistribute the wealth" to the poor, the money was in fact being funneled OUT of the country to Western banksters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "redistribution" was going up to the ultra-rich. Not down to the poor.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why so much Russian gold and Faberge eggs were flooding the West during the 1920s.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was listening to a Youtube video of a Professor discussing Sutton's work and he had a great what to encapsulate it: "Socialism is NOT a grassroots movement of the poor to protect the people from the bankers. It's a movement created by the wealthy to protect the bankers from the people."
      </p>
      <p>
       (They're using the State to strip-mine wealth from the ordinary citizens to transfer it up to the wealthy.)

       Seriously though, what billionaire supports socialism?
      </p>
      <p>
       As in actual socialism, the system that would not only strip billionaires of their wealth and power but make it impossible for them to every reclaim that power and wealth, not "welfare and the government does stuff" social democracy "socialism"

       Its an interesting theory... but the title already starts with a false assumption. Every ideology has its own set of wealthy supporters. As your needs are better met by your wealth sometimes these people move onto another purpose in life. Perhaps trying to leave a legacy that is bigger than money. But there is more than one reason.

       The most blatant "nice guy" is the UN, specifically Agenda 21 and 30. Once accomplished people will be concentrated in tenements. Rural areas will be cleared. "Clearing" was used by the royals to kick Scottish people *off their own land, it was called "The Clearing". These fuckers are NOT DONE. Once you're in your tenement, that can imprison, watch, and oppress you truly: Orwell's "If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever."

       The tech giants undid decades of labor-reform policies in one fell swoop with the 'sharing economy'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left (traditionally aligned with workers rights) scrambled to accommodate this new donor-base, replacing the workers-rights rhetoric with 'socially liberal' or 'identity politics' (Gays can get married, 'inclusive' work places, weed should be legal, etc....that's all fine, as long as we can continue to exploit labor).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now labor isn't represented anywhere in the political spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time people really rose up and killed the elites was the French Revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'elites' are not scared this will happen at the moment. They believe their modes of control are so absolute they can do whatever they want with impunity.
