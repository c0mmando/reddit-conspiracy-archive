       This sub has, in general, been considerably more lenient with content than other subs. This is a double edged sword. Yes, it seems ridiculous at times, but it can be useful at other times. You need to take the good with the bad. Starting down the road of censorship never ends well.

       i've been here for about as long (8yrs &amp; 3 accounts), and you cannot deny that the amount of posts that deal with current events has been increasing. political? of course! conspiracies are a natural side-effect of secrecy and black-ops programs. however, it seems like since the Boston Bombing or Sandy Hook posts exploded, the number of mainstream/current event posts have exploded as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       perhaps it was due to the lackluster 12/21/2012 or maybe more users are wanting to be the next big internet sleuth. I'm not sure. one thing i know is that the 2016 presidential election didn't help anything at all.

       I reckon it's more a reflection of the broader discussion in society....

       and frankly.. politics has gotten to he point where it is hard to tell the difference... so it reflects society, not how Reddit works imho

       Your missing the point. It's not that there's too much political topics posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's specifically r/politics style Infilitration... Which is radically pro MSM, neoliberal, and pro old gaurd establishment. R/politics is more rabid and delusional than the worst offenders on msnbc... And that shit is increasingly finding it's way here. And it's sad.

       One of the biggest conspiracies in American history is going on right now, and you want this sub to ignore it? I love posts about CIA psychics, and secret Nazi soul harvester moon bases, as much as most people here, but to think thats the only thing that belongs here is crazy.

       The biggest conspiracy of all is extraterritorial life. This sub ignores that completely despite thousands upon thousands of declassified documents out there for everyone to read. Yet all people worry about is how the government has been screwing them for years like its a new thing. The elites rule and you can do nothing about it even if they try. The next generation of kids will be of no use whatsoever being glued to social media 24/7.

       *Biggest conspiracy being reported on
      </p>
      <p>
       This is more of a conspiracy like Watergate, it's out in the open with very cleat cut evidence so it's reported on by mainstream press
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracies like aliens, and ancient civilisations, have lots of evidence, but even the biggest believers have to admit it's not super solid yet. Because of this it doesn't get as much mainstream attention, even if it's totally true.

       What conspiracies that have harmed us as citizens are not based in government and political acts and what conspiracies have been bigger than these very political conspiracies?
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back a little to Iran/Hostage, Iran Contra/guns/drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Star Wars Defense, (the cover story for the deployment of the massive global  data collecting installations).
      </p>
      <p>
       The first and second Iraq Wars,
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2000/of and of course the 2014 midterm and 2016 election thefts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now of course this push for a war against Iran.
      </p>
      <p>

       It’s not as tinfoily as it sounds, actually, and it’s actually relatively low now, but until about a month or two ago it was like ground zero for r/politics and r/T_D users battling it out.

       Conspiracies are inherently political, so I think your question is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       As if LBJ conspiring with Israel to shoot JFK and same conspiring with Cheney to take down the WTC are obviously acts with tremendous political ramifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The belief in the lie is also a form of political control, which is a form of mind control.  You are supposed to be trained as a good american to refuse to see or acknowledge even the most obvious conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why the entire american media is obsessed with collusion, which is the same thing as a conspiracy.  They can't admit it, after all this, now all they can do every day is talk about how everything is a big conspiracy of one kind or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the military bombs freely on the map in Syria and no american(even the soldiers preparing to be sacrificed i suspect) has any clue what is going on over there whatsoever except her da der 9/11 never agin!
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think it is possible to have politics without conspiracy and a conspiracy without a political dimension is actually difficult to imagine.  Even mice conspire in some circumstances.  Wolves in a pack may conspire.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are allowed to conspire in a political campaign over what your messaging will be and when you propose legislation in congress.  It's' not an absoslute thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is simply a space in human culture and society where people need to think freely and look at the actual connections behind the scenes, which we know very well to be well crafted veneers like the paint job on a Trump construction project.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should it be shameful, oh you're one of those, or oh you are talking about the conspricy woo woo needs to stop.  it's just a part of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all conspiracies are bad, anyone who says there aren't any bad and/or important ones though is trying to control your brain and that is not going to go well for you and yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, can you say something intelligent about the problems?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just as good, what do you think is the most important issue affected by the worst secret?

       the reason is that the stuff that is happening publicly now, is what this sub has been trying to bring to light for the last decade or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       things we have and are still being called "crazy" over are becoming widely known and accepted because the truth has been dug up.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean you are right a lot of it isn't the juicy stuff your looking for, but imho there is some celebratory vibes seeing the things we have known here for decades actually being reported on, and making sure they are discussed here only supports the things we have dug up that are still in the early phases of being exposed.
