       It’s just curious to me that r/conspiracy seems to be pushing the same anti-Israel narrative that the mainstream media has been pushing. Here I thought that they were the last people to be trusted.

       It's a brutish and cruel occupation with one side heavily armed and genocidal. How do you make reality look better for Israel. The media tries bit hard to put lipstick on this pig.

       Look through the history of how Israel has illegally taken land and implemented Israeli refugees into that land and now the land that the Palestinians do have left over they are forced to remain in that area without access to leave and better their circumstances

       The MSM's willingness to call out Israeli violence is a fairly recent development, and even with that they're still trying to downplay it linguistically, eg source like the NYT exclusively using passive voice in their headlines about it.

       Well they are ramping up killing people just in time for there new embassy and 70th anniversary, so you are going to see more anti Israeli stuff, it's literally in the news right now that they killed over 60 protestors so it's not really suspect to see a uptick in anti Israeli posts.

       Israelis are now openly murdering hundreds of desperate natives.  They stole their lands, deprive them of food, water, electricity.  Treat them as subhuman filth.  Ensure that the Palestinians have absolutely no hope for the future, for themselves or their children.  And when these natives respond with anything that isn't hopeless, helpless submission, they're openly slaughtered.

       Yep. They are celebrating 70 years of occupation and death. Since this secular Rothschild State of Israel likes pretend to be the biblical Israel, then 70 years usually marks destruction of such evil people. They may get their wishes answered.

       Trump admin didn't just put the embassy in Israeli  Jerusalem, they put in the disputed area of Jerusalem. This area was known is "no man's land". Now that's a pretty big provaction to rattle the Palestinians. Since the Palestinians live, you can't just expect them to give way to settlers, soldiers etc...

       It's equivalent to Texas being given back to Mexicans because the UN said it belong to Mexican ancestors so needs to be a Mexican State. Now, how would Americans who live in Texas feel?? Not only that, the Mexican military would be constantly killing them for protesting to be treated well.

       The MSM has been pro-Israel since before I was born. The standard line is that Israel is simply defending itself against an entrenched and determined enemy. Like all good propaganda, this is partly true and partly false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the power dynamic between Israel and the Palestinians: who has the power?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who has tanks, laser-guided missiles, nuclear weapons and US-trained personnel?
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious answer to those questions is Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, who can make peace? The weak or the powerful?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why anti-Israeli sentiment is strong in this sub: MSM is pro-Israeli from the get go.

       This was true before Obama admin but it isn't now.  I think ir has ro be ties to getting us to welcome the tide of young violent male "refugees" into Western countries by the millions to destroy our societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I wonder... If our MSM is after something it's a globalist agenda.  Maybe they play anri Israel now so we will react opposite and wdlxome these destructive forces in to collapse our countries. And the endless wars and droning innocents creates more blowback and hate against us ensuring more violent "refugees" coming here to destroy us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like reverse psychology.  Make us hate Israel so we relocate their enemy to our parts of the world.

       Are you fucking serious? I'd love to have an adult conversation about foreign policy and power relations, but you're starting out with nonsense premises as if they are both true and everyone believes them. They are not true, and hardly anyone believes that except Fox News watchers. If you watch FN, maybe you should try to alter your news diet a little bit to see if what you hear is actually true or if it's designed to make you feel scared of the outside world.

       Now, I probably agree with you here, depending on what you mean by "globalist agenda." If you mean the people who own/buy/profit from the media are the same people who own/buy/profit from war/murdering foreigners, then yes, I agree wholeheartedly with you on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if you think the media coverage of the massacre of the people of the West Bank is designed to make the US want to bring Palestinian refugees, again, it seems like you're getting your news from cartoons in Bazooka gum wrappers. The world we actually live in doesn't work like that. No one in the world wants the Palestinians. Not even the other Arab nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a weak person wants to have peace against a strong person, but the strong one wants to beat the weak one, what is the outcome? Simple, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, who is the weak one and who is the powerful one in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

       MSM has always been pro-Israel while this sub has always been anti-Israel and for good reason, a nation of people that survived a massive attempt of ethnic cleansing is now doing a little version of ethnic cleansing themselves. Also don’t get me started on the JIDF.

       The MSM is not anti-Israel. The major papers, and TV network have to whitewash the massacres by using terms like clashes, and befuddling the issue.  The NYT is not anti-Israeli, it is pro-Zionist, same with the WaPo, Fox news is pro-Israel, CNN is pro Zionist, the only entertainment network where cracks can appear is MSNBC.

       I hear this a lot. But the actual articles and news commentary is pro Hamas.  Thousands of unarmed protesters shot down etc.

       They were attacking the fence and gate and had incendiaries and child/disabled human shields.

       Israel isnt innoxent either but this case the sporting outside Fox News was decidedly twisted to for Hamas narratives exactly as they wanted.

       Purse Hasbara.  The protests have been going on for over a month, and Israel has continued to massacre protestors.  In additon, the actual border fence/wall is inside Palestine.  Israel does not have internationally recognized borders.

       You are right. All bur Fox News and some alt news like Jihad Watch were running the "poor unarmed protesters massacred" narrative. One guy got called out about "unarmed" when they had bombs and kites with bombs and tires lit up with flames and incendieries and switched tactics back to kids and wheel chairs.

       It is a little strange when 80% of the posts on the front of this sub are anti-israel and they align perfectly with the mainstream opinion on r/worldnews. Usually the regular conspiracy theorists reject views that are mainstream such as being anti-Israel. It is a pretty simple answer. Alot of people deep down hate Jews. It is a hate that has existed for 1000's of years and almost culminated in their elimination just 1 generation ago. I notice alot of the anti Israel people dont even have the balls to admit they hate Jews. "Jews and Zionists need to be wiped off the map but I am not an anti-semite" is a pretty common sentiment.
