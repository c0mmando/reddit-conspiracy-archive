        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Conspiracy has been infiltrated by partisan politics. I&#39;m not just talking this subreddit, i&#39;m speaking in general. Conspiracy theory used to be a fringe, niche topic in society until the internet caused it to reach new unfounded heights in popularity and broke into the mainstream. Now we see even our front end political parties engaging in official versions of their own conspiracy theories towards each other. When we used to speak of the &quot;deep state&quot; we were referring to ancient orders, illuminati type wealthy bloodlines, royal aristocratic type inner circles that controlled governments and economies away from the public eye. Now the &quot;deep state&quot; is obama and hillary&#39;s cronies, and the democratic establishment. </p>

<p>If this is the case, who was the deep state during the bush years? Why is there no emphasis on who belongs to the &quot;deep state&quot; in the republican establishment? </p>

<p>Because conspiracy theory is being infiltrated and used as a psyop to propogandize voters in elections. Q is currently evidence of this, being used as propoganda to support the president, and republican mid term elections. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theory is very powerful in the age of the information. People no longer trust mainstream official media outlets. They turn to theories, rumors, and interesting threads of discussion on forums like reddit and 4chan to flesh out their political ideas.</p>

<p>Lobbyists and corporations that work on behalf of persuading voters know this. Its why they employ shills and bots to manufacture and manipulate conversations on these outlets. Its most likely why many subreddits are also infiltrated and porpogandized to support or align with certain viewpoints. Most of the internets social media has been infiltrated in this manner. </p>

<p>These are my thoughts, what do you all think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that are not endemic to the republican platform</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What that means to me is that you recognise that &quot;globalist policies&quot; are very much a part of the &quot;republican platform&quot;. What it also means to me is that you are essentially criticising the Democrats for becoming more like the Republicans - a criticism most real leftists will also make.</p>

<p>The &quot;deep state&quot; is very much a Republican invention, and it is only in relatively recent times that the Democrats have been subverted by it. They only appear worse because we expect the same behaviour from Republicans - we&#39;re just not used to seeing the nominally &quot;left wing&quot; party participating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is the term turned into a euphemism for Democrats and any old school Republicans who dont really support Trump because Trump fans needed a boogey man to blame every time something went wrong for Trump. </p>

<p>So criminal investigation into his campaign? Deep state. Cant get his agenda through in Congress? Deep state. Oh shit Trump bombed Syria twice? Either the deep state made him do it or he was secretly bombing deep state targets in Syria. See the pattern? I cant take the term seriously at all anymore because I only hear people whine about the deep state when Trump doesn&#39;t get what he wants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Deep state,&quot; as it&#39;s being used currently, is right wing conspiracy theory duct tape. In order to maintain the illusion that Trump is an intelligent and shrewd political operator with the best interest of the United States at heart, a lot of factual holes need to be filled. Deep State Tape absolves him of all accountability and positions him as an innocent victim rather than a greedy, bumbling idiot who may also be a full-blown traitor. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever debated religion with someone, you&#39;ve probably come across the &quot;God in the Gaps&quot; argument. It&#39;s where someone will try to use an instance of scientific ignorance as proof of God. &quot;If science can&#39;t explain this, then it&#39;s obviously God doing it.&quot; The deep state argument is more or less a reskinned God in the Gaps. </p>
