       SS: it blows my mind that there us evidence of both Russia and Israel illegally working with Trump, yet democrats only focus on Russia. Why is this? Why is our government so hypocritical wanting to end foriegn influence and sure up elections while giving Israel access to everything. Both Israel and Russia have massive online armies on american social media to distort us, yet its only wrong for Russia. This had a situation shows us just how aggressive Israel's army is if you go through all the threads. What has Russia got from Trump? What has Israel got?

       That's true but using Israel to hack and manipulate the election is illegal and should be punished. I think mueller was brought in to protect Israel and Saudi. He did it during 9/11 and here he is again... There is undeniable evidence trump and Israel colluded with hackers espionage and blackmail to win, yet mueller is on a Russia hunt. I am against trump and democrats because they never hold Israel or Saudi accountable.

       it depends man, I work a full time, while also dealing with a flood, while also reading several books depending on what kind of mood i'm in that day and if there's free time (today was a bit of history on whether or not Jews can really claim Israel as their own, Kriya Yoga, and some Zen), and sometimes I make mistakes.......but fix them, or recant them later...yes we are all human, its ok

       I do really? I just made a post about Zognald Trump getting 8 years and after that guessing it will be Hulk Hogan vs The Rock, so that's a shot at ole orange face right there. I'm hoping he proves me wrong and that he negotiated some sort of deal with Israel in exchange for the embassy, like maybe letting them that they better be okay with the

       which we all know is shilled the F up with kickbacks and dirt going back to Israel and MF's gonna go down....one would hope anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, Republicans are a dead party and I dont really see Trump as Republican, except in name only. He's been a democrat and has done business with both sides and lived in Democratic NYC for a large portion of his business life. I just see him wrapped in that label and thrown into the fire, and
       <a href="https://i.redd.it/qn77m87po9r01.jpg">
        guns pointed to his head from every angle
       </a>
       something I have never witnessed with any other republican.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I think the bigger threat is the progressive left looking to ban guns, ban free speech, socialize society by taxing the corporations, like just passed in Seattle, creating internet police to censor comments and send fines/police to people who criticize religions and the Gov, filled with hate, and causing a massive rise in the far right., which then causes the alt-left to rise in #'s as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a no win situation, also I brought up the democrats because of this comment:

      <p>
       So it was contextual to show both sides are the same
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        By your logic, the Jewish republicans are still doing Israel's bidding.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       of course they are, look at the embassy

       The thing is, IDK. I'm entertaining possibilities, ideas, angles, etc.

       When it was trump vs hillary, it was welcome to clown world no win situation, but I saw Hillary as he devil versus Trump as a comedian reality sitcom character, however have been surprised by some moves that I was always for even when I used to be a democrat: strict closed borders, reinvest in U.S infrastructure, Audit the Pentagon, renegotiate tariffs, peace talks globally, etc and some of these things are actually happening, and I am shocked.
      </p>

       In terms of Israel, meh, they are going to get what they want, and even though its costing lives (Palestinians) those lives are the price paid to awaken the world against these people and more and more everyday all over the world start to figure things out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm seeing TONS of hate on the left against ISrael, which I never have see in my life come from them. I think if they ever get enough progressives together and get "their" woman/tranny/whatever into the white house, we may see jewish relations come to an end and a purge happen in the U.S. except it'll also be all the guns, speech, tweets, posts, etc.

       You know it's possible to believe in many multiple conspiracies of this nature right? These things don't all happen in a vacuum, and just because there is focus one aspect of a conspiracy of a political leader, does not mean the previous conspiracies go away.

       I think the biggest difference is that Russia tried to sell the info to Trump Jr in exchange for lifting the sanctions.   All this info came out months ago so people eventually connected the dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving the Embassy to Jerusalem is a new development.  If there is proof that the move was in exchange for illegal activity by the Israelis during the election then I am sure the media will soon connect the dots as well.   Democrats don't like the Jerusalem move anyways.

       Its ran by Christians and Jews. But Christians dont know that Jews hate them. They think that since they share the bold testament they have something in common. This current Israeli Jew trouble is reawakening christians as to why Jesus was necessary to get past the Jewish hiccups. I am shepardi and know this... I'm glad as all 3 religions need progressives to update and get along so the hardliners don't force us to fight an unnecessary religion..
