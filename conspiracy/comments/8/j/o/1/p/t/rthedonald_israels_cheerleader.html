       It’s safe to assume that all T_D mods are deep state and the sub is heavily monitored. Any comment critical of Israel or Zionism gets straight out deleted within a matter of minutes. And you won’t even know it got deleted unless if you paste the link in an incognito window. The comment still shows to the person who posted it, but is deleted for anyone else.
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       is probably the most important piece of influence the zionists have. Just yesterday they had a picture of trump with a yarmulke on touching that wall they love so much as the sub pic. If you look at the posts and top comments, all are pro Israel. They allow no dissent as the comment is instantly deleted. They know how important the user demographics are as they represent a large portion of Americans who are vocal about their beliefs.
      </p>

       It is important for us to reach out to the users of

       through direct messages, as mods will simply delete your posts. Inform them of the true nature of these parasites.

       Typically, comments that can be seen as even slightly racist gets the shadowban hammer. Not every one gets found and removed, but reported comments get removed quickly.

       It’s more a condition of protecting the sub from being terminated by appearing to condone racism or anti-Semitism.

       Netanyahu has been a pro-Trumper for quite some time as well.

       You're welcomed to view my post history and make fun of my T_D, conservative, worldnews and libertarian posts (tho the libertarians didn't really like my independent thinking), but if you look at my first Political posts they are being critical of Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The substance of this administration's accomplishments are undeniable. They are roiled in turmoil because the left is hell bent on demonizing everything right leaning. However, to deny any progress has been made would show you are just as brainwashed as you claim T_D users are.

       either you're an excellent disinfo agent who has mastered double-speak or you're confused about the true nature of things. Who exactly do you think the left represent? Who do you think funds these SJW protests? Who do you think (at least not recently) smeared Trump throughout the media before and after the elections?

       Not true. There's a way to be critical of things and the mods will make judgement based on your post history. If you're not a T_D regular and a regular poster in Anti-Trump subs, such as yourself, there is little to no tolerance against abrasive content.

      <p>
       That's a pretty big assumption. If the people on T_D were high impact or activists in their community, this might be somewhat true. However, the amount of T_D subscribers vs how many people there are in the real world is an incredibly low percentage (600k vs 7.6 billion) makes this statement very "dis-info"ish.

       It looks to me like you make it your job to mod every sub by trying to correct every low level pro-Trump comment possible. Lol you must mod r/worldpolitics. Those mods let anything go and it's a garbage fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D started by catering to a base. They grew because of their consistency and how they took care of their base. T_D and their users are constantly belittled and bitched at outside that sub (see OP), why in the hell would the mods allow it to happen in that subs simply so people like you and OP can get your jollies in the belly of the so-called beast?

       If you actually are a mod in a high volume sub, the fact that you're self proclaiming and pandering for low level upvotes seems silly and petty.

       It's very transparently an everyday rally for President Trump, unlike other subs that ban you just for subbing or commenting at T_D or a major political default sub that touts itself as neutral. It's like a straight white male going into "blackladies" and complaining that they're not welcome. It's their sub, and the PRESIDENT'S sub, so leave 'em be!
      </p>
      <p>
       Some pathetic users go around checking your history and the minute they see that you have interacted with that devil sub, they automatically discredit you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy T_D, I visit every now and then, it's a little memey and over the top for me but I enjoyed that spark during election season and I still enjoy the bants when there's a Trump rally. Why the hell people gotta bust anyone's nuts just for being enthusiastic about the President? Is it because of racism? You think everyone who supports Trump is some knuckle-dragger scum? Seems so, and that's the kind of racism that is lowkey on display by the Left: if you're black you're too stupid to achieve anything on your own merits (you can't even get ID's to vote apparently) and if you're a white conservative, you're in inbred hick from flyover rural retard-land.

       I love whe Donald supporters decide to speak eloquently like they're misunderstood victims and any criticism of them is just spin. I've never contributed but I've been on t_d fairly often and its people acting super immature, posting racist shit, and only creating significance off reaction of people who don't agree with them. I've seen anti Semitic content, anti Muslim, and support of violence towards opposition. I'm sorry you can't see trump boosting the s&amp;p isn't him boosting the economy, it's him being pro corporate and expanding the takeover from private institutes.

       If you look at my post history and compare it to yours, there are two key differences: good grammar and intent. I have no problems defending myself, but I will not voluntarily attack someone simply to point out how much of a piece of shit I think they are based on zero time actually knowing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure why I'm telling you about me though. You know me, right? I am "super immature" (btw, next time leave super out... it makes you sound immature), racist, reactionary, anti-Semitic (even though OP is saying we are Zionists) and anti-Muslim (look up extreme Islamism), support violence against opposing ideals (aka bigot... there are idiots in every sub. Look at the stuff that makes it to 5k+ to see what the "hive mind" agrees with).

       This sentence make absolutely zero sense. Every government is pro corporate, it's literally the pulse of the economy.

       Please do. I'd also like to mention, at no point, have you made any good argument. You're simply throwing out ad homims and strawmens left and right.

       I like how your only response is calling hg grammar bad. Sad you can't actually sustain a discussion without getting distracted by petty things. Then again, you voted for Donald so what can I expect? Also, you haven't used many big words like you think you do. Go read a book.

       Hey big guy, again, talking with better diction and grammer doesn't make you more intelligent. And no, you don't have to dig far into the donald to see racism and vile hatred. Sorry you've cozied up to it, and as far as your boot licking statement on all governements do that, well you're on a conspiracy forum fucktard. The status quo of governments isn't our concern, in fact, it's what we're actively fighting against. Except you, a chimera of american racism and unchecked confidence has convinced you that you're doing something with you're life. If you're cool with all that, it's because your value system is tethered to the social engineering of the right. being a supporter of donald gives me the absolute right to classify you to certain things. Also, supporting Israel doesn't make you not anti-semitic. They buy weapons, along with Saudi Arabia, so we're cool with them. Of course you will read this comment, feign being a victim, and then try and block yourself with more generilizations. So going forward, I emplore you looking into the art of debating and not get caught up in the prestidigitation of fancy words!

       It's ignorant to write off 40% of American's who voted for and identify with Trump.  The divisive nature you are exhibiting is exactly what they want.  I may not like certain aspects of how the Presidency is going, but I still respect our Command in Chief and our Country.

       That is your opinion and you're entitled to it.  Obama disgusted me as much as Bush and Clinton and most Presidents before.  Most politicians are narcissistic, pathological liars.. or the word you're looking for is Sociopath.  Sociopaths seek positions of authority so they can exercise power over others.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you need to realize is, America is a spectrum of beliefs, cultures and communities. I don't agree with a lot of American's, but I can honor them as a citizen without personally attacking them.  You can criticize their actions (constructively) and help bridge the divide in beliefs or at least gain an understanding for their choice instead of lambasting them as a person.

       I was speeking about people who voted for Trump, not people partaking in T_D, however, if you knew any thing about T_D besides what's been regurgitated down your throat, you would know there are lots of different 'believers' in Trump at various degrees.  Some hold him as high as God Emperor, some just appreciate that he isn't Hillary, some acknowledge his other 'positive characteristics' or just being "different" from other politicians.  It's more complicated and intricate than you think.

       Not at all. First of all, 60% of Americans voted so you're actually referring to only a quarter of Americans who voted for Trump. Second of all, by definition, half of America is dumber than average. Respect is something that's earned, not won by stirring up the dumbest quarter of the country and garnering their votes. Nobody was telling the racists to respect Obama because he's president. Holding a title doesn't earn respect. Actions do.

       I am well aware that only a portion of America voted, but many who do not vote, still support certain actions/people etc.  His approval rating is above 40%:

       This is where you're wrong.  People are stupid, period.  Not half or some other amount.  Nearly all people are stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       From one of my favorite books:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Wizard's First Rule: people are stupid." Richard and Kahlan frowned even more. "People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything. Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true, or because they are afraid it might be true. People's heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool... People are stupid; they want to believe, so they do."
       </p>
       <p>
        Nobody was telling the racists to respect Obama because he's president.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And they were fools too.  To bridge the divide (created by MSM/TPTB) and finally overthrow our masters we need to put aside the personal vitriol for each other.  Maybe you don't need to respect the other, but gain a slight understanding.  You really have no idea what life they've had and it's ignorant to think otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about Trump is, his Presidency is a phenomenon greater than you realize.  The Trump curse, numerology(Gematria), fulfilling prophecy etc  He is a buffoon and a fool, yes, but he is also much more important in the grand scheme of things.  He's playing his part in all of this, like every one of us.

      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: "for the sake of argument they are all the same person"
Premise: "they share the same stupid ideas"
      </p>
      <p>
       Because [premise], [conclusion].
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's look at yours:
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: "you are just plain wrong"
Premise: ???
      </p>
      <p>
       "I know you think that" is not a premise that supports your conclusion, it does nothing to attack my conclusion or premise. It's just an opinion and a dubious one at that (how can you really
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       what I think?) It's an informal logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you can't distinguish between what you said and what I said says a lot about the disparity between our education. I hope you're just young.

       Your whole premise is garbage though, I thought it was obvious.  It is your
       <em>
        opinion
       </em>
       they all share the same ideas.  In reality it is a mixed constituency, though they tend conservative overall (source: reading comments from supporters).

       T_D user here. We come to conspiracy sometimes too. It's good to hear other points of view. I have read your comments on Israel, and in general disagree with them, but it's good to hear them. The only place you can make pro-Trump or pro-Israel comments right now without starting a fight is T_D. T_D doesn't come here and call you all crazy, why try to brigade our sub? We will come here and argue points from time to time (check my posts for today) but a variety of opinions is important. We can disagree on some things (Israel) and agree on others (DNC election rigging, WikiLeaks, etc.).

       Apparently the deepstate even extends to Reddit mods now. 
They leave up all the posts exposing themselves though, it's just the Israel ones and ones criticising the president whom they are trying to remove that they don't like.

       In your post you incorrectly state liberals want everyone brown without quoting a single democrat who states such a thing
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you state you dislike interracial breeding, which is an opinion. Not a point

       Better with what they have, compared to the US. You have 13% poverty but could have 0% if you had some small changes in social transfers. Haiti probably couldn't have 0% poverty, but at least they try to have it.

       Absolutely. Look at the Amish. They've kept the same traditions, language and ways of life for hundreds of years. They have the same blood and have no reason to fight about racism or who's rich/poor, because they got rid of those degenerates. They work, pray and live together and when someone needs help, they help because that person helped them at some point. That's a model community and that's something I can get behind. They don't live for themselves, they live for the community. That's what Whites should be striving for.

       Yes. But studies have shown Hispanics and Asians identify with their race and the country their ancestors came from, not the US.

       My parents and grandparents grew up in an Italian community in the US. Their neighbors were Italian. Their coworkers were mostly Italian. The local stores were Italian and of course they all went to Italian churches. They had much in common so they had little to fight about but they got soft. They stopped speaking their home languages, they stopped going to church so much, people moved and now they are about as Italian as the local Pizza Hut. What they lost is gone forever here and it's going to take multiple generations of work to get it back.

       You realize that’s socialism right? I’ll agree national socialism is not as bad as international socialism, but it’s still socialism. It’s the coercion that’s wrong, the fact you are
       <em>
        forced
       </em>
       to “live for the community” (or whatever the ruler proclaims to be in the interest of the “community”). Your life is worth less than the herd’s (and the rulers’) comfort.

       I don't actually agree with assimilation. I think Italians need to be Italians. I think Africans need to be Africans and Muslims need to be Muslims. I support separatism where every race is free to perish or prosper on their own.

      <p>
       My ideal US would be set up like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Native Americans - We will have to work out something for them. They were screwed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hawaiians - We would still want to keep a military base there, but they should be given back full control of their country, if they decide they want that. They may not since they benefit a lot from the Mainland US.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Hispanics - Deportations. Most of them speak Spanish anyway and follow their cultural traditions anyway, so it won't be too hard for them to go back.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Blacks:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Sterilizations in exchange for no deportations.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Paid deportations. We can even work out something with Mexico, The UK, Canada or another country I'm sure if they'd like to go there and since the UK/Canada take in tons of people anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Deportations to possibly some kind of area near the border of Mexico where they can perish or prosper on their own. If any Whites/mixed people choose to go there, they will follow the same rules.

       America is not a country based on equality or human rights for non-Whites. See the Native Americans and Mexicans if you think otherwise. The founders intended for this country to be White only. Laws did eventually change though and when you establish that laws are not set in stone, they can be changed, removed and abused.

       Not a lot of other countries allow its citizens to have the types of guns we have nor allow them such freedoms to purchase them. It is really hard to large numbers of people who are armed without hurting innocent people in the process.

       Again, skin color has nothing to do with religious preference or nationality. A person with black skin that is born in China would be Chinese. A white person who practices Hinduism would be Hindu. None of that has to do with skin color.

       "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equally; that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."

       You can have a large portion of the population owning firearms without the hurting of innocent people in the process, but it would involve sensible gun regulations. Sensible gun regulations do not conflict with the second amendment. Are you in favor of said regulations?

       As long as I am not doing anything against the law with it and as long as I make sure it is in a safe and secure location, I don't see the issue. It's not the weapon, it's the intent behind the weapon. France banned guns, so people use cars and killed over 130 people. There's some chemicals out there where a couple pounds of it can kill a whole block.

Some reasonable term ought to be allowed to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American attachments; to learn the principles and imbibe the spirit of our government; and to admit of at least a probability of their feeling a real interest in our affairs. A residence of at least five years ought to be required.
If the rights of Naturalization may be communicated by parts, and it is not perceived why they may not, those peculiar to the conducting of business and the acquisition of property, might with propriety be at once conferred, upon receiving proof, by certain prescribed solemnities, of their intention to become citizens; postponing all political privileges to the ultimate term. To admit foreigners indiscriminately to the rights of citizens, the moment they put foot in our country, as recommended in the Message, would be nothing less, than to admit the Grecian Horse into the Citadel of our Liberty and Sovereignty.

       Like I said, you have no legitimate reason. And compare the nber of times vehicles are used in public places to the number of times guns are used in public places if you want to try and rehash that "why don't we ban trucks then?" nonsense.

       Your entire post falls apart due to this statement right here. Even if we all “look” the same....Italians would still be Italian because they’re from Italy. Africans would still be Africans because they’re from Africa. Muslims would still be Muslim because they worship allah. Americans would still be Americans because they either hold citizenship or are born in America (hence holding citizenship). Man you’re from T_D aren’t you because there’s no way someone holds these views unless they worship the God emporer of the US....you sound like one hell of a racist asshole

       We can argue over the legitimacy of various Holocaust claims and we can probably agree that instead of killing, deportations and sterilizations would have done just fine.

       But their overall ideals like cultural/ethnic preservation, Familialism, fitness/health and religion were causes with high moral values.

       Poland has a long history of being conquered because its geography makes it difficult to defend.  That's like saying you aren't a rapist because the woman has a history being raped before.  The idea of Germany as a nation didn't exist until the late 19th century, so the "Greater German Empire" did not have a long history of anything at the time the Nazis began inventing reasons to invade their neighbors

       Britain, France, The Spanish and The Portugese(IIRC) fucked the Native Americans as did we. If there is ever a group that deserves something in the US, it's them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Native Americans are a great example of what may happen to White Americans if we don't act soon. Once we are the minority, I firmly believe we will be forced to pay reparations for slavery and will be able to do nothing but watch as the Southwest United States is slowly reconquered by Mexico. There are more poor South/Central Americans than their US citizens and as long as those countries stay poor and as long as South/Central Americans continue to have more kids than they can afford, we will always have millions of them wanting to come here.

       5/8 Mexican, 1/8 German, 1/8 Irish and 1/8 Japanese. You can’t trace back the male lineage on my Mexican fathers side bc he was adopted. If you went back on my moms side it would put me in Japan. So by your logic should I be in japan? I honestly think that’s a little bizarre because I’m from northern Midwest and I’m learning Chinese, and I learned French and Spanish on school, so I would have a very hard time in japan. Or should I be living in Mexico? I’m married to a white (primarily British/Scottish) man, so where would my child belong once he is an adult and we are dead?
      </p>
      <p>
       Last question, how would you address the vast differences in living standards between countries? If I were to be forced into Mexico bc of my lineage, I would feel that is unfair. I was born and raised here, I’ve paid taxes, this is my country.

       Your kid will end up as an outcast. They won't quite be Mexican, so they aren't going to fit in with that group. They sure as hell aren't anything else, so they are unlikely to fit into those group either. The best thing you could do is marry another Mexican and turn what would be half Mexican into 3/4th Mexican.

       The only thing in life that is fair for everyone is that we all die. What we did to the Native's wasn't fair. What our politicians have done to this country isn't fair. Fixing the problem that we have is not going to be done in a fair way either.

       This is where you really aren't going to like what I'm going to say. The average IQ of South and Central America is not very high. Mexico's system has been failing for a long time and considering they are about to vote in a socialist, I don't see that changing any time soon.

       Okay first: if you’re saying I shouldn’t be here period, then neither should you. Because going back to native Americans, you are not from here and therefore shouldn’t be here. So that’s kind of awkward. Am I following your logic?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I honest to god laughed out loud when you said the community has failed. I think you should expand your mind and think past race. I thought if I showed you that I am mixed and I have a beautiful (maybe I’m biased as his mom but strangers stop me when we are in public and tell me how beautiful he is, they somehow come to the conclusion that he is full Italian...) mixed child that it’s not as big a deal as you’re making it. Race mixing is not a bad thing. No one is being forced to marry outside their race, unless you can show me proof of this that is what I will believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think you somehow managed to describe what it’s like to be a mixed person. You don’t fit in anywhere, but I still have friends of all races and a family because my race has no impact on any of that. And no, I’m not going to marry a Mexican man lol. Correct me if I’m wrong but Mexicans are the product of Spain (Europeans) colonizing the native population. So isn’t every Mexican mixed anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
       You still didn’t address my inequality between nations question. If I am a citizen and have lived here my whole life why should I be forced to move somewhere far far worse? Simply because of my skin color or who my parents are? I’m not trying to attack I just fail to see the logic in this. I am a human and if you are going to judge me on my race then I think you need to look inward and ask what makes you and me so different.

       Whites have built this country. This is an undeniable fact. Without Whites this country would be the Africa of the West. It's nothing for the majority of Hispanics to go back to their home countries. They speak the language already for the most part and they will fit right in. Most Hispanics are not assimilating and I'm not even suggesting they should, because assimilation has caused Whites to lose their whole identities - this is the real reason why so many people are unhappy. We feel like we have nothing because we traded it all to assimilate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to fight for this country. The people who are using this country as their shopping mall are not going to be willing to fight. The second shit hits the fan(and it's going to when the 70% who funds the other 30% become the 40% who fund the other 60%) they will be on the first plane out of here, never to return. Whites don't have anywhere to go anymore, and we have no choice but to fight. Germany's being ruined. England's gone. France is gone. Australia is gone. Italy's waking up and if you would have told me that Poland and Hungary were the most woke groups in Europe, I don't think most people would believe you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we fight for this country and lose, that's nothing to be embarrassed about. But if we let this country be invaded through immigration and don't do a damn thing to stop it, we deserve whatever is coming.

       The community has failed. My ancestors grew up in an Italian community in the US. Their neighbors were Italian. Their coworkers were mostly Italian. The local stores were Italian and of course they all went to Italian churches. They spoke in Italian. They had much in common so they had little to fight about but they got soft. They stopped teaching their home languages, they had less kids, they started marrying with non-Italians, they stopped going to church so much, people moved and now the community is about as Italian as the local Pizza Hut. What they lost is gone forever here and it's going to take multiple generations of work to get it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the game plan for Hispanics and Asians and this has already happened to Blacks.

       There are good looking people of almost every race minus blacks, but if my ancestors intended for me to be non-White, I'd be non-White. Since they are gone and can no longer speak for themselves, I have to speak for them and do my best to carry on their wills. This isn't about me. This is for them.

       People are certainly being encouraged. Watch some TV. The majority of commercials now feature black/white couples, even though those are only 1 million total in the US. The fucking elites are trying to convince us that a royal family which would have had a brother and sister marry to preserve a line are now okay with blacks being in the royal family. W A K E  U P.

       We do not care about trying to be fair. White's fairness is our weakness, hence Hitler once saying he wished Catholicism was at strict as Islam. The only thing that is fair is that we all die and Whites will be dead in the US unless action is taken soon.

       What game plan? Do you think there is a meeting held each Friday and they serve tacos? I’m done with this conversation. You lost me when you said whites built this country. You you know slavery was a thing right? What specifically makes white races superior?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I never said Spain was white, but you cannot deny that it is European. How is that still not considered mixing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem pretty cemented in your views. I don’t understand how one can be so full of hate and superficially obsessed with skin color or race. You should learn more about the history of Mexico as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suggest you get off the internet for a bit. There are forces that feed and benefit on division and fear. Don’t fall for it. Glad we could exchange ideas civilly and I hope you find peace with yourself.

       It still is a thing, only instead of black people, big companies use illegal immigrants who get paid $2 an hour under the table, work 14 hour days with no real safety precautions and can be fired at any time since they aren't on the books as actual employees anyway.

       The US taking in Blacks as slaves was the best thing that ever happened to them. There's a reason none of them want to go back to their homelands.

       You obviously find something attractive about them since you are with one. And it's evident your ancestors did as well since you are have some White blood in you.

       Blacks are strong in athletics. Whites are masters of war and nation building. Asians are quite smart. Jews may be even smarter since they managed to win territory in a war that didn't even involve them and since they own 4 of the 5 big TV conglomerates, 2 of the 3 big music companies and all 6 of the big movie companies, where they can control the message.

       It's not about hate. I take a bus sometimes when I do, I'm usually the only White person on it. I realize that less than 30 years ago, that same bus would have been almost all White. I see my community, which use to have its own identity look like every other community. I see the Chinese taking spots in our best schools, which make it harder for Americans to progress. I see the best jobs in the US being occupied by foreigners. I see illegals lowering wages by taking bare bones pay rates while sending all the money back home. I see a group that makes up 13% of the population committing 52% of the crime while our media fawns over them like flies on shit and see every shortcoming of their's blamed on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me fucking sad to see the best country in the world head down its demise and seeing anyone who dares try to contest it be called a racist and a nazi. It makes me sad to know that Whites are going to be the minority in their own damn country in less than 20 years by people who don't give a single fuck about it while the media celebrates like something out of 1984.

       White genocide seems like a good idea.

       Can't wait for you to be a minority and finally be treated like how you've treated others for millennia.

       You seem to have a lot of hate in your heart, which I think is almost certainly and intentionally caused by propaganda. I understand that you feel that you're treated unfairly because you are a minority, but I doubt that is reality. People tend to want to blame their problems on some external source, and I think that is likely the case here.

       Like what? White people are still responsible for the vast majority of technological innovation. I don't know what race you are, but your quality of life is largely thanks to the White race.

       That's fair. But I'm a bit ashamed to admit that East Asians have a higher average IQ and commit less crime than Whites. I'm also a bit ashamed that Blacks are generally more athletic and stronger than Whites. And I'm a bit ashamed to admit that Hispanics tend to be better and more efficient with their hands, etc.

       Fuck that was the other guy, my bad. I still think you put too much emphasis on race, but I’m not going to jump straight to calling you racist since you don’t seem malicious. But I would argue that upbringing and societal conditions are bigger factors than race and make your “objective facts” misleading.

       That's a reasonable position to take. I think that humans are animals, after all, and that the different races are actually different sub-species of humans. Once you think of it in that way, you have to admit that the races are "different." And they are obviously genetically different just by their physical appearance, it doesn't make sense for the brain to somehow be excluded from those differences.

       I agree that those definitely play a huge role as well. This is an age-old debate, nature versus nurture. It seems clear to me that both are important.

       Jewish people are certainly impressive, I won't deny that. But they generally play the role of middle-man in society, they are not as often creators. They are also very good at looking out for their own and helping each other to be successful. But, they are not as innovate and creative, so they are not responsible for much of the art and beauty, or the technological advances in civilization.

       Yes, of course there are famous Jewish scientists and artists, I never said that there weren't. But look throughout recent history, the Renaissance and classical music, architecture, the vast majority of scientific advances, etc. They are responsible for very little of what has made civilization great. Much of the modern art that is dominated by Jewish people is degenerate and lacking in real quality. And Einstein is way, way overrated, by the way.

       You’re obviously a moron, and I’m not going to entertain any of the stupid shit you just said. If Jewish people aren’t responsible for a majority of the contributions to society, guess what, it’s probably related to the fact that they’re a minority. They weren’t renaissance painters? Probably has to do with them getting expelled from every country they sought refuge in.

       Most of that innovation has come over the last 200 years. About the length of time we've been race mixing. I say, more race mixing!!!

       I think we are all racist to some extent, whether we admit it or not. I think that there are genetic differences between the races, and that those differences predispose us to certain traits and behaviors. Perhaps that is a racist view to take, although I think it is also the most reasonable view to take.

       I mean, they obviously had to have known that they would be giving up aspects of their culture when moving to a different country. If you think your ancestors intended to come to America to only associate with Italians and to only participate in Italian culture why would they have left Italy to begin with?

       They 100% made big cultural changes when moving to America, and were well aware that their descendants would be part of a culture that differed from the one that they immigrated from. They 100% came to America knowing that down the line you would never experience Italian culture like they did and they were totally okay with that otherwise they would've stayed where they were.

       I think, if you want to get people to stop thinking about race, you need to get them thinking about something else.

       It appears to me that he believes that:
1. A community must have strong indelible ties
2. Race is the only way to endure that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that you might change his view more effectively by getting at the core premise of his belief rather than outright rejecting the entire chain of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s an old black man that is kind of famous for this. Assume that his concerns are legitimate, and then convince him that race is not the cause of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Korea, when the Koreans complain about the way that foreigners act, I tell them that they are right, and they should be angry, and I will listen and try to help. You don’t have to say the same, but you need to recognize his humanity if you ever want him to recognize yours.

       So I'm half Japanese, and I'm not an outcast, probably because in my community (in the US) people aren't that preoccupied with race. It doesn't dictate your social circle. 
I don't think it's internally consistent to decry race mixing whe  there is extreme diversity amongst "white" ethnicites that you are ok mixing. You generalize white nationalities as part of the same monolithic culture being diluted by miscenation.  That's just not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, Asian Americans on average are more educated and earn more than White Americans.  They also have stronger associations with the traits you find to be worth promoting in bloodlines, like familialism, nationalism, and discipline.  Are you also opposed to Whites interbreeding with other races to increase their genetic fitness?

       So essentially we need an anthropologist to redraw the map so that Culture A exists in and only in location B? Sounds difficult without the whole forced expulsion/mass homicide deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       To that effect do we allow Norwegians to mix with Celts or Anglo-Saxons with Eastern Europeans (they do have quite a few central asiatic traits)? Will everyone need a DNA test at birth so they can be deported to their proper genetic homeland?

       Yeah I have no problem with map changes (though ethnically based forced expulsion sounds pretty fucked up to me) the relevant fact for someone of your persuasion is that partitioning the global population along ethnicity is not a straightforward thing in the first place, as far as ethnicity goes "african" means absolutely nothing. As I mentioned regarding actual ethnic groups (which you didn't respond to) today there are Nilotic south Sudanese Nilotic folks practicing animism living next to someone in Uganda descendent from the Bantu; their average height and facial features more distinct than the Irish compared to Sicilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The comical (white, black, orientals, arabs) categorization (which I presume you're running on) fails to capture one feature which is found throughout a given race; you could find a pair in any group who differ from each other as much as they may differ from another "race", each group probably contains 1000s of incompatible cultures. Trying to partition humans into cultural groups is a task only a one world totalitarian regime could complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel you may be afraid of the end-game world where we all look like tiger woods and like I said it's fine for people to want to preserve their culture. I just don't think that little factoid is gonna happen. You and your kindred minds will always be able to form a enclave away from the dreadful mixed folk (at least in our lifetime and barring something apocalyptic which fucks over more than just racial supremacists).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a though experiment, you cleanse the white lands and now you and all the white folk of the world are together at last, free at last. When you, a South African, a Swede, an Italian, a Pole, a Macedonian and a Serb sit down to decide how white-land works, will perfect harmony prevail or would you have the same old disagreements you had before we miraculously reversed ethnical entropy?

       Do you believe it’s realistically possible to rewind the natural course of civilizations? It’s inevitable with technology and free markets that cultures and ethnic spheres will overlap and have to learn to coexist in a peaceful manner in order to survive. 
Do you believe in nature over nurture? 
I take it you’re not a big fan of Star Trek, which envisions all cultures somewhat uniting under western customs and practices.

       We've done it thousands of times. How do you think Whites got here? What do you think is happening now with millions of illegal immigrants? That's not natural. I will gaurantee you that if Whites never touched North America, things wouldn't be much different here than they were 400 years ago.

       Many races and countries made it thousands of years without much change.

       Whites and Asians will be fine. White's have invented just about anything of significance for the last century anyway. I do not think we would suffer much at all if non-Whites disappeared tomorrow. The 13% of the population that commits 52% of the crime would be gone, making things a lot more peaceful and the group of 50 million with 80% of them being on government assistance would give us tons of new cash to do amazing things with.

       I'm actually a huge fan of Star Trek, though I refuse to watch STD and hope that show dies.  I get why people think it's a left leaning show, but to me it was always right wing:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Races are always treated in a racist way. Klingon's are always violent and the Vulcan's are always smart. Sure, one or two here and there might not be like that, but the series always makes it clear that those people are defective rejects. If you learn nothing else from this series, it's that other races are different and even if they try not to be, it's hard because of their DNA.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Enterprise crew and government usually uphold the law and don't give into feelings. People who don't are often punished, even if it's for the right reasons. The crew often times lets bad shit happen due to not wanting to break rules.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Violence and fighting are answers to most Star Trek problems, especially in TOS. Kirk and crew fight someone just about every episode.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         TOS LOVES right-wing groups. There's a nazi ep and there's a roman ep. It's pretty clear Roddenberry had some interest in these people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The various races are all pretty rich culturally, with the humans really being the only ones who aren't. They have religions, traditions, customs and totally different ways of life.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At least in TOS, this show would not support any forced immigration or foreign involvement. They make it clear that when foreigners from other places are introduced to a civilization, it's bad because it harms their natural evolution and path.

       I really would like to read more about this imaginary world where "races and countries made it thousands of years without much change".  Crack a book about European history -- from the schism of the Roman Empire to the fall of the USSR, the continent was a revolving wheel of migrations, conquest and colonization.  Nothing stands still, and myths about an idyllic, long-standing association between a particular ethnic group and a particular piece of land are just that -- myths.

       They would legitimately be seen as bad. The victor is correct the loser is bad this is how all of history has been, they lost so=bad. Not to mention, even if the holocaust didn’t happen they still tried to literally conquer all of Europe.....still bad bud

       The central theme of the Nazi ideology was the final solution, a supreme and superior race. That was their thoughts then and it is now, if you want to agree with SOME of their philosophy there are many thought processes/philosophies/parties that share some similarities. Like those. Not the fucking nazis man. You’re on the losing side here no matter how much you try to spin it. Nazis=bad. Not a Nazi=still potential for bad but at least you’re NOT A FUCKING NAZI!!! It’s not hard dude...

       They really didn't though. They did put some people in camps, but they were losing the war and conditions got bad due to it. The NWO and the Allies then used it to create the state of Israel and to destroy nationalism.

       They would torture, mutilate and execute allied POWs... our soldiers 
 We were fed up enough to send millions of men across the ocean to stop their bullshit, without the Haulocaust being public knowledge yet.

       You're being downvoted to hell, but I'd like to give you props for at least speaking out and using your free speech rights. Those ideas are indeed a little difficult to grapple with, and maybe talking about them is a good way to deal with them. I don't necessarily agree with your ideas, but I'm upvoting you for saying out loud exactly what was in your mind, filters down. Cheers.

       You are overcomplicating this. The Nazis are anybody who opposes Israeli criminality. Before Trump completely submitted to Israel, he was a Nazi. Once he invades Iran, he will become an anti-Nazi. The Palestinians, despite being victims of Israeli genocide, are Nazis who persecute Israel by dying.

       Forgive me I just don't see how the supposed lead up plan to initiate the apocalypse is so obviously connected to something which happened in the last two hundred years to describe it simply as an atrocity that happened less than two hundred years ago.

       there is no "book of revelations" in the Bible; the mention of the "book of revelations" is one of the surest signs that someone doesn't know what they're talking about when they're discussing apocalyptic literature.
      </p>
      <p>
       in regard to the book of
       <em>
        Revelation
       </em>
       (or, as i prefer to call it, the Apocalypse), please quote the portion which states that israel as presently constituted must exist in order for Christ to return.

      <p>
       actually, there is a spectrum of belief in evangelicalism regarding zionism, and the most prominent shills for israel in the current american religious scene -- such as john hagee -- are pentecostals.
      </p>
      <p>
       evangelicalism is also less than 300 years old.

       I think its hilarious to see some users a month ago blaming Jews for everything but now that people are blaming Trump for supporting jews to much, those same users are supporting Jews and trump. Its the most hypocritical thing ever. The right can manufacture support by creating drama against trump for causes unfavorable to his base so they immediately flip to defend trump. Its pretty genius. I saw the same thing with North Korea lol. Nobel peace Trump a day after they called to nuke Korea lmao.

      </p>
      <p>
       It's a cult. A cult that is the embodiment of virtually everything this sub has been against: cult of personality, censorship, pro-Israel, pro-Corporate, pro-propaganda, pro-govt line, pro-neocon, pro-torture... It's absurd how those people so freely infest this place.

       Even more hilarious how posts like this are upvoted to the front of

       yet supposedly this place is "T_D 2.0". Weird how all those T_D subs and "russian bots" would upvote posts like this.

       .. I used to go there for my conspiracy news, but it's literally operated by Jews and if you post threads about the real truth they get deleted. They also have a karma system where posters get green points for being good posters or whatever.
Somehow all the pro Israel posters have green points.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all hate on blacks, Muslims and all and yet they have green points. But same thing cannot be said hating on Jews. You will get banned. Fuck the Zionist scum, nobody likes you

       So true. Former t_D subscriber.  I always knew MSM was brainwashing bullshit, so when he started attacking them I bought into him as a candidate,  then as a president.  It wasn't until I started digging deeper (in hindsight, shoulda came here first) that I realized what a Zionist puppet he really is.  He just wants to MIGA.

       I know for a fact, many are waking up to Israel, even those who voted T_D. That is more of the Rand Paul supporting faction, which is fairly substantial.  Some people truly think / thought Donald was going to get us out of the ME wars like Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Donald takes us further into conflict there, many will revolt.  Many were already beginning to revolt when he signed his big spending bill.

       I love how this sub is convinced in some grand Jewish propaganda conspiracy, and in doing so, completely neglects to consider the possibility that they're being used as part of an anti-Jewish one. There's only one country in the world that gets constantly bombed, rocketed, and shelled without all-out war in retaliation, and there's only one country in the world whose population's very existence is a point of deep hatred: it's Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that anti-Zionism has no government influences is hilariously ignorant of reality. Both Mossad and the rest of the world's intelligence agencies try to win the propaganda war. The truth is almost always somewhere in the middle, but you've got to pick a side. Either the "wipe them from the map" people should win, or Israel should win. There isn't an alternative in such a starkly contrasted issue. So...I pick Israel. They aren't throwing gays from rooftops, aren't stoning women for being raped, and aren't lopping off heads. Hamas, on the other hand, has routinely used hospitals and schools as human meat shields.  Sure, it's a war, but...when you purposefully involve your population in your war strategy, don't get shocked when they get killed along with your troops.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know anti-semitism is a fairly big thing in conspiracy circles, but y'all could at least pretend to hide it...

       , and you will also see that it is deleted. If there isn't some grand Jewish conspiracy, then why were they so quick to not only delete my comment but do so in a way to prevent me from ever knowing. Sounds pretty conspiratorial to me.

       You can be critical of Israeli policies without being an anti-semite. Just like you can be critical of the American government without being anti-American. Do you support everything the American government does? Did you like everything Obama did? How about Bush? Would you have supported Hillary?

       I think it sucks that I can’t be pro Palestine and not be a Jew hater .. or I can’t support Israel and Be a piece of shit. What is it with you people bashing others for the way they think. Judaism is different than Zionism so why can’t I support America in supporting Israel while having sympathy for Palestine at the same time and wanting Palestinians to prosper. Someone is lying to us.

       Bear in mind the mods actively delete stuff because they have to. If they didn’t the concern trolling by leftists would get so out of control every comment would be some fake;,” i vote for trump by why is he fucking up so bad” etc.and TD would be over run. Unfortunately, legit criticism can get deleted in the process. That what r/askthe_donald is for.

       This is funny to me because for so long the right wingnuts have been blathering about Jews subverting the entire planet and enslaving mankind, and now, apparently because trump embraces Israel's actions, Jews are fine upstanding people who are simply misunderstood.

       Can someone please elaborate for those of us who don't know what you're talking about when you say "it's safe to assume that all TD mods are deep state?" Before someone does the Reddit thing and checks my post history to try and divine secret hidden intent behind this question: I read and occasionally post in TD, do not understand this claim, and would genuinely like to know if there's evidence supporting it so that I can adjust my opinion accordingly.

       Apparently the deepstate even extends to Reddit mods now. 
They leave up all the posts exposing themselves though, it's just the Israel ones and ones criticising the president whom they are trying to remove that they don't like.

       Not true. There's a way to be critical of things and the mods will make judgement based on your post history. If you're not a T_D regular and a regular poster in Anti-Trump subs, such as yourself, there is little to no tolerance against abrasive content.

      <p>
       That's a pretty big assumption. If the people on T_D were high impact or activists in their community, this might be somewhat true. However, the amount of T_D subscribers vs how many people there are in the real world is an incredibly low percentage (600k vs 7.6 billion) makes this statement very "dis-info"ish.

       I'll also like to add how it's hilarious to watch the same fucking group of people who constantly have a fucking meltdown over "MSM!!!1!1" and constantly rail about how MSM lies when it comes to reporting the Trump admins criminal connections

       It's a cult. A cult that is the embodiment of virtually everything this sub has been against: cult of personality, censorship, pro-Israel, pro-Corporate, pro-propaganda, pro-govt line, pro-neocon, pro-torture... It's absurd how those people so freely infest this place.

I do not think we would suffer much at all if non-Whites disappeared tomorrow. The 13% of the population that commits 52% of the crime would be gone, making things a lot more peaceful and the group of 50 million with 80% of them being on government assistance would give us tons of new cash to do amazing things with.

       I'm actually a huge fan of Star Trek, though I refuse to watch STD and hope that show dies.  I get why people think it's a left leaning show, but to me it was always right wing:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Races are always treated in a racist way. Klingon's are always violent and the Vulcan's are always smart. Sure, one or two here and there might not be like that, but the series always makes it clear that those people are defective rejects. If you learn nothing else from this series, it's that other races are different and even if they try not to be, it's hard because of their DNA.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Enterprise crew and government usually uphold the law and don't give into feelings. People who don't are often punished, even if it's for the right reasons. The crew often times lets bad shit happen due to not wanting to break rules.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Violence and fighting are answers to most Star Trek problems, especially in TOS. Kirk and crew fight someone just about every episode.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         TOS LOVES right-wing groups. There's a nazi ep and there's a roman ep. It's pretty clear Roddenberry had some interest in these people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The various races are all pretty rich culturally, with the humans really being the only ones who aren't. They have religions, traditions, customs and totally different ways of life.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At least in TOS, this show would not support any forced immigration or foreign involvement. They make it clear that when foreigners from other places are introduced to a civilization, it's bad because it harms their natural evolution and path.

       No, I just can't believe that anyone would be so racist.

       Italian isn't a skin color, African isn't a skin color, Muslim isn't a skin color. Where someone lives and what religion they practice has nothing to do with skin color.

       If owning a gun represents what you think it means to be American, you've set the bar pretty low.

       The electoral process means (well, it should mean) that all citizens are represented, no matter their skin color or religious preference.

       ...what? When has American ever been whites only?

       I mean, they obviously had to have known that they would be giving up aspects of their culture when moving to a different country. If you think your ancestors intended to come to America to only associate with Italians and to only participate in Italian culture why would they have left Italy to begin with?

       They would legitimately be seen as bad. The victor is correct the loser is bad this is how all of history has been, they lost so=bad. Not to mention, even if the holocaust didn’t happen they still tried to literally conquer all of Europe.....still bad bud

       The central theme of the Nazi ideology was the final solution, a supreme and superior race. That was their thoughts then and it is now, if you want to agree with SOME of their philosophy there are many thought processes/philosophies/parties that share some similarities. Like those. Not the fucking nazis man. You’re on the losing side here no matter how much you try to spin it. Nazis=bad. Not a Nazi=still potential for bad but at least you’re NOT A FUCKING NAZI!!! It’s not hard dude...

       Your entire post falls apart due to this statement right here. Even if we all “look” the same....Italians would still be Italian because they’re from Italy. Africans would still be Africans because they’re from Africa. Muslims would still be Muslim because they worship allah. Americans would still be Americans because they either hold citizenship or are born in America (hence holding citizenship). Man you’re from T_D aren’t you because there’s no way someone holds these views unless they worship the God emporer of the US....you sound like one hell of a racist asshole

       Yes, of course there are famous Jewish scientists and artists, I never said that there weren't. But look throughout recent history, the Renaissance and classical music, architecture, the vast majority of scientific advances, etc. They are responsible for very little of what has made civilization great. Much of the modern art that is dominated by Jewish people is degenerate and lacking in real quality. And Einstein is way, way overrated, by the way.

       Poland has a long history of being conquered because its geography makes it difficult to defend.  That's like saying you aren't a rapist because the woman has a history being raped before.  The idea of Germany as a nation didn't exist until the late 19th century, so the "Greater German Empire" did not have a long history of anything at the time the Nazis began inventing reasons to invade their neighbors

       Discipline, nationalism and religion aren't high moral values, they are selfish characteristics that prioritize the desires and needs of oneself and one's ingroup over outgroups, and the state over the individual.

       Better with what they have, compared to the US. You have 13% poverty but could have 0% if you had some small changes in social transfers. Haiti probably couldn't have 0% poverty, but at least they try to have it.
