        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A tragedy overlooked by national and international media. Media is silent, president is silent. </p>

<p>20.000-30.000 people are protesting every single day in our capital city, Banja Luka and over 200.000 people signed the petition which is a lot considering our country only has like 1.700.00 people living in it
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/txWuEv8.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/txWuEv8.jpg</a></p>

<p>A young man,David Dragičević, aged 21, disappeared and was found dead under suspicious circumstances.</p>

<p>The coroner&#39;s report states that death was a result of drowning, and that there are physical wounds on the body pointing to a physical altercation; however, the report states that there is no evidence of foul play, and that the death was either accidental (as a result of him falling into the river) or suicide.</p>

<p>Witnesses (including his parents who came to identify the body) report that his body was visibly beaten and wounded. His post mortem photos were leaked a few days ago and everyone can clearly see that it was a violent death. His jaw was broken, he was missing a few teeth and you can see very brutal bruises and cuts all over his head, legs and body.</p>

<p>The police, on the other hand, believes there is no reason to suspect murder, and does not want to begin an investigation even tho there is  A LOT OF evidence that it was a murder (his photos, text messages he sent, survaillance videos we have etc) and people request investigation.</p>

<p>There is an entire Justice for David movement with the goal of uncovering the truth behind this obvious murder which was shrugged off as suicide. People are prostesting in every city across the country for 51 days now.
The media isn&#39;t reporting anything and our government wants to sue everybody who attends these protests. They are covering up this murders, there are many many holes in their story, their investigation and nobody believes them but they still remain in power and don&#39;t wanna resign.</p>

<p>I just wanted to share this case with people and hope it can spread because we can&#39;t count on our media to help us</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. It spreads awareness and gives support to those who may actually do something. Changes come with changing the mentality and state of mind in citizens, and protests show they are not going to stand for this. If people are afraid, getting together and protesting might give them strength to do something. Maybe protests in your country differ, but people here don&#39;t usually protest, and when they do, it can get violent. Weapons can be used, and I&#39;m not talking about simple rifles. </p>
