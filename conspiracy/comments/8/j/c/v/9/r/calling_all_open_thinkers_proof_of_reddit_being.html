        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, here is a post I made, including the edits on a thread about TPTB doing some gender bending. It&#39;s a topic we have all seen before as they pop up once every two weeks or so.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is my post : </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8iwu1a/women_have_different_skeletons_than_men_do_are/dyv9q8s/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8iwu1a/women_have_different_skeletons_than_men_do_are/dyv9q8s/</a></p>

<p>Now, your job as a reader is to look at the content of my post and then decide if the majority of replies and all of the down votes are equal to what I said. </p>

<p>Bear in mind, my original thought was probably poorly fleshed out. However, I want you to have a look at the replies and how so many of the replies are focusing on the seeming homosexual/transsexual hate. That isn&#39;t what I implied or intended to happen.</p>

<p>Please read, make your own assumptions.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t me feeling sorry for myself, looking for acceptance, spreading hate or self-promoting. If I saw this same post with a different username I would still make a thread about it.</p>

<p>In no way are the down votes and replies equal in force and measure to my original statement unless Reddit was trying to downplay any sort of gay/trans hate. Now, if somebody was calling for all gays to be murdered, I would understand the deleting or censorship of the post. I wouldn&#39;t agree with it, but I could understand it.</p>

<p>Open thinkers of conspiracy, what do you think? </p>

<p>*Please do not turn this into a pro/anti gay or transsexual discussion. There&#39;s nothing to discuss. This is simply about a possible brigading or silencing of one line of thought on a sub that allows  teh jews did it, Israel is a meanie, we love Iran and Russia etc. kind of threads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We might be discussing different things here friend. Im not making a moral judgement about homosexuals. I have homosexuals in my family.  I have homosexual friends. I also have friends with poor eyesight and autism.  I have a friend with severe borderline personality disorder.  These are all good people that do good things.</p>

<p>However, they all have traits that, to varying degrees, can potentially limit their success at reproduction. Living organisms have one job: reproduce.  Everything an organism does is to enhance its chances at successful reproduction. Reproduction and traits that lead to reproduction are normal.  Traits that limit the probability of reproduction are abnormal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This definition is better, normal is generally considered to be the standard. It has nothing to do with reproduction so don&#39;t associate them.</p>

<p>I agree that homosexuality is abnormal, in the sense that it doesn&#39;t occur often. But generally people, like you, use the term to imply a problem. In fact, you were doing this by associating homosexuality with mental retardation then trying to use &quot;normal&quot; as the reasoning.</p>

<p>I said I could understand calling homosexuality a defect but it&#39;s only a reproductive defect. Implying it&#39;s an overall defect is wrong, homosexuals are considered more successful by other standard measures (intelligence, income).</p>

<p>The issue isn&#39;t the word normal but how you tried to use it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Homosexuality is a birth defect. Like mental retardation.&quot;</p>

<p>I can understand calling homosexuality a defect, but to compare it to mental retardation is actually retarded.</p>

<p>Mental retardation detrimentally affects how you perform in life but homosexuality does not. If anything the statistics appear to show that homosexuals have slightly higher IQs than heterosexuals - take from that what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Thats a reasonable position and does not necessarily dispute my point that its a birth defect.</p>

<p>Living organisms exist for one reason: reproduction. Any trait that interferes with that objective is a defect that has a high probability of preventing reproduction.</p>

<p>Poor eye sight is also a birth defect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only wouldn&#39;t call is a defect because they still can reproduce. If they were to put their P in a V, they could still have a baby. </p>

<p>If there are more women than men (which there are), then not every male is going to have a female. Those males will need to turn elsewhere for pleasure, so they turn to each other. Society/reproduction has lead to this outcome, rather than it being a &quot;defect&quot;, if you see what I am saying. But I can definitely see where you are coming from, I just don&#39;t agree with the terminology. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, homosexuality is not a choice. Maybe it is a mutation? Or a trait that is expressed when their environment allows?</p>

<p>Why is it a stereotype for men on a ship to be <em>&quot;gailors&quot;</em>? Are there that many gay guys on a ship, or is it that because there are only men around, you have to resort to less <em>traditional</em> ways of getting off?</p>

<p>And if there are <em>that</em> many gays on the ship, at what point is it just normal for people to like people of the same sex, in an evolving society? This may be nature&#39;s way of balancing the population and putting limits on who <em>should</em> or <em>could</em> have sex to reproduce. Which is funny because most of the gay guys I see are ripped and attractive (prime for mating), as opposed to the fuck in the chair here typing this comment lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please, for me and this isn&#39;t a trap, point out the anti-gay bit in my post.</p>

<p>The replies to the post seem to be people assuming i&#39;m implying a negative towards homosexuality. That&#39;s what confuses me the most. The replies are built upon the repliers&#39; own bias. How they jump to the defence of gays when I never attacked them is...worrying.</p>

<p>Should a group or class of people be SO protected?</p>

<p>Gays should be treated like everybody else. </p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t want to imply negativity towards homosexuals, maybe you shouldn&#39;t have said that more open homosexuals are a sign of civilisation collapse.</p>

<p>Also, the number of downvotes are due to the post being on <a href="/r/SubredditDrama">/r/SubredditDrama</a> </p>

<p>That subreddit is notorious for attracting attention to unconventional opinion, which people who disagree with downvote to show that they disagree.</p>

<p>You can even find a couple of these people in this very thread. They come to a sub like r/conspiracy because, not only can they not think for themselves, but it makes them insecure when others do so and it makes them feel better to mock and condescend.</p>

<p>Are you complaining that reddit is somehow not hosting enough bigotry against women? and against immigrants? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, what the hell kind of logic is that?</p>

<p>All i&#39;m saying is :</p>

<p>Look at this shitpost (this time it was by me). Is this shitpost really that edgy/controversial that it deserves that level of downvotes? No, unless it struck a chord with a large number of people with the same viewpoint of oppressing opinions.</p>

<p>Oppressing opinions is bad, mkay</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Thats a reasonable position and does not necessarily dispute my point that its a birth defect.</p>

<p>Living organisms exist for one reason: reproduction. Any trait that interferes with that objective is a defect that has a high probability of preventing reproduction.</p>

<p>Poor eye sight is also a birth defect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, I&#39;m a live and let live sort of person. However, I think that society should treat those issues as they really are, abnormalities and potentially even mental illness. They certainly shouldn&#39;t be celebrated. </p>

<p>And yep, I see the current trend and that pedophilia is the next issue on the horizon. 20 years from now, it might be looked at similarly to how homosexuality is. Of course they will have to deal with the whole consent issue, and I&#39;m not sure if they will be able to lower the age of consent any time soon, but I do think that it will become more acceptable in society. The slippery slope people were right.</p>

<p>The reason I mention the downvotes is because it indicates a discrepancy between my comment and what is classified as &#39;acceptable&#39; to reddit at large.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re complaining at the number of downvotes your post received, but at the same time you don&#39;t care about downvotes? I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being so dishonest about it. I&#39;m not trying to shame you for it. I would just appreciate some honesty. It&#39;s like you want it both ways.</p>
