        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey all, just wanted to check in to give you your daily reminder that the whole story centered around Comet Ping Pong Pizza was a PsyOp, cooked up by the media to discredit PizzaPeodGate researchers and make us look like absolute loons. They made short work of it, really. By moving the epicenter of the PizzaPedoGate scandal from a global, decentralized network of child molesters (with a few key nodal points like Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Huma Abedin etc)  to one pizza joint in DC, they were able to hijack the narrative and then drive a stake into the heart of the entire conspiracy by proclaiming &quot;nope, no basement here&quot;.   </p>

<p>Those of us who are truly committed to exposing the monsters behind PizzaPedoGate don&#39;t give a flying fuck about Comet Ping Pong Pizza. Yes, there seems to be copious evidence that something evil and demonic was going down there and the Alefantis guy absolutely needs to be locked up with his gay pedo buddies, but that restaurant is NOT the hill we&#39;re willing to die on because we feel it pales in significance to the numerous other sites of extraordinary Satanistic violence and supernatural extermination of our nation&#39;s most valuable resource. </p>

<p><strong>DON&#39;T FALL FOR THE PSYOP.</strong> Remember that all they want to do is DESTROY us and they will stop at NOTHING to gaslight us into thinking we&#39;re crazy. They will stop at NOTHING until our dismembered bodies are scattered across the country. They have no reservations about killing you and everyone you care about. We are at war, and for now it&#39;s mostly nonviolent, but that doesn&#39;t mean things won&#39;t escalate.   </p>

<p><strong>WE MUST ALWAYS ADHERE TO THE GOD-PRINCIPLE OF NON-VIOLENCE. THEY HAVE NO RESERVATIONS ABOUT USING VIOLENCE AGAINST US BUT WE MUST RISE ABOVE. THEY ARE NOT HUMANS AND DO NOT HAVE THE NORMAL HUMAN SENSE OF EMPATHY AND IMPULSE CONTROL.</strong>     </p>

<p>If someone tries to shut you down by bringing up Comet Pedo Pong Pizza, DO NOT ENGAGE WITH THEM, because they are paid agents trying to extract information and biomaterials from you. We must go high when they go low. They don&#39;t want us to know the truth but NOTHING will stop us in our quest to free these children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is probably fake. Pedogate is very real. I think comet ping pong and the pizzagate emails are all probably nothing and could be easily be explained away, even the weird lingo. But they ironically opened up pandoras box through awesome researchers digging and discovering the sick, twisted satanic pedo crap actually does go on behind the scenes, and it&#39;s a huge network of elite politicians, celebs, power players finding and pulling the strings. Staying away from pizzagate would be helpful and focusing purely on pedogate will facilitate further research and help with redpilling others. Jimmy savile is a perfect example. Corey Feldman speaking out and even Elijah wood. Even Dr Phil had a guest on a year ago that escaped an elite pedophile ring. Now we have Allison Mack indicted for child trafficking. The truth is slowly being unveiled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as an honest comment--the moment you make the statement &quot;garden variety Satanistic transhumanist gay thug&quot; -- you&#39;re going to do a lot of damage to your attempts at persuading people that your story has any validity to it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly willing to entertain the -possibility- that such rings exist, although I frankly find it very hard to believe that stories can be really kept silent in 2018. But for the majority of people--those whom you actually need to finally believe if you want to truly succeed at your goal--statements like that, which are both encompassing and overblown really do you no credit. They make you sound crazy--and it&#39;s just not helpful to your own mission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does it make me sound crazy...? He is 1) openly gay, 2) involved in Satanic rituals as proved by his Instagram photos and comments, 3) likely a trans humanist given his connection to known transhumanists like Podrsta/the spirit cooker chick (can&#39;t remember her name atm. Aronovic?) so I repeat my question, and put the money aside for just a moment -- <em>how does what I said make me crazy?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha. I&#39;m not being paid and pizzagate is bullshit. Funny a political scandal comes out about &quot;elites&quot; raping children. I&#39;m guessing dems are the only &quot;elites&quot; in Washington because that&#39;s the only political party mentioned whenever this gets brought up funnily enough. Every Republican politician would be shooting this from the rooftops if true every election. Plus Trump has walked in on underage girls dressing rooms and somehow he never falls in with the pizzagate story.  He&#39;s  friends with Epstein as well,and also supported a pedophile in Roy Moore. When your conspiracies smoking gun is a napkin with pizza on it don&#39;t blame people for seeing through the bullshit. </p>
