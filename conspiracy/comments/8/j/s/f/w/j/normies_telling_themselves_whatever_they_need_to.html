    <div class="md"><p>This guy’s rationale for asserting that it’s <em>not</em> rigged is twofold:</p>

<p>-There’s billions of dollars involved </p>

<p>-The NBA hires Ernst &amp; Young to arbitrate</p>

<p>Yes because when billions of dollars are involved that’s when you know things are corruption free. And I’m sure E&amp;Y CEO Mark (((Weinberger))) and NBA commissioner Adam (((Silver))) have no vested interests and are totally not buddies. </p>

<p>Are you trying to insinuate that because of their last names, the whole process is corrupt and rigged? Seems like you are saying because they both sound like they have jewish last names they must be friends. </p>

<p>Can I ask, besides baseless speculation what evidence do you have for A. This conspiracy and B. That they are friends have vested interests?</p>

<p>Because in that post you linked to the interests of the 2 organizations are clearly explained. The NBA wants a fair and organized lotto system for the Draft, and E&amp;Y want to protect their reputation. Is the conspiracy here that the 6ers sucked ass for years to get those draft picks and now they are good? Idk if you get TV or real news, but the past years two teams have dominated the whole league mainly using veteran players like Curry and LeBron “I shit on everyone” James. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent. I believe it’s influenced not rigged. But considering you’re saying it’s rigged the burden of proof is on you and I’ll need something other than “they’re Jewish” so offer it shithead. So offer something other than “you’re free to believe it if you want” if you’re the one offering the counterpoint. As far as I can tell your point is “they’re Jews”. You need more than a Jewish hate. My city councilman is a Jew and he hasn’t stolen my community from me. You need points not “they’re Jews they’re evil” gtfo with that shit coming from a guy that believes Palestine is horrific finally abused and denied its rights to its own country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me ask, let’s take (American, not sure where you’re from) football. The “powers” force coach A to call play A on offense. The “powers” then force coach B to call play B and hope that player C is in the exact correct spot to intercept ball when it’s thrown to player D? Now if you’re arguing that calls are often questionable I can agree. But it seems you’re arguing the powers control what’s called........that still requires a WR running to the correct spot, a DB being in the correct spot, and a QB throwing it to the correct spot. They would literally have to practice for MONTHS, WITH the other team, to get this quardination down for ONE game......bye Felicia </p>
