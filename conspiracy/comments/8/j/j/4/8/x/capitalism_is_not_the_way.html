       Those are two separate things. Capitalism is just a way of organizing society around the free trade of consenting individuals. Consumerism is a type of market driven by planned obsolescence. Capitalism is the main system that has driven the advancement of mankind, while consumerism is more of a bastard child of corporatism, which is itself the bastard child of capitalism and the state.

       Are Corporatism and Consumerism not easy, slippery-slope, almost inevitable consequences of Capitalism, however?  I wonder if what you're saying isn't similar to saying "Killing someone while driving under the influence isn't the fault of the use of substances themselves.  It's a fault of their
       <em>
        misuse."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Use" very easily, if not inevitably, becomes "misuse" in many cases, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure Capitalism doesn't almost inevitably
       <em>
        become
       </em>
       corporatism and consumerism under the auspices of the current civilization - making the differentiation between the three quite possibly fallacious.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be sure, almost every other political system has its own degenerations, and these very degenerations have for the most part come to pass more often than not.  Communism, Socialism, and almost every other type of "ism" has been polluted and mutated into a nightmare version of what it could possibly be in its more evolved form.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it seems important - if one is to be an intellectually honest critical thinker - to acknowledge that A) corporatism and consumerism are quite caustic and deleterious in themselves, and B) it appears
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       difficult for Capitalism to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       eventually become these very things.

       I disagree. Capitalism isn’t a political system. Bartering is a capitalistic system. It is the position of power governments(a state) provide that allows capitalism to be twisted into corporatism. There are other capitalistic modals that center around the re-use and extension of an item’s usability as opposed to planned obsolescence, I fact I’m working on a project built around a “circular economy” right now called junktion.io. Capitalism isn’t inherently bad, it’s just a spontaneous and organic ordering of society that can easily be abused if a corruptible government(state) exists

       Perhaps I just don’t understand capitalism then because bartering does

       seem like anything capitalistic to me.

       It would seem that it is the

       of a state’s position of power that leads to corporatism - not so much the position of power in itself.  One can use a position of power in quite a productive way if one is so disposed.

      <p>
       It’s just that the governments in this civilization haven’t appeared to be anywhere near so disposed.

       Well, think about the term “free trade”. Bartering is free trade in it’s purist form.
And no, all governments rely on the representative governance modal which puts representatives in a position of power. It’s not that power corrupts, but that it is a magnet to the corruptible.

       Bartering never happened. Pre-money cultures relied on economies of debt ("Oh, you like my cows? Just take one, man.", "Oh, nice apples" "Hey, you should have some...you gave me that cow!").

       Bartering never happened? Is that something you just made up to make yourself feel better or what? I would say from your comment that you don’t even know what bartering is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is the physical representation of debt within a corporatist structure sure, but that doesn’t mean that all forms of capitalism rely on debt based currency. Before the invention of fractional reserve banking, gold was money and it wasn’t debt based.

       The value of an item is driven by market forces, even in a bartering system. One of those market forces is the need of an item. That is basic supply and demand. And it’s not a debt owed to soldiers, it’s payment to soldiers for work they’ve done, that’s exactly the same as bartering but with the extra step of involving a currency. Admittedly there is a huge problem with the centralized distribution of currency(aka the federal reserve and other banks) but the concept of money itself is just a tool, a tool that makes bartering easier. Before capitalism, the only way for man to acquire wealth was through conquest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism is a system that provides a tool: money that helps to easily facilitate trade. It’s a tool that gives an individual the ability to easily trade for the labor of others to do things he can’t or doesn’t have time to do, or that he can’t accomplish on his own. Money(capitalism) is literally the only system that empowers the individual by allowing him to vote on the services of others. Don’t like the way port of subs makes sandwiches, vote for the better sandwich and get what you need by spending your money at subway. 
A free market is formed from spontaneous order, based on the consent of individuals. History has shown that top down, centrally planned communist systems where the collective is more important than the rights of the individual become tyrannical. It’s too much of a concentration of power.

       That entire article doesn’t prove anything, it just argues that the anthropological beliefs for the origins of money may be wrong. This doesn’t mean systems of barter “are a myth and never existed. I for one have and still do participate in systems of barter.  Hell, the article itself even admits systems of barter where used after Rome fell. Even if the “origins of money coming from barter” are wrong, that does nothing to argue against anything I’ve said.

       No, it didn't. Capitalism produced massive wealth inequality and poverty throughout it's bloody history. Capitalism is system driven my profit, so any technology that is not potentially profitable is not pursued. How many technologies were burried because they  were not profitable or would result in less profit for capitalists, but beneficial for people? Electric cars? 100 MPG car technology? Who said technological advancement credit belongs to solely to capitalism?

       This is also the most common arguement....so, what? There's no better way? When you say capitalism sucks, people jump to, 'well, it's the best system...what are you, a communist?'

       We have to admit we have a problem before we can get better. Maybe a better system has yet to be devised, but we can't devise it until we all realize it's necessary to devise it, because we all recognize Capitalism is utterly broken and doesn't work for the majority of the people.

       You are clearly confused about what capitalism is and what it isn’t. I suggest you start with the actual definition of capitalism and move on from there. Also, communism has been responsible for far more deaths than just about any other system, only a moron would think it to be a viable solution after all the death it’s caused.

       Venezuela's crisis is the direct result of economic warfare initiated by the United States since Maduro does not play ball with American multinational corporations.  Capitalism is a punitive socioeconomic system expressly designed to extract wealth from 99.9% of the world.  The media talking points you keep parroting have been debunked ad nauseum if you care to look deeper.

       One bad thing that comes from capitalism will not bring it down. We can sit here all day and bitch and moan about corruption and rent seeking and inequality,  but at the end of the day capitalism is still the best form of government ever created. As bad as capitalism is in some ways, everything else is much worse. That is why socialists and communists always claim thay Venezuela and North korea and the Soviet Union are not real socialism and communism.   They can only ever offer an alternative that doesn't exist because they can then pretend that their alternative will not have corruption and poverty and murder. It always does.

       Literally just eff the philosophies fornow. Anyone reading this sub knows how to start and run a business. So just do it. Hire people, give them healthcare, be a good boss. No one can tell me it's impossible to accomplish this, no matter who you are. Learn the rules of the game. Proceed to profit over a number of years. No one is stopping you anymore.

       Capitalism, like Democracy while not being perfect, is the best we've got so far in History.

       All the other alternatives ended up in bollocks or corpses littered streets/fields.

       You are clearly confused about what capitalism is and what it isn’t. I suggest you start with the actual definition of capitalism and move on from there. Also, communism has been responsible for far more deaths than just about any other system, only a moron would think it to be a viable solution after all the death it’s caused.
