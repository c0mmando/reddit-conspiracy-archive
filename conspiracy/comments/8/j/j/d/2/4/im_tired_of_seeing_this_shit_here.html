<p>Ask the 400,000 people in jail/prison for marijuana offenses. The exact number is hard to pin down, but if it&#39;s 1,000, it&#39;s too many. And I can&#39;t even fathom a country throwing someone in jail for simple possession of weed. Indonesia, maybe. But the United States?</p>

<p>Why are you? The US is complicit in what happened in Israel today. Not sure if you realized this, but the US said Hamas is entirely to blame. Jared and Ivanka were in Jerusalem fucking smiling while Palestinians were slaughtered.</p>

<p>Actually, if you&#39;re stating facts, very few of the things you listed affect me. I don&#39;t smoke marijuana. I don&#39;t hunt. I don&#39;t have kids.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;ll care about those things so that others can enjoy rights, but I&#39;ll also do the same for others fighting abroad for their right to exist.</p>

<p>If caring about others&#39; rights makes me a virtue signaller in your eyes, so be it. (Again, it&#39;s not like I need your permission for any of this.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a valid point, there are plenty of local conspiracies and problems we should be looking. </p>

<p>JayZ says &quot;there&#39;s much bigger issues in the world I know..but I first gotta take care of the world I know&quot; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have all the answers. But yesterday I decided to solve some of our debt problems through crowd sourcing. (I understand it is not exactly what you are getting at with this post,but it could be a start to something better). My idea is to start a debt collection company an use donations to buy large amounts of debt, then forgive it. According to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/structure-and-practices-debt-buying-industry/debtbuyingreport.pdf">this</a> from the ftc in 2013, debt can be purchased for as little as 4cents on the dollar. 1million in debt for 40k. There are over 217 million adults aged 18 and older in America. If 100 mil donate 1 dollar we could (in theory) buy 25 million in debt and forgive it. The focus will be on student loans and medical debts. I do not desire for this make any profit an the only operating expenses will be licenses an permit fees. All other funds taken in would be used for buying debt packages. I want to free humanity from debt slavery.</p>

<p>Many years ago I wrote a wh.gov petition asking for harsher sentencing for any law enforcement who broke the law. The employee discount needed to end, with clauses that stated if a law enforcement officer is under investigation and quits before said investigation is complete, that is to be considered an admission of guilt an they cannot get employment at another copshop anywhere in the country. If a cop is charged with a violent crime they are no longer allowed to own a firearm. An a few other things. I actyually thought I had done a great thing an it would gain enough signatures to at least be addressed int he media and force a discussion about the  discount anything with a badge gets for being a criminal. I got 12 signatures and was told by one dude that my grammar is what stopped him from putting his signature on there. &lt;--that right there really discouraged me, my message is not validated because I did not receive the same education as someone? An the idea still stands. </p>

<p>We as a people need to come together as one and fight for our own rights. No matter,race,creed,orientation(unless you touch kids) or political stance. Congress is worthless,cops are the biggest gang in the country,churches need to pay taxes and free a lot of the burden from the people. Just have to figure out how to unite us all in this fight. my rant is over . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One needs to think about countries and their relationships. For example we all know Israel and America are best buddies.</p>

<p>This means that whatever Israel or America does, the other will help them.</p>

<p>This makes it clear as fuck, that it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s good or bad , they support each other. These are military gangs that have each other&#39;s back.</p>

<p>The world should be run on good principles and morals and there should BE NO ALLIES.</p>

<p>Or everybody should be ALLIES.</p>

<p>Meaning , we shouldn&#39;t worry about country friendships so much as we should about what is right and wrong.</p>

<p>If Israel wasn&#39;t USA&#39;s buddy, they would have paid the price numerous times.</p>

<p>This is all unfair to the common man. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want a war , but Israel might start ww3 that will affect billions of people. And who wanted that ? Not me, not you , just Israel and their buddies.</p>

<p>Fuck allies we need to rely on morals and good deeds, every country should be ranked on their willingness to help the planet, not help another country </p>

<p>What we need now is a smart and deft hand and a sword. Start pairing this beast down to sjze. And it will hurt and seem outrageous sometimes and scary.</p>

<p>Trump has impressed me which isn&#39;t popular here or anywhere but I started out detesting him only less than I did HRC and Obama and Bush and etc etc. If my gut feeling about Mueller coupled with some wise words from a couple conspiracy friends, ends up correct it&#39;s goong to be wonderful.  Or I will feel like I did in 2012 watching MSM and the RNC collude to rig primary against us and Ron Paul who had 100 times the turn out of any of these criminal puppets.

<p>You have an understanding of the reality that most people cannot grasp. Weed is illegal because the prison industrial complex makes a fortune housing these &#39;criminals&#39;. The people who own majority interests in these prisons have bought and paid for our politicians and our elections. They have laws passed that favor them, not us. In <strong>all</strong> aspects of society, not just drugs. Investment banking and the Federal Reserve and fractional reserve banking come to mind. OP, we are not the problem. However, the solution seems to be miles away.</p>

<p>The total irony would be if all these events would be just fake news.</p>

<p>People call it &quot;Gaza Massacre&quot; or &quot;2nd Holocaust&quot;, don&#39;t you think that is a massive exageration, I do.</p>

<p>Here is my guess what happened:</p>

<p>I bet there were barely any causalties outside of casualties happening in normal protests.</p>

<p>And the so called dealths are just fake news. C&#39;mon it is a conflict zones, so fog of war applies there.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t get real news from sensationalist propaganda alt-news outlets.</p>

<p>I bet most of what supposedly happens there didn&#39;t even happen.</p>

<p>Media fakery has been going on since Orwell&#39;s journalistic days.</p>

<p>Remember when journalists have been making up fake battles in the Spanish Civil war, or guys like William Randolph Hearst who was caught red handed fabricating news out of his ass.</p>

<p>I pity people who call themselves conspiracy researchers and can&#39;t see the obvious agenda being pushed on this sub.</p>

<p>I have been documenting the rise of antisemitism for 2 years, it&#39;s an obvious macro-political pattern.</p>

<p>Do some reading. Like the vet that just had his kids taken because he was treating his ptsd with marijuana. No big deal because it&#39;s anecdotal? Just one case? Ask that man, who put his life on the line for his country, if it&#39;s important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah just wondering because you personally attacked me over the subject, but you never post in this sub or even comment here, so it&#39;s definitely unclear what conspiracies interest you or why you would show up in an obscure low-karma self post to do this.</p>

<p>I figured you weren&#39;t an honest user, just making sure you don&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re talking about and have no intention of backing up any of your claims. If you change your mind let me know and the embarrassment can begin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then a huge fuck you to you. I live here, in Japan, and have visited both the Nagasaki and Hiroshima memorials to the devastation that nuclear weapons have caused. You want photos of people melting? They’ve got plenty. It was truly fucking horrifying. Hundreds of video accounts from survivors who had to suffer in the worst ways. Families watching their loved ones later due to radiation. And you, with your fucking disgusting disbelief because your government doesn’t earn your trust chooses to disbelieve something as fundamentally well documented as the nuclear bombs, all of the fucks to you. You are a horrible human.</p>
