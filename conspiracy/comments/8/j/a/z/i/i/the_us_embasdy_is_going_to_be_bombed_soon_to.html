<p>Iran backed Hams bombing of the embassy. Easy enough to find a reason most would believe. Hamas is violent enough and frankly none of my neighbors know jack about Iran and it&#39;s regime.</p>

<p>I could see the death or murder of Ivanka as the switch that would flip Trumps&#39; shit though. I mean, say it was a foreign national that killed her, I could see that country being turned into glass within 24 hours.</p>

<p>I cant imagine Israel putting themselves at risk of eating a moab. Israel would be leveled with only a few of those with only people living out of population centers surviving. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>US invaded iraq at a totally different political global game. Where Russia was still shit from collapse of USSR, Europe was in support of US to a point of helping with iraq war efforts. Now though US only has its main allies in support of it, France and UK. Everyone else is somewhere on the spectrum. </p>

<p>Back then 9/11 helped A LOT, and the dominance of US was so huge that everyone believed there were WMDs....which turned out ot be a lie, and then there were syrian false flag gas attacks, and look US tried, it gave it a good try, but failed. </p>

<p>So you are right its not &#39;impossible&#39; but gosh golly, I cant wait on how they will try to justify iran..... and be damned sure that russian rise, and now strength on global forum, will be there ready to counter like they countered syrian false flag justification. </p>

<p>Wouldn’t the US invade them just like they’ve already taken over half of Syria? Send in ISIS, only to follow them in under the guise of pursuing and fighting them? Doesn’t that bit of fuckery give the US free reign to do whatever they want?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funding separatists, and terrorists has been a tactic in covert warfare for a long time now even before 9/11. When Syria buckled and made deals with russia, russia flocked the cash and funded the blitz on isis in syria, meaning they used their military to do what syrian gov that were in disarray and with many regions of its lands unpoliced under a unified gov couldn&#39;t. Took on the role of security found targets and eliminated them, dealing a blow to organised efforts of isis. Essnetially taking bulk of it out in a day. That victory essentially facilitated isis defeat going forth months later, and that was last year, and since isis was gone for the most part, US stepped in and tried gas attacks to then try and bomb some stuff, but that wasnt successful either, since they werent covert efforts, everyone knew they were happening and like nobody died.... because they bombed select facilities, and russian made defence stopped the rest (US claims perfect 100percent success, russia and syria report otherwise, so its like wtf is going, war games?).</p>

<p>Iran is bigger, already has support of russia, meaning they are already ready for isis. Russia mentioned that isis was spotted in afghanistan. So I am guessing that tactic is/will be used in more crushed afghanistan where we also know that US has been sending their troops to...even when they mentioned they wouldn&#39;t (lie and lie again tactic). Iran is more developed and stronger (politically and military to patrol its borders and land to crush terror aka isis, or whatever else they fund). </p>

<p>So iran is another game, Iraq was easily dont with WMD lies, syria was almost done with isis movement, until russia stepped in. Then false flag lies akin to iraq, which failed. Then US used brute force to try and justify it at UN, and did not succeed. So whatever iran would be, I really hope its something new, I mean they tried to sue iran over 9/11, next they claimined Nuclear deal, and withdrew. So what ever happens next, I hope its good, and not just more false flags. perhaps they WILL sacrifice a real person (or fake it, as they are good at that too), in some international incident in iran. Akin to when german diplomat died and how war started, or how history books tell us it happened. I can even think of a few more scenarios: The Jerusalem fiasco, why is US moving the embassy there, who are they supporting? Jerusalem is like thei epicenter of religious war for hundreds of year, who rules jerusalem rules the world! </p>
