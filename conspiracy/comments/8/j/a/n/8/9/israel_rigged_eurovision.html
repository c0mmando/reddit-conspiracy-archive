       First off I'll go ahead and admit that I don't have any proof for this theory, but it smells fishy to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts is that Israel rigged the Eurovision finale so that they won. This forces europe to acknowledge Jerusalem as the capitol of Israel next year, or boycott Eurovision and out themselves as anti-semites.
      </p>
      <p>
       This year Eurovision was slightly different, the juries had more influence on the outcome.
These juries are media personalities and singers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In her victory speech, Netta said "Next year in Jerusalem", which has been some kind of chant for jews throughout the times as a sign of the desire to return to Jerusalem.
Except that next year it will actually be in Jerusalem.
She also praised diversity.

       Nonsense. Musically it was the most daring of all.

       The problem with the song was only the message, which apparently appealed to the general public but not the jury. I found it tasteless, similar to the latest Amy Schumer movie. I have no problem with ugly girls, but calling them beautiful is just lying.

       Israel's cyber control is becoming apparent IMO. After they were caught hacking jcpoa, the white house and Congress, they must be doing good. They were also working with Cambridge Analytica to get trump in. So, having been caught hacking democrats, then caught working with team trump, its likely Israel is behind all the hacks and leaks in the election to get a republican puppet. Since that was so big, I wouldn't doubt they'd use that capability for little victories for propaganda.

       The popular vote is not a good representation of the entire nation. You would have a handful of urban areas that would control every election and leave a huge chunk of the nation unrepresented. This is the reason for districts and the electoral college.

       "The popular vote is not a good representation of an entire nation"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, what? That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you run a 2 party system, and  54&amp;#37; of the entire population votes for one of them. It makes sense to represent that 54&amp;#37; of the population, not the other 46&amp;#37; because of how some districts were drawn. Proportional representation is the fairest way to represent a nation, because everyone has equal impact on the vote, you know, the full sum of what makes a nation. First past the post, the dumb system of the UK, the US, and plenty of other places, makes it so that people in power can redraw districts (Gerrymandering) so that even if a county has e.g. 60&amp;#37; support for one party, they can distribute the districts in such a way that the lesser percentage wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say we have 50 people that we need to split into 5 equally sized districts of 10. If we know the expected outcome of the vote, e.g. where people are likely to vote what, then we can redraw the districts such that an obvious 60&amp;#37; democrat to 40&amp;#37; republican vote becomes the opposite. If we draw two districts that contain 9 democrats, and 1 republican, then draw three districts that contain 6 republicans and 4 democrats. Suddenly, even though there are 30 democrats in total over the 20 republicans, because three districts come out with a 60&amp;#37; republican vote, and the other two at 90&amp;#37; democrat, because you use first past the post, this gives three seats to republicans and only two seats to democrats because of an intentional distribution to sway the favour of one party over another.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not representation, that's political swindle.

       First, control-c control-v will help when you want to quote people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I am well aware as to what gerrymandering is. I live in one of the most gerrymandered states in the nation and I am against gerrymandering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, I am talking about by the nation as 50 individual states and the land that lies within it. Popular vote cannot give equal representation to most states, to most land holders, to most of the country. It will give you as an individual an equal right and that is it.
       <a href="https://www.maps4office.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/usa-states-population-2010-anamorphic.png">
        This is where the power would lie by state if we used popular vote.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot use popular vote. It is impossible. Someone who lives in LA or NYC or Miami or Chicago, has no clue what is happening in Hays, Kansas or Many Farms, Arizona. And these towns are the vast majority of America. The urban centers would be the people making all of the high level governmental decisions for those cities.

       You seem to be a Dem who is still upset with the election. Let me leave you with this.

       Without CA Trump wins the popular vote by over 1.5 million votes.

      <p>
       Trump won 86.6% of counties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton won 88 of the 100 most populated counties which drove the popular vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those 88 counties, while large in population, only represent a small portion of the entire US interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The electoral college did exactly what it was supposed to do in 2016, it balanced power.

       So, we should represent the states over the nation? I don't agree, simply by the virtue, even while all states may pass different state laws, they cannot overrule laws passed by the senate.

      <p>
       I think you should instead understand why that 88.6&amp;#37; of counties isn't representative compared to the popular vote, by first understanding

       You do know that the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy#Republic">
        USA is a representative/constitutional republic
       </a>
       , which is defined as a form of democracy, right? You can't pretend like you know anything about any election system if you claim that the USA is not a democracy, and that it is instead "a republic",
       <strong>
        even though a republic is one of many types of democracy.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The election system of the USA and the UK are the same, spare the we elect a prime minister instead of a president, as they are both
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting#List_of_current_FPTP_countries">
        first past the post countries
       </a>
       and I was complaining about both of them. I wasn't saying the UK had it any better, they have the exact same problem, where parties can win more constituencies with a much lower percentage of the actual popular vote than their competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UK is service country, meaning most of our gain per capita comes in the form of our GNP, not GDP. Our GNP, like the US, is not on a downward slope. The GDP is decreasing, because of the obvious problem pertaining to Brexit, which I also disagree with.

      <p>
       This discussion was about how FPTF means that gerrymandering is effective in sabotaging elections when people with vested interest are permitted to redraw the lines. Everything you mentioned in your previous comment is immeasurably irrelevant, and half of it factually incorrect. I suggest that you stop pretending like you could teach anyone anything about civics  and actually study it yourself before trying to make any claims about election systems.

       You realise the home votes are electronic right? Someone at eurovision could have easily been paid off and just assigned any amount of votes to whoever they wanted. Its a really simple concept. But hey, you couldn't think of any way that it would be possible? There's a hundred different ways they could have altered the figures.

       It's not true. Last year the system was the same. Plus, Israel didn't get the majority of votes from the juries, Austria did. Israel got the most votes from the public, so the fat lady would have won even if the juries didn't vote at all.

       And lastly she came third by the juror votes by quite a margin and won because of the popularity vote which seems accurate considering her youtube video views/upvote ratio prior to the contest.

       Everybody knows the Eurovision is rigged to some extent. Just look at the disparity between the jury votes and the popular votes. 
The jurys often vote on their neighbours, i.e. for political reasons, this has been very apparent since forever.

       Wrong. The public vote is mostly to their neighbors, and that's easily explainable.

       The jury consists of experts, and their vote went to Austria, to a guy with the best voice, and a decent song.

       It used to get blatantly rigged, no doubt about it. That's why they overhauled the entire voting system to make it practically impossible to rig. Nowadays they publically release the entire voting and voting proces publically. Also the introduction of more countries has made a huge imact in preventing obvious rigging.

       I don't see the need for a jury though. The jury was necessary historically because there was no practical way of making all of EU vote at the same time. With SMS voting you don't need the jury (however they should remove the goddam 0.5€ SMS fee!! ffs.). Why not make it completely transparent and up to the public? Why have a jury that could have been cherry-picked...

       Don't disagree, but it changes slightly if you know who the jury consists of. It's usually former participants, the national organizers, and the commentators.

       It is transparant, just not fully democratic.

       Not only "could",
       <strong>
        has
       </strong>
       been cherry picked. The answer is quite simple. It's the Eurovision Songfestival, not the European Union Songfestival. They want to uphold traditions, and make sure that a certain type of songs enter the competition. Now to you this might sound like influencing, but this literally happens in every competition ever. Except Eurovision, just like for instance X-Factor or American next Topmodel, don't just limit themselves to gateway selection, they select throughout. However, the proces itself is transparant.

      <p>
       Well, is the process on jury selction transparent? who gets to be a jury and who decides who is selected?
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, X factor and other competitions are usually national in scope. With international competitions there comes a need for it being more than just entertainment. What if the Olympics was 'judged' instead of being measured by timing devices?

       The songs with the most public votes were all at the end. Basically people are so thick they can't even remember what songs they like so just vote on the last one they can remember, that theye liked. Italy was probably the worst song in the whole thing yet as it was last, they came 3rd in the public vote.

       Are you dumb? They did well in the jury vote, where it doesn't matter what position you perform. Austria did terrible with the public BECAUSE THEY PERFORMED ON EARLY. The jury's vote the day before in the warm up, not on the fay of the final.

       I love how there's 18 comments in this thread from people without a shred of evidence, none of whom have ever watched the songfestival. I could give you a detailed explanation of why you are wrong, but I don't even know what I should debunk as the theory right now is literally:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Israel won with a song I don't like --&gt; rigged"
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for the people who say it's because of Jeruzalem. The festival has been held twice before in Jeruzalem. The songfestival is non-political.

       I stated in the OP that I had no proof. Its just a hunch. Chill out mr.serious pants.

       I watched it live.

       I didn't say I didn't like the song.
I didn't, but that's irrelevant.

       Sure I'ts been held in Jerusalem before, but it wasn't quite as relevant back then.

       You have to understand that I have so far reacted to 4 similar threads on this forum (they had an equal amount of proof), but it's funny because this is the first time in 7 years the songfestival is being discussed on this forum. With such a backwards rationale as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like diversity, why on earth are you watching the songfestival. It's literally 90% gay community, trans community, ableism community, this cannot possibly be the first time you've noticed that it promotes diversity.

       This crossed my mind too.. Especially when I saw the winning performance. I know Eurovision songs are notoriously horrible.. but this year's winner was pretty bad. There was chicken dancing.

       Well.. yes it's a conspiracy theory so we should take such discussions with a huge pinch of salt. I'm a big fan of the Eurovision but this year I've seen some weird stuff that I didn't like going around...
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there are chances it was rigged in a "lawful" way if you get what I mean..I don't think Cyprus is like a hard opponent, I think it never won anyways and it was the bookies' favorite with extremely low rates like 11/10 as I remember. Last year Sobral had only 5/4 for example and he won. I believe the odds are hardly wrong each year especially concerning the winner. What was also very very troubling were the many dislikes in the opponent's youtube videos that all of a sudden dropped exponentially once the final was over. Did you see it? Their biggest opponent was Cyprus with 1 extra million views than Israel. And the views historically on the youtube channel were directly linked with the winner as well (except in cases like this year's Russia entry which was well.. unfit for Eurovision). The most disturbing thing is a poll somewhere on the internet with somewhat 100.000 voters that was showing again cyprus to win by seeing the change in votes in the last three days before the final...and it was a fucking significant change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I genuinely did not think about Jerusalem being a possible reason but well... it sort of makes sense. The past few days two were the major news about Israel: a) winning the Eurovision contest and b) showcasing the new US embassy in Jerusalem which caused serious clashes and deaths in the border with the Gaza Strip. Could it really be?? Are the above points considered evidence?

       What was pretty disturbing was the whole audience booing the Russian delegate as they gave their points.

       Russia was not even in the final (was not a great song either)

       Are you dumb? They did well in the jury vote, where it doesn't matter what position you perform. Austria did terrible with the public BECAUSE THEY PERFORMED ON EARLY. The jury's vote the day before in the warm up, not on the fay of the final.

       From UK arguing about represented government.... O the irony.

       Also the US is a Republic not a Democracy so the first 10 seconds of that video shows the ignorance.

       I don't have time to teach Civics to you nor do I care since you are not a US citizen. The UK has its own set of problems (Like your current downward trend in GDP per capita) but, I will not preach politics on you.
