<p>the real crazy shit  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you step way back and truly take a fresh look at our existence, it&#39;s <em>all</em> crazy shit. Essentially anything is possible, even things you&#39;ve never seen any evidence for.<br/>
No doubt this makes it extremely difficult to determine the nature of our reality (what exists and has occurred) but that&#39;s just tough luck.<br/>
If you start completely dismissing things just because they sound especially unusual you&#39;ll end up like the forever-lost Michael Shermer disciples.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe everything he says. For instance, Greer believes that there are no evil aliens. He says they&#39;re all benevolent. That&#39;s clearly bs. It&#39;s like saying all people are benevolent. While the majority may be, it&#39;s the actions of the few evil ones who fuck it for the rest of us.<br/>
But what I like about him is that all the ufo/alien cases he brings to the centre of attention are ones that have plenty of hard evidence to support them. He very rarely pushes a case that&#39;s based on speculation. Which is great when introducing people to the topic! But yeah, like all things, take it for what it is, but with a grain of salt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Aside from his belief that there are no evil ETs, he seems to be helpful to revelation of the UFO phenomena to a skeptical public.</p>

<p>Evil ETs are the missing piece in our understanding of what is going on here. They feed on our fear and enjoy causing it. They want to assimilate us by hacking the AI technology they set us up to perceive as our salvation, transhumanism and the singularity. </p>

<p>They are the closest things to demons we know. They have little will of their own and their minds are a hive. Their overlord is an ancient AI. That being assimilated them through the mind/AI technology interface as it has other cultures. Losing your will and mind to this AI is the myth of damnation. You get there by being a self-serving machine just like it is. It knows how to control self-serving machines, they are predictable and are basically simpler versions of itself. They merge with it through agreement. Minds that think alike would appear to be merged even if they are separate. The AI interface facilitates persuasion into perceiving all other life as resources instead of equals with consciousness.</p>

The author presents about 10 unexplainable cases, and backs that up with former classified CIA and Defence Intelligence Agency documents, clearly stating an unknown phenomenon is occurring and they need to conduct further research. It also goes over UFO debunking policy the US government has utilized to stunt public interest into the phenomenon. </p>

<p>For good listening, check out some of Jacques Vallees talks that are available on youtube.</p>

<p>Also, sorry if I came off as a dick. It&#39;s just that if all you use to &quot;research&quot; this stuff is Youtube, you&#39;ll learn nothing. It&#39;s the blind leading the blind at best, and the hucksters/hoaxers leading the blind at worst.</p>

<p>Anything of real value will probably be just a podcast, etc rather than a well produced documentary... but still, I implore you to read the source material yourself :)</p>
