    <div class="md"><p>Submission Statement: This legitimate questions. I don’t hate Jews. I don’t love Palestinians. I want to know why the United States supports Israel using live ammunition on protesters. Iraq was invaded for supposedly killing civilians. Syria was invaded for supposedly killing civilians. It makes no sense that the US continues to support Israel’s behavior. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;  Iraq was invaded for supposedly killing civilians. Syria was invaded for supposedly killing civilians. &quot; -</p>

<p>The common pleb requires a &#39;good vs bad&#39; to get on board with going to war, so the government ALWAYS make their cause out to be a moral one to gain public support. The reality is the US/Israeli instigated war in Syria, Iraq, et al were not about &#39;protecting civilians&#39;, they were merely about protecting Israel. Saddam was viewed as a threat to Israel as he was paying large sums of money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and repeatedly threatened Israel with SCUD missiles etc. Syria and Iran are allied together, and both militaries worked together to clear US/Israel backed ISIS and &#39;moderate&#39; rebels out of Syria. Assad and Iran are a tight knit crew, both of which are not aligned with the US or Israel, therefore they are an enemy. </p>

<p>After the Iraq invasion, it became clear to pentagon brass that conventional invasion forces were too expensive, politically taxing, and easier methods of overthrowing governments needed to be investigated. They came up with what we see in Syria, where the US government will supply arms and training to a revolutionary group who is willing and able to fight the government. This also occurred in Libya, with the eventual anal raping of Ghadaffi to death. The drawback is the country remains chaotic, with tribal infighting an no real governmental stability, a small price to pay for a conventional land invasion as seen in Iraq.</p>

<p>As far as Israels killing of civilians, Israel has an enormous amount of influence within the US government, media, academia, entertainment. If you&#39;ve ever wondered why there are so many films about the holocaust, but none about the holodomor or communist atrocities, look up the number of jewish people running hollywood. They always portray Israel and jews to be victims (Spielberg&#39;s Schindlers list for example), which gives them the ability to commit mass murder without anyone saying anything negative about them. You dont want to be called an anti-semite do you goy? The media is also almost entirely run by jewish head masters, so being overtly criticial of Israel is never going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many parallels here to the plight of the native Americans. Natives were forced off their land, put on reservations, and not allowed to leave their reservations, in the same way the Palestinians aren&#39;t allowed to leave their reservations. Natives who decided to leave their reservations and retake their ancestral homelands were shot, just like the Palestinians. If you want to play the morality game, its hard to argue for the Israeli side, but the reality is the moral side is always that of the most powerful side as they get to tell their story. Jews dominate the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason Jews in the media hate Trump despite him being the best president Israel has ever had is because the majority of Jews in the media are NOT zionists. Zionist Jews prioritize Israel before anything else. A classic example of a zionist jew is Alan Dershowitz who is a radical leftist, but has just as recently as a few months ago jumped aboard the Trump train and is supporting him vehemently. Mark Levin (the once never trumper) is another example of a Zionist Jew. The GW Bush admin was chalked full of zionist jews, which is the primary reason we ended up invading Iraq...you can read the book &quot;The Israel lobby and foreign policy&quot; which goes into great detail regarding the power of the Jewish lobby and their influence in government..AIPAC is the tip of their spear.</p>

<p>Your typical MSM jews like Jake Tapper, Wolf Blitzer and CEOs like Jeff Zucker are globalist Jews. These jews are primarily motivated by pursuing the goals of cultural marxism, open borders, etc and have little loyalty to the cause of Zionism. George Soros is another classic example of your typical globalist Jew, and he has even come out publicly against Israel. His open societies organizations were recently booted out of Hungary, and George Soros claimed he was the victim of &#39;Anti-semitism&#39;...there is an old saying that comes to mind...&quot;the jew cries out as he strikes you&quot;.</p>

<p>What you will rarely ever see is a powerful Jew who is a nationalist for the nation he resides in. Stephen Miller is the only exception I&#39;ve been able to find, but even Hitler had Jews serving in the upper echelons of his Military.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iraq was killing its own civilians. So was Syria. If they were just defending their borders against foreign militaries and terrorist groups, then it wouldn&#39;t be used as a casus belli. </p>

<p>Overall, in the last couple of days 40,000 people showed up for the protests but only 8 civilians were killed. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in any way excessive force considering the fact that there are over a hundred snipers and thousands of soldiers guarding the border at any point of time (during the protests of course, not on peace time).</p>

<p>Because the IDF troops are protected behind sand hills located tens of meters from the border fence, and because the DMZ is about a hundred meters wide, it is impossible to use rubber bullets as these have a very limited range and terrible accuracy. If the IDF would try to shoot rubber bullets to their max range (they do use rubber bullets, but only when possible and within the range), they would have a fairly high chance of hitting a person anywhere except the legs, which could be highly dangerous. A hit to the torso or the head is in many cases lethal. </p>

<p>Thus, by using live ammo they are often limiting the risk of lethal force to the recipient as they can aim for the legs.</p>

<p>Recently Hamas admitted that out of 62 killed, 50 were their members. The PIJ also claimed 3 were their members, which leads to 9 innocent dead, but the Gaza health ministry also said that one of the casualties, an 8 month old baby (that someone was stupid enough to bring to a riot) died because of preexisting medical conditions and not because of tear gas inhalation as was previously thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could really care less about Palestinians or Israelis, but whats clear to me is if ANY other westernized nation was doing anything even remotely close to what (white/Jewish) Israel is doing to the (poor brown) Palestinians, all hell would break lose and they would be demonized non stop in the media and governments would immediately sanction them. I&#39;ve personally been to the Gaza strip when i was in the Army, and they are basically land locked and surrounded by Israeli guard stations. Want to leave to go visit family somewhere? You have to let the guards know days ahead of time, you have to be back at a certain time, and you have to provide an extremely detailed story of why you want to leave, and the soldiers can refuse you anytime. Palestinians have no sea access and have no way of trading or building a functioning society without Israels allowance. The palestinians were also forced off of their land post WW2. And again, i dont have sympathy for anyone over there, just pointing out that this would never be allowed to happen with any European nation without extreme consequences. Its only because they are Jewish and have an enormous amount of power and influence in the world that they are allowed to do this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel is white? What? Have you ever seen an Israeli person? They&#39;re not black but they&#39;re certainly not white. Most Israelis are from Arab countries, you know.</p>

<p>Also, you said you&#39;ve been to Gaza during your military service. Are you an Israeli?</p>

<p>And last but not least, many countries have done what Israel is doing right now and none batted an eye. There was some response, but nowhere near the scale in which the world responded to the Gaza riots. Not even close.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a debate in a Canadian subreddit recently about a Canadian doctor who was shot in the leg. The specific topic was an Israeli deputy minister giving an interview, in which he said Canada would respond exactly the same.</p>

<p>Needless to say, all redditors over there immediately claimed they would have never done that, and never have. Little did they know that just about a decade ago they faced a rather similar situation:</p>

<p>They failed to respond to a UN inquiry into how the Canadian army ended up killing more than 200 Afghan civilians in raids they conducted as part of the ISAF along with the US and UK. It didnt cause any stir. Barely any coverage. These guys dont even remember that.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Israel ends up killing 8 innocent civilians in a massive protest of more than 40,000 people spread across many points in the Gaza strip and West Bank, admittedly (by the IDF) that some were targetes by error, but gets an insane amount of coverage on every little thing that happens, reaching headlines multiple times per day for several weeks now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it shouldnt get coverage. Everything is news-worthy. But to say that Israel is somehow unique in its methods is just a sheer amount of hypocricy. And of course it&#39;s very easy to criticize from a safe spot with 0 threats, and with 0 propositions on what to change and how.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve talked about Canada, but I can give you examples of more countries doing even worse. Far worse and getting off the hook.</p>

They are throwing fire bombs, rocks and sending incendiary kites over setting farms and forests on fire and they are trying to storm the border in mass. Look a little bit into Palestinian violence and you will see why they don&#39;t want them storming the border. Palestinians have gone into Israel and committed many suicide bombings on buses and restaurants schools, markets etc.. They&#39;ve gone into Israel and stabbed random citizens. They&#39;ve launched over 8600 rockets from Gaza into Israel. There was a planned mass cyanide attack that got stopped. Their goal is the complete destruction of the Jewish people.

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism was never taught as main stream christian theology until pre WW1 when the jewish man and founder of modern zionism (theodore herzl) began his conquest to gain the land of palestine for the jews via the Balfour declaration. Christianity was not at all pro Jewish until the scofield reference bible was published just after WW1 and the various church leaders were &#39;persuaded&#39; to push zionist propaganda into the minds of millions of church goers. The slick Jews managed to poison Christianity with zionism, which made millions of christians put the well being of jewish people before the well being of christians. Its unfortunate that our once great christian religion has been poisoned and its followers brainwashed into thinking Jews are better than christians.</p>

<p>You have a president only known as potus to the world so he shall die in disgrace as most do, when they hide their own name. </p>

<p>Then what of 3 billion what does Israel give to you. One of the highest prime real estate locations on planet, bar non. First look to your own medication bottles and see the originators. They have gone full hog to give the world medicines to help them to lead a healthy and productive life. </p>

<p>Decipher reality as you ask a question. I give you answers. I see the writing on the wall and 3 to 13 million is what is given to them. I see no legitimate 3 billion added to their coffers. Please explain the actual 3 billion free money given to any country during the time of the skin flint Trump. </p>

<p>There is nothing to show of 3 billion dollars so I shall call your hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel uses sniper rifles made in the US, which it could buy with that aid money, but nowadays it buys at least most of them from the UK, and many others are developed and made locally. So there&#39;s probably no relation here.</p>

<p>Also, the US supports Israel on this because Israel is a US ally, and it&#39;s common practice for countries to aid their allies when they are attacked. Also, Hamas is considered a terrorist organization in the US, so that&#39;s a contributing factor as well.</p>

<p>We benefit from the never ending  conflict Israel has with its neighbors by using their military to improve our own weapons and tactics and to maintain pressure and a watchful eye on hostile nations like Iran.</p>

<p>In my opinion, anyway.</p>
