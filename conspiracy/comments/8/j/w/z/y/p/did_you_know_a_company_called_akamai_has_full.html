       Nope... it's Akamai tech.

       Let's be just a bit curious and look at who owns this shit. Not the managers, these are just the guys they pay to be bored in their stead but the real owners.

       Let's look at the board. (behold the diversity).

       That's right, the app with full permission on my drive and system, signed by Microsoft goes to an IP belonging to a company that has professional SPIES on the board as the only non rich tech guy... HA.

       I advise you to show down this store shit ASAP. If you don't want to be spied on and have your machine compromised that is.

       This is not a conspiracy.  If your first image stated inbound as opposed to outbound, that would be concerning. This is literally client/server model. With your Windows 10 PC being the client and akamai being the server. This TCP basics here. Nothing suspicious. I am in complete agreement with u/startrk from akamai, and I am not affiliated with them, but have leveraged their services for video game hosting.

       Super fishy, yes. But just connecting back to the same IP doesn't mean it's the same application. Could just be hosted on the same hypervisor (VM). That's the app store, as the other guy said.

        The auto updating tries to FIRST connect online to akamai addresses during startup.  In fact everywhere
I go online akamai is  trying to connect to my computer.
       </p>
       <p>
        I said no to "SpyNet" to start with, partly to test whether or not settings actually works.    Apparently, its not possible to stop auto update.  I always set my updates to manual so that I know what is happening and when.  But after denying access  to akamai efforts to connect during auto update a respsonse of  "can't connect" is returned.  Apparently, updating is dependent upon akamai collecting information.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since I said no to SpyNet, there should be no information collecting - except from Microsoft about
ONLY updating during the update process.  So what's the deal with akamai?  Does anyone have
any insight to share about this?  I presume akamai its doing some sort of information collecting that 
has nothing to do with the updating process - and its without my consent.

       Akamai is a CDN (content distribution network).  CDNs are what the 'other side' of the internet (companies, not home users) have instead of ISPs in many cases.  If you don't panic when you see connections to Amazon S3, LLNW, att.com,  etc., you shouldn't panic about connections to Akamai.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, anything you download from microsoft, regardless of the delivery method, should be eyed with suspicion.

      <p>
       Also, the poster of that question is doing windows wrong.
1. wipe HDD
2. install win7 sp1 x64
3. crack win7 (if needed)
4. TURN OFF UPDATES.
5. install updates manually, on a case by case basis, when updates are required to run software you need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything less than the above is implicitly trusting Microsoft to not do anything bad to your PC.

       Not if you compile it yourself. It will only have what you put in it.

       Wow...  So let me see if I can break this down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Akamai is a CDN.  The IP's you see are their edge servers that serve all the content you currently enjoy.  Nothing more.  There is no spying.  They are just a part of the road and traffic systems of the information highway not the cops that pull you over.  Linkedin/Microsoft use Akamai to deliver their content/software.  Go ahead and block those IP's....  You will see how crippled the internet can really be.

       No. The store app is which is fully under microsoft's control. Akamai could probably technically change the content on their cdn in order to try to serve the users modified versions of store apps but I don't think that would go on undetected for long and it would result rather quickly escalate into a giant lawsuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are concerned with spying and privacy breaches Akamai is definitely not the first actor you should worry about as long as you have Windows10 installed and frequent websites like reddit.

       because of people like the op and posters in this thread who don't know what a cdn is or what permissions programs have you install on your windows computer. It's worse than trying to explain physician's assistants why their printers not work. But remind me again - what fundamentals of IT did I get wrong there buddy.

       dont fall for the obvious misdirection. The fact that there is a permission allowing for remote regkey modifications tells you all you need to know. Only reason you would need such a permission is to modify additional tailored backdoor access.

       Exactly, they didn't want a NYT article with "Microsoft installs backdoor" so they made a file with the permission to add it later.

       What about the open ports allowing your ips to connect at any time? The Store app is responsible for that? It seems Windows is wide open so that Akami and MS can push updates as they see fit. Talking about it like a CDN doesn't really address the issue.

      <p>
       And when they have learnt it all and made ais and robots and automated it all. They will cull the population. After all the only reason we have mega cities and so on today is that large populations were needed for large industrialisation. But now that we are at the age of automation, do you really think they will need to keep us all around?

       Perhaps I watched black mirror and electric dreams and related it back to reality too much, But no, there have been short stories and publication going back to 1800s with owellian ideas. Its just staring into epoc of another age defying human revolution is a bit scary.

       There is one essential problem they overlook!
      </p>
      <p>
       Companies track and sell your data to marketers to try and market to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       These marketers use social media to market and collect data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their marketing works steering
       <em>
        most people
       </em>
       to these main “hubs” and getting the demographics to do what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       As marketing continues to succeed, more and more people move to the mean of their demographic.
      </p>
      <p>
       They keep buying and selling more data and
       <strong>
        the value of data is a bubble
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       BECAUSE, the marketing works, meaning everyone’s data *looks more and more like everyone else’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as this progresses, “Big Data” will be no more effective than a “Google Trends” curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is particularly unique, 90% of people on the internet browse the exact same top 10% of the websites.  Your data just looks like a point in the middle of the Bell Curve.

       Good thing people are tyring to break out of this. Also this only accounts for a system that gets stale and dies. What the current shit thats happening in US is at least proving to me that humans do need a push to get going, but at least they know this and will always spice things up. Otherwise society becomes stale and dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also yes short term profits, but I guess its important to realise nothing is forever. Eventually we are all going to die, eventually everyone comes out of fasion. So there is a trend to move to gig economies (gig work sucks, but if they can get min wage or basic universal income to work) then humans can have more free time to be human, and move about society easily working where they can instead of being stuck in a cubicle doing the same repetetive tasks day in day till they are dead. So its a positive with a negative. We just shouldnt let them get too greedy and fuck things up because they want to get their way, for as long as possible, like keeping coal and oil in business far longer than it should have been considering solar panels were invented a long time ago, and we are still waiting for market availability at affordable prices to replace coal and oil. China is communist and they have a plan and look they are achieving it, if anything their system should be looked at in US a bit more seeing as for a greater good they have things working right (bad points good points, )

       Dude, UBI
       <em>

       .  Give people UBI and then turn them into
       <em>
        serfs
       </em>
       totally dependent upon the state and enough money to live and enjoy life but not enough to actually own anything or accumulate wealth...  give them some free housing while the ultra rich buy up every square foot of actual property around them...  soon enough “serf” won’t be an analogy or hyperbole, people will literally become serfs to the landed nobility who rules them.

       My hope is that “AI” which is really just very advanced data analysis
       <em>
        gets turned back on the government
       </em>
       .  The power of the bureaucracy rests in its Byzantine and indecipherable nature, so many moving parts and tangled webs that even those “controlling” it don’t have the ability to know every function.  Toss in super computers with AI that was built to decipher complex patterns and systems... suddenly the tax code is demystified (for a simple example) bribes and kickbacks are simple to detect, all these things hidden by complexity are revealed.  Trillions of dollars will no longer be able to “just go missing” anymore.  This is what will convince the government to fight AI themselves.

       Although I agree that dependence on the state is an issue in an ideal society basic income is the only solution to take the burden of slaving away at a dead end job just to live. After all thats debt enslavement atm, where by the rich have figured out how to enslave the populace anyway, even without the govs help. So now instead of being dependant ont he state as rich buy up everything. You Are willingly giving everything to the rich to own, unless you pay back your debt, and since wages are stagnating and markets are becoming saturated, paying back the debt becomes harder and harder. Plus they give out loans to everyone and the housing bubbl happened, then tax money gov money aka peoples money was used to bail out the private banks. This system is also fucked, but at least in being owned by the state you are now dependent on the private banks, and they dont have na oversight of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least when it works democracy can solve these issues. And I guess US democracy is being put to the test right now in trying to fight the rich on many issues at the gov level. Dont confuse yourself the gov is yours, its entire function is to maintain order and civility, beyond just security through a police state. American capitalism and anti gov ideologies brought on by that has warped peoples understanding of what a gov is supposed to be. Because being free means anarchy and anarchy doesnt work, we see this every day with private sector taking too much liberty with it smarkets, finding loop holes where they can just to squeeze all they cna in a for profit system/. If democracy works in US, the public should be allowed to create a stronger welfare state to elevate the society as a whole and help those who are unable to help themselfs. This way the society is now a mass that on a micro individual level promotes self responsibility and personal accountability whilst on a macro level as a country as a nation elevates everyone to do better.
      </p>
      <p>
       AI to turn its back on the gov, or perpetual bureaucracy is lunacy, as currently we arent even close to an AI that can learn on its own. But we are there at a technological level to automate and centralized systems so the bureaucracy becomes less about people in power and power of the people. USSR was a huge coalition of nations and bureaucracy then and even now in russia is preventing things getting done fast enough to respond to modern world. But they are hard at work streamlining systems. So is china, once they get it, USA will just fall off the map as a bloated bureaucratic hell it is now. Where "its hard ot know how many employees a department has". Trading the gov for the private sector is literally handing over the keys to the kings and monarchs who rules through wealth of history, and allowing them to run the whole show. Gov is for everyone, and thats why its here to stay, its liek the court system, its must be able to function to rid itself of corruption. Old governments who have not democratised are risking collapsing because democracy is meant to allow for voices of everyone to be heard. And the internet and securing the internet by gov is how everything will become streamlined and create a dark market on the streets. But its happening because thats the future.

       Yes all of it, even anarchist freedom market ideology. Hence we have to think to ourselfs. What is working now, and what isnt. Anarchist free market capitalism isnt working, so switch it up to a more socialist centrelised gov. When then stops working, I am willing to bet the richie rich will have their space technology and they will take the free free market capitalism to space, then once everyone gets up to speed, once again a gov gets implemented to bring order to the space coalation. Its like leap frogging advancing of human prospecting. The prospectors colonised america and made it great, but it reached its capacity as an empire. America has already made a claim to capitalise space, as space has no jurastiction. Then gov came to america, then free market capitalism, then more gov, then less, and now we see automation and obviously once again more gov.

       The ideal system is the one we crewte and we adapt. A system must be able to adapt and grow otherwise it stagnates. Fighting progress is pointnless, so heading for the ideal is the only logical solution. Will we ever reach utopia? I dont think so, but its a whole lot better than sitting around letting society tare itself apart.

       So far, at least for a while, capitalism worked
       <em>
        best
       </em>
       because it best protects against inherent corruption... so long as new people can reach the market, infighting and greed essentially keep them competing to prevent dominance, problem is, those at the top are beginning to realize how to win a prisoners dilemma and work together; making monopolies.
      </p>

       Other systems fail sooner because they don’t let greed fight against itself.

       See, that assumes that evil is inherent. And although power corrupts, there is still no shortage of success storues of good leaders. Capitalism in itself is a marjet system, and most of the developed world has already adapted it in one form or another. Governance, on the hand is another matter. Governance systems require more than a market, and one statistic of gdp to strive for. Governance needs to satisfy the people, the market, safety, security, nature and land. Free market enterprise of US capitalism has failed. And it is time to adalt and change, and on a level it is happening, but those 1% as you mentioned, the rich monopolistic greedy evil want to continue their exploitative dominance over the masses. And it is they, that influence the media the most. It is they that infliltrated the US government and started to change things to better their ideals at the expense of the wage earner. Market therefore has become the governance of the nation. And thag is bad, on so many levels.

       No evil is not the natural state, it has been proven time and time again, morality is what you make of it. Greed and self interest are a natural state, evil is just a concept made up to categorise the undesirable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And pure capitalism on its own, promotes self serving interests, but without a way to promote individual differences within a society as we have already seen in communism society cant work. So like the balance of goodVSevil, yin and yen, and black and white and all the shades of gray are needed to be created. The only stable form of gov that has persevered in the past has been one with strong military, but as the world doesnt really want another big war, smaller police state is implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can never understand americans, they dont want socialism or gov, but they have socialism for the rich and taxes that pay the rich but dont promote social development. Its like a backwards country where the only god is the dollar. Only statistic for wealth of a nation is gdp and spreading of democracy, means war, whilst its own country functions on anything but democracy. Saying capitalism works because it allows evil to compete is lunacy, as the only way to compete is to conspire and monopolise.

       You use Kaspersky, I'm sure many have backdoors in them.. but that's clearly something you might want to get rid of.  Even US military got rid of that shit cause of security concerns.

       Akamai is a document hosting company. They actual host the windows help manuals. If you have an Asus, they host Asus manuals. It's what they do. I worked for a company that hosted their servers, which hosted our companies online support manuals.

       Akamai is a content delivery network.  It is similar to Cloudflare, but probably less featured since it has been around longer.  It is a private company that provides distributed web hosting, for large corporations generally.  Usually this is used to serve the bandwidth-intensive parts of a webpage like images, and large file downloads.  These files are stored on Akamai's distributed network of servers so that whenever you go to a webpage that requests one of them, you receive it from the nearest server and the page loads faster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are privacy and security implications which is why generally this is only used by large corporations that are capable of auditing the process as necessary.

       No.  In the context of firewalls, 'outbound' just refers to how the connection was initiated.  It means the connection was initiated by your computer, and could be used for upload or download.

       They make IC sound codecs and now that I think about it every vendor that writes a driver has access to your entire computer.

       This is no different if you use Linux.
