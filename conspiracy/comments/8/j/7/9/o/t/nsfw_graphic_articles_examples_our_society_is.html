       I know I know...I'm a sexist and have a small penis, but why can a woman
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/8j3fbj/texas_woman_who_ran_over_cheating_husband/">
        run over her husband 3 times with a car with their child in the back seat
       </a>
       and be out of prison in 15 years?  Could you see a jury only giving a guy 15 years for killing his wife, especially in that manner
       <em>
        with their child sitting in the car
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_and_Lorena_Bobbitt">
        Lorena Bobbit
       </a>
       .  Chick chopped her husbands dick off and was acquitted because of "temporary insanity" due to the evil cheating man.  Then it just became a big joke for late night comedians.  Do you see that same situation playing out if John Bobbit had caught her cheating and decided to mutilate her genitalia?  See how I even have to phrase it differently because saying "stabbed her vagina with a knife" sounds infinitely more graphic and terrible than chopping a guys dick off with one?  There is absolutely no way our society would joke about that but men are just a throw away character for everyone to shit on apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I love Bill Burr and have for a long time and one of his many great points is this, if we are going to call out the asshole men and the dogs of the world then we need to be able to call out the bitches and whores too.  There should be no taboo on talking that way about a women, if we want true equality, because they are not floating up in the clouds and are just as likely to be a piece of crap as a human man.  In fact you could argue they have a lot more room to be garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is far more socially acceptable to be an abusive woman in a relationship than an abusive man.  Absolutely zero chance I'm wrong based on my own views, you see it over and over.  The older couple where the women is constantly bitching at the man and the guy just kinda stands there and takes it because he's basically been lobotomized.  People don't bat an eye at that shit, they even think it's funny and cute to see a little woman bossy around some big oafish seeming man.  But try reversing those roles.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe me just start asking yourself this question through your day to day, "would it be alright if a man did it?"
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory, if you can even call it that it's pretty much an open secret, is this.  A big part of the foundation of capitalism (all the way back to merchant capitalism and probably many other economic systems) was using women as a carrot on a string to manipulate the males of the population into doing whatever it is they were "supposed" to be doing.  In a capitalist society that is working long hours and spending all their money.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Buy her a nice big house with a white picket fence, jewelry, pampering and all the new fashionable clothing.  Women, you just sit there and stay pretty."
      </p>
      <p>
       For this to work women needed to be highly controlled.  Being humans they weren't okay with this and they started fighting for their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you mix the brainwashing of "women are goddesses who deserve to be loved, pampered and understood" with the reality of they are selfish human beings like the rest of us... you get a vicious cycle thing going on.  It's become if you give a mouse a cookie, and they just want more and more.  That sounds blamey but it's not their fault, they were called princess by their daddy and all their favorite movies have taught them they are perfect and men have to earn them by either being a magic fairytale prince or spend lots of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are a lot of progressive women out there but as far as mainstream society we are still having the "immature man must better himself to deserve magnificent woman" narrative crammed down our throats in every movie, tv show and advertisement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's encouraging to see a narrative of getting away from media gaining steam, but I sometimes wonder if these movements aren't just smoke and mirrors designed to placate people like me who are tired of living in a brainwashed society.

       These days we are split so many ways it's impossible to count.  There are several different tiers of socioeconomic status, in the peasant class, not to mention the political views where which all hate/blame each other and all seem to forget there are only a few people pulling all these strings.

       Women more than men seem to be overwhelmed with matters of 'identity', and making it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was of course a product of industry. Selling cigarettes to suffragettes, for identity. Selling yoga-pants to sluts who think they practice Buddhism, is marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
       People buy based on identity and need, and when we have a culture that think it needs an identity/ to formulate one from objects, we have a fundamentally flawed society of cattle - cattle which think they are special.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women, statistically, care less about actual issues in politics, care less about facts and more about 'fairness' - what ever the hell that word means in a world-scale - while just over-all being obsessed with 'relationships' [of all types, not just sexual or romantic] and the place within them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find me one wise woman, from history or literature, who goes out ALONE on the mountain and finds god. not one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find me one woman, who while in her prison cell, wrote the greatest work of linguistic-examination ever. Nope. yet, how many men spent there last seconds writing out their masterpieces?
      </p>
      <p>
       The holographic-space of the sense, combined with a group-oriented narrative in linguistic-space, make women the kinder of the species but also the most stupid in matters of material gravitas. They act 'safer' and more 'hesitant', but often 'not at all', when assertion and process mean 'change'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, let's just look at the 'woman's march'
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally, "if you have a snatch, please march for whatever you think brings you a sense of moral high-ground value".
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally, the most vapid demonstration of masses I have ever seen, and not one of those idiots could adequately describe why there were wasting their time like useful political idiots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women also steer nations. Men capitulate for ease of relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's in this subtle-tribal power over in group-paradigm (mothers teach the children most), that slowly drives the masculine values of a society into a shitter, along with the society itself in time and cultural-destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, it can be a form of identity to be an abrasive feminist out to destroy western culture - she gets vapid value from that moronic stance, and a warrant for blue-hair.

       Well, no doubt,
      </p>
      <p>
       someone will prove they have an identity by attacking the non-PC nature of the argument, and subsequently myself, over addressing the various propositions leading to the conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, oH, or downvote - that's easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the reddit phase of people expressing cognitive-bias in the most profound way. Hide or punish the words, via downvote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, attack the speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will see this. . .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the PC-playbook. Why? Again, I mentioned, most people who feel otherwise dont invest into the facts of the argument, as that takes work and serves no identity purpose.

       on women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they haven't done anything, they have done plenty and if you need some proof
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qy3wo/what_are_some_great_things_that_women_have_done/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1qy3wo/what_are_some_great_things_that_women_have_done/
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But you do highlight a good point with the woman's march.. which, correct me if I'm wrong, you had to actually buy a ticket for...  My point is that right now, the old world brainwashing methods revolving around women are colliding with the new world commercializing of their "rights movement".
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have "you are a perfect angel and men should carry you in their big strong arms and protect you" clashing with "men are assholes, and you can do and say whatever you want and everyone has to be understanding" which has really created just a whole host of various Frankenstein's brides.  Hell that whole bride of Frankenstein story, build a woman to appease the unruly male, is like a perfect analogy for them just creating a work force and trying to use women to appease us like we are all just things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides are being used, I definitely don't look down on women though I definitely can get frustrated with it.

       Looking down on women?
      </p>
      <p>
       DID  I not say seek virtuous women?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, am i looking down on women or the general and average beast called 'woman', "hear her roar"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Am i talking about all women, and the answer is no. WE know this through logic extrapolation in that I reference good women. So, thanks for categorizing me with your intentions and bias and not actually readying what I wrote beyond your visceral reaction in terms seemingly applied.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is in your head, in formation, and not my words - if that's your narrative to what I blatantly wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       NEXT,
      </p>
      <p>
       Women create and lead nations, men just do the grunt work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's female sex-cults that owned city-states after generations. holy- prostitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that. A case common to all city states but those of the 'ancient-Americas'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The perfect angel does not exist, And I think you expose a bias in trying to do so, when you apply the same standard in respect to all women without knowing most of them in limit or potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, who am I to say they are whores and psychos?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the world. Look at the un-happy "trying-again" single-mom on tinder trying to score with the younger guy who has a life-going for him (my dating experience in a nut shell on those apps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the tinder girl, saying, "I already fucked like 40 guys my freshman year, I want love motherfuckers".
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the 40 year old at the bar, drinking her 'separation' celebration away, while fawning over men as an attention seeking-routine like a fourteen year old girl in a rotting make-uped body.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the reality of women seeking love in my civilizaion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have I met wonderful women, who actually have the virtous capacity for marriage and 'we'-reality that comes with marriage and children?
      </p>
      <p>
       YES!!! i have. very much so.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are a fraction of the women I have met, and I used to not only promote for clubs, but live in Vegas and Chicago. I also lived in Europe, and the culture is MUCH more trial-and-error there (non-catholic nations).
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, what I just said was TRIAL-AND-ERROR.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the dating reality of women and men now. Fuck them if it does not work out, it was trial-and-error. NO. It's a relationship made and then broken. Over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dating and love is not trial-and-error, unless you live in a society that benefits off your suffering in error.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why respect all people? Clearly, not all people deserve this blanket of respect. Save the energy for something real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Save the energy for actual identities that have value, that you can respect and love, and throw the universal garbage of fake-love/respect out with the rest of the generalizations that you like/dont like.

       Do all mental illnesses result in someone being a psycho? No, of course not. Do some in fact result in someone the average person would consider a psycho? Undeniably, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Promiscuity has been studied and polled quite a bit. Just because money doesn't exchange hands immediately before or after the act doesn't mean a woman isn't a whore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you and your self righteousness have never even considered the fact that you're wrong. That's a sign of immaturity, try growing up a bit if you wish to discuss adult topics.

       Fucking duh. But that's not the point that I was taking issue with. Of course there are some people who most would consider "psycho", but that's not the same as "most western women" being psychos. That is hundreds of millions of women labelled as psychos.

       Desperate equates to want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no time for psychos and whores.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have experience that 'gate' of necessity, and panic-reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       remember, me accounting for something like 60 plus sexual partners, all women. Why? It's EASY!!!!!!!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       you think im super-man?  NO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple game-theory slays most opponents too stupid to see their own lack of options in moves. These are untrained everyone, but especially women, who never invest in their potential knowledge and virtue-ethics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just right now, in fact, my personal circle is now filled with married women contemplating divorce, because they're essentially board, and want to live like their 30-40 girlfriends who now act like teenagers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think they drink with me or the guys the married?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think they take out cash form the bank ATM? to find the financial loss of their still husband.
      </p>
      <p>
       Desperate? No retard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im surrounded by these desperate women. desperate for any-type of validation that equates to temporary feel-good identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       low-and-behold, it creates a reactionary desire to KNOW better women, sexually and romantically.

       You assume my anger is like the warmth of a lamp.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       My anger is like a laser.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has purpose and is directed. Real virtue in wrath. Wrath we see as virtuous in practice of the good or promotion of it, even to fools who seek and wish to see me destroyed, like your wishing-warning. . .
      </p>
      <p>
       No, my anger is directed at fools like you who:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) think they know me
      </p>
      <p>
       b) think they know the world they prescribe
      </p>
      <p>
       c) have no connection to a descriptive reality independent their wants and hopes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why you assume ill be destroyed by something that would wholly-consume you. You're weak, and it shows in your appeal to things and person you clearly dont understand, and only seek to warn about, like someone threatening me with karma.  Like your good enough to threaten me with karma or otherwise, mr. pride.
      </p>

       Karma is part of a structural universe, so you can wish anymore than your own destruction upon me three-fold, silly boy.

       Ultimately, it doesn't matter to me and won't impact me in any major way.  I was just making an observation based on your comments.  And I think it's immoral for people to encourage this kind of self-destructive (not to mention just plain destructive, period) thinking.

       This is a conversation that needs to be had-there are different versions of feminism and the older versions have criticized the newer SJW types.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it as this, women are people too. Give anyone power what do try want? More power. Women have largely been in control whethwr they'll admit it or not. Happy wife, happy life. The stereotype of the dumb oaf husband and the smart wife who puts up w/him has been around since Fred and Wilma to Homer and Marge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now society uses the wage gap thing as a marketing tool. Even though srudies have shown its the same when u control for the factors(men tend to negotiate more, work at more lucrative jobs, etc). I think there's evidence to suggest women make more in their 30s than men.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is there is a lot to discuss, but we can't because otherwise we're sexist. Also interesting because no one ever mentions the emasculation of men, which is a noticeable cultural shift if nothing else.

       Yes, you can. You just have to understand the importance of 'time and place'. The time is never when women or simps are around, and the place is never work or social/family events (unless isolated with a thinking person, and nobody else around to get triggered).

        A big part of the foundation of capitalism (all the way back to merchant capitalism and probably many other economic systems) was using women as a carrot on a string to manipulate the males of the population into doing whatever it is they were "supposed" to be doing. In a capitalist society that is working long hours and spending all their money.

       There will be a convergence between the so-called 'conspiracy' scene and the so-called 'mgtow' scene over the next few years. So many of the ailments they see with society and modern life stem from the same source. The solutions to the problems, on the micro (personal) level are also largely similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expect to get downvoted by men stuck in crappy relationships and crypto-SJWs. They want to believe that  modern women are worth the time and effort. Many of them
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to believe. The problem is that unless you are in the top few percent of males in terms of sexual attractiveness, then it is a fool's game. Even being wealthy only 'attracts' women to what you can provide rather than what you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       For most men, the smartest long-term strategy is not to play. Fortunately for modern women, most modern men are too stupid to think long-term.

       That doesn't make sense to me at least as far as loneliness is concerned. To be willing means to want and enjoy something no?
So if they're not enjoying life wouldn't that mean that they're either lying to themselves , the they are Unwilling? I just don't seem to get the point you're trying to make, can you give me an example?

       They’ve been conditioned by Japanese culture to believe that work is more important than family. Computer games and other banal distractions occupy what little downtime and energy they have left, leaving no room for dating or raising a family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they lying to themselves? Not necessarily. Japanese society endorses that lifestyle for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extend this idea to other cultures, let’s say the western bachelor dream. Instead of “work is the best use of your time” replace it with “money in the bank and a fast motorcycle and babes and drugs and endless good times” etc. I’m generalising of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does any of that kid of lifestyle matter either? Is it glamorized as valuable, or cool, or worthwhile regardless?

       Well working a lot and video games, play on the male need to be "a hero" what this speaks to me is that they can't get that elsewhere. 
I also hear that Japan is full of "empowered" women , who don't want to date your average shy Japanese guy, who as you pointed out works a lot and plays games.
       <br/>
       "money in the bank and a fast motorcycle and babes and drugs and endless good times”
       <br/>
       again sounds like a goodlife to me, except for the drugs of course.
I'm still not getting why you see this as a bad thing? Dudes are enjoying their own money. What do you want them to do? voluntarily give up their money to government ,companies , women? That's downright intrusive.

       It’s just the other side of the same coin. Instead of pissing time down the drain directly at work, it gets converted into money first. It’s illusory freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that raising a family is one of the most natural and rewarding things a man can do. All the selfish fun and personal introspection benefits that are artificially sought elsewhere no matter the culture can be obtained by focussing your energy on others, specifically the ones closest to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       To do that, you have to swim upstream and find a mate. This means “playing the game”, whichever version you find yourself in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back to the OP’s, “what is the end goal” of not playing the modern mating game. If you choose “not to play” then life’s final scrapheap beckons by default. To think otherwise is to convince oneself that it’s possible to step outside society but still win at life. Maybe it is possible, if one abandons it all for the bush and living off the land. Selectively abandoning some parts — money, possessions, society’s “desirable” women — while in reality continuing to be bound by the same laws and customs as everyone around you seems like willful self deceit to me.

 Yeah lets blame everything on Capitalism, what a joke.
Do you think Monkeys are capable of understanding Capitalism?
Well it turns out once they learned about monetary exchange they paid other monkeys for sex.

       It's a basic evolutionary concept, those who can best provide, are best suited to secure their lineage. It has absolutely nothing to do  that's mutually exclusive to Capitalism. It's monetary exchange, plain and simple.

       It just depends on how deep you want to go.  There's a strong argument that western society was born from male insecurity (jealous sex partners) - with successful tribes growing from stroking that ego (commoditizing the jealous desire of the human male).  Women were turned into property that could be "doled out" to incentivize productive workers.  This then lead to colonialism and it's shiny first born son, self-regulated patriarchal capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, to me, it's wasteful to worry about the few times women get away with stuff or show small advantages in current society.  We're only a few generations from literally treating them like property.  Let's work together to solve the big issues (ingrained racism and sexism in the rules and laws that bind) so the rich can stop distracting the poor by causing infighting on teevee and the internet.  I think you're smart and I think you're close, but I don't think you're  all the way there on this one.

       That is not at all the point of the post.  If some of that tone came through it's because yes I'm a man with some personal experiences of being straight shat on by women, like many of the other commenters.  But I think if you really read it and understand what I'm trying to say you will see I don't see women as the enemy.  I see men and women as being pitted against each other for economic reasons and I am obviously speaking from the male standpoint.

       Nature programmed us that way,men are expandable as in if you wipe out all the male population and left just one he'll probably be able to keep the species going but if you wipe out all females except one...you get the picture. The value of female life to nature is not a conspiracy,on the other hand the constant noise about opressive males,rigged patriarchal system,only male sexual abuse,whorification of western females, constant bombing of the institution of family is part of the 'conspiracy',what better way to divide men and women than to build up mgtow and feminism? As a result many won't marry and the ones who do will probably break up,leaving the child's education to the state and the media, this is the conspiracy. People that planned this understand it pretty well,how many parents nowadays educate their children? How many teach them whats wrong and what's right,about life,about a purpouse,about building a purpouse and a value code to live by? It's not about pussy conspiracy or dick conspiracy,the next generation is 'the game' and we almost lost it.

       For me mgtow is a better lifechoice. 
You can either work your ass off for your family and wife, basically playing the Russian roulette , 1 bullet 2 bullet cylinder(50/50).
Or you can work for yourself and have fun in life , start respecting your own time and effort.

       We're too hedonistic and self centred(myself included) but that's rubbish,what do we leave behind us? I always had the fear of being a father,I looked up to my father as a model of sacrifice and how up he raised the bar,with his goods and bads he formed me to behave like a man. I confessed to him that I don't think I'll ever have a child because of the responsability I'll face and the fear of being a bad parent and he told me the following:'You can't be perfect,you can't be right,you'll always make mistakes but all you have to do is to give your best'. And he's right,it's natural law to have children,try picturing a life of loneliness,with no one around you,just you in your man cave,that sounds like happiness? We are social beings but on top of that we have special bonds with our lover and our children,they might be basic emotions,but they can keep you going even in the hardest times and they give you a life purpouse. I had a sort of MGTOW philosophy(not even knwoing about MGTOW,afterwards I found out it is a thing)and do you think I was happy? I was empty,devoided of 'life'. Trust me,women aren't happy with feminism either,especially in their 30's when their biological clock starts ticking but WE need to bring this into discussion,we need to stop promoting MGTOW and feminism if we want a future(as a culture)...and we need to make sacrificies,we need to make an effort,if this was indeed a plan to destroy us do you think we'll simply clap our hands and everything will be dandy again?Women are empowered exactly for the purpouse of attracting male hate,males go their own way,they become secluded monks,they stop working,stop improving themselves(because they lost their biological role as 'pillars' of the family) and we simply but surely dissapear,our race,our culture,gone. But sure,we can complain,we can cry,we can build a shelter into the woods and abandon social life or we could find a way to better ourselves and stop this,it is after all our choice,isn't it? Find an intelligent woman,make 2 children,educate them properly and we might have a chance,if we quit the sacrifice of our ancestors(being it voluntary or involuntary-based on simple maternal/paternal instincts would have been for nothing).

       "Me and my mancave" - sounds like a paradise. I don't get off on the idea of people watching me slowly die. As for socializing ,Plenty of to be friends with.
       <br/>
       "give you a life purpouse" - see that's the lack of self-respect I'm talking about.
       <br/>
       If you're not slaving away for a woman , or raising a little copy of yourself , by your own admission your life has "no purpose" ,that is sad to me.
       <br/>
       MGTOW needs no promotion it's purely a reaction to the state of the world , it will grow and there's nothing anyone can do to stop it.
       <br/>
       "in their 30's when their biological clock starts ticking but WE need to bring this into discussion,"
       <br/>
       Nah, shoulda spend their 20ies looking for a good husband rather than irresponsibly fucking around. Not my problem.
       <br/>
       "and we need to make sacrificies" YOU NEED,  I absolutely feel no need to do so. 
Then again I do some charity work and pay taxes.
       <br/>
       "simply clap our hands and everything will be dandy again"- mate you probably can't even fix your own neighborhood and you are talking about fixing the world.
       <br/>
       But you're right to some degree I am pro escalation of the problem , I think it will wake up more people. 
"become secluded monks,they stop working,stop improving " - become monks , stop working - perhaps, but that's not a bad thing , "Herp depr having more time must be so bad".
       <br/>
       stop improving - Never seen a mgtow that's not improving, you're just shoving your idea of "improvement" down other ppls throats.

       Why are you here?Why do you exist?Why do we all exist?It is because of the sacrifices our ancestors made before us,their time,their sweet,their blood for your genetic line to survive,as I've said,it might have been conscious,it might have been not but we're breaking that contract,hedonism will be the downfall of our society. If you can keep your routine,your morals and your life in order because you adopted MGTOW,fine,your choice but remember that lifestyle,that ideology dies with you,it's unnatural.
No one indoctrinated me on family values or way of life,I've passed through all ideologies and ruminated them,to understand the implications of an idea you have to play with it untill you understand all possible outcomes,then you can find the best case scenario for you.
I agree that nothing ties you directly to your ancestor and you have no direct duty them (if you don't consider your existence to be one).
"- mate you probably can't even fix your own neighborhood and you are talking about fixing the world."-We're not mates,sorry,and I try to keep a civilised aproach to this topic,personal attacks are nothing more than the death of the debate,whether you are right or wrong the moment you start attacking someone the exchange of ideas is over,there's usually no further gains except for some increased versatility in the ability to curse.
"Then again I do some charity work and pay taxes."-those charity works are things you believe in or do you do them just because you think you should?If you firmly belive in that cause it's a good thing.
 "Never seen a mgtow that's not improving, you're just shoving your idea of "improvement" down other ppls throats."-yes,I've seen MGTOW improving but because of their resentfulness,their hate on women and on society(I had MGTOW friends),do you think that's constructive?
"and that's bad , because? They're just sentimental values, have nothing to do with your personal happiness"-I've never been happy,I haven't found hapiness yet,though I'm constantly improving the way I feel and thik about the world,darkness and dark thoughts breed only darkness.
I'm not a hippie kid,I can tell you that I've probably hit the bottom of the well a few times,I'm not naive nor do I think in global peace and blue unicorns,I just understood that natural law is the best law,the moment you step out of the line and break your contract something might 'break' into your psyche as I've seen with many of my MGTOW friends. 
Now let's think,what is MGTOW? a response to a problem. 
What problem? the abuse of state and society over man,over it's value and it's pride.
3) Did we have another way to go?Yes,but that's risky,it means going against the narrative,being demonised by the media and the feminists,it means fighting for our cause,for our culture,our "tribe".I see MGTOW as an escape from reality,it won't change if you go away and do nothing,it will probably get worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr:If you find hapiness in your lifestyle good for you but don't assume it has to be the norm and understand that by adopting this way of life you promote egocentric and hedonistic life views,it's not bad,it's not good,it is what it is. The reason I spent so much time responding is because I think(from my own experince)that it can't bring hapiness and fulfillment,working and building only yourself means that you leave nothing behind,when you die all is lost.Having children on the other hand assures you that some of your knowledge will be passed on,that you made the future better,as good as you could. And think this,if all people did as you the entire human race would be extinct in max 100 years,how is that normal? To me it seems the most nihilistic and self distructive approach,this kind of movements don't stem from the upper part of the emotion spectrum.

       "Why are you here?Why do you exist?Why do we all exist?It is because of the sacrifices our ancestors made before us." - 
Sacrifices or stupidity.
Firstly you assume that existence is better than nonexistence. Which you cannot prove , you only fear non-existance/death due to lack of information.
       <br/>
       Secondly those "sacrifices" could easily , be thought as stupidity.
       <br/>
       Case and Point
       <br/>
       Why would you have a child , if you can't afford it. Here I'd like to point out that women in US alone are having 2mln abortions per year of which 50% are repeat abortions. In 10 yrs time the casualties will reach roughly WW2 numbers and half of them are caused by share power of irresponsibility.
       <br/>
       My father sacrificed time and money for me and In return I will take care of him and love him... however he's still stupid. I only owe Him/mom no-body else. He owes his own father and his father his father.
"that ideology dies with you" - wrong an ideology is not bound by procreation and genes.An ideology is not a living being, but an abstract thought. Anyone can think it at any time.
       <br/>
       Is this your attempt at scaring me? cute. Even if the ideology was to die, I don't see how this is "good or bad" it just is.
       <br/>
       ",whether you are right or wrong the moment you start attacking someone the exchange of ideas is over" - really? that just doesn't sound right, from what I've gathered we're irresponsible , monks , who do no work... but when I point out that your ideological approach to fixing things is flawed...that's a personal attack xD.
Sure I guess Imma ignore the rest of the post then. As you say the ideological exchange is over.

       the terms I used are from the chatter I see in the virtual media,I have not used any pejorative term that pertains to your specific person,as I'm not a native speaker I used the term 'monk' as a description for the monastic life MGTOWs have,also seclusion and withdrawl from the workforce and education institutions is also corelated with MGTOW and feminism upward trend,what is wrong in that?I read your post,I will respond to any post you have(if time allows)with arguments and logic.
As we're on  conspiracy theory post wouldn't it be wise to think at the root of it all? Why males and females have to be divided,why create conflict?Why turn females against male,then males against females?What was the result of this?Why housing got so expensive?Why 2 people can't afford a child even if they work full time in some countries?Why if they afford it they won't probably be much around him? Don't you see too many coincidences?

       What returns do you expect and why every investment has to have material gains? You see it only from a material POV. It is not illogical as in natural logic,material,yes.But let me ask you,what material products value without a system of reference? Isn't it the social desire,the exchanges humans partake that give value to something?Does anything have any value without human interaction? Can the rich exist without the poor? Does it matter if you have all the wealth on the world and you're alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       You build a family 1) from instinct,if you are a lower being or 2) from the conscious desire to educate and teach a human being your values,your ideas,your insights,if he agrees with you, the  discoveries you made in your lifetime will be passed on for the betterment of our species.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are an intelligent human being,why would you let lower IQ people outnumber the next generation with their 8-10 children? What will happen to the human race if we devolve?
 If you won't make children don't think stupid people will do the same,on the contrary,they'll probably make even more and humanity will fall again into darkness. The sole reason we are able to communicate and live carefree lives is because those before us passed the knowledge  and knowingly or unknowingly had children. It might be just instincts but I'm grateful that I exist,if my dad cared about the car he drove I probably  wouldn't be here. You can see the good or the bad side of existence,I think that feminism and MGTOW focus only on the grims of existence.

I see a discrepancy in your virtuous morality. a slight... hypocrisy.
Surely if production makes you more happy and happy society makes you happy, then you are responsible for those 8-10 children almost as much as for your own? Here we go back to the abysmal flaw in your "make the world better logic", you can't even bother to make the effort to take care of small community. Yet I'm the problem, cuz I'm not having enough "HuWhite" babies.

You can be as misantrophic as you want but don't bash people who want a change.

       And have you seen any ideology protecting men as it is happening with women? Why women are empowered to behave like that and men don't react? MGTOW is the opposite of reacting,it is literally running away from the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men shouldn't complain if they shut up over the years,you are a cuck by choice,the milenials had fathers,why didn't they reacted? Is the inablity of some of them to educate their children part of the problem? Yes
Is their inability to take a stand against the economic enslavement we see now part of the problem? Yes
      </p>

       You can't see the whole picture untill you study all that has happened in the last 70 years,the feminist movement,the contraceptive pill,abortions,housing crisis,media promoting single moms in films and tv shows,man being imaged as a lazy egoistic ape(alpha gorilla),white hate,cuck culture(you only need to go to pornhub to see how much they promote cuckolds and interacial intercourse where 'thehubby' is a castrated twat that licks a black dick),the whores we see now on tv that concentrate only on self image(like the Kardashians),most recently the white guilt movements...the list can go on and on,if you don't see a pattern I'll retreat from this discussion as I've stated  most of my arguments and opinions.

       How did I evolve since I became MGTOW? 
I lost a lot of weight 20kg and replaced it with muscle, I invested in crypto currency made 10k just on that alone this year. On top of my usual earnings. I bought a small house for myself which meets all my needs, I pay only what I must to the government. Everything is mine and mine alone.
       <br/>
       Half a year ago I bought myself a piano , because why the fuck not. 
I don't have to worry I already have everything sorted out, could buy it without A SINGLE worry and no need to ask for permission.
I'm going to Japan next year taking my mom with me , she ACTUALLY deserves it.

       I'm sincerely happy about it,you really seem to be good man but I don't agree to that lifestyle,as I've said , I was a women hater myself(because of the hipocrisy of feminism) and I know some of it was due to frustration and rage(as I heard many cases of men fucked by the judiciary system),I find it hard to get kindred minded women but they exist if you look them(I don't let my sexual instincts guide my life),I'm usually analitic of every action. I could get easy pussy but I always refuse casual sex,I had sex only with women I loved and with whom I planned things,things didn't worked out but that's life...I don't hold a grudge against them. After I finish UNI I seriously plan to have 2 children with my best girl friend :)) We made a pact,she's highly intelligent and we understand each other very well so why not give it a try once we're on our own feet? We would be able to afford it easily. We don't live in 1st world countries and here our salaries will be enough to do it,we think alike so I think it will work out. I won't be able to change much of the future but I'll change my enviroment as good as I can.

       About that you're not right,at all. It is now that way,in the 'till 30-40 yrs ago families of 4-5 were supported by one salary,they afforded a house and a car. Why do you think the purchasing power decreases every year and wages stagnate?

       Unfortunately no,the highest global debt is now,in the times of MGTOW , feminism and planned obsolescence. You can search global household debt in the last 100 yrs,it is related to banks but mostly because of their dillution of currency, artificial debt and other shady things,they first happened to America,now it's spreading.

       I lost thread count,sorry but if you edit comms I don't get notifications on most :)) I get your point,I've been harsh and kinda stingy because I thought you are one of those frustrated men who blame it all on others not doing a thing with their lives. I'm glad life is working out for you and if you feel fulfilled even better,I understand your view even if I don't agree with it. I just hope you'll change your mind for the sake of our succesful future,as a species.

       It's a bad habbit of mine, I write "on the fly" , people usually think that I'm just fucking with them, I have to stop it really. I just can't seem to get into habit of writing a full comment and stopping there no matter what XD
No I don't blame even women for who they are, I just observe them as they are and don't want no part in it. 
It's like scratch cards , you win a little you loose, but you will never hit the jackpot, statistically speaking.
       <br/>
       I understand you absolutely , you want to get your life together and settle down properly. 
I fundamentally stand against everything that a woman represents to lesser or bigger extent.
In ideal world I'd be doing exactly what you are doing. I respect you for choosing the hard path, but I also think it silly.

       I chose this path because I almost dropped out,I saw no reason in working just for myself,I really was rock bottom a few years ago, I felt humanity is hopeless and that we'll never solve any problem we currently have,I hated and blamed everything around me,I'm no snowflake unfortunately...I looked only for bad and obviously found it everywhere so yeah,I can't be productive just for me,everytime I set the bar low I'll go even lower,the only hope I found was in educating the future as good as I can,I don't want to be pointless here,though I know I won't have much impact now there is hope for the future if we all strive to make the future happen(I know,sounds silly but this idea brought me back from the deepest and darkest corners of my mind).
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep around people that think,people that feel  their good actions can add up in time, we don't agree on everything( a few are very materialistic) but we agree that if we do nothing surely others will and not necessarily with a good outcome in mind( Good for our future,our liberty and our succes as a species).

       I would have no problem with that.
I encourage women to go out there and be empowered. Open up their own businesses and climb up the social ladder.
       <br/>
       Go their own way. It's more a question of fairness and keeping it real. I have literally 0 issues with women who clearly state their needs and wants. It's when your mouth says one thing and your actions say another, that I get pissed of.

       Maybe you and I have different ideas of "progressive", but most women I'd call "progressive" are firmly in the "women are goddesses who deserve to be loved, pampered and understood" camp, along with a dash of "all men are secretly sexist".
      </p>
      <p>
       And capitalism definitely benefits from the current system as well - possibly moreso. Requiring women to be in the workforce doubles the amount of laborers.

       This comes down mostly to the feminist movement of the 60s and 70s.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the time there was inequality and it was obvious so they picked the low hanging fruit, the easy targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept of the patriarchy which they started to perpetuate was easier for them to explain as men keeping women down instead of powerful men keeping everyone else down, especially because America where this movement was coming out from was in the middle of its golden age so it would have been an extremely difficult concept to sell since a man with a 10th grade education could provide a comfortable life for a family of 4 including home ownership and vacations.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a internal rift in the feminism movement at the time, look at the story of Erin pizzey, she started England’s first domestic violence shelter and was pretty much kicked out of the movement for wanting to provide the same service to men and boys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the major points of inequality were tackled for the most part by the 80s the feminist movement was already a massive machine, it was taking in millions of dollars, by the end of third wave feminism the war was won, they now had an army of seasoned soldiers and no war to fight, so they go looking for one.
      </p>
      <p>
       When any legitimate movement would start to take into account plenty of the legitimate grievances of the MRA movement which was starting to bring to light ( men having zero reproductive rights, being more likely to work themselves to death, the breakdown of the male gender by boys having less access to powerful positive role models outside the fields of sports and music, etc. ) instead they simply doubled down on the anti-male rhetoric of the past and went for the jugular, now it’s perfectly fine to accuse someone of rape just because “it’s a conversation we need to have” or protest any viewpoint which is viewed as opposing or dissenting even if it isn’t simply because someone has taken offence to it..
      </p>
      <p>
       If you shout loud enough at something you do not think you agree with it will simply go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the exact thinking which ended up getting trump (note, I believe the man is absolutely disgusting and the symbol of the patriarchy which the second wave feminists misinterpreted all those years Avon) the presidency, the American “left” was too busy being up on their high horse shouting down every single viewpoint which they thought they disagreed with without bothering to try to figure out of the grievances are legitimate or not, or if the people who have the grievance simply do not understand enough to articulate it properly ( see the whole “deplorable”/“bringing coal back” thing. , these are people who have legitimate desperation, the right lied to them about being able to bring those jobs back, the left just called them deplorable instead of talking about how to help these people return to prosperity )

       You were doing pretty good up until the very end. Like or Hate Trump, he has in-fact created jobs, maybe not the specific ones he campaigned on, but unemployment is significantly lower. And let's not forget, while the intentions may have been good in nature(I personally doubt it) leftist brought us Feminism and Cultural Marxism. 
Probably why Conservatives have happier relationships(go ahead google it yourself, even leftist news sources acknowledge this)

       If women have to work to support themselves or their family, that instantly doubles the potential workforce, and cuts wages in half. The stupid lazy guys get cut out of the workforce improving productivity. The massive oversupply of trained college graduates means that you have to swallow any demand by your employer because you can be easily replaced. It all means more money for the fat cats, and less for us.

       I think women have generally superior emotional intelligence, possibly due to some kind of evolutionary advantage in child rearing.  In western culture, women have been traditionally denied official access to power and have had to use cunning and manipulation to gain power and use it, especially against men who may have had access to formal and/or material power advantages.
      </p>
      <p>
       The combination of potentially innate emotional intelligence and socially learned manipulation has made it possible for women to engage in sophisticated psychological abuse of men, in and out of intimate relationships.  When it works well, men aren't even aware they're being manipulated or abused.  In many cases men ARE aware, but the nature of the abuse makes it difficult for them to describe, prove or even coherently understand -- it's kind of the same phenomenon or effect as gaslighting in many ways.  If they result to the "trump card" of physical violence to resist or retaliate, they are labeled abusers -- which may be factually correct, but the underlying motivation and causes are ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this helps explain why some level of physical abuse has been tolerated in spousal relationships historically -- some kind of shared understanding that women can and are capable of vexatious psychological abuse that's not controllable without resorting to some level of physical violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not endorsing either party's role in this -- manipulative behavior or violent retribution -- just trying to describe how I think it often works.

       If women have superior emotional intelligence why do you always see little boys being way more social than girls?  I think that whole line is a complete lie that's been sold to us to keep young girls in a bubble away from young boys so they can drive them apart and then use them against each other later in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me exactly
       <em>
        why

       women "superior emotional intelligence" just because they can cry about their feelings whenever they want.  What constitutes intelligence?

       I see girls as more cooperative with each other but that doesn't necessarily mean more emotionally mature.  Boys are far more likely to reach out and interact with other boys than girls who are typically a little more shy and reserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you might say the quality of the interaction between boys is very unruly between boys and thus making girls more mature.  But maybe the very fact that "boys will be boys", or at least at one point were allowed to be (not so much anymore they put you on adhd medication if you act out too much), but girls have always been expected to get along better and be more well behaved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well that is a bit restrictive to young girls isn't it?  I know things are changing but that undertone still very much exists in society and no matter how much certain parents and teachers might really try to keep their predisposed notions about genders in check, every young girl is going to face some form of "this is not how a lady acts" at some point.  Probably repeatedly unless they have a well to do family that can afford to send them off to a nice open minded liberal arts college where they can grow there armpit hair and whatnot and then go on to work some really cool "out of the box" job that only kids from wealthy families can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       So boys are allowed to exercise more emotional freedom, and you could argue that actually eventually makes them
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       socially mature because they are more in touch with their emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a conformist society of course acting out and being human is going to be seen as "emotionally immature" and the little girls who sit nicely and play tea party with each other are seen as "mature".  Because they are acting the way they are
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to.  Not necessarily the way that is best for their human development.  Thus the conflict I am highlighting in my post.

       A little boy might kiss one kid, push over another.. run around in a bunch of circles, throw up, cry.. go play some tag, experience their first loss or victory, call the teacher mommy and then snuggle up with their favorite stuffed toy and blankie for a nap... all in one day.  While the little girls are braiding each others hair and dressing up dolls and playing house.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which one of those kids is testing their emotional waters and which kid is just sticking their toes in?  How can the little girls be so emotionally mature if they aren't even having as many experiences?  I know it's changing but they have been forced into that weird stepford housewife role for a long time to the point that "playing house" with dolls and shit is still a major pastime for them.

       Men run the world and pussy runs men.  Women have mastered playing the victim and all feminism has done is tried to disenfranchise men as a whole, as much as possible.  It has done nothing to move women forward in society.  If anything, it's holding them back.  Women are basically a meme in my mind, currently.  There is no point in dealing with them (as a man) unless you want your finances taken, or to be thrown in jail for false rape claims.
