       The "conspiracy community" or the Truth Movement communicates almost entirely online via a series of online forums, YouTube videos, and social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guarantee you that TPTB have had a very close eye on this culture, and have been monitoring it's growth and the spread of our message for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they want to maintain absolute control, they have to prevent a consensus from manifesting within our culture, or our beliefs could really catch on and spread on a mass scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody paying close attention can see, they are implementing that plan now, and you would be surprised at how well it seems to be working.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we are treated as a separate entity from the masses, because we don't watch the MSM and were skeptical of propaganda in films, the publications, newspapers, ect. Since we congregate almost exclusively online, our brainwashing and programming comes in the form of false prophets, psyops, attempts to legitimize the political spectrum. They used the election as a weapon to divide us, they are using the political spectrum as a weapon to divide us, and they are using gatekeepers and disinformation agents to confuse everybody and drive a wedge between us. And they are using a massive online army of paid astroturfers, to reinforce all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it appears as if there's this "tug of war" going on between those who believe in the "Q" phenomenon and those who are wary of it as a psyop. The majority of this culture used to reject the false left/right dichotomy, the legitimacy of the scripted elections, and the "puppetry" of the presidential candidates and politicians. Now it seems as if they are cleverly "sucking" some of the more naive users back into the paradigm and into supporting the administration, which creates a rift and tension/division/arguments ensue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the bottom line is, I don't find this division within the conspiracy community to be developing organically. I think we're all essentially being gaslighted and led astray by this massive paid infiltration campaign, because we pose a substantial threat to the establishment of we were to unite under one single social/political ideology, and one single cause. It's something we should be aware of.

       And then to work collaboratively to bring that idea to fruition. No one cares that you know, for instance, that the 9/11 narrative is bogus. What could be considered a threat is that you know, and then work towards producing, a viable alternative to the status quo.

       I've known this for a while, and if I'm brutally honest with myself... I don't want the responsibility. I'm sure most can relate. We can sit around and type away on Reddit until our finger fall off, but until our hearts and minds are aligned with our ACTIONS, nothing will never change and TPTB will continue to sit back and laugh at us as they further condition us into non-action and spectating.

       We all face a choice. You can either be a passive observer, or do something to change things.

       It is definitely some sort of cult following. People will believe anything now a days.. not that it's a bad thing. I try and keep things at a distance when it comes to something like that. Can't be too gullible.

       For things like 9/11 truth, the people who don't believe the government's version, at this point, are not going to be dissuaded by mere shills &amp; trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the 9/11 and conspiracy subs are attacked with posts like "convince me" and then the shills &amp; trolls try to shoot down everything a truther offers - but it's not to convince the truther. They'll also post outrageous theories in the subs to make the sub appear populated by a bunch of gullible foil hats willing to bandwagon any "conspiracy" no matter how absurd. The goal isn't to suppress current people convinced the official 9/11 story is bullshit. It is to stop the "infection" of more people who historically have never questioned 9/11 but who are recently hearing about 9/11 truth as it rises enough above the background noise to make them curious if it has any merit. Since they were never the type to question it on their own before now, the goal is to introduce uncertainty, doubt, &amp; ridicule and to reinforce the official story to stop as many as they can at the "front door" before they accumulate sufficient skepticism to look into it further.

       It can be quite easily argued that the current administration exists despite (((them))). He's documented to have received 90% negative press from the moment he announced he's running and his own party plotted against him to keep him out (Trump isn't an ideologue by nature so the whole left vs right thing falls blank on him.) The GOP did everything they could to stop him just shy of rigging the elections, which is what the DNC did for Hillary. Hell this whole Russia thing was started by his own party in collusion with the left. The elites were genuinely shocked when he won.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all the gutting he's doing and programs he's started as it relates to things (((they))) want. He's getting prison reform done, he cut the globalist programs, he's taking a dagger to welfare, he's trying to rebuild America's industry to get people put of service jobs and back into the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he works for (((them))) it's a greater conspiracy as to why they'd wreck 50 years of their own progress than it is that he's beating them.

       I see this as a healthy diversity of opinion. When people are using their brains and thinking for themselves, they always head in different directions.

       When you see the whole herd running in the same direction, that's not people thinking for themselves... it's a stampede.
