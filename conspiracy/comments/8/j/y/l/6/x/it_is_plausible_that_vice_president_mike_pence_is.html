<p>Remember, Pence was foisted upon Trump, not the other way around. And what does Pence gain by doing this? He has the potential to become President and can also help ensure that the RNC establishment is protected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen, I don&#39;t like Trump at all and believe he is deeply unqualified to be the President. I also know that Mitt Romney was the leader of the establishment RNC not long before Trump won the Primary. In that context, it makes absolute sense that they would help Trump select his own Brutus that would conspire to politically assassinate Trump. You have small groups of both Democrats and Republicans involved in setting Trump up for surveillance. </p>

<p>Someone tell me any evidence that could exclude Pence from being involved in this. It&#39;s a fascinating exercise in what looks like a modern day Caesar being taken down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true...but does not necessarily mean Strzok and Page were the only ones cooking up an insurance plan.</p>

<p>McCain was there at the beginning...with the Dossier. He would also have way more contact with people who have more contact with Pence.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say Jeb Bush, McCain and anyone else on the list of primary losers hooked up with certain power players on the democrats side...(easy to do, they&#39;ve been doing business with each other for 20 or more years.)</p>

<p>Think about the Senate committees...and think about the ties to the intelligence agencies through certain committees..say the one that McCain chairs...</p>

<p>Hey John, do you really think that we could survive a Trump presidency in the unlikely event he wins the Republican nomination and goes on to win the election? I mean, it&#39;s not going to happen, but we&#39;re putting together a contingency plan just in case. Want to talk about it? </p>

This whole fantasy would require Russia to be in on it either with Trump or with the &quot;secret cabal of presidential losers&quot; that your proposing in your conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>But this doesn&#39;t explain the &quot;Russian collusion&quot; narrative that started in March of 2016 when young George Papadopoulos was hired by Clovis in the campaign and then he was immediately contacted by a Russian professor who claimed to have copies of Hillary Clinton&#39;s emails. You don&#39;t find that convenient? And Clovis encouraged the young guy to fly to Russia and meet with leaders over there?

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting thought, and very possible. I almost wonder if itâ€™s irrelevant who is leaking though by this point. Trump will either win re-election on the back of a fiercely loyal base, or he lost it just by being elected in the first place. What trump does is irrelevant to his base. What trump does is irrelevant to his detractors. At this point the electoral college votes are already decided honestly. But I do like your thought process and it certainly makes sense </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I believe the insurance policy spoken of was in the event Trump got elected, that the established government get a VP on the ticket to provide eyes and ears to Trump&#39;s discussions so that leaks could be released to the public for elected officials to call for his impeachment.

<p>I simply think that 90% of his base will never abandon him. The next election will come down to his 10% that may consider it. His bad will show up and vote and itâ€™s very possible his opponentâ€™s base wonâ€™t. Itâ€™ll be a fun one for sure!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are we trying to argue that Trump hasn&#39;t broken the law or just that the intelligence community and state knew he was corrupt and started to infiltrate his team once he had the nomination so that they could hold him accountable should he win the election?
