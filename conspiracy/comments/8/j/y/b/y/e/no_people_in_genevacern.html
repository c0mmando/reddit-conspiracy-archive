    <div class="md"><p>This was about 10 years ago, but yes I&#39;m well aware of the frightening capabilities of Google Assistant as well as the Adobe programs demonstrated several years ago. </p>

<p>In most cases, I worked with remarkably hardworking, dedicated and brilliant people who were grossly underpaid for what they were accomplishing. There are other laboratories working on identical or similar projects to CERN as well.</p>

<p>For what you say to be true, everyone I conference called with would need to be fake, but also all my colleagues would need to be actors/holograms, and all the projects I worked on would have to be digitally/surgically implanted memories.</p>

Like the other guy here said... are you implying that not only is our entire faculty lying to us but our extremely no fucks given proffessor just fucks off once every few months to partake in this weird scenario. are you implying we built this extremely expencive device which actively produces research btw and left it empty so people could fake conference calls for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Ive said it once and I will say it again. Enough with this bullshit. There are real conspiracies having real effect on real people every day of their life. And meanwhile youre here debating if cern is empty or not like a bunch of asshats. You are part of the bloody conspiracy conspiracy and you dont even know it. How is everyone supposed to accept the truth when this bs is giving the word conspiracy such a horrid reputation.</p>
