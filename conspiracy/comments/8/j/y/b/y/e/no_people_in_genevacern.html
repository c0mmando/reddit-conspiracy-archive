       I don't have any links, but if what you're claiming is true, I've participated in dozens of fabricated video conference calls. Without sounding immediately dismissive, I'm not too inclined to believe this one.

       I'm specifically looking for links but thanks. May I suggest you do some research into what Google Assistant is capable of now. Did you know AI can create people? That live video can be edited in real time? Not saying this happened during your conference calls, but it will be possible in the near future and probably already is.

       This was about 10 years ago, but yes I'm well aware of the frightening capabilities of Google Assistant as well as the Adobe programs demonstrated several years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most cases, I worked with remarkably hardworking, dedicated and brilliant people who were grossly underpaid for what they were accomplishing. There are other laboratories working on identical or similar projects to CERN as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what you say to be true, everyone I conference called with would need to be fake, but also all my colleagues would need to be actors/holograms, and all the projects I worked on would have to be digitally/surgically implanted memories.

       I didn't realize it wasn't so cut and dry from the sound of the original post. Again, didn't mean to sound so dismissive but clearly I have a hard time wrapping my mind around the notion that those projects are fabricated when they make the progress they make. Apologies if it appeared in was railroading you however

       I'm not saying that anything is fabricated. All I remember is the videos had day and night CCTV footage of Geneva with very little activity from people. There were cars yes. But not many. And I have tried to find them. They may have been erased from the web but not my memory, so figured I would ask if anyone else knew. Thanks for the back and forth.

       The post itself (before the edit) did make the claim that no one was there. I didn't know he meant very few people as opposed to "no one." I do see your point however.

       Wasn't my intention to dismiss so much as it was to offer the most informed response I could given my work history and understanding of the fundaments of some of the projects being conducted therein.

       It's really all about compartmentalization. Those people you talked to, very well could've been real and working on "something" and progress with the "something", however, the end goal may not actually exist or may be something completely different. Best example of this, would be Atomic City, during the 50's.

       Dont gimme that shit man. Like the other guy here said... are you implying that not only is our entire faculty lying to us but our extremely no fucks given proffessor just fucks off once every few months to partake in this weird scenario. are you implying we built this extremely expencive device which actively produces research btw and left it empty so people could fake conference calls for whatever reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive said it once and I will say it again. Enough with this bullshit. There are real conspiracies having real effect on real people every day of their life. And meanwhile youre here debating if cern is empty or not like a bunch of asshats. You are part of the bloody conspiracy conspiracy and you dont even know it. How is everyone supposed to accept the truth when this bs is giving the word conspiracy such a horrid reputation.

       You seem upset. You should spend more time in the world. Conspiracy already has a negative connotation, what we say or do on this sub will not change that. And I didn't mean literally no people. See the edit. Calm down. Even if I was some type of shill this reaction does more harm than good.

       I visited CERN when i was in Geneva back in 2000.  It's a nice city, and certainly has people in it.  The CERN facility was giving tours at the time, and there weren't very many people there, but there were people.

       I didn't realize it wasn't so cut and dry from the sound of the original post. Again, didn't mean to sound so dismissive but clearly I have a hard time wrapping my mind around the notion that those projects are fabricated when they make the progress they make. Apologies if it appeared in was railroading you however

       Please consider this an aside as opposed to malicious forum sliding, but a Total Recall world is not a world in which I'd like to live. Saw on the front page yesterday or the day before that the procedure was successfully performed on slugs(or snails maybe?).
