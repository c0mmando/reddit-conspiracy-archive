    <div class="md"><p>Fomenkoists would call Rome a place holder word so they think that when mainstream historians discuss ancient rome they are to narrow in their definition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>, according to Fomenko the word &quot;Rome&quot; is a placeholder and can signify any one of several different cities and kingdoms. He claims the &quot;First Rome&quot; or &quot;Ancient Rome&quot; or &quot;Mizraim&quot; is an ancient Egyptian kingdom in the delta of the Nile with its capital in Alexandria. The second and most famous &quot;New Rome&quot; is Constantinople. The third &quot;Rome&quot; is constituted by three different cities: Constantinople (again), Rome in Italy, and Moscow. According to his claims, Rome in Italy was founded around AD 1380 by Aeneas and Moscow as the third Rome was the capital of the great &quot;Russian Horde&quot;.[22]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chronology_(Fomenko)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Chronology_(Fomenko)</a></p>

<p>Fomenko thinks jesus was a reformer king.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fomenko claims that the most probable prototype of the historical Jesus was Andronikos I Komnenos (allegedly AD 1152 to 1185), the emperor of Byzantium, known for his failed reforms; his traits and deeds reflected in &#39;biographies&#39; of many real and imaginary persons.[19] The historical Jesus is a composite figure and reflection of the Old-Testament prophet Elisha (850–800 BC?), Pope Gregory VII (1020?–1085), Saint Basil of Caesarea (330–379), and even Li Yuanhao (also known as Emperor Jingzong or &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; - emperor of Western Xia, who reigned in 1032–48), Euclides, Bacchus and Dionysius. Fomenko explains the seemingly vast differences in the biographies of these figures as resulting from difference in languages, points of view and time-frame of the authors of said accounts and biographies. He claims that the historical Jesus may have been born in 1152 and was crucified around AD 1185 on the Joshua&#39;s Hill, overlooking the Bosphorus.[20]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>now i&#39;m not a strict fomenkoist i take the historical manipulation beyond the 17th century but he&#39;s a good place to get a grasp on how messed up history is in general.</p>

<p>here is a good outline</p>

<p>Why do Egyptians thrones always have four cat legs as the legs of the throne.</p>

<p>It was symbolic of being able to overcome and control the cats. Look what happened to Egypt after that...</p>

<p>I know..you&#39;re going to say..&quot;but Egyptians portrayed cats as gods&quot;...and I say &quot;the victor writes the history...every single time&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to Seattle about 5 years ago with my wife and kids. We took the Pacific Coastliner up there. I was coming down off of heroin because at the time, I was addicted. (I’ve been clean 2 1/2 years now. )</p>

<p>We rented a car once we got to Portland and drove to Seattle from there.</p>

<p>Our first stop was Kurt Cobain’s house. It was in a really nice neighborhood next to the beach with big beautiful houses. </p>

<p>Kurt’s house has a tall wall around it and it’s right next to a little park. There’s a bench in the park where people from all over leave notes and pictures and various mementos. Someone left a Lego version of Kurt Cobain (which I wanted to steal but didn’t want the bad karma). </p>

<p>I took some pictures of the bench and the park. Took a few in front of the house and then we walked over to this little beach that was right a crossed the street from his house.</p>

<p>We sat there and enjoyed the view that I imagined Kurt enjoyed from that same spot.</p>

<p>When we were getting ready to leave, we got in the rental, turned the key and heart shaped box was randomly playing on the radio.</p>

<p>That was strange.</p>

<p>We headed into Seattle and our next stop was the Music Experience in downtown near the Space Needle. Coincidentally, they were having a Kurt Cobain / Nirvana exhibit. Neither of us knew that was there.</p>

<p>But the strangest part, was when I got back to California, I was looking through the pictures from the trip and one of the pictures I took of the memorial bench had a picture of all of the members of the band but Kurt’s face was black. Like it was turned inside out. I don’t remember it looking that way in person but in the photo it looked like a black hole where his face should have been.</p>

<p>I’ll try and remember to upload the picture and link it. It gave me the chills the first time I saw it.</p>

<p>Also, Courtney had Kurt murdered. He was planning to divorce her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The modern otaku-esque anime industry is an experiment by the Japanese government. The Japanese have a history of experimenting on their own people during WW2 and anime is the latest experiment. They wanted to originally somehow weaken and reduce the populations of their enemies. They have experienced population decline despite having a nationalist government while they let the anime industry boom. They see it working well in their own country and it continues to become more prominent in the west.</p>

<p>They use the most unrealistic and over-sexualized designs on female characters and animate some of the weirdest type of scenes that you would probably never see even in the likes of Family Guy or even South Park. They introduce weird types of fetishes that had never even existed and even go as far as sexualizing under-age girls in the anime that is produced. The audience can never experience these types of situations in real life, so they continuously consume anime and hentai to satisfy their idealism. It raises their standards to unprecedented levels and makes it so that even some of the most beautiful IRL people don&#39;t make them feel a thing, making them return back to watching anime and hentai.</p>

<p>The Muslims don&#39;t tolerate this kind of crap in their culture so that&#39;s why they don&#39;t suffer from this kind of issue.</p>

<p>Not really a &quot;non-political&quot; conspiracy I guess, but not quite worth taking seriously either.</p>

<p>We may not leave reality (while alive) and if we were a simulation program on a computer, we could not leave that computer.</p>

<p>That entire theory falls to absurdity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres a lot of fuckery going on with Instagram models. They have to fuck a photographer to get pictures. It’s all consensual but there will be a monster who will arise from this. Also I’ve been following dj akademiks and his journey from YouTuber to being apart of the media. He drops bombs a lot saying how easy it is for the media to craft a narrative in the music industry which is telling since it’s a smaller industry so the media surrounding it is more willing to take bribes. Not only that but drake may have connections with mafia, he apparently makes people “disappear”. </p>
