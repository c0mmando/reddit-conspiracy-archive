<p><a href="https://archive.is/3cyhK"><strong>When Kerry Was Kohn: The Jewish Roots of John Kerry</strong></a></p>

<ul>
<li><em>The new nominee for secretary of state</em> <strong><em>only found out about his Jewish grandfather</em></strong> <em>while running in the 2004 presidential election.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>(Yeah. Rrrright!)</p>

<p>Kerry is a direct descendant of the infamous Kabbalist/ sorcerer/ Magician Yehudah Loew, the Maharal of Prague (1512-1609)</p>

<p>JBuff .com </p>

<p><a href="http://jbuff.com/c090204.htm"><strong>Rabbi Loew &amp; His Descendants</strong></a></p>

<p>Quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because of his immense learning and courageous defense of the Jewish people against the usual enemies, many legends arose concerning the Maharal. Rabbi Loew was said to have created a GOLEM. A GOLEM is a monster created by humans. The Czech word for GOLEM is Roboto, from which we derive the word robot. The best known GOLEM story in English is the story of Dr. Frankenstein, written by Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (daughter of the novelist Mary Wollstonecraft), when she and her husband Percy Shelley visited Switzerland in the company of Lord Byron in 1816.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[...]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rabbi Yehuda Loew’s father, Bezalel Loeb, had four sons. One of his sons was Sinai Loew. He in turn had a descendant, Josefina Loew, who became the grandmother of Ida Loew. She married Fritz Kohn, a native of Moravia. <strong><em>The Kohns immigrated to Boston, Massachusetts in 1905. Before coming to the United States they changed their name to Kerry and converted to Catholicism.</em></strong> Their son, Richard Kerry, then became the <strong><em>father of Senator John Kerry</em></strong>, the current Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the United States.</p>

<p><strong><em>Like so many other non-Jewish descendants of Jews, Kerry tried for years to hide his Jewish ancestry, claiming to be of Irish descent. He even said on the floor of the U.S. Senate, “those of us, fortunate to be of Irish ancestry”, etc.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some pics of the (creepy) statue of John <del>Kohn</del> Kerry&#39;s famous ancestor (Prague)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s examine this story by applying some simple logic, and see what we find.</p>

<p>Cui bono; who benefits?</p>

<p>How would it benefit the Iranians to expose politicians and diplomats from the Obama administration who corruptly accommodated them to give them a sweet deal allowing them to covertly continue their nuclear program?</p>

<p>Answer? It would not benefit them at all. It would hurt them by showing the world  that the deal was arrived at through illegitimate means to the favor of Iran.</p>

<p>So who would such exposure benefit?</p>

<p>Answer: Trump, Israel and the Saudis.</p>

<p>Conclusion:This story is almost certainly made up bullshit planted by an Israeli intelligence agency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, the link you just provided doesn&#39;t provide a source or another journalism outfit claiming that anyone official in Iran said anything like this. </p>

<p>You&#39;re just linking back to a claim made by the same writer for the Jerusalem Post, which isn&#39;t exactly an impartial source.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if such an incendiary statement was made by an Iranian government official, I&#39;m sure someone else in the Western media, aside from only an Israeli journalism outlet. </p>

<p>I agree. But this particular article is pretty clear. The quote came from 
<strong>Mohammad Javad Zarif, H.J.Ansari Zarif’s senior advisor</strong></p>

<p>I do not think the Jerusalem Post is objective, by any measure, but unless there is a reason to believe that Mr. Zarif did not say this (like him denying it), then relying on the testimony of the person who (apparently) heard him say it, is all we have.</p>

<p>I throw it back to you. It is such an incendiary statement, if Mr. Zarif did not say it there should be at least a denial. Have you been able to find anything?</p>
