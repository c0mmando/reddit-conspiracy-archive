        This video

       is a good place to start for more information about Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Qanon's emergence in October of 2017, Alex Jones appeared to downplay the phenomenon and instead tried to push his own "Q" (named "Zak"). According to supporters of Q, when this approach failed to gain traction, InfoWars enlisted the help of conspiracy veteran Jerome Corsi to "discredit" Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory is summarized in

       Alex jones has done more in the past year let alone half of his life for the freedom movememt. The man is a traget of GEORGE SOROS, Hillary called him out by name and Obama has. Alex has risked a lot and has done more than Q TARD. So lay off of the guy. No doubt hes jealous about having some cheesy insider Zack that all his listeners know is FULL OF SH*T

       Alex Jones is a hack whose loyalty lies with whatever will fatten up his paycheck.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for getting Trump elected, he was just a useful idiot. He thought he had it made since he was able to talk to Trump, went all in on the guy, and as soon as Trump won he had no use for Jones anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jones made a video of him fake crying over Trump being "compromised by the deep state" and literally includes the fact that he doesn't call him anymore.

       The guy is a piece of human trash, and I hope he loses ALL of the money that he has sucked from the gullible mouth breathers that believe his acting, and buy his snake oil. Sure, he should have a voice, this is America after all, but freedom of speech is not freedom of consequence. If he truly is the “patriot” he claims he is, he can broadcast on am radio, or ham radio, or whatever, if he is relieved of all the money he has made on the backs of false accusations and unproven conspiracies.
       <br/>
       And Q, LOL, the need that these inbred moron Trump sycophants to LARP is truly incredible. I am so surprised that the Jones contingent and the Q contingent are not forming like voltron to have crazy, stupid, incel, Jordan Peterson, red pill/mens right’s, non PC, kek babies, you know......for libtard tears...

       Nah not really. I think meme wars is where it's at for now. Zognald Trump at the very least disrupted the radical alt-right Fascist's plans for a bit, while simultaneously enraging then even more and making them grow in numbers, and tbat has caused far-right folks to grow in massive numbers as well as a reaction, so we've stepped into a sped up version of one side or the other rising to power in Gov in a crazy fashion that equals Sesame credit, censorship, illegal to criticize Israel like just passed in South Carolina, spread of radical Islam, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit is going to reach pique flash point by the time Zognald gets his 8 hears wrapped up

       A discussion can't hurt imho. I honestly doubt he is legitimate, yet I have to also honestly say that I have never really looked into the whole thing deeply enough to have a good unbiased in depth opinion on the subject. The r/greatawakening sub (where they talk about Q) turned me off of it to be honest, because it in many cases (not by all users, I digress) was filled with mindless Trump worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume the reason this is being discussed is simply because a lot of people believe it and are talking about it. I mean that sub alone has a huge amount of subs for a relatively new subreddit.

       A ban for that may be a bit much, but if you've read this thread, it does have its rules. It's a no meta thread and for a reason - so it doesn't devolve into discussions like this that lead to nowhere and are unrelated to the subject at hand. Your comment should have been posted on the stickied comment, as per the rules of the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I think a ban is too harsh for this, but your comment was rightly removed because it wasn't posted under the stickied comment (as it was meta territory).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also best to state your mind about Q rather than attack the mods. If you think Q is a LARP, then you can say so and discuss it freely without moving into meta territory.

        One of the things I would say about Q: If Q is a LARP, a phony, he has never drawn attention to himself. He's always said don't glorify us. We work for you. Most of the people that I know who are LARPS and phonies, they want attention. They want to take the glory. They want to be seen as Important and smart. q as never wanted to take the glory for anything. He always points to others. He has thanked the anons. He has asked people to pray for the anons, to pray for the president. He's never drawn attention to himself...I could go on for days about the proofs that Q anon has posted hundreds them. But you know, more than the proofs, looking at Q's posts and getting Q's information has helped me interpret the news, interpret world events on the global stage. Q has helped me understand what the plan is, the big picture plan...I find it kind of fun to follow Q and to do the research. It's interesting to me. What it really does is it gives me hope. It gives me hope that their is a plan to end all these wars. There is a plan to end corruption. There's a plan to prosecute bad people.

       While that is all fine and good, it does nobody any good if the population is simply waiting for a "big plan" to unfold while remaining pacified, without actively spreading awareness and finding ways to make our society better and less corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether Q is legit or not, whether there is some plan to end it all or not, the dangerous part here is that many people will use Q as an excuse to do nothing and just watch as events unfold, thinking it's all "under control" and everything will "turn out alright", when that could very easily not be the case at all, especially not without the participation of all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I wrote in another thread on CST that also discussed Q as well as the hope and fear that come with it - in my view, both fear and hope trap us and bind us, often making us passive. For fear it's obvious enough, but people generally see hope as a positive thing. As the great Zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh spoke - hope again keeps us in the future, and away from the present.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can allow ourselves to have some hope in order to get back on to a lighter road from even darker states of mind, but ultimately even hope must be let go of. In hope we are letting go of our powers as the creators of our destiny, personally and collectively, for all of us. We are also focusing on an imagined mental image of a future where salvation will arrive. But that salvation can only be present now. The deepest salvation is there when time is dropped, both past and future, fully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly you drop both past and future and your life becomes better, your intuition sharper, your choices superior as a result. You slowly come to greater peace, compassion, joy. But all of this comes from letting go of what is in the past and future, including hope. This then gradually (or quickly for some) leads to freedom and peace, as well as better, more harmonious life (and globally, society).

       People really still believe that Alex is owned by some Saudi prince because he liked the name Genesis? That was laughable 10 years ago when I first heard about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took about 30 seconds to look up the incorporation of GCN and see it had no relation.

       I don't know, man, sure seems like they're shoring up all military, defense, intelligence, political, media, and corporate arms in preparation for a coup.  I see about as much successful pushback as The Occupy movement.  It's gonna be ugly, for sure, but history tends to favor the least ethical side.

       I think users here should really start giving some thought to where they're posting and who is running the subreddit. For starters, mods should not sticky their own personal conspiracy stuff. This should be a given and any mod with any sense would know this. If you'd like an example why: we already had a mod which did this and literally generated revenue by people clicking the links. Nevermind the last mod noms turned out to be a total farce, with the mods choosing people from their own list and in contradiction to the  votes they asked users to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, in this case, we have a mod promoting QAnon and Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       QAnon, to anyone with any sense, is a crock of shit. Their 'info' are literally keywords from conspiracies dating back to +10 years ago. Nothing gets proven. No secret info revealed. This has been the case from Day 1 and
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       wised up about it and stopped posting about this wild goose chase. But now we have a mod pushing QAnon. Yeah nah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones admitted in court that Infowars is 100% entertainment. Again, like QAnon, it's all hot words and big claims and a big show but zero results. Keep in mind this man harasses the families who had their children killed in a mass shooting. Absolute scum and this subreddit should not be directing users to this man, especially a moderator!
      </p>
      <p>
       The sub this mod has linked to supports Donald Trump and seems to have the same kind of cult-dazed bizareness as the_donald has including the random capitalisation of words which all follow similar themes of religion, freedom and military:
      </p>
      <p>
       In their rules:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        AMERICA WILL BE UNIFIED AGAIN! 
Please PRAY for those who would lay down their lives to protect our FREEDOM.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Thread titles which the same capitalisation and the same off-hand remarks in caps like the_donald (see the third example):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That's a lot of big guns to take down a mere LARP!
        <br/>
        Reeeeee
        <br/>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also, the majority of the users in that subreddit only post to that subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't look at all this and point to conspiracy but I sincerely hope people here apply some critical thinking about what this mod has posted and why.

       Jerome Corsi pushed qanon hard on the cbts sub. Not sure where the idea of him being anti q in October came from.  He was analyzing q drops for months.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that whoever is behind qanon had a disagreement with Corsi about monetization. Hence the fallout

       Corsi flipped after Q post 1295, which was a non-specific warning regarding factions taking advantage and shepherding.  The pattern in Q's messaging is to be loyal to patriotic principles,  not parties or personalities.

       Q referenced a user on a Q sub to explain, essentially. In short:  Corsi is an extension of whatever faction Alex Jones is in.  Listening to Corsi led you to Jones.

       Which is crazy, because many of their predictions have come true in the past few months, so it really shouldn't be dying down. The conspiracy community is enthralled with Q throughout the internet...except for here. That should tell you something.

       So pointing out that Qanon was pretty popular but not anymore without extensive sources is now mudslinging. As one of the most active users and top mods on r/conspiracy, it must be hard to pretend that you weren't aware of the massive surge in Qanon followers and posts here half a year ago.

       Q anon is an psy-op. When people start predicting dates (11/11) I get off the bandwagon. If you have been involved in the conspiracy community long enough you should know that this has happened hundreds of times before. But enjoy your giant disappointment on 11/11/18.

       It's important to elaborate on how it's a psyop as well. What is the ultimate purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, from what I'm seeing, it benefits the elite that our culture is vastly divided on the issue. Some think it's real and will passionately defend it out of a desperation for a savior or some kind of hope, and the rest of us just want to help others understand that they are being "played" and tricked into following a false prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also seems to generate a "cult-like" support for the current administration and the POTUS, which benefits the establishment because they are essentially converting conspiracy theorists into rabid defenders of the government. This tells me the establishment is having trouble keeping the masses supporting their puppet president, so they have to find a clever way to "recruit" new followers, or else we could all unite under skepticism/rejection of the POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all a charade, and I'm glad people are finally seeing past it, but I think at this time we can just stop talking about it and it will hopefully fade into background noise.

       My guess is that the psyop is directed towards conspiracy "researchers" to redirect them from looking too deeply into Trump's activities with a skeptical eye. You're right about the cult-like support which seems to be largely faith-based.

       Furthermore, this information really started to gain traction right around the time that Backpage and Craigslist's personal section was shut down. They were shut down to combat human trafficking, which probably was happening, but QAnon I think was created to create support for this action.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pimps and brothels will still exist, and if anything you could say shutting down those sites actually benefits the wealthy brothel owners who are now back in the driver's seat of the sex trade.

       That was done primarily to stop pedophile and trafficking transactions which is not something people go down to the local brothel to conduct.

       That's true. But I think there's a calculus of the lesser of two evils. Also, I think local LEOs can deal with brothels in whatever way the community deems appropriate, whereas the kind of international cabal behind these big syndicates is really beyond their scope of operations.

       I guarantee there will be no disappointment if nothing of import happens on 11/11, either because some minor event (after the midterms???) will happen that believers will latch on to, or any believers will conveniently forget or deny 11/11 was ever a serious prediction, despite being pushed into the sidebar of their sub.

       That date is Veteran's Day and the day of Trump's big military parade in D.C. It's been known for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Q (or his fans) is correct in "predicting" that "something big" happens on that date. The problem is that it's not really hard to predict it, since it's public knowledge anyway. And the parade is nothing more than military fetishism. But I'm sure Q fans will love it.

       What they're saying is that by that date, the better part of the domestic portion of the Alliance operation against the deep state will have been completed, and will be publicly known--in time for Trump to survive the election, and in time for our returning military to celebrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That isn't the date of some major victory in the war on corruption and the deep state. It's a marker for a turning point in our republic. Kind of the beginning of the long climb back from the meshugas that must happen between now and then, for which I'm sensibly strapped in with popcorn.

       Funny thing is Victory of the LARP, a related person (which had a whole shitstorm back April last year) and butt-buddy of QAnon kept saying that November 2017 was meant to be some game changing shit where "ayy lmaos" (Aliens) were meant to "BTFO" the Deep State back in November 2017 (and then February, then March, then April) and obviously now it's been updated to another fake prep date of 11/11/18.

       Alex Jones is a state sanctioned disinformation agent, and Q is a state sanctioned disinformation campaign. This fake "drama" between the two is more phony baloney bullshit to confuse us all and make us question who/what is "real" and who isn't.

       Yes, and there's much too little interpersonal interaction for that to be the case with Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, behind the "rabbit hole" revelations about the deep state, there's a focus to the rest of Q that is too rigid to work with that MO. The actual Alliance war we're witnessing exhibits FAR too much coordination to be international "business as usual." There is a REASON we're not all dead from WWIII right now, and it's not because Q is lying to us. It's FAR more likely that it's because Q is telling the truth, and there really is a last-ditch coalition of humanity against the evil overlords.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that possibility, I'm going to take a serious look at what might be a signal from within that operation letting the rest of us know how it's going.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really can't see why that's a problem. If it's just a LARP, humanity is circling the plughole anyhow, and we'll all be gone in a few years. Why not cheer for an Alliance against the Cabal?

       If someone is truly on the inside or has information they are not going to go all Nostradamus quatrains they are just going to post the information anomalously and move on never to be seen again under that tag for fear of being outed. Now someone who wants to be noticed and followed will do just the opposite, they will say very little except what their followers want to hear while simultaneously saying nothing. I put "Q" in the second category.

       Do you really find Q all that hard to understand? Or are you just stating an opinion based on second-hand experiences? No disrespect intended, I just want to know. Have you actually spent some time with it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it deliberately started with disinfo in order to drive away those who have thin skins for disinfo. That wasn't the ONLY reason for it--I believe it met other operational objectives too--but it was a good reason to begin on such a note.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you're willing to endure the disinfo (which I have to say has not been frequent), it's really not at all hard to understand.

       The autists on 8chan are actually helpful, if you're not bother by the adolescence of it all, and beyond that there's always good old internet search skills. And places like r/greatawakening/ where you can discuss the posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       For every objection my brain could come up with, there was a corresponding plausible answer, and in the end I'm left with the conclusion it might very well be the real deal, no matter how unlikely the idea might seem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also left with the realization that even if it's NOT what it claims to be, it's not any more harmful than any other

       I have spent more time then I should from the beginning. I truly believe it’s more than one person and each has different agendas. The originator imo is no longer posting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big predictions came and went with nothing happening. The many proof posts could easily be setup by individuals or small groups doing deep research and don’t require inside or secret knowledge. Other posts look like well crafted PR stunts from possible inside or connected players.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately it’s harmless except to those who are 100% sold on it as a source for news on “the deep state civil war.” The desire to see and believe and interpret coded messages can be harmful or could make certain people susceptible to programming. Hell if you need any proof of physiological control efforts like MK ultra look no farther. The level of group think is scary. Counter points are brushed off. Inconsistencies ignored. And blind faith to trust the plan or love your president. All of these are control methods to influence people. That’s the real conspiracy. I see it in the donald too. Not all the members or contributors but a good portion of them surrender rationale thought to group think. It’s scary as hell.

       IDK. I see pretty lively discussions in well-moderated groups, and surprisingly little "sacred" dogma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I think it's a bit unkind to the Q folk to tar them with the brush of some kind of special susceptibility vs. the general population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind control? Really? I haven't yet seen anybody start believing anything they didn't already believe in a general sense. People aren't being "transformed" by it, so where's the mind control?
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst case I can imagine in that regard would be "pacification." But I think if Trump were working in total opposition to the Q message, people would get pretty pissed, no matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't see the kind of motive or result I would associate with mind control, or cults, or any of that. No money at stake. I mean, what's the nefarious motive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, concern noted, but I'm still taking my chances there, and so far I'm not doing anything weird. LOL

       No doubt. It’s like group hypnosis. They are constantly reaffirming each other that they are right and in the high ground of a fake war. 
That’s why I liken it to mind control. They will not believe anything contrary to their ‘belief’ system. Not all of them but enough to be concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most diabolical part of this is that it has caught on enough at a high level that the administration can follow (not drive or control) and actually act on requests to re-affirm the fable. It’s like a magic card trick where both parties are in on it but never actually meet or talk beforehand. It’s super convincing when seen from the outside.

       Yea it didn't take me but 2 days to realize it was a mind control operation. They are making sure there are still blind Trump supporters when all the Mueller stuff comes out. I've been saying this forever. Trump will incite Civil War if he thinks he might be going down and now with the help of Q, they'll really think they're on the right side. I've been trying posting in there trying to get people to see that Trump is what he appears to be. I've gotten some people to listen and the ones who try and debate me, they don't last very long. I have EXTENSIVE knowledge about Trump and his supporters because of my childhood. My father is basically the archetype Trump supporter. A paranoid, narcissistic authoritarian and I was his scapegoat that refused to blindly take his abuse. I learned everything about his psychology and his belief system. In a weird way, I feel like I've been preparing my whole life for this. I've been trying to expose Trump since before he won the primaries. This whole thing is so ironic to me. The right always thought that when the next America Civil War happened, they'd be fighting against a corrupt government. Instead, they'll be fighting to maintain one. I believe in the dark forces Q talks about but Trump leading that movement is a total misdirect. The forces behind getting Trump elected are actually fucking genius. They used Obama as a red herring and the arrogance and hatred of the religious right to put in Trump right under their noses.

       Ok guys, I've been quiet around here for a while but I gotta chime in here.   I've been there since day 1 of Q's appearance, and quite frankly, I don't see how anyone takes him seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason so many people are infactuated with Q is that he has been keenly predictive in many instances, like Trump's tweets and such.  But it's these little coincidences that are blinding you to the truth.  NONE OF HIS MAJOR PREDICTIONS HAVE EVER COME TRUE.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Q, Hillary should be in jail by now, a militia should have risen against Antifa, the 1000+ plus sealed indictments should have had every deep state member in jail, and patriots should have full control of the govt by now....  Do you guys even remember "the 4th"?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I won't even get in to the cryptic messages he started sending about 6 months ago.  Do you remember at first he would speak in coherent sentences?  Then he resorted to &gt;&gt;P Alpha, they speak &gt;&gt;11/11 day of reckoning &gt;&gt;F needs to be brought down, Country In Arms is on our side.

       I too was there from day 1. Shit was intoxicating, esp due to proximity to the LV shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The longer it went on, the less sense it made. And now it's just an entire subculture of its own. There are Q beginner vids, entire online ecosystems of information (and some ad money) "explaining" this thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally none of the "predictions" happened. There was always a ton of confusion as to wether Q said the thing that was in the tweet first, or if the tweet came first. I would see the same "voices" I continue to see promote the whole thing sharing screenshots with fucked up time zones, and all kinds of rationalizing of the timeline despite anything being definitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there it took off and became literally bolsheviks 2.0, or Brownshirts 2.0... would not be surprised if tptb are setting up the well intentioned q cult to be the arbiter of the next global bogeyman.

       Huh? Are you arguing that when you upvote it, it should show a score of "1"? That's not how Reddit works, there are no negative post scores. This post has way more downvotes than upvotes, so it's going to show a zero unless and until it gets a net positive number of votes.

       Well if you go back, Q did make some predictions with dates about stuff like this, but none of those predictions came true. But nowadays it’s so cryptic that’s it’s impossible to tell what he means at all, if there even is a meaning.

       Q has also posted that disinfo is necessary, and the posts are just as much for the opposition as it is for "patriots."  The 11-11 date is a marker for a phase change--  most believe it will be when our country starts to unite. Q is a psyop, aimed at a specific portion of the community:  those who love/support the Constitution and consider democratic transfer of power to be sacred.  If you don't believe there is a "swamp establishment" and problems with corruption in our country, then Q isn't for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Common themes that Q pushes is to 'Define Patriot', "unite," and "Pray."  I'm on the Q subs and TD, and Q hooked me when I started seeing the intent of the psyop... to trigger an awakening and guide pro-Trump memetics, all grounded on preserving the Constitution.   Once again,  if you think Trump is the source of corruption, then the psyop's aim is to convince you there is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a sticky on a Q sub lately that was saying 'thank you' to Q debunkers. I was fooled by WMD narratives during the Bush years.   I wish I would have listened to the anti-war crowd, they were right!  In today's media narrative environment there is so much propaganda, and Trump's pattern has been to not be Jeb!  Trump fights fire with fire, aggressively so.  It makes sense that a faction in Trump's military is attempting to mount a response to globalist narratives.  If you hate the Trump agenda  (that's ok), then seeing Q as a total liar is expected.  Insults don't work on Trump supporters though.  For me personally,  I need to see your solutions to problems without emotion to have my mind changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly,  Q is just another human faction, another voice in the noise.  I don't let Q affect me too much, except,  admittedly,  my thirst and hope for justice/unity has increased tenfold due to Q.  Since the North Korean war has started to end, that thirst for peace is spreading.  I never thought this kind of peace was possible,  and I'm still pretty cynical, thanks to the WMD lies. See Q like reading those trashy celebrity gossip magazines,  except the subject is geopolitics.  I balance out Q by lurking on anti-Trump subs, and I'm always appreciative when logic is used to make arguments,  not just playing on emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump does seem to have a plan, and I believe Q is part of his strategy.  Q points us to not have allegiance to Trump though, but the Constitution that Trump took an oath to uphold.

       The thing that makes Q unbelievable is that he neither confirms or denies anything. The "research community" deciphers the babble to fit  whatever agenda is happening in the world based on who's this and what's that, or follow this, follow that. It would be a remarkable board game like monopoly, but this is real life. Say what you mean, and mean what you say is a much better approach to getting any kind of support. Giving cryptic messages while being anonymous is just too unbelievable to be real.

       There has to be some feedback loop though, even if it's abstract.  If you believe Q is a hoax of some kind, Q is writing things that it believes will appeal to it's target.  Q would then monitor response from the community, see what gains traction and what doesn't.  I agree though, the term cold reading doesn't apply, but it could be similar.

       I do agree that some kind of feedback is being given to whomever is involved. It also leaves me to wonder what the reaction is to that feedback from him/her/them. The places where Q has posted from are far from being known as the bastions of truth and justice. Yet, here we are.

       It works on vaguely similar principles, but scattershot prediction is even easier.  It "works" the same way astrological charts and nostradamus and the dark side of the moon matching up with the wizard of oz "work".  If you throw a metric fuckton of vague gibberish at simpletons who desperately want to believe it's all true, they'll do all the legwork and make a bunch of tenuous connections after the fact.

       Actually Q answers most of "his" own questions within the same post or a nearby one. Also, "he" always confirms anon's correct answers by either re-posting their post, or the number of their post, frequently with elaboration.

       To be truthful anything that is not straight and to the point is just meaningless dribble to me. Their is no need for word games, unless you're playing word games. Especially on an anon site. Giving him choices of answers makes it even easier for him to keep the game going.

       That's understandable. It's not for all tastes or brain types. Doesn't have universal appeal. I don't think it's meant to.

       Here's this huge important issue that the public know nothing about, and the only way to.spread the word is to......not spread it.

       Well surely it helps for there to be
       <em>
        somebody
       </em>
       to act a seed group during and after the fact, with an awareness of what's happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were done in a mainstream way, there would be mass social unrest and perhaps panic. The intelligent and socially adept among us (and there are many) are helping to spread the word gently--first to people we know and trust, and then as awareness increases, anyplace we can have a civil conversation. Like here, it seems to me. You seem like a decent human being.

       You guys are being used as pawns. Q is using your hatred of the Clintons/Obama and your blind support for Trump to blind you to the real agenda. Don't you find it odd that Trump and Q literally hit ALL the checkmarks of the conspiratorial right wing christian conservative belief system? I grew up with a father who fit this exact archetype. Trump and Q hit every single box that it can't be just a coincidence. They are playing off of those blind beliefs and using them against you. Trump's entire campaign was constructed by people outside of himself. He didn't come up with half of that stuff.

       That might be an interesting theory if in doing so it was materially altering our viewpoint of anything. Given that it doesn't, I hardly see how what you're saying makes any sense at all.

       I'm dead serious though. I'm not trying to insult anyone. It's just the facts of the matter. Q is painting this as a battle between God and Satan essentially. Why wouldn't someone who believes they are on God's side and the evil forces are taking out God's soldier do something to try and stop it?

      <p>
       Awesome! I have been doing tons of research on QANON since last year and I wish I had some material prepared already to post but I'mma get my opinion out there with the time I have right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you read Qanon's posts, from the beginning, the first thing he talks about is an impending arrest of Hillary Clinton, among other figures, part of a series of broader actions taken against a network of corruption and treason against the US government. Called "The Storm".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, earlier in the month (October 2017) Trump made some mysterious comments to the press at the White House, saying “Do you know what this represents? I don’t know. Maybe it’s the calm before the storm. Could be the calm. The calm before the storm.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting some clarification on what exactly those comments meant made the chans pretty excited, and even though the supposed day of Hillary’s arrest came and went without an arrest, Q was back online the next day unfased and continued to post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early on, his posts contained some very interesting things. There was the discussion of Saudi Arabia being players in the game just before King Salman arrested his adversaries, including Prince AlTalwalib, an alleged source of financing for Hillary, in what is now known as the Saudi Purge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I jump into specific instances that may or may not validate Q as a real Q clearance insider, as opposed to being a LARP, let me paint the picture that Q presents through his cryptic, socratic questioning type communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Q, the United States government and power structures all around the world have been infiltrated by a cabal that practices black magic and runs organized crime syndicates. He refers to individuals from the cabal as black hats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, personally, I’ve been on board with the above statement for some time now. And one of the main reasons some people dismiss Q immediately is because they think the idea of a cabal is insane. To those people, I borrow a phrase from Q, expand your thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a second reason why some people immediately dismiss Q, and that is because Q refers to himself and Team Trump as white hats (also referred to as Wizards and Warlocks), altruistic crusaders for the freeing of humanity who will lead us into a new Golden Age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, personally, I find this idea much more difficult to accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a slight digression, there are three possible conclusions we can make about Q at this point. One, that he is a LARP and is doing it for fun, two, that he is telling the truth and is a white hat, or three, he represents a competing black hat faction and is running a PSYOP to gain support for the actions that will be undertaken during The Storm. (A fourth possible choice, that Q is a PSYOP for one monolithic cabal, aka CIA disinfo or something like that, I personally don’t think is valid because the deep state civil war is real and, at least at the lower levels, the cabal is not a monolithic entity).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok back to the picture Q is painting. We are currently in the calm, where we can see actions such as hundreds of politicians and businessmen are resigning from prominent positions, a massive and growing pile of sealed indictments are on Sessions desk, reshuffling at nearly every major agency on multiple levels, all as Team Trump prepare to take action. This action, The Storm will be a massive series of arrests of high profile people, allegedly all connected to a global network of bribery, blackmail, corruption, and crimes as sick as child trafficking. National guard will be already active in major cities to keep a lid on the protesting that will occur and the marine corp will help with high level targets. Because the justice system is too corrupt from cabal-sponsored presidents stacking the courts, all will be tried as enemy combatants in military courts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to this, Q paints a picture of a deep state civil war going on behind the scenes, which Q is on the forefront of fighting. There are a lot of interesting explanations of what is going on behind the scenes than you will hear in the media. For example, Q heavily implied that Trumps aerial strikes in Syria were against CIA and Iranian targets, in coordination with and not in contrast to Russia. They claim that the gang MS-13 is being used for assassinations, such as with Seth Rich, and to commit other crimes but still have plausible deniability. Q accurately predicted a large amount of politicians resigning at least 10 days before the media started reporting on it, saying that they had been “put into submission.”
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Q, the CIA owned North Korea until Trump cut the strings. Now Un seems so eager for peace because he is free from the cabal to do as he wishes. Iran is next (he actually predicted both the North Korea peace and the nixing of the Iran deal a month before each happened), and apparently the Iran deal was tied with the Uranium 1 scandal, and that an Iranian nuclear weapons program was functioning in syria with the awareness of top western officials, who wanted to use Iranian nukes to be able to take other countries hostage or to leak out nukes with traceable uranium signatures to take out who they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       He will not say if Mueller is a white hat or a black hat but has pointed us in the direction of IG Horowitz, who is doing his own investigation that will expose election fraud and the Clinton foundation. There are also a few bombs that could be dropped onto the playing field at some point, specifically information from Weiners “security file” the NYPD found on his laptop, and also the alleged existence of a video of Hillary doing something illegal (with suggestions of its contents ranging from as mild as a tarmac meeting between Bill and Lynch to as dark as child abuse)
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, Q team has it all, thanks to Military Intelligence, and they are finding ways to get devastating evidence into the judicial system legally. This may involve ploys such as giving evidence to lawyer Cohen before the raid on his office. Trump has been preparing his office to have the power it needs during the storm, such as the executive order that gives Trump the power to freeze assets of criminals with crimes “against humanity”. This can be linked to the amount of billionaires who are donating massive amounts of their assets to registered charities.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Q would tell it, their team is winning bigly and the cabal is scared shitless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before judging the validity of all the above, lets look at some instances I really think eliminate conclusion 1 from above. I am not going to cite the specific q post or context for each of these things because I dont have the time at the moment, but thats good so people can look for themselves and then decide.
      </p>
      <p>
       * Calling the North Korean peace and the Iran deal being broken more than a month in advance. (“Iran is next” multiple times, and then there is indeed a massive policy and press shift towards Iran.
      </p>

       Ok. The rabbit hole for some of these, especially the possible coding of Trumps twitter, goes pretty deep. As u/axolotl_peyotl mentioned, u/serialbrain2 has some excellent material that goes into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to me this is pretty conclusive, Q is real. Many individual reasons can be dismissed as coincidence but collectively they cannot be. Detractors will point to the failed predictions about arrests and information leaks but this fits in with the concept of not revealing your moves to your enemy, disinfo for plausible deniability, and maybe its possible that the series of arrests are on a timeline that hasn’t been revealed yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cabal is real, we all know that here. Q is real, and the storm is probably coming soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal conclusion is that Q is a blackhat, and we are witnessing a coup and not a revolution. It just seems so absurd to me that a new golden age of humanity is going to be ushered in under an ideology of walls and strong military and America first. I think Q is wrapping legitimate deep politics events and trump team insights into a PSYOP meant to trap people waking up to conspiracies into a hateful alt right ideology, and to radicalize a base to rabidly support the incoming military tribunals.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think Q is very valuable. The crimes Q claims will be revealed are going to be 100&amp;#37; real, even though the decision of who to arrest and who not to will be politically motivated. I am optimistic that, with disclosure of the cabal to everyone, many people will be able to see through the false dichotemy of God Emporer Trump vs. Russia made up all the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ll organize all of this more in the future. Thanks for listening.

       Your welcome, it can be a pretty dense topic to wade through, especially considering the community's intensity. On the 8chan qresearch board they have a book available thats a compilation of all of Qs posts plus some context I recommend. Neonrevolt is also a blog from someone who seems pretty level headed in their decodes.

       Thanks for posting all that. I think it's much simpler. Old money neo cons vs nuvo riche Team Trump sometimes in cooperation when Trump remember he's a puppet and can't say we'll leave Syria so he symbolically bombs an outpost with Russian missile defense shooting them down. The US EU are too sunk by now in WorldRunning. The Sectarian rift amongst Muslims is real. Team Russia is a unified front to check any and all further action from the Neo Cons. There is no need for cabals and NWO stuff. It is as it was and Russia's back and here to stay. Their strategic alliance is getting W after W and the old guard is confused and pissing in the wind.

       But how many of these things actually happened, or weren't low-hanging fruit predictions that could be tossed out at any time? I wasn't familiar with a few of these, but the rest can easily be explained without turning to a "Q Clearance Patriot" secretly embedded in the Trump White House.

       There is no "North Korea peace." There are talks, and a shift toward a ramp down of hostilities, but that's happened before, and the status quo has always returned. And Iran has been "next" for a decade. Remember John McCain singing "bomb Iran?"

       With some of these, such as the Q picture, I agree. Others I think you are downplaying the significance of. I think we value some of these differently because of our views on Trump and his team. Greencastle as code for army corp of engineers followed by Trump announcing that the wall will be build by the military with military funds is a big deal and can't be dismissed away by the thought that the wall won't be built. Especially seeing as this was one that anons picked up on beforehand, not after Trumps announcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list doesn't seem to fit in a worldview where trump is a bumbling incompetent idiot, I understand that. But they fit perfectly in the puzzle we can build from Q's crumbs. At the very least we have to assume that Trump is being propped up by Military Intelligence, and probably has been since before winning the nomination. 4-d chess is more than just a meme, its an explanation of how Trump has gotten so far. Now remember I am not pro-trump I think he is a sleazy psychopath, but there IS a cabal, a criminal network that operates as a shadow government, and I think Trump is fighting them (not altruistically). From this perspective, crumbs like Flynn being cleared in 30 is accompanied by the narrative that Flynn plead guilty on purpose in order to get a plea deal where he has to say on record every illegal activity he was aware of, as a means of introducing evidence and testimony in an early part of the storm.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe that there is a cabal in the first place, then the idea of Q is pretty impossible to reconcile. But Q's analysis of current events makes so much more sense than the idea that a bunch of idiots are bumbling around without a plan.

       Uh yeah. Marina Abramovich is a performance artist. The single mention of spirit cooking in an e-mail between her and Tony Podesta— an art collector as well as a lobbyist— doesn't make much of a case for a vast "black magic" conspiracy.

       Maria saying it's art does not mean she does not also view it as ceremonial. Ritualalistic ceremonies can said to be art.

       Keep in mind, we are not talking something we would consider extreme when we are talking black magic fuckery. Numerology, astrology, speaking to the dead things like these are considered forms of black magic.

       Of course Eyes Wise Shut didn’t come out of some vacuum- it trades on powerful images of the occult. Those images however are really a part of the collective imagination. I’m sorry, but the idea that the liberal elite are partake in neo-pagan rituals says much more about the deracinated middle Americans who buy into that nonsense than anything else.

       People will say that russia fabricated all the evidence against the cabal and choose to believe that it just isnt true. Ultimately, trump supports and anti-trump team are right about the other side being corrupt, but it will be spun in a way so people only believe their side.

       This is my fear as well. The investigation may have been tainted from the start and if that turns out to be the case, his supporters won't even care if there's a recording of Trump and Putin talking about rigging the election together. This is what our political system has turned into. Two corrupt sides justifying anything and everything because the other side is corrupt too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, accordingly to Rudy, Mueller's team has decided they cannot indict a sitting President. Trump is going to get away with this.

       I think Q was setup for more or less the same reason. To create a cult following who will not react negatively to the things Trump does - which are all following the agenda of the neocon neolib Cabal. It is designed to get people on board with unilateral neocon war with Iran and anything else.  Q will always come out and claim that this is all a super genius multi dimensional chess move and that any day now she will be arrested and the hammer will come down.

       I'm upset about y'all lumping in qanon Infowars and
       <strong>
        alternative media
       </strong>
       all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infowars is a giant big money production. QAnon is a anonymous fringe topic at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of alt media is lumped in with the above clowns? The alt media ive watched has been skeptical of both of them forever. Try some styx, h.a. Goodman, and hard bastard. I like Jamarl Thomas a lot recently as well.

       Definitely. The news has never been more fascinating. The "legit" news itself. Just looking at the subtle and not so subtle differences between Comedy Central, VICE, BBC and RT. Just seeing how Syria is a flash point for dozens of militias and militaries all the way up to the big bad powers of yore. How Iraq was just handed to Iran. How the Secular Shias are so resilient and defiant to vote their own into Iraq today. If the Neo Cons continue to double down they will die or blow up the world. They never learn their lessons

       How is jones a psyop? Listen to the dude and hes the most genuine guy in media. Everything he says isn’t accurate but that’s because he’s taking info in real time and spit balling and sharing ideas but i haven’t heard him lie once. The really telling moment is the joe rogan podcast episode with him. They got jones drunk and stoned as fuck and hes still good ole Alex. Nothing about him changes. Now if you say that government sources have at times fed him false info that he’s reported on I could believe that but I don’t believe he’s a willing participant

       I generally don't buy into conspiracy theories. Sometimes I even spend time offering refutations or counter-points.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I generally find conspiracy theories interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's largely all stopped with political conspiracy theories. Q most of all. It seems so blatant too me that outs some cryptic shotgun approach that guarantees people will find just enough of significance, after the fact, to convince themselves it's real. It's like a horoscope.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I wonder most though is who's behind it. I know some here like to believe it's a "deep state" psy-op, but I'm more inclined to believe it's some stupid prank... Someone (or a small group) is insanely delighted at how many people hang on their every cryptic post.

       Q surfaced awhile after FBIAnon, claiming to provide the same sort of "insider information" to the autists on 4chan, more than likely after seeing how many people took FBIAnon at their word on the board. He didn't even tripfag at first, instead people identified him by his device hash, he made some wild claims and got everyone worked up over dates that nothing ever came out of. During the early weeks he posted in coherent sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once nothing happened from his initial set of predictions he starts pushing that their are no coincidences and starts posting in cryptic "code" that people can interpret a million different ways. He also starts to use a board trip-code for message authentication, an extremely weak hash, which should have been a giant red flag for everyone following him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q was warned multiple times in advance that using a trip-code for authentication was idiotic and that it would be cracked soon, but he never responded, and most people on the board would jump to his defense saying he obviously knew what he was doing as he is a super secret spy. His trip-code was cracked immediately after multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "q clearance patriot" who was participating in cyber operations couldn't even figure out how to use basic cryptographic authentication. I don't even think its a "psyop", at least not a professional one, I think it's simply a board regular or group of trolls fucking with the conspiracy community, and it's working beautifully. Even as far as ARGs go, this one has been low effort, but people eat it up anyway.

       I consider InfoWars and Q two sides of the same coin: disinformation utilized to further divide the masses and tell their base what they want to hear. They only serve to perpetuate the false left-right paradigm the elite use control and manipulate the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       To elaborate further:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The left–right paradigm as political criticism
       </p>
       <p>
        Used in another context, the phrase refers to a political theory that alleges that members of opposing major political parties such as the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States share common interests and goals, as well as a covertly unified ruling authority over the political issues of the masses. The two major political entities act in concert to create divisiveness among the population while keeping control of the political spectrum.
       </p>
       <p>
        This "left–right paradigm" concept theorizes that the two opposing political parties utilize their tremendous hold over mainstream media to dramatize political distractions and engage in covert warfare and operations, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Divisive issues are purposefully fed through the major media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class's hidden and ulterior (and sometimes global) agendas. By drawing attention to the differences between the two embedded political systems, ideologies, races and classes, the political groups obscure political clarity and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, which enables the ruling class to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances that actually works. The theory contends that the fresh interjection of a new political party or group (such as the expanding Libertarian or Green parties) into the political arena, would be the only way to provide a means to break the cyclical paradigm, currently established in the political system.
       </p>
       <p>
        False left–right paradigm political theory
       </p>
       <p>
        The "false left–right paradigm" is the political theory that members of opposing political parties such as Republican and Democrat deceptively share common interests and goals, as a one body ruling authority over the masses. The two parties act to create divisiveness and influence the general population while keeping control of the political spectrum. The false left–right paradigm political theory is closely related to theory of Inverted totalitarianism and Managed Democracy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The false left–right paradigm theorizes that opposing political groups use their influence over the establishment media to dramatize party warfare distraction, in grand performances of bureaucratic rivalry meant to propagandize and divide the populace. Psychological deception is coordinated on all levels of politics and fed through controlled media outlets to divert attention away from the ruling class's hidden agendas. By drawing attention to differences between two political systems, ideologies, races, and classes, the political groups obscure and divide unity among the masses. The tactic creates confusion and frustration among the population, enabling the global elite to increase and consolidate their wealth and power through maintaining an illusion of a two-party system of checks and balances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Former Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) archivist and Georgetown University professor Carroll Quigley, who is known as being President Bill Clinton’s mentor, wrote in his 1966 book "Tragedy and Hope"—
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         "The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the doctrinaire and academic thinkers."
        </p>
        <p>
         "Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so the American people can 'throw the rascals out' at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts in policy.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       IN short: Distract, divide and conquer.

       Because before any of that can happen, we have to take out the evil rat bastards who're suppressing all of that, and that requires a level of warfare and strategy most people cannot imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's that warfare that Q is talking about and preparing people to understand. It may not come to pass, and humanity may keep circling the drain a few more years before we pass the event horizon into oblivion--which is the trajectory we're on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or...or there might actually be people including our POTUS who are serious about putting an end to the deep state and the NWO criminal cabal behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, it makes a lot more sense than that Trump just stumbled his way into unconditional NoKo denuclearization and reconciliation talks, and that his engagements in Syria happened to accidentally take out Iranian and ISIS strongholds and sent the terrorist fleeing into the path of Russian and Syrian forces, and that the Syrian conflict is nearing completion, all without starting WWIII.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that Israelis took out Iranian facilities in northern Syria a few days later, without provoking an escalation in that theater. Everybody wants the Iranians to leave. And now they just might.
      </p>
      <p>
       And ending the fake Iran nuke deal, and moving the Israeli embassy? How can these things be happening without unleashing total war?
      </p>
      <p>
       No incompetent boob could have waltzed into all these Kobayashi Maru situations (and so many others) and come up roses! Please tell me you get that!
      </p>
      <p>
       So, given that we're talking about a level of coordination and competence that could actually pull of such a mission as Q describes, perhaps it's not irrational to think it might be the real thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the evil is certainly real. The deep state and the NWO hidden hand in human history is totally real. JFK was no conspiracy nut, and he told us about it. Plenty of other serious people have as well. Why would you write off the idea of humanity staging a coordinated military operation against it, in order to stave off the mass extinction events those people have in store for us if we do nothing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll take the "conspiracy nut" moniker as a badge of honor if it means I have reason to hope my daughters will inherit a better world than the rotten tomato we've got now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody got a better idea that might actually work, given the evil anti-human scum that have run the whole shit show up to now?

       some very good points. papa trump def has some terrible parts, but he has, somehow, done a medium job so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       hes riding on the coattails of obama's economy. well see if papa trump's economic policy helps or hurts us in the long run. they say that economic adjustments take about 8 years to set in or something, so well know after the end of his second term. just the time he doesnt have to care anymore lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       but, his foreign policy has been pretty medium. i expected him to do much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the north korea one either: A- fell into his lap with the collapse of NK's underground nuke research base or B- he (or someone in the government) used some sort of weapon to destroy the base (HAARP based earthquake, or rod of god, or seal team 6 with explosives? idk lol)
      </p>
      <p>
       i think that syria/iran/russia is really just a stalemate that nobody wants to break. papa trump knows that, and is using it to his advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       hes surrounded by military guys who understand russia's capabilities the best, and maybe he knows theyre not ready for conventional war. i personally dont think putin wants nuclear war, so i dont think hell ever attack that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       iran is a crazy type cuz of muslim extremism and general hate for americans (not that i can really blame them). my understanding is that they do have a pretty decent military. nothing compared to ours, but decent compared to the rest of the world. drones and shit. maybe iran just wants to season some veteran soldiers for a war that they want to start soon? i dont really buy israel crying wolf about an iranian bomb, but, iran's actual military force is a legit threat to israel and any allies we have in the region. plus they dont have a rothschild bank right? theyre on the naughty list with NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think that russia might be for iran stirring things up, but, is also against nuclear war, so theyre not gonna outright help the iranians either. i think most of the world knows that if israel is nuked, everyone is gonna die of nuclear winter. i read somewhere they had a plan about it and everything, but havent researched it. it does make sense tho. russia also backs assad, so they have to be against iran in syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think maybe israel realized that iran was a little too overextended, and they might be able to strike without retaliation. they took the shot. theyre pretty aggressive, so that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       syria itself is a proxy war between the US/iran/russia. just like afghanistan in the 1980s, and ukraine. this one has 3 players instead of 2 tho. (just had a crazy thought: what if weve been having these proxy wars to level up our special ops. what if russia and the US are actually friends? we used to have space station together. what if aliens are evil or something and they use these proxy wars as a way to have battle ready troops? god i love conspiracies.)
      </p>
      <p>
       oh and the embassy thing, it already made israel look terribly with the killing of protestors, and its too soon to know what effects it will have on the world. let alone the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, this has been a very long, neutral, (i think) way of looking at these events. i dont think papa trump is really pulling as many strings here as ppl think he is, but, i think that he hasnt actively fucked anything up (save potentially the embassy thing, and im not really pro-israel with how they treat the palestinians. so empowering them with embassy is neutral at best. honestly i think its dumb. i could be wrong and it could bring world peace. who knows? lol). for me at least, my expectations were sooooo low for him that being even medium as hes been is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       lastly, at the beginning you talk about an inevitable confrontation between the powers that shouldnt be and everyone else. i understand where you are coming from: our rights are being taken away, secret tax of inflation, dumbing down and arguably killing the poor with the "modern" education system, big brother, nonsense wars, pollution, etc etc. the world is shitty. but, i dont think there has to be a war about it. i truly believe that if enough good ppl stand up, that we can win. it may take some strategic strikes or something, but not a full on war. i could see how you might feel that we are on a slippery slope to marshall law that some asleep ppl might be for, but, i think more ppl than ever are starting to wake up. forums like this and youtube, and really the internet itself are making it harder and harder for the ppl in power to do their work in secret. they cant just hide now, they have to put out fake news as a smoke screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the powers that shouldnt be are smart, they would realize that throughout history the oligarchs have never survived. the people always rose up against them. any tyrant or unfair system is eventually exposed. society is trying to find the balance and the oligarchs are taking too much. i hope that one day we label their greed as a mental health disorder tho. its completely illogical. with all their money and the advent of modern technology, maybe they can see it coming this time and stop themselves before its too late. or have someone they love that isnt as crazy save them, idk. give peace a chance man lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think Q is smart enough to know all of these things and is tapping into the resistance that is growing. i dont buy him not saying things outright tho. theres literally no reason for him to speak in code other than being a shill. im down to hear reasons, and maybe there is a crazy reason i havent thought of, but if its anything that takes a whole train of logic to figure out, its not a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       end crazy rant. lol

       Seriously, it's not that hard. There are some people performing mental acrobatics with it, but I think THEY are LARP-ing for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The essentials are pretty straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of like Mark Twain said about the Bible. "It ain't those parts of the Bible that I can't understand that bother me, it is the parts that I do understand."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people's REAL problem with Q is self-protection. People are scared to death of hope. They feel like "Fool me once--shame on you; fool me twice--shame on ME!" and so they develop a strong aversion to anything hope-inducing, and they attack it with all the vigor they can muster. Compare that to truly destructive stuff about which people more or less say "live and let live."
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that burned sentiment. I really do. But I also understand that if you're in a fight to win, you cannot afford the luxury of surrender. As a species, I say "Do not go gentle into that good night. / Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
      </p>
      <p>
       We fight for humanity with all we've got. Right now, we count this in that category until we can rule it out.

       I think Qanon is a high ranking member of trump’s administration or possibly trump himself. The strategy is to keep the rabid internet base that mindlessly supports Trump content by feeding them snippets of info that is vaguely legit. Personally I think the media gives way to much credence to the power of “the hacker known as 4chan” and the rest of trump’s internet base, but I still think that the memes and trolling that they pull in favor of trump no matter how ridiculous does give Trump some free publicity nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now why would Alex Jones vehemently seek to discredit Qanon? Well I think it signals that trump has moved from Alex Jones’s orbit which he was during the campaign (just like how he ditched Steph Bannon after the election) and Qanon is his administration’s way of still channeling energy from the conspiracy theorist base. Alex Jones knows this (during the Syria strike a few weeks ago, Jones let it slip that he hasn’t spoken with trump in months) so discrediting Qanon is his way of indirectly telling Trump and his administration that him and his brand (InfoWars) is still the best way to appeal to conspiracy theorist.

       If Trump says WH leakers are traitors and cowards, then Qanon is the biggest traitor and coward of them all.  That's if you even believe the LARP is real.  They saw what the conspiracy clowns did to the news stories and are attacking it with fake.  The greatawakening reddit bans anyone that disagrees with the idiot posters.  It's not awakening ANYONE.  Spreads misinformation from a fake loon on the internet.

       It's a PSYOP by the white-hats, for a positive purpose. It is meant to wake people up, and get them to start or continue investigating. Qanon uses a Socratic format. This is perhaps the first historical instance of a leader (President Trump) being able to anonymously communicate with the GLOBAL masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the predictions and leads dropped by Q have been purposefully wrong. "Misinformation is real." So said Q... the point is to make it UN-believable, since the information is so vast and terrible, it would be risky to reveal it all at once. It is also happening in real time, so spies might be reading the same post. Q and his team remain adaptable. It can't be too credible. Q wants to redpill the masses slowly, perhaps one at a time, rather than all at once.

       I think Q was just a bored, very well read/generally informed, social media savvy regular person. S/he showed up after MegaAnon (or MegAnon?), who showed up after HighLevelInsider. Fascinating as all get out to read but (outside of a few weirdly accurate predictions/confirmations) basically content that most folks with a good thinking mind, quick wit, and a shit ton of time on their hands could generate.
      </p>
      <p>
       As other folks have said, it did get weird after a while, which made it less believable.

       Custody Wars &amp; the Bizarre Transformation of Hypocrite Alex Jones : Interview w/ Kelly Jones
      </p>
      <p>
       Robbie Martin speaks to Kelly Jones the ex-wife of Alex Jones about her ongoing custody battle and experience being under a continual bombardment of vexatious litigation on behalf of her ex husband. Kelly has already been granted primary custody by a Texas court yet the judge has left her children with Alex. They also speak at length about how Infowars transformed over the years from being a non-partisan, civil liberties focused, anti-militarized police platform into a pro-Trump, pro-police, pro-fascism hyper partisan anti-left megaphone. Kelly also walks through when the big 'shift' occurred (which happened to be around the same time as their divorce) when shadowy figures like Roger Stone, Matt Drudge and supplement manufactures started circling around Alex as he descended deeper into alcoholism and uncontrollable anger.

       She allegedly claims to be against "American Capitalist Empire" but she allegedly often voices support for Communism which is inherently violent but she goes so fucking far as to fucking defend North Korea and Stalinist Russia. She allegedly is literally advocating for violence in the streets and violent and forceful "redistribution of wealth." HYPOCRISY!

       Everything Q has said has come true.  Their photos put them in extreme close proximity to the president.  The fact that POTUS immediately corroborates important Q Drops within a day shows Q's legitimacy (literally happened today w/ the NYPD officers who saw Weiner's laptop getting killed).

       The 11/11 "prediction" is not really a prediction. It's just commonsense. It's after the mid-terms, and it's the date of Trump's big military parade.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump is to survive the election, a significant portion of the information contained in deep state investigations currently unpublished must be revealed and substantial progress must be made on corruption and election fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what Q is saying is that by that date, the public will know much of what is currently just a "conspiracy theory" to "normies."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if one is not a deep insider, which many consider the Q team to be (and which Q claims to be, and which many of Q's original photos support) it's not hard to come to the same conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these things do not happen, it won't be a matter of embarrassment to the Q community, it will mean a Blue Wave and impeachment for Trump. So...

       That's about where I'm at on Q.  I read his posts and some of the research surrounding them.  I often learn new things, so I've stopped caring if it's a LARP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still mildly concerned about a psyop of justice porn...but a lot of the stuff he mentions is verifiable and real, so not much concern there.

       I stopped caring about anything Q related when my friend who follows it religiously told me that the president was going to use his national cell phone alert system three times in one week, and it never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I pointed out that Q is bullshit, since it didn't happen, he tried arguing back that things don't always happen because he tips everyone off to what will happen. Such a confirmation bias.

       A researcher was claiming the EAS would be used by the president, I don't believe that was Q's statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of other proofs from Q, you need to be following or you'll miss it.  Most recent proof is involving Officer Familia's family being honored. Also Trump started using Promises Made Promises Kept after Q had been posting it for a while.  There's an overwhelming amount of Q-Trump overlap like this.

       Since you seem to know a bit on the subject, can you explain how net neutrality is either good or bad?  I know one of them is bad, but I can't figure out which one?

       Net neutrality has been around since the 90s and tried to prevent ISP's from attempting to rip people off since there is so little competition in many parts of america. They were continuously trying to infringe on NN and in 2015 comcast (i think) won a case against NN so obama basically made it a law. Here in Australia we don't need NN because we have many ISP's competing with each other. So yes NN is good, the problem is with large ISP's and their monopolies which getting rid of NN would not fix and most likely make worse.

       I agree with your first sentence. Do you agree with my premise that he's a psyop? I've watched it unfold from the beginning, it's more pizzagate esque misdirection. It's no different than anonymous, it could literally be a team of trolls just for the lulz but I find Qs occasional insider info to be evidence that we are being played to support Trump. Trumps are the new Clintons but fanboys are too erect at the moment to see the writing on the wall. Oy vey

       In these times people need to take chances and be willing to stick out. I could be wrong but gotta assume I'm right because my inner voice seldom fails. In your mind, opinions are worthless, analysis is worthless. I don't think you'd agree with my assessment but just know that's how it reads. I don't know for sure, neither does anyone else other than Q and individuals that could rule themselves out via process of elimination.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do you I'll do me. I respect your principle but there are plenty of folks on here spreading the gospel of Q and pizzagate and I'm here to tell you: it's a misdirection. I hope I'm wrong but seldom am on these matters.

       There's nothing that makes you stick out by saying Q is a psyop or larp.  Plenty of people have said that already.  In fact, you guys push LARP way too much when it's not really part of the general lexicon.

       There's nothing on a "stone wall", just your unsubstantiated opinion.

       There's nothing in the way that you address people that makes me think that you don't "hope you are" wrong about anything, at all.

       I'm sorry, there's not somehow a huge quota of people that have become experts in sniffing out "LARPS" or "psyops", especially with no evidence.  Just bland assertions.

       As lucky as we are to be able to see the otherside of this so can our enemies. Q is a military operation. Deception and misinformation is involved with all of this. I can't tell you why killary didnt get arrested back then. Maybe it was posted just to make the fuckers sweat, or maybe things didn't go as planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Future proves past. There are plenty of examples proving Q isnt a LARP. Dismiss if you want but you're missing one hell of a show at r/greatawakening

      <p>
       90% of the conspiracies will be fix by the Q team. That should interest every genuine person on this sub.

       Ok, so here's a brand new Q post.  It includes what looks to be Trump's pen laying on an executive order, including visible LETTERS on the right side of the picture (not the white house on top).
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is a "larp" tell me how they managed to get a picture of an EO that will match up with the response to the letter also pictured.    I realize that hasn't happened yet, but when it does will anyone argue it's fake?

       <p>
        Trump is protected under an executive order that was signed by Barack Obama in 2009 establishing a uniform system for "classifying, safeguarding and declassifying national security information."
       </p>
       <p>
        The order allows the president to determine the system of designating classified information, and he is the ultimate authority over U.S. intelligence agencies, which gather and classify the information.

       actually no, 6+ months of constant posting by 6 and constant due-dilligence by the chans convinced me.  Along with Trump's tweets proving Q posts.  But you people wouldn't know anything about all of that, including 3000+ threads on the chans about it all.

       I go to the great awakening subreddit time and time again. Q happens to be right about something for about every 100 or so times he's dead wrong. He posts abstract platitudes that are completely vague so people can interpret them how they see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I give it 90% chance it's a LARP, 9.9% it's an intelligence/law enforcement agency experimenting with social engineering .0001% chance he's the real.

       But by all means please continue to put faith in some anonymous vague shitposts on a forum full of degenerates that have not borne out anything of value.

       take a png image you trust to be unedited. needs to be .png! e.g. this
load it into the Forensic Tool everyone references.
play around with the filters and compare.

       The forensic analysis is only part of the argument. Please read the whole thing. The fact that the seal, which a the poster points out is highly suspicious, seems to be the part photoshopped in is very telling.

       it's ok, 4chan is on the case.  they already know that the thread was started by a TMOR poster, so it's already discredited.  Of course, none of this matters if the letter written is acted on by 5.19 or whatever the date is.  Nitpicking .png artifacts and seals doesn't matter

       this is why i rarely waste time on people like you.  you're not interested in the topic, you're interested in debunking the topic.  which is fine assuming you're honest about it and do your due diligence.  except that's not you.

       When you have the outlandish claim the onus is on you to prove it. If I said NK is a made up country for propoganda purposes, I had better have some rock solid evidence if I am going to convince you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim that the POTUS (who as an aside, apparently doesn't know the difference between HIV and HPV) is a genius and is leaking though either a staffer or even himself to a message board rife with incels and NEETs events and plans that are coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I ask is one clear example of something obvious. Like you said there are over 2400 so it shouldn't be hard to produce one since you claim to be familiar with the subject.

        I go to the great awakening subreddit time and time again. Q happens to be right about something for about every 100 or so times he's dead wrong. He posts abstract platitudes that are completely vague so people can interpret them how they see fit.

      <p>
       How can he be wrong when the things he says are so vague that people can confirm via bias?  It's either one or the other.  He's either wrong because he's specific, or he's never wrong because he's so vague.  Your comment seems a bit contradictory.

       The incels really sit there at home and think some super secret government agent is cryptically communicating with them to save the world.  It's fucking hilarious picturing these people all excited thinking they are for once part of something and not ostracized losers.  I suppose it's better than them killing others like the Toronto guy, but damn is it funny.

       People need to understand that Q cannot come right out and give straight up proof due to national security concerns. This is why he is so cryptic and this is why he poses everything as questions. Plausible deniability.

       This is the most fascinating thing on the internet right now. I don’t believe it’s a LARP. Although parts of it may be due to the anon nature of 4chan.

       That's not how chans work. It's the same Q from the beginning and we know this because of tripcodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tripcodes are generated based on the password from the original poster.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Q" has to enter the original password to post under the official Q tripcode.

       That assumes two things (maybe more):
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        That 8chan's implementation of tripcodes is correct and secure
       </li>
       <li>
        That 8chan's owner/admin is not in on whatever con might be happening.

       If Q is who he/they says they are, they would know that a public/private key signing would be significantly more secure and demonstrative of it being the original person/group.

       well, Q started on 4chan and then moved to 8ch. So his trip has changed more than once. And i think i remember he was either anon at the beginning and/or changed his trip at least a few times. But we know it happened at least once. Not arguing validity just pointing out your simplification of the chans' tripcode is not really true.

       Well technically if the old tripcode was compromised, can it really validate, without a doubt, the new trip code? If i were to steal a password for someone's account, then make a new account, couldn't I just use the old account to confirm the new account as the "original account owner"?

       Is this really confirmed? I noticed that snallygaster and hapticsloughton are very left leaning, so I took a picture of a piece of paper with the yellow graph on it from my desk and the
       <a href="https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#pca">
        'Principal Component Analysis'
       </a>
       with the Component selected at 2 (just like it was in hapticslougton analysis) and the yellow graphs jumped out in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in no way an expert, but I would definitely like to see a confirmation of an unbiased person rather then just believe the "confirmation" of biased individuals.

       Just read the raw Q posts. Larp or not. It gives hope that the criminals in the CIA, NSA, FBI and DOJ will be taken down. I mean, that kind of is happening already. People are stepping down/being fired. If you don't support the message Q is putting across than you are a traitor or a naive liberal shitbag who hates America.

     <div class="md">
      <p>
       There's an interview with Roger Stone where he talks about how the political landscape has shifted in terms of media coverage, he talks about the dwindling power of the legacy media and the rise of the Internet and the huge audience net based channels like InfoWars get. Using these avenues Trump tapped into a huge supporter base without the need for the legacy media who were in Clintons pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, imagine if you took every American voter and sorted them into groups according to which websites they frequent and where they get a majority of their news. Obviously Facebook would be popular as with all social media, and then you have places like Reddit where we seen the birth of The Donald, you would also have a huge amount of (majority) white males between 18-40 who Anonymously visit a website called 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Clinton lost the election the old guard has realized how dangerous the Internet is, we have seen an astronomical rise in astroturfing, we have seen alternative media blatantly attacked and called fake news by the media who were complicit in rigging the DNC election.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the election Trumps supporters eagerly awaited Clintons arrest, the swamp being drained, the wall being built, the tax loopholes to close, the JFK files to be released, the cold war to thaw, the troops to come home...
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps support dwindled, people felt cheated, he began passing laws he claimed to he opposed too, he delayed the JFK release, Assange was still locked up, Hilary was still free, he bombed Syria over much to the delight of the MSM...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Q arrives. Dropping a very interesting post on 4chan. This post was saved and reposted a few different places including this one, Q immediately changes the narrative, he lets everyone know that while it may look like Trumps tweeting about the new season of The Apprentice he is actually busy saving the world from George Soros and his gang of retired politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, at first I thought it was a LARP, then the Saudi Arabia stuff happened and I thought he was legit. Then he started floundering. He was going to a lot of effort to prove he was legitimate, yet the information he was giving was extremely poor. It was like he was guessing about potential stories by throwing out vague hints. However whether or not Q was an insider quickly became irrelevant....
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps actions spoke louder than Qs words, first we have Trump openly shilling for the Military Industrial Complex, his diplomatic missions are more like door to door sales with F-35s instead of steak knives. Then we have the bombing of Syria, twice. Based on no evidence. Pushing for war with Iran and sending more troops back into the middle east. His actions at the UN and various other choices to abandon previous agreements like the TPP, The Climate pact, Iran Nuclear Deal and imposing steel tariffs. Trumps alienating the US, not a smart move with such a fragile economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one country however who Trump has been bending over backwards to please, whether its murdering unarmed protesters, bombing Syria or threatening to Nuke the rest of the world if anything ever happens to them...
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course; its Israel. Now ask yourself, why is Trump putting tariffs against some of your most important economic partners yet still handing over billions to Israel? Why did Trump cancel Obamacare when Israelis have free health care? Why does Trump want war with Iran? They are no threat to the US and would probably even move back to the Petrodollar if Trump agreed to discuss the Nuclear Agreement. How is another war financially possible when Americans are still drinking lead poisoned water?
      </p>
      <p>
       Q may or may not work for Trump,
      </p>
      <p>
       But if he does that should make you even more suspicious of being manipulated by a controlled narrative, especially if election time comes around and all those promises are still just around the corner.

       A discussion can't hurt imho. I honestly doubt he is legitimate, yet I have to also honestly say that I have never really looked into the whole thing deeply enough to have a good unbiased in depth opinion on the subject. The r/greatawakening sub (where they talk about Q) turned me off of it to be honest, because it in many cases (not by all users, I digress) was filled with mindless Trump worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume the reason this is being discussed is simply because a lot of people believe it and are talking about it. I mean that sub alone has a huge amount of subs for a relatively new subreddit.

       It's important to elaborate on how it's a psyop as well. What is the ultimate purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, from what I'm seeing, it benefits the elite that our culture is vastly divided on the issue. Some think it's real and will passionately defend it out of a desperation for a savior or some kind of hope, and the rest of us just want to help others understand that they are being "played" and tricked into following a false prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also seems to generate a "cult-like" support for the current administration and the POTUS, which benefits the establishment because they are essentially converting conspiracy theorists into rabid defenders of the government. This tells me the establishment is having trouble keeping the masses supporting their puppet president, so they have to find a clever way to "recruit" new followers, or else we could all unite under skepticism/rejection of the POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all a charade, and I'm glad people are finally seeing past it, but I think at this time we can just stop talking about it and it will hopefully fade into background noise.

       I guarantee there will be no disappointment if nothing of import happens on 11/11, either because some minor event (after the midterms???) will happen that believers will latch on to, or any believers will conveniently forget or deny 11/11 was ever a serious prediction, despite being pushed into the sidebar of their sub.

       That date is Veteran's Day and the day of Trump's big military parade in D.C. It's been known for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Q (or his fans) is correct in "predicting" that "something big" happens on that date. The problem is that it's not really hard to predict it, since it's public knowledge anyway. And the parade is nothing more than military fetishism. But I'm sure Q fans will love it.

       some very good points. papa trump def has some terrible parts, but he has, somehow, done a medium job so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       hes riding on the coattails of obama's economy. well see if papa trump's economic policy helps or hurts us in the long run. they say that economic adjustments take about 8 years to set in or something, so well know after the end of his second term. just the time he doesnt have to care anymore lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       but, his foreign policy has been pretty medium. i expected him to do much worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the north korea one either: A- fell into his lap with the collapse of NK's underground nuke research base or B- he (or someone in the government) used some sort of weapon to destroy the base (HAARP based earthquake, or rod of god, or seal team 6 with explosives? idk lol)
      </p>
      <p>
       i think that syria/iran/russia is really just a stalemate that nobody wants to break. papa trump knows that, and is using it to his advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       hes surrounded by military guys who understand russia's capabilities the best, and maybe he knows theyre not ready for conventional war. i personally dont think putin wants nuclear war, so i dont think hell ever attack that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       iran is a crazy type cuz of muslim extremism and general hate for americans (not that i can really blame them). my understanding is that they do have a pretty decent military. nothing compared to ours, but decent compared to the rest of the world. drones and shit. maybe iran just wants to season some veteran soldiers for a war that they want to start soon? i dont really buy israel crying wolf about an iranian bomb, but, iran's actual military force is a legit threat to israel and any allies we have in the region. plus they dont have a rothschild bank right? theyre on the naughty list with NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think that russia might be for iran stirring things up, but, is also against nuclear war, so theyre not gonna outright help the iranians either. i think most of the world knows that if israel is nuked, everyone is gonna die of nuclear winter. i read somewhere they had a plan about it and everything, but havent researched it. it does make sense tho. russia also backs assad, so they have to be against iran in syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think maybe israel realized that iran was a little too overextended, and they might be able to strike without retaliation. they took the shot. theyre pretty aggressive, so that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       syria itself is a proxy war between the US/iran/russia. just like afghanistan in the 1980s, and ukraine. this one has 3 players instead of 2 tho. (just had a crazy thought: what if weve been having these proxy wars to level up our special ops. what if russia and the US are actually friends? we used to have space station together. what if aliens are evil or something and they use these proxy wars as a way to have battle ready troops? god i love conspiracies.)
      </p>
      <p>
       oh and the embassy thing, it already made israel look terribly with the killing of protestors, and its too soon to know what effects it will have on the world. let alone the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, this has been a very long, neutral, (i think) way of looking at these events. i dont think papa trump is really pulling as many strings here as ppl think he is, but, i think that he hasnt actively fucked anything up (save potentially the embassy thing, and im not really pro-israel with how they treat the palestinians. so empowering them with embassy is neutral at best. honestly i think its dumb. i could be wrong and it could bring world peace. who knows? lol). for me at least, my expectations were sooooo low for him that being even medium as hes been is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       lastly, at the beginning you talk about an inevitable confrontation between the powers that shouldnt be and everyone else. i understand where you are coming from: our rights are being taken away, secret tax of inflation, dumbing down and arguably killing the poor with the "modern" education system, big brother, nonsense wars, pollution, etc etc. the world is shitty. but, i dont think there has to be a war about it. i truly believe that if enough good ppl stand up, that we can win. it may take some strategic strikes or something, but not a full on war. i could see how you might feel that we are on a slippery slope to marshall law that some asleep ppl might be for, but, i think more ppl than ever are starting to wake up. forums like this and youtube, and really the internet itself are making it harder and harder for the ppl in power to do their work in secret. they cant just hide now, they have to put out fake news as a smoke screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the powers that shouldnt be are smart, they would realize that throughout history the oligarchs have never survived. the people always rose up against them. any tyrant or unfair system is eventually exposed. society is trying to find the balance and the oligarchs are taking too much. i hope that one day we label their greed as a mental health disorder tho. its completely illogical. with all their money and the advent of modern technology, maybe they can see it coming this time and stop themselves before its too late. or have someone they love that isnt as crazy save them, idk. give peace a chance man lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think Q is smart enough to know all of these things and is tapping into the resistance that is growing. i dont buy him not saying things outright tho. theres literally no reason for him to speak in code other than being a shill. im down to hear reasons, and maybe there is a crazy reason i havent thought of, but if its anything that takes a whole train of logic to figure out, its not a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       end crazy rant. lol

       Funny thing is Victory of the LARP, a related person (which had a whole shitstorm back April last year) and butt-buddy of QAnon kept saying that November 2017 was meant to be some game changing shit where "ayy lmaos" (Aliens) were meant to "BTFO" the Deep State back in November 2017 (and then February, then March, then April) and obviously now it's been updated to another fake prep date of 11/11/18.

       There's nothing on a "stone wall", just your unsubstantiated opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing in the way that you address people that makes me think that you don't "hope you are" wrong about anything, at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, there's not somehow a huge quota of people that have become experts in sniffing out "LARPS" or "psyops", especially with no evidence.  Just bland assertions.
