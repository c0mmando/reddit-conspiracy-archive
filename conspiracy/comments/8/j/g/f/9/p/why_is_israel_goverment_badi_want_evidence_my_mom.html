       Ask her if she thinks one religion should rule America. If she says yea, remind her of the constitution saying that you are free to practice your religion but the government shall respect no religion.

       Israel is moving to be an all Jewish state where christians and muslims are second class citizens who cant own land or business. Its the same thing the Nazis did to the Jews to have an Arian national state. Replelace Arian with Jew and thats what israel wants. Ethnic nationalist states are worse than communism.

       Israel took over the land and made it's indigenous people a permanent refugees. Ever since it's creation, it's been at war with it's neighbours, an instigator of bloodshed in the Middle East. It's the only nuclear country in that region, in addition to having stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. State that discriminates (even amongst it's citizens) on basis of ethnicity, religion, and color.

       Isnt just a tad odd that you think the Israeli government is bad but can't think of any evidence off hand to back up that belief? How is it that you reached the conclusion before you had any evidence?

       <em>

       biased on this issue. Here are some good explainer videos although the producers of course have their own biases:

       Depends what your views on Islam are. Israel is extremely advanced - theh build a lot of our weapons and we pay them for it. But Mossad also blackmails everyone including America. Our 3 letter agencies do the same though.

       I'd check out the podcast Martyr Made, it's a 10 part series on the history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. It's pretty unbiased and unconspiratorial and I feel it's giving me a great perspective on the issue and how there are no good guys or badguys and no winners to be found. The whole thing is a shitshow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't ascribe to the theory that everything can be pinned on the jews, it feels overly simplified, but the notion that Israel is a force for good is equally ridiculous.

       The Israeli government we know today was created in 1948. By all standards, this is a very young country. The Israeli people were repatriated there as an offering on a promise made half a century earlier--and by sheer violence by the founding fathers and mothers of Israel. Undoubtedly, the Holocaust and the Nuremberg Trials](
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials
       </a>
       ) definitely played a major role in the timing of the agreement by TPTB at the time, which were the colonial powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israeli history will tell you that they landed on uninhabited land and turned it into a paradise. Palestinian history will tell you people were kicked out of their houses and villages, water supplies were redirected, in some cases families were murdered. The uncontroversial history says that the land was in fact occupied, and there were murders and other horrors, but there were Muslim communities that welcomed them in, and in which these groups flourished together for many years. There were thousands upon thousands who had no choice but to leave their land. In legal terms, this is what the progenitors of America did to the native populations. They simply said, "This is ours. We pay taxes on this land to the new Israeli government. Fuck off."
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's that initial injury. The Israelis see that land as a birthright given by Yaweh. The people who had been there for as long don't feel that God had given the land to a different group, especially since they were already there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus began the birth of a nation in perpetual warfare with its neighbors. In 1967, the leading Arab nations thought they'd crush the Israelis, however, after running the Egyptians westward and pushing the Syrians and Jordanians northeastward, inflicting casualties at a 20:1 ratio, the Arab states gave up. This solidified Israel as a true nation to be reckoned with and induced a foundational national pride in the Israeli people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Decades of tension from all sides and a close relationship with the US produced the most highly trained and well equipped army in the world next to the US. Military service in Israel is mandatory, with a few exceptions. It's not unusual for any Israeli citizen you meet to have seen combat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately following the Six-Day War, the UN ratified a resolution referred to as [UN Resolution 242]9
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_242
       </a>
       ) which was a compromise for the Arab nations in that they had to formally sign a document recognizing the existence of the Israeli nation, and Israel having to give up the "occupied territories," i.e., the newly acquired areas, and go back to what we call the "pre-1967" borders.

       It took a long time for one of the Arab nations to get on board with the agreement, but Syria finally signed it in 1973. The problem is that Israel never relinquished the occupied territories. So there's another injury. To this day, an Israeli citizen can buy land from an Israeli real estate broker that's within the occupied territories. To this day, Arabs are being kicked off their land. Houses get destroyed by tanks, sometimes with family members still in them. This is probably the number 1 issue flaming the hate between these groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israeli government is controlled by the ultra-hard right wing. They do not want peace, they want to commit genocide on any remaining non-Israelis in the occupied territories, and absorb them as Israel proper. This government basically took over after the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Yitzhak_Rabin">
        assassination of Yitzak Rabin
       </a>
       in 1995. Rabin was about to sign the Oslo Accords, which would have fulfilled the terms of UN 242 and ceded the occupied territories back to the Palestinians, thus likely allowing a sustainable 2-state solution. The current Israeli President, Benjamin Netanyahu, advocating strongly for throwing the Oslo Accords in the trash and "doing away" with Rabin.
      </p>
      <p>
       To absolutely no one's surprise, a hard-core right-wing asshole heard Netanyahu's dog whistle loud and clear, and he murdered a man for attempting to make peace with the Palestinians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since that time, the Israeli government has murdered civilians--men, women and children, old, in a wheelchair, etc. The Palestinians constantly fight back with every bit of themselves, but they simply don't have the training, the money or the recognition as a nation to have anything like an "army." Meanwhile, Israel has tanks and laser-guided missiles and nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like an adult beating a handcuffed child with an aluminum bat. It's no contest who has the power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel has the choice to make peace, but the government has stood firmly against that goal for decades. The Palestinian leaders, despite their many flaws, are eager to make any deal that provides basic human rights to the Palestinian people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current Israeli government prefers genocide as the path to peace. That doesn't go down well with the targets of that genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to understanding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is to know who has the real power: Israel. Peace or no peace is the choice of the powerful, not the weak.

        The Israeli history will tell you that they landed on uninhabited land and turned it into a paradise. Palestinian history will tell you people were kicked out of their houses and villages, water supplies were redirected, in some cases families were murdered. The uncontroversial history says that the land was in fact occupied, and there were murders and other horrors, but there were Muslim communities that welcomed them in, and in which these groups flourished together for many years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Uninhabited?  What?  No one has ever said that Palestine was uninhabited.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP, here's what really happened: Great Britain had decided to split the area called Palestine into two countries, one for the Jews and one for the Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neighboring Arab countries objected to this proposal; they surrounded the land that was supposed to go to the Jews with multiple armies, and informed that area's inhabitants that: that they were going to wipe out everyone that didn't leave; if they didn't want to die then they would need to leave; if they left, then they would be allowed to return just as soon as the lands were cleansed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unsurprisingly, a significant portion of the Muslim population left, because they didn't want to get murdered.  The Jews (but also a minority of the Palestinians) stayed and prepared for war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel was declared its own country; the Arab armies invaded, and people that had stayed to defend themselves (Jews Christians and Palestinians, but mostly Jews) won the war, crushing multiple armies that were bigger and better armed than themselves.  When they pushed back the Arab armies, they pushed them not only out of the half that was supposed to go to the Jews but also the half that was supposed to go to Muslims.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of this 1948 war, everyone who had stayed and fought against the invading armies became citizens of Israel.  They have full legal rights, and if you go there today you'll see that significant minority of its population is Muslim.
      </p>
      <p>
       The muslims that didn't join in the new country's defense have not been permitted re-entry.  These are the "refugees" that everyone talks about.  The rest is, as they say, history.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple things to keep in mind:
(1) The Nazis used to control all of this area, and the Arabs were inundated with anti-Jewish Nazi propaganda.  A lot of their anti-Jewish hatred originated from the Nazis, which was almost certainly responsible for the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, where the Arab armies promised to complete Hitler's final solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) This hatred has gotten really, really bad.  No one tried to counter the Nazi propaganda, the way America did in post-war Germany.  On the contrary, Arab kings and dictators found it extremely useful and encouraged it because it helped distract their populations from their own oppressive regimes.  Jews have lived all over the Middle East for thousands of years, but now the Jewish population in most countries is entirely gone, kicked out of their old homes and synagogues.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) Palestinians generally demand that they be incorporated into Israel.  This is impossible as it would immediately make the country into a muslim-majority, with Jews losing political control at every level to a group that wants them dead.  Anyone who supports the "Right of Return" has no interest in a practical solution to the Palestinian problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       (By dead, I mean really, really
       <em>
        dead
       </em>
       . You have to see it to believe it - youtube videos of Palestinians dancing and celebrating every successful terrorist attack; children's shows celebrating murdering Jews, etc.  It's stomach-churning, unbelievable stuff.)
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) Anyone genuinely interested in a solution recognizes that Israel has to give the Palestinians land of their own, and the Palestinians have to stop demanding that they be allowed to re-enter Israel.  This is the "Land for Peace" plan.  Everyone knows that this is how things have to be, with the two sides bickering for a long time over how much land and how much autonomy the Palestinians will get.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a time in the 90's where Israel was controlled by leftist peace-makers who offered the Palestinians land in exchange for ending hostilities.  They pulled their Settlors out of areas that were supposed to go to the Muslims, gave the Palestinians full control over Gaza and basically to almost everything that Arafat wanted.  He didn't get 100%, but it was darned close.
      </p>
      <p>
       This failed miserably.  Arafat couldn't take the deal because Jewish-hatred was so strong that he would probably been killed.  Hamas took over Gaza and used their autonomy to launch wave after wave of attacks into Israel, including some really brutal and horrifying terrorist attacks (duly celebrated by gleeful Palestinians).  This caused the peacemakers to lose power, with the Israeli citizens voting in hardliners who promised to keep them safe from Palestinian terrorists - building the wall, severely limiting what resources the Palestinians get, &amp;c.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where we are now.  The current refugees reside in areas under Israeli control, with little power or resources and generally cut off from the rest of the area.  The Israelis basically treat them like mad animals, while the Palestinians behave in ways that justify this treatment, wasting whatever resources they get in futile attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It didn't have to be this way - if Arafat had taken the deal and tried to build his country in a positive direction, then the current situation would be very different.  But he didn't.  He lead his country down a ruinous and self-destructive path, and now there is hardly any sentiment left in Israel for peace, with the Israelis mostly just trying to contain the Palestinians to limit what damage they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews have historically been extremely wealthy and influential for their small population.  Jewish conspiracies have been around for an extremely long time, and these conspiracies will continue for as long as Jews out-perform the rest of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean, however, that the conspiracies are real or that the claims made on this sub are correct.  Israel is most certainly not committing "genocide", for example; it is the most-heavily scrutinized country in the world, and its critics almost always biased, ignoring the greater context and excusing or outright ignoring Palestinians and Arab behavior.

       Jack, you'll find the truth here:
The Bible, Rev. Ch. 2 vs. 9 and Ch. 3 vs. 9.... "those who call themselves jews but are not, but are the synagogue of satan" This means those who 'converted' to Judaism... Khazars/Ashkenazi - who are Zionist running Israel - they are NOT jews, and to criticize them is NOT anti-Semitic b/c they're NOT semitic.
      </p>
      <p>
       A GREAT historian, Michael Hoffman puts out trustworthy info on his site Revisionist History.com
      </p>
      <p>
       Jake Morphonious/Blackstone Intelligence on you tube
      </p>
      <p>
       ALSO KNOW that the SAUDI's are Jewish Bloodline.... stemming from Abraham's seed. He got his slave girl, Hagar pregnant; who had Ishmel. Afterward his actual wife got pregnant with Issac and wanted Ishmel and Hagar sent away. They went to the town of Sheba - I think - in Saudi Arabia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, the current real jews have not converted or repented of killing your Creator/Christ. They did not want the Heavenly kingdom, they wanted Satan's earthly kingdom.... and are in control of it to this day. Expect the finale - with the 'chip' coming soon. 
Tell your mom she should be ashamed of herself for not teaching you properly and condemning both of you to misery... 'My people die from lack of knowledge'  Good for you in searching out the Truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important Truth God gives us to be saved is the fact that He sent His Son as the last blood Sacrifice - a continuation of the Old Testament Offering and Priesthood - established in the single church He established to offer It. 
Please check out 'Eucharistic Miracles'. These are PROPERLY consecrated Hosts/bread - some hundreds/thousands of years old - that have/are the flesh and blood of Christ. He allowed these miracles to show the unbelievers that He is not a liar; that His Promise to always be with us is Real. This flesh and blood match what is found on the Shroud of Turin, the Crucifixion site, Veronica's Veil and the Blessed Virgin Mary's.... it has one set of DNA.... belonging to Mary. You need two sets to be human; this shows He is Divine. Also, Bethlehem means bread, and He laid in a manger... meaning a feeding through. 
So, Life/salvation is only found in receiving what He left for us... Himself, His sacraments within the True Catholic Church - not the one currently portrayed in public as evil - as the buildings were infiltrated by the demons of satan to remove Christ's Real Presence on the altar so you would have no life/salvation. The Catholic Latin Mass is Christ's True offering to the Father for our sins. He is the Victim offered to Him; of which we are to receive to be counted as His. This is why the Satanists imitate the Latin Mass for their black masses - strictly the real catholic mass. The old boy knows very well the Power Christ gives us there, and is why he infiltrated to destroy It. He hates us, and has taken our only means of salvation from us.... unless you know that Christ has told us this would happen and has instructed us to offer It in union with the few true priests left in the world; receiving confession and His Real Presence spiritually to save our souls.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are His Greatest Truths.... I hope you run to them, and take your mother with you :)
In Christ, with much love, KAT

       One addition Jack so you can see how this relates to current events even more..... 
think Israel - created by the Rothschilds. Think ISIS .. created by Israel, SA and US. They've killed only Christians/Palestinians .... the remaining bulk of Catholics in the world.... and the original ones I might add. 
Think worldwide human and money control. Think Syria, Russia, Iran - who are not part of the Israeli banking system and either are or protect Chrisitians.  If they can be taken 'out' - total control of both the money and the death of spiritual Light and Eternal Life is theirs/satan's.
For more info on any of these subjects see Omni Christian Bookclub's catalog, m.h.f.m.com or their you tube site. Also see Marie Julie Jahenny/Briton Stigmatist for Christ's comments on these things, as well as remedies for the 3 Days of Darkness and Chastisement. LaSalette apparition for historical events predicted that have come true and those to come, as well as who the AC is .. Luther Htoo.

       AND ONE MORE THING - After killing Christ, God cursed the jews and dispersed them around the world; nullifying the covenant, the land that He had set aside for them. The real jews will tell you that it is only when God says they have converted will He re-establish the land to them. It's the Rothchilds who are dedicated to satan that bought the land and orchestrated the holocost to drive them back into 'Israel' to set up the 3rd temple for the AC.
