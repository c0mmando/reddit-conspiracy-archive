<p>This man never charged anyone, student or patient a dime, nor profited from his practice in anyway.</p>

<p>A team of scientists and medical doctors were dispatched to try and determine if he was fraud, and despite their best efforts to debunk him they could find no evidence of trickery.</p>

<p>The practice itself can be self verified as legitimate and has been my numerous students.</p>

<p>However whenever discussion of this practice occurs online only people promoting disinformation are allowed to have a voice, and anyone who cares about the actual practices and teachings are trolled into submission.</p>

<p>It is almost as if paid shills come out of the woodwork.</p>

<p>You said it so well. I meditated constantly for a while before just cuz I heard people experiencing cool shit and I wanted to know for myself if there&#39;s any truth to it, I experienced lot of cool stuff but at the end I realized it was kinda a waste of time for not focusing on more important aspects of my life and that&#39;s not what it&#39;s really about, spirituality is like a lifestyle, to be your best self in every regard and not just seeking for paranormal experiences. </p>

<p>When you do yoga, it is with a goal in mind to unlock chakras, awaken consciousness, spend hours doing mantras and breathing exercises for a future goal of Yoga/Union. Zen is a the goalless realization that you already are consciousness and Oneness.</p>

<p>Realizing what already is, is much more natural than contorting yourself into various positions and spending hours doing practices</p>

<p>A team of medical doctors and scientists did their best to uncover fraud. </p>

<p>He was stripped to his shirt and underwear and checked for metal and provided a demo indoors.  They suspected something in the house causing the effect so they go outdoors. Outdoors he gives another demo, and they suspect something on the property, so they go to a random hotel room that they themselves chose and got another demo.   He never charged anyone anything and was oath bound not to.  He was also xrayed at a local medical university and shown to be able to move a opaque mass around his body at will.  </p>
