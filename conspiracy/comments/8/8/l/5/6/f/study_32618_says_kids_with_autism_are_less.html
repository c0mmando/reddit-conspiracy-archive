        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So for those who don&#39;t know, the VSD is a tightly guarded data set of which kids got which vaccines. This huge study used that data, and looked at vaccination rates of kids with autism vs no autism AFTER their diagnosis. AFTER... Why not BEFORE? They had the data right there. What are they hiding?</p>

<p>As far as the vaccination rates after the autism diagnosis, all I can say is DUH!! The parents watched their kid regress into autism after a round of shots, and stopped giving shots. That&#39;s common fucking sense. </p>

<p>Of course, people don&#39;t read or think about studies, so when the news reports it, they make it sound like less vaccines = more autism. </p>

<p>Here is Del Bigtree explaining the study and why it&#39;s totally stupid. It&#39;s an entertaining little watch. <a href="https://youtu.be/DLeF7FvRBEg">https://youtu.be/DLeF7FvRBEg</a></p>

<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2676070?redirect=true">Here&#39;s the actual study.</a></p>

<p>Reminder to shills: There has STILL NEVER been a study comparing overall health and chronic illness of <strong>fully vaccinated</strong> kids with <strong>fully unvaccinated kids</strong>. The CDC says it&#39;s &quot;not ethical&quot; to do such a study (even though the data is already right there). There was this small pilot study, but the scientific community wasn&#39;t happy with the results lol <a href="https://archive.fo/DC1mj">https://archive.fo/DC1mj</a></p>

<p>And I&#39;m certain there have been unvaccinated kids that had autism, especially before mental disabilities had a recognized &#39;spectrum&#39; and any with disabilities were just considered retarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Considering 95% of polio infections are asymptomatic, and only 1% result  in paralysis, and even fewer of those result in permanent paralysis...</p>

<p>And considering they changed the diagnostic criteria for poliomyelitis <em>after</em> the vaccine came out, which artificially made it look like we beat polio...</p>

<p>And considering a lot of the &quot;poliomyelitis&quot; people were diagnosed with was actually caused by DDT poisoning or autoimmune processes (like we see often today)...</p>

<p>Yes, I&#39;ll take my chances. </p>

<p>I will say that the polio vaccine seems to be one of the safer ones though! If polio was one of the <em>only</em> vaccines given, I think kids would have a lot fewer problems these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am actually not here to argue with someone in your position. To the typical anti-vax conspiracy theorist, I only argue as hard as they argue with me. To be clear, I don’t throw insults or skew information and I’m more than willing to show my sources when asked. But for someone in your situation, I genuinely feel sad. Your experience parenting is more difficult than you anticipated it would be, and it’s common that symptoms of autism start making themselves known in young children, when they are getting vaccines every few months. It’s natural to be skeptical of something that you worry could have potentially hurt your child. You’re not a hobby conspiracist. It’s different. But often, people in your position have their fears about vaccines reinforced by uninformed, radical articles on the internet. </p>

<p>For you, I’m more interested in genuinely asking questions about what you experienced and what influenced you to believe what you do. If I can share knowledge or resources that might help you, then that’s even better, but I am not trying to argue with you. </p>

<p>I worked in children’s programming for about 8 years and worked extensively with children with disabilities, including children who are on the autism spectrum. In college I studied public health, child development and medicine. I now work in pediatrics, and now I deal with all of these things. Naturally this is a topic I am quite passionate about. I believe in good and repeatable science, and I am opposed to children living with lifelong hardship and/or dying from preventable diseases. If you think that makes me mean, then I guess I’m mean, and I’m sorry to have been a negative part of your day. I’ll leave you alone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re misunderstanding the study...none of the kids in the study were &quot;fully unvaccinated&quot; by your standards, and there was no cutoff before/after diagnosis with ASD. In fact, it doesn&#39;t sound like the dataset includes information about when the diagnosis was made at all, only if they received such a diagnosis (the kids were grouped separately, meaning data about any of the kids without ASD &quot;acquiring&quot; it over the course of the study does not exist as far as I can tell). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the study does not include info about their vaccination status before the diagnosis. The study looks at the vaccination status after their diagnosis.

    <div class="md"><p>This study was clearly not aimed at trying to prove/debunk a causal link between vaccines and autism. It was trying to look at whether parents are in fact less likely to continue vaccinating on time for their children (both with and without autism) after they had a child diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum. So basically it was trying to determine parental attitudes towards vaccination. </p>

<p>They aren’t hiding anything. The study very clearly states that the children in the study were on the recommended schedule of vaccines prior to one child in the family being diagnosed with autism. </p>

<p>So I guess, your explanation is somewhat correct, but your perspective and interpretation is off. Ironically, the researchers were trying to measure if people had the same train of thought as you do. And for the record, vaccines don’t cause autism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because 
1) that was not the focus of their study, they were focusing on attitudes towards vaccines AFTER an autism diagnoses. This was performed for insight about how people feel, not on the mechanism of vaccines nor autism 
AND/OR
2) there are already plenty of studies that show no relationship between vaccines and autism, so why waste their time on putting together yet another study that would not add any sort of new insight? </p>

<p>Do you honestly think that there haven’t been studies that have shown that there is no correlation between vaccines and autism? Just use Google scholar, type in “vaccines cause autism study” and you’ll find study after study, some even larger than this one, that show no correlation between vaccines and autism. If none of those studies convince you, then why would this one study be any different for you? </p>

You have read ALL of the studies about autism? Even the ones published in journals that you have to be subscribed to and pay in order to read? </p>

<p>I have looked into the conspiracies about vaccines and this is easily the most ridiculous one. I have read the easily replicated studies that TIME AFTER TIME shows NO relationship between vaccines and autism. What about them is poorly designed? Can you please tell me what methodology you’d rather see? How much do you know about scientific research? When was the last time you took a basic biology course and learned about basic scientific method? </p>

<p>Who is “they”?? And do you know why the CDC can’t do the study that you’re asking for? Not only would it be an incredibly broad and intensive study, but you wouldn’t have your answer for decades AND they would have to forcefully withhold vaccines from children, which is completely unethical. You cannot forcefully withhold proven medical treatment for the purposes of a study, we are no longer living in the dark ages. Instead, they study diseases and look for potential causes and trends in patients. And guess what? Vaccines don’t come up. Never.</p>

<p>I have heard the WHOLE story about the MMR vaccine, are you referring to the fully false reports?? Or the other totally false reports?? ;) </p>

<p>But now I would like to hear about your thoughts. You didn’t answer my one question about why this one study would be different for you. Will you answer that? </p>

<p>So according to your belief, why would the CDC, WHO, international health groups, as well as the vast majority of independent researchers, scientists, public health workers, doctors, and healthcare professionals, all promote vaccines if they are not only ineffective and unnecessary but actually CAUSE other diseases? </p>

<p>I already told you. Vaxxed vs completely unvaxxed. In terms of overall health and chronic illness. </p>

<p>Now you&#39;re doing the character attacks that every hardcore provax shll on here does. Trying to intimidate and appeal to authority. I won&#39;t even engage in this BS so don&#39;t do it again or we&#39;re done talking. </p>

<p>There would be nothing unethical about a <strong>retrospective</strong> study. The unvaxxed kids already exist.</p>

<p>There&#39;s all kinds of stupid medical practices that have been done over the centuries that we didn&#39;t know were harmful until later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You made it clear what you’re trying to say in multiple comments. You can back track if you’d like and I’ll allow you the dignity to do it because we both know the truth there. </p>

<p>Nope I haven’t read all the studies and I never claimed to, but you did. I have read a great number of them though because I work in pediatrics. You called out all of the current studies showing a lack of a link between vaccines and autism. I would assume you would have more specific knowledge to back up that view. Also “un-vax vs vaxxed long term” is not a methodology, that’s a study. I asked about procedures for the studies you criticized, not the study you would want to see. </p>

<p>Not trying to attack you for lack of education, I just asked because you seem to not understand the scientific method and applications of it. There are actual rules, ethics, and strict guidelines that researchers must follow, and even seemingly simple questions can be difficult fund or even design studies for, and you seem genuinely outraged that things can’t just “happen” like you want them to. For example, your solution for unethical research is retrospective testing, yet there are actually limitations to this type of study that would prevent that information from being considered statistically or scientifically significant, again, things are not as simple or straightforward as you might think. </p>

<p>As for the innuendo, this could be an entire unrelated discussion itself. Just take a simple fact checking article from snopes for now and if you want to talk more you can start a new thread dedicated to this topic. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bad-medicine/">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bad-medicine/</a></p>

<p>Finally, you don’t have a theory behind what might be at play? You just think a lot of brilliant people and large organizations all agree on something with a lot of scientific backing and yet you think it could just be people being dumb? Something that now has multiple generations over more than a century reaping its benefits with very few downsides, one of the most significant developments humans have made, billions of lives saved, yet you think it could be just idiots thinking it’s the best thing? No big pharma? No government mind control? I’ve got to say, that’s a new one. </p>

<p>Excuses excuses. So we can do all the epidemiological studies in the world, we can do all these &quot;vaxxed vs less vaxxed&quot; studies, but we can&#39;t do a vaxxed vs unvaxxed. Okay man. </p>

<p>I appreciate the link. It seems that snopes debunks this by offering an explanation for why the African American boys had more autism. A plausible explanation actually! But it doesn&#39;t prove that what Dr. Thompson said (the cover up attempt itself) was false. In fact it doesn&#39;t even attempt to disprove that.</p>

<p>More appeals to &quot;these people are smarter than you&quot; blah blah blah. As far as the conspiracy theory as to why? NWO, big pharma, who knows? I don&#39;t pretend to have it all figured out. </p>

<p>Yeah hipaa is important. So what? That&#39;s not a conspiracy that I said it&#39;s a tightly guarded dataset. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Certainly. </p>

<p>Aluminum is used as an adjuvant in many (not all) vaccines to stimulate an immune response. This isn&#39;t exactly controversial...Do I really need a citation?</p>

<p>The aborted fetal cells are what the pathogen is grown on in many (not all) vaccines, and it&#39;s not possible to filter it all out.
