    <div class="md"><p>Chemo kills in that it destroys all of the &quot;weaker&quot; cancer cells, thereby allowing any aggressive cancer cells that survive a completely open field to propagate and metastatize.</p>

<p>In other words, I believe going through chemo and having it not completely kill the cancer (which happens in a lot of cases) actually spreads the cancer faster than it would have if the person didn&#39;t go through chemo.</p>

<p>It makes sense that they don&#39;t use chemo on the elderly because they will probably die from something else before the cancer kills them. Younger people should be more judgemental about whether or not to use chemo depending on the type of cancer and its stage. </p>

<p>By going through chemo you might be trading months or even years of a slow decline from the initial cancer that might still allow a decent quality of life, for several months of the horrible existence of chemo treatments followed by a quick descent to death from the more aggressive post-chemo cancer (and none of your life during that time is &quot;quality&quot;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(This works preventative as well, of course.)</p>

<p>Stop eating garbage. Most Americans pay more attention to how they fuel their car than how they fuel their body. Switch to a raw, plant-based diet. Lots of fruits, lots of veggies. All organic, as clean as you can find. If you can&#39;t commit 100% (and that&#39;s difficult, I know), then maybe 70%. Or 50%. Maybe start with fruit until lunchtime. Don&#39;t think of this as an all-or-none scenario. Less poison is better than more.</p>

<p>Light exercise -- yoga or walking are great. They help move lymph, which contains metabolic waste which, if allowed to build up causes &quot;cancer&quot;, to your kidneys and liver for processing. Along the same lines, sweat is also a great way to pass this waste from your body. (Think of your skin as your third kidney.) I&#39;d argue that over-doing the exercise (say, hardcore crossfit or whatever) is actually harmful  in this respect as it builds up more acids.</p>

<p>De-stress. Being in a fight or flight state shuts down processing of metabolic waste, because hey running from that tiger is a top priority.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more, but that&#39;s a great start.</p>

<p>Cancer is a very broad term for a disease. We can cure some of them fairly well, but we have no universal treatment. I personally don&#39;t believe that the elites have an universal cure, but it&#39;s not impossible. If it exists, it&#39;s probably hidden and used very, very rarely. </p>

<p>Couple that with access to the best doctors and you could see how a VIP has a much bigger chance of surviving than a normal person. </p>

Q: How does lymph differ from interstitial fluid?</p>

<p>A: The only difference between lymph and interstitial fluid is its location. If the clear, colorless fluid is found in the spaces between body tissues, it is called interstitial fluid. If it is found in the lymphatic system, it is called lymph.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES. It&#39;s a multi-billion (trillion?) dollar industry, not to mention the political / population control aspect. &quot;Cancer&quot; is long since &quot;cured&quot;. Here, lemme copy paste something I just wrote:</p>

<p>(This works preventative as well, of course.)</p>

<p>Stop eating garbage. Most Americans pay more attention to how they fuel their car than how they fuel their body. Switch to a raw, plant-based diet. Lots of fruits, lots of veggies. All organic, as clean as you can find. If you can&#39;t commit 100% (and that&#39;s difficult, I know), then maybe 70%. Or 50%. Maybe start with fruit until lunchtime. Don&#39;t think of this as an all-or-none scenario. Less poison is better than more.</p>

<p>Light exercise -- yoga or walking are great. They help move lymph, which contains metabolic waste which, if allowed to build up causes &quot;cancer&quot;, to your kidneys and liver for processing. Along the same lines, sweat is also a great way to pass this waste from your body. (Think of your skin as your third kidney.) I&#39;d argue that over-doing the exercise (say, hardcore crossfit or whatever) is actually harmful  in this respect as it builds up more acids.</p>

<p>De-stress. Being in a fight or flight state shuts down processing of metabolic waste, because hey running from that tiger is a top priority.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more, but that&#39;s a great start.</p>

<p>Not my video, but a terrific 5 minutes summary: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carter is a vigorous and clean-living man and as a former President gets routine and thorough check-ups. In his 90&#39;s any cancerous growth or tumor he develops is going to grow extremely slow compared to anyone that&#39;s much younger. </p>

<p>His was probably very small when they detected it and not so difficult to cure without the extreme methods that are used on a majority of people who aren&#39;t even aware of just how invasive and extensive their cancers had become before it caused them enough trouble to see a doctor about it. A situation where if the cancer doesn&#39;t kill them what it takes to potentially cure it at that stage almost certainly will. </p>

<p>So there could be a logical explanation for Carter. As for McCain, on the other hand, who is most definitely a CIA pawn and plant and has been since his return from Nam, almost anything is possible in regards to whether his was what it was reported to be or some kind of a hedge against the shaky ground he happens to be on if he&#39;s ever called to account for his sins in this world before the Man Upstairs finally gets around to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you actually were any &quot;normal person&quot; who knows even a fraction of McCain&#39;s history and how he was drafted to replace another warmonger named Barry Goldwater and boosted up the political ladder, or how many people have been killed as result of him and other assholes like him, you wouldn&#39;t be trying to stick-up for the lying and untrustworthy bastard that he is. </p>

<p>And if in you&#39;d watched that vid I recommended, which you clearly didn&#39;t, you never would have referred to the person in it as &quot;a guy&quot; when it was clearly a woman from the very outset or not make any comments about the factual information she provided about McCain that comes mainly from government documents and sources.</p>

<p>That woman is Patty Hopper whose husband was an Air Force colonel and whose son was an Air Force pilot that was one of many MIA&#39;s in Nam. </p>

<p>She and her husband and countless others like them have been trying to get whatever information the US government may have about any of those missing men from the debriefings of the POW&#39;s that escaped or else were finally returned. </p>

<p>Debriefings that McCain has fought tooth and nail to prevent ever being released because they contain his own admissions of voluntarily violating the military code and the fact he was anything but the so-called &quot;hero&quot; he pretends to be. </p>

<p>Infractions he was actually charged for and was slated to be court-marshalled that was only prevented by Nixon giving a blanket pardon to him and a few others like him. That&#39;s in the records and from direct testimony from those in the military that prepared those charges.</p>

<p>Now run along, because you&#39;re not here with any interest in the truth but to continue to obscure and try to deny it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR - He was given an anti-PD1 antibody. </p>

<p>If you have a cancer that has a relatively high mutation load, then the proteins on the surface will have mutated sequences. The immune system should point at those and scream like Donald Sutherland in Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Think of it like organ transplant rejection: yes, it&#39;s still human cells, but your immune system knows it&#39;s not <em>your</em> human cells, so they know to attack it. </p>

<p>So, why doesn&#39;t the immune system get rid of all cancers? One way is checkpoint inhibitors. </p>

<p>PD-1 and PD-L1 come into play here. On immune cells responsible for killing other cells, you have a PD-1 receptor. PD-L1 is expressed by other immune cells as a &quot;whoa, I&#39;m an immune cell with weird random proteins on my surface, but I&#39;m not an invader or a cancer cell, so chill out&quot; signal. If your cancer cell, while randomly mutating and having random switches flip on and off, manages to turn on PD-L1, the immune system will ignore it and let it grow. If you give something to block PD-1 (Keytruda/pembrolizumab), then the immune system is going to ignore the &quot;ignore me&quot; signal. </p>

<p>So, <em>if</em> the cancer has a high mutation load and <em>if</em> the PD-1 was the <em>primary</em> checkpoint inhibitor that was being used to escape the immune system, then you&#39;ve got cancer cells that aren&#39;t immune to the immune system and an immune system ready to go crazy and mess them up. </p>

<p>There are about a dozen other pathways and other checkpoint inhibitors and confounding variables, but some people just have <em>really</em> good response to these things. &quot;Complete response to the point you don&#39;t need more treatments&quot; isn&#39;t uncommon (57/654 in the KEYNOTE-001 trial). </p>

<p>Jimmy Carter was just fortunate enough to have a type of cancer that we have a (new) treatment for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s just contemplate the economic ramifications of a widely available cure for cancer. </p>

<p>If it was announced that there was a cure, it would likely belong to a single coorporation. The entire feild of oncology would disappear overnight. Tens of thousands of people would lose their jobs in hospitals alone, that does not include the pharmaceutical industry who advocate for treatments rather than cures to maintain sales. Increased unemployment and lack of a diverse market means that most of the global market will be hit hard. The rich will be hit hardest, as well as the governments. They will lose vast amount of tax revenue not just from lack of pharma and hospital visits but just the decrease in spending globally will be enough to greatly accelerate global debt. </p>

<p>In short, it would cause the global market to spin into a depression far worse than anything we have previously experienced. Technology might even regress. </p>

<p>So I get it. They are in too deep. That lie is too buried and there is too much at stake. We simply cannot afford a cure for cancer.</p>
