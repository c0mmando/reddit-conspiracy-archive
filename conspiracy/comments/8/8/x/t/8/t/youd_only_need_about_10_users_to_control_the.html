        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I recently submitted a thread on the alleged poisoning by Putin assassins using Polonium. Due to a typo, I deleted the thread and resubmitted it.</p>

<p>The original thread (with Plutonium in the title) had +8 points, 79% upvoted, and submission statement +6</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/850f68/remember_that_russian_who_got_poisoned_with/">/r/conspiracy/comments/850f68/remember_that_russian_who_got_poisoned_with/</a></p>

<p>The resubmitted thread (which only differs in that it is Polonium in the title and was submitted 10 or so minutes later) has 0 points, 47% upvoted, submission statement -10 points. These stats were like this very early in the threads history.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/850ict/remember_that_russian_who_got_poisoned_with/">/r/conspiracy/comments/850ict/remember_that_russian_who_got_poisoned_with/</a></p>

<p>In other words, it got brigaded. They weren&#39;t alerted to it until I had resubmitted a new version.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s more evidence of brigading:</p>

<p>Two threads, exact same article, only difference being one uses &quot;pizzagate&quot; and the other doesn&#39;t, have such hugely different scores. The pizzagate thread got downvoted to 4, whereas the same thread without that word has a score of 46:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/88g6tb/teenage_victim_of_grooming_and_rape_speaks_out/">/r/conspiracy/comments/88g6tb/teenage_victim_of_grooming_and_rape_speaks_out/</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/88fjup/pizzagate_industry_knew_sick_pedophile_sexually/">/r/conspiracy/comments/88fjup/pizzagate_industry_knew_sick_pedophile_sexually/</a></p>

<p>Yet again, a thread that mentions 911 gets stuck at around 5. Whereas the same theory - no planes on 911 - which doesn&#39;t mention 911 gets to 45 and front page:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/88wkey/we_need_to_talk_about_this/">/r/conspiracy/comments/88wkey/we_need_to_talk_about_this/</a></p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/88uoyl/this_short_gif_shows_why_the_911_narrative_is_a/">/r/conspiracy/comments/88uoyl/this_short_gif_shows_why_the_911_narrative_is_a/</a></p>

<p>I believe there is probably a brigade of about 10 people who downvote certain threads and keep them stuck on controversial and prevent them getting to the top. They&#39;re not bothering to read the thread they only vote if it has key words like &quot;pizzagate&quot; etc.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had similar thoughts about r/movies and r/worldnews. Same effect and for the same reason. Control of content.</p>

<p>You get a small group of people hanging around keeping track of new posts. They act as a group and upvote the content they want to promote and downvote competing or undesirable links.</p>

<p>It works too. This is because of the karma points system. A lot of users see a brand new post that&#39;s already sitting at 38% upvotes and they&#39;re outta there. The easily swayed will see downvotes and be predisposed to disagreeing and downvoting too.</p>

<p>The reverse holds true for a few upvotes. A link that has 5 or 10 upvotes in the first 15 minutes is going to get a way more favorable perception. All other things being equal, it will get more comments and more upvotes.</p>

<p>There was a user named unidan who got banned for running a do-it-yourself brigade system. He was using a small number of alt accounts to upvote his own posts. Those quick few upvotes were leading to a pile of follow on upvoting.</p>

<p>Then a few mods noticed and figured out what he was doing and he got banned.</p>

<p>A brigade of 10 or 15 different users wouldn&#39;t be as noticeable though. It&#39;s also harder to prove and ban one account and they just active a new one. 5 minutes later you&#39;re right back where you started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have ~20 one-year-old accounts that, with the help of [PRAW](<a href="http://www.praw.readthedocs.io">www.praw.readthedocs.io</a>) , would post new articles from a list of sites that had greater than 5% word density of &quot;Trump&quot; and &quot;Putin&quot; to r / politics automatically.</p>

<p>For those that don&#39;t know, PRAW is Reddit&#39; API that developers (but really, it&#39;s for advertisers and political orgs) use to make bots.</p>

<p>It was initially because I found the Russia hysteria hilarious, but I&#39;ve since stopped the script.  For a smaller, more targeted sub like this, it wouldn&#39;t really be too hard to automate the entire thing outside of the comments (it&#39;s way more effective to comment as a person).</p>

<p>and with mod support, you can DEFINITELY start shaping the narrative you want</p>

<p>We all forget how the hivemind works though - it could just be that this subreddit is now a bit more mainstream so we have the loudest of the normies coming in here with their stubborn opinions. </p>

<p>That&#39;s actually a really good point. Could we be scaring off non TMOR users by assuming they&#39;re TMOR users?</p>

<p>Maybe we&#39;ve been outplayed by them putting us on the defensive?</p>

<p>The people that care about objective discourse and entertaining what the mainstream would call stupid ideas will move into smaller communities and the things they uncover may never leave those communities - definitely in the interests of the power that be...</p>
