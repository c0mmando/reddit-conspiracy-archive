       It’s late and this might get buried but I wanted to know if anyone has been seeing ads for things they don’t google, talk about or text about? I understand Facebook/Google listening to us through our microphones and have seen ads related to things I’ve had casual conversations about near my phone and seen ads for things I’ve googled and researched. But lately I see ads for very random things that I’ve recently thought about only in my mind and it’s creepy af. Here’s a couple examples: I live in a tropical climate where it never snows, the other day I randomly thought about the boots with spikes people wear when hiking on icy mountains...hadn’t watched any movies about icy mountains, hadn’t clicked on any articles or searched anything remotely related and it was a very fleeting thought while I was driving..an hour later I see several ads for hiking boots with spikes and a couple for trips to Antarctica. Another example, I’m walking in my neighborhood admiring the neighbors flowers and thinking how rare blue flowers are, next hour I see ads for blue flowers/seeds. This isn’t confirmation bias and it’s happening almost every day, has anyone else had this happen?

       I have not. It's actually been sad how one track the ads are. Pet supplies really? All my mobile ads are generic trash that's barely recognizable as a product. Or pet supplies.

       Ads?  I see very few of them, as I run ad-blockers and ignore the few that make it through on Facebook. It's also why I try to avoid watching live TV and record everything.

       Could be confirmation bias. Only now you're noticing ads that were there all along.

      <p>
       Or alternatively it just the good old coinky-dink.

       Assuming that our brain is a 'transreceiver' (an antenna basically), it's only safe to assume that a thing like this will work both ways (especially through 'smart' systems) whereby said device doesn't just transmit but also receives and processes electromagnetic impulses in order to produce the desired outcome - a projection of your thoughts on a screen.

       There was a website I found through godlike productions years ago. It described a system of cellular towers being used to manipulate human brains. But the weird part was, it only worked because our minds are quantum computers. I forget the URL. And have never had luck with the way back machine.

       You should note and be aware of the fact that the vast majority of our concious thought is not original. These thoughts come from some external stimuli or others who implant the thought in us.

       It is a mistake to take ownership or identify with any thoughts you have imo

       You're spreading that Sam Harris bullshit on the wrong sub.

       Go spread it on r/worldnews or r/politics where original thought truly is an endangered species.

       I would say what OP might be seeing is subliminal messages followed by the actual targeted ad.
Make them unconsciously aware of something. It becomes a thought or desire and follow up with the target ad.

       Yep, advertisers have been doing this for years but it's gotten worse. In the old movies you would unconsciously see product placement but now they literally focus on them purposely.  Like in Jurrasic World where they zoom in on all the Mercedes-Benz. I took a class in college out of curiosity and a lot of the stuff I learned I still spot and see today. For instance most slogans that you can recall or remember are 7 syllables or word. Nothing more. Look Home Depot or Lowe's, do you know their slogans?

       I'm one of those odd people that advertising doesn't work on me. I have to be interested in or have already shopped for an item before an ad gets my attention. And usually by the time the ad gets to me I've already got it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most obvious place you'd think it would work is food. Does that ad for a pizza at 6pm make me call Domino's? No. It just prompts me that I'm hungry and need to go to the kitchen and start dinner.

       This is the most logical answer imo. Mind reading tech in your home or car would be possible I guess, but its much more likely that a prompt you barely notice is followed by an ad.

       The only ads that I typically get are for video games that I play. They've got me on those, but when it comes to everything else I'm interested in, they fail. Xbox/Microsoft knows my purchasing habits, but that's it. I try not to use plastic for most purchases. It creates too many inseparable links.

       It isn’t all that far fetched to think that our devices could hear what we’re thinking when you remember that in 2004 scientists collected rat neurons and were able to listen to the “conversations” that the neurons had within the neural network they made. They even used this data to fly a flight simulator with the Petri dish neural network.

       All I can say is that there has to be some minimum level of coincidence in your life. Level should fluctuate also because random phenomena fluctuate over short periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're looking at hundreds of webpages and thousands of images, the odds of coincidental appearances should be a lot higher than they'd be if you were only online for 5 or 10 mins a day.

       They’re definitely on point when it comes to spying on you, and advertising to you using that data, that I feel the machine has down nearly 100%, but I don’t think they can read your mind.
Using an algorithm and location data it would be fairly easy to pinpoint just about anybody’s needs with eerie accuracy. You can guess things about your friends just by making simple observations, I feel like a machine that spies on you 24/7 would yield amazing results when it comes to guessing things about us. I don’t think we’re as unique or complicated as we imagine ourselves to be, nobody wants to feel average but we all share the vast majority of basic needs which can easily be extrapolated into specific products.

       I think this is the best answer. It's eerie what they can guess about you personally, just based on the "matrix" of indicators they get from thousands of data points you give them, and then they associate your data with every other person that shows up as "similar".
      </p>
      <p>
       So, out of millions in your demographic category, if 20 other people that have very similar patterns of online interactions to yours, are searching for some kind of product, guess what? You want that product, and they will know it as soon or sooner as you do.

       You can test this by being random and doing something a little different, and telling no one, and not looking it up on anything connected to the internet. How connected are we to this spying network, and how blatant are they willing to use it to target us? Check out a book about playing the tuba from a library but don't google it at all; see if you get ads for repairing tubas. Start making pen drawings out of the blue. Will their ad network guess this and advertise drawing pads? Will the cameras around your house be able to tell what you're doing? "That's a nice rendering, Dave. I think you've improved a great deal" says the camera on the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not there, quite yet. At the moment, I doubt you'll even get tuba repair ads on your phone if you start subscribing to r/tuba on reddit on your desktop. However, if an algorithm has our thoughts down pat, I doubt they'll tip their hand by using it to show us crummy commercials. They probably have far more nefarious purposes for guessing our thoughts.

       I’ve waited for someone to post this because I thought I was going fucking nutty. This has happened to me a few times. Scanning IG. Saw a picture someone posted of an island. (Didn’t click the photo or like it) Thought that’d be nice place to travel. Never spoke a word to anyone. Never searched this island. And next thing I know ads on IG and Pinterest for this damn island.

       If you have a front-facing camera, I'm sure it follows where your eyes look, and it already knows how long you stay on a page, or before you scroll away from something. Ditto web cams. So "it" knows that you looked at certain parts of a page (pictures, headlines, ads, etc), and where your eyes lingered. That can be almost as useful as tracking clicks.

       Could also be worth noting that instagram tracks how long you look at certain images. So even if you didn't actually click or like the photo, if you looked at it longer than average, that would be enough evidence to them that you're interested. Quite sneaky really.

       Welcome to the Matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was on the phone with my kid the other day. We live on separate coasts and often spend time on the phone absent conversation, like zoned out. We were both reading unrelated online content during a lull in the conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading Instagram or some such, she used a word out loud that I was reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I call it the matrix. A server somewhere had a little glitch and I get a peek behind the curtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as seeing products you've though about, yes indeed. Mine are conceptual usually, as my brain isn't visually oriented per se. I believe this could be suggestion and confirmation through all the unnoticed stimuli we are bombarded with all the time. Algorithm if anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Baader-Meinhof" phenomenon: noticing the Subaru model you test drove last week, or some analogous example. . Suddenly that word, object, or person start popping up everywhere. You start wondering how it was you never noticed so all these obnoxious Subarus! You decided those are for aggressive little fuck-boy cunts who want to drag race at the lights and you've got to show them what's what in your bad-ass sleeper, the supercharged Audi S4... See you later, fuck-boy with the ole' "one in the pink, one in the stink" bumper sticker. What a cunt he is. I'm a different kind of cunt, you think to yourself. More the European car-cunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, I'm super paranoid naturally, and have suspected foul play with things only thought of. AND I live near a bunch of military installations with secret technology. I have no reason to believe there's some coincidence. Sometimes. The meds are working.

       ANYWAY, Tin foil hats have proven to restrict the transmission of... Bullshit.

      <p>
       Now I'm joshing you... good luck with either pill you choose. I chose a mood-stabilizer. But I'm already woke.

       Take a look at the controversy over Facebook psychological profiling based on likes and interface behavior tracking. They can work up a statistically probably profile with very little information on a user. I would probably be willing to earn a million dollars just to bet that the ability to do this is not unique to Facebook.
      </p>

       They are predicting your mind based on your monitored motions. An algorithm can remember that you were on a page where a headline you were otherwise ignoring was talking about something to do with mountains. A statistically appropriate time later, an ad network knows it is time to show you an ad you might react to (which you did) because the concept may have since crossed your conscious mind (which it did, in the car).

       This seems like magic, but it is really just indicative of the unacknowledged narrowness of each person's domestic enculturation.

       I don't know if this might be going on, but I will be reading about a certain topic and a phrase or word I want to look into will pop up.  I'll start typing it into the search bar and the phrase I'm looking for is the top result, maybe the words from our browsers are also taken into account.

       It's not outside the realm of possibility that there was predictive analytics at play. Even if you weren't specifically talking or searching for, say, mountain boots, it's possible that you did, or you were a part of some activity, that lead up to that event.

       See this article from 2012 (time flies!) about Target's predictive marketing based on user data:

       Obviously you can say "I wasn't doing any of those things" but without knowing the algorithms used by the advertising companies, you have no idea what data points they are tracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a cognitive bias element at play here. Maybe you don't recall or think you did anything that would lead to this behavior, but from a marketer's standpoint you were showing clear signals.

       I think you're right: This isn't mindreading, advertisers have set themselves up such that they can hijack people's associative reasoning systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that given OP's demographics and content consumption, they can get certain people into the mood to buy certain products. The products then appear as advertising just when the predictive programming kicks in.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP might watch certain shows, and those shows cut a deal with advertisers to get people in the mood to buy hiking boots (maybe the sure-footed hero wore boots, or lost his footing on TV only to be saved by a booted person). The boot sales people know they have a certain window in which they can profit, so they boost online advertisement within that window.

       It’s definitely predictive analytics.  The algorithms are so immensely clever now, companies spend a fortune to buy the software to choose what to market to you.  You may not know where your next adventure will be yet but the software can make a very educated guess.

       Not to belittle your experience, but I assume you see tens to hundreds of ads every day. The only ones that are going to stand out to you are the ones that confirm your theory.

       I have when i was at my friends. Literally a minute after he pulled out apple cider vinegar. He didn't say anything about it and i had an ad pop up. I think Facebook accessed my camera. That happened a year ago. Nothing like that since thankfully.

       Yeah, the other day I was thinking about that movie I loved as a kid, you know, Karate Kid. So then next time I went on YouTube there was a advertisement for a new Karate Kid movie and I was like WTF. All I did was think about it and there it is! OMFG!!!

       On Amazon just now on my computer (no webcam no mic, don't use app on my phone) I searched for "Ice pack" and on related items was "sugar free nicotine gum" which was what I was that second JUST thinking about. Whats even weirder is I haven't spoke about or even taken a nicotine gum in weeks and I was just thinking about it, how on earth is it related to ice packs. SOOOOOO creepy. Immediately thought about this post and had to comment on it lol

       Yes, our thoughts can be precursors that anticipate 'real life' events, including digital stimuli. Paranormal psychology experiments have verified this in various ways. Quantum physics has also discovered and portrayed these principals experimentally &amp; conceptually. Outside of the spiritual traditions of meditation and occult knowledge, this aspect of the mind is mostly unknown and untaught. Which is unfortunate, as I have found that people who spontaneously discover these predictive capacities within themselves (yogis call them siddhis) often encounter confusing difficulties given that the society is not organized around these intrinsic abilities of the mind to defy basic assumptions of linear causality.
