        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In our most popular messaging app Telegram a group related to recent Iranian protests with bunch of monarchist shills and curious people, someone sent a personal message saying something like &#39;along reminding your friends to leave the group, please leave the terrorist group [group name] or legal actions will be taken against you as association with terrorism groups.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no conspiracy really, it was a public group and every member&#39;s name was there.</p>

<p>Being in that situation when you know both sides are fucking with everyone and they force you to make unnecessary decisions exactly <em>because</em> both sides are intentionally fucking with everyone I just couldn&#39;t stop laughing at the whole situation they created, felt so bizarre I had to share.</p>

<p>The equivalent in US would be something like civil forfeiture, having to prove your innocence instead of innocent until proven guilty, people taking people&#39;s stuff cuz they&#39;re supposedly protecting someone. It&#39;s just fucking ridiculous to imagine some people really think like that and they&#39;re helping their society. </p>

<p>A better example probably is the government torturing and gathering all data on innocent citizens, allowing terrorists to run free and sometimes help them commit terrorist acts while also making people sicker with their medicine, dumber with their indoctrination and poorer with their money then say ahhh the weapons is what&#39;s wrong in this equation...facepalm at government shill logic.</p>

<p>Then they say I&#39;m the weird one for believing governments follow some kind of really retarded A.I and don&#39;t possess true organization, as if I&#39;m trying to create a boogyman. No that&#39;s not what I said. They follow flawed methods and it shows through their presentation, all we have to do is look, truth doesn&#39;t need anyone to debate on it&#39;s behalf and always comes out eventually, the important thing to keep in mind is how we implement changes not if they will occur or not.    </p>
