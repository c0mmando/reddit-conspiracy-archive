        Take this comment
       </a>
       for example...notice the same tactics being used:
      </p>
      <p>
       OP is bemoaning the effect of T_D on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , even claiming that T_D "has hit this thread." This is demonstrably false for several reasons, which I explained in my reply to OP's comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a perfect example of the new "up is down" mentality they're trying to sell us with respect to brigading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that subs like TMOR have been exposed for this type of reprehensible behavior, they seem to be getting more brazen by admitting that this behavior is taking place. You'll note that the beneficiaries of the TMOR brigades have developed a new talking point, namely they "acknowledge" that brigading is fucked up, all the while enjoying their role as beneficiaries of the brigades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, they continue to justify their behavior by claiming that "other subs" like T_D engage in the exact same behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me spell it out again:
       <em>
        they don't.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This phenomenon is
       <em>
        almost entirely
       </em>
       associated with subreddits like TopMindsofReddit, which only exist to mock and disrupt the activities of other subs (how pathetic, eh?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time you see someone "crying T_D" in a thread that's been buried and
       <em>
        clearly
       </em>
       not brigaded by T_D, don't hesitate to call them out.

       It's not that t_d brigades here, it's that they were invited here and the mod guildlines seem to let them away with murder (that user with Shill in his name constantly seemingly avoiding bans)
      </p>
      <p>
       TMOR links probably do skew the votes more on individual posts but the overall feeling of this sub is that people who believe Russia is conspiring to undermine western democracy, with all its failings, are being idiot MSM sheep who are marginalised for the sake of appeasing this constant contrarian attitude that Russia is cool let's just ignore all of recent history...
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't really think t_d is actively brigading (though they have done eg during the Macron leaks and the the 2016 election cycle) - rather "people" believe the sub is more accepting of them simply because of mod actions on various posts and users (unverified allegations, lots of bans and meta drama posts).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my perspective at least.

      <p>
       You do discriminate, I've seen you ban people you disagree with by going back through their comment history for some borderline rule violation months ago. I've seen you ban people for "having an agenda" which is merely a point of view you don't agree with. The list goes on.

       It's impossible to discuss these issues with you openly and honestly because this post will be removed and I will be banned for mentioning the well documented bias your mod team displays.

       I see you don't moderate any subs so let me help:
       <em>
        This is how you moderate
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       When a user is responsible for a rule violation, that's enough to earn them a warning. At this point, their account is under review and yes we
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       go through their history to see what kind of contributions they've made to the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they have a history of repeated rule violations, they earn a ban. It's really not that hard of a concept to grasp.

       The selective application of the rules is the problem. Here I am, a user having a discussion with you, a mod, I have no power yet you are threatening me with a ban for daring to discuss these things. I'm not in the conclave so I have no recourse.

       This sub trumpeted the official narrative and plenty of MSM reporting when it came to Clinton's email server. Nonstop. It's only when Trump or Putin have been in the crosshairs that the narrative is supposed to be suspect.

       The MSM narrative was that Hillary's e-mails weren't a big deal, people on here stayed up day and night going through them trying to prove it was a big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point stands, I am not saying "the MSM is wrong 100% of the time and you need to believe the exact opposite of what they say" or that we aren't allowed to discuss something if the MSM acknowledges that it exists  - which seems to be what you think that I think.

       Actually I said it's not your fault because you probably had only seen a misrepresented version of events.  I'm not sure how that makes you a gullible sheep but that's fine, you can be mad at me for phantom reasons.

       People like me will be just fine without your approval.  As a matter of fact that how I know I think for myself and that I'm not desperately trying to find a group that will make me feel better about myself by congratulating me and rewarding me for successfully repeating the prayers in Latin regardless of my ability to understand Latin.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can they concede a small point when they don't even understand the Latin they are speaking?  When your argument is a memorized mantra and your belief in it is based upon identity and not understanding, you are incapable of conceding anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm not saying these things about you, I sincerely thanked you because you actually read my side of events and said "I hadn't considered that angle".  This doesn't make you a sheep, a sheep is the person who can't get past the title before they have passed judgement, they can't even consider that the title in the vernacular of TD users is actually using their own meme against them to draw attention to the fact that they crossed our borders and immediately started breaking our laws.  Something they rightfully complain about with illegal immigrants in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       I chose my words carefully when I addressed the sudden wave of refugees we experienced the day that The_donald went private, and my words literally stopped a huge problem in it's tracks.  If the people bitching about my post had any idea of how many "cucktard" comments we had removed that morning, how many users we had to ban for shit posting, they would understand why the mod team decided such a post was needed and why kekistani was the best language to post it in.

       TD threw their little tantrum entirely of their own volition. They were slapped on the wrist for massively abusing reddit's algorithms and their response was to cry and go private. Nobody forced them to do it, and making a big show of inviting them here was an incredibly stupid move.

       Why was the offer on the table in the first place? T_d shut itself down for 12 hours in protest of reddit taking them off the front page, it's not conspiracy business.

       You act like it's not the same exact offer provided to every user who decides to visit this website. Their sub was "being shutdown" for all they knew and there was
       <em>
        plenty
       </em>
       of conspiracy discussion taking place in that sub, a lot of stuff that was being outright banned anywhere else. Obviously they were going to flood to somewhere, and many were going to come here. It was less of an offer and more of a warning - If you participate in this sub and don't follow the rules you will be banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it's all really seeming to be about is how anything that appears negative about the left, even on their own accord, has been coopted as some sort of conservative aligned propaganda (Seth Rich/Podesta) when many of the people who investigated these conspiracies supported Bernie and didn't vote for Trump.

       If our sub is about to be flooded with "refugees" from another sub with a political bias, I believe it's our

       as mods to inform the community about it.

       This is stupidity. You honestly think a lot of those who post in TD aren't aware of this sub? Half the shit they post there is about some kind of conspiracy. THAT'S why there's some crossover between the two subs. TD users that do come here have an actual interest in conspiracies, which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for those that are truly brigading this sub.

       In the last year or so "conspiracy" has been used as a cover for spreading fake news with a pro-Trump agenda.

       Yeah I don’t think they brigade necessarily. It’s just that they basically think any conspiracy against a liberal is true, anything about a republican or trump is a lie and is being used to distract from Clinton, and the fact that their sub doesn’t allow any negative talk about trump seems to carry over to how they talk about him here. One example is that Clinton emails are a big deal for them (which id agree with) but then any email or text or call showing a link between trumps campaign and russian intelligence is fake. I’m sure this example will get blasted because it’s MSM narrative. Just a reminder, MSM isn’t 100% lies, it’s some truth and some lies with their own spin on things a lot of times.

       Not really. The same kinds of denials and deflections took place when George W. Bush was in the White House -- and just about exactly the same percentage of people voted for Donald Trump as voted for Mitt Romney. Who else could they be but basically the same people?
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't explain r/conspiracy. Donald Trump support in this sub mostly represents those same kinds who voted for George W. Bush, and are now LARPing that they hated him but Donald Trump is the real deal. Basically, Republicans saw an opportunity to weaponize and partisanize conspiracies and ran with it.

       When the MSM does not support the sitting president and goes out of its way to push anti-president narrative, then you will find conspiracy people focused on supporting the President.

       If MSM and President stand together - then you will find conspiracy people discussing conspiracies about the President.

       When the president puts people in position to act against those organizations, isn't transperancy in regards to his past with his tax returns and has an administration that wants to use their budgets for their own travel the MSM will talk about it.

       It would be healthy if the MSM put all politicians and big corporations under a microscope.  Unfortunately that is not the case so we have a divided political environment with pretend news taking sides.  Can't blame the President for this one.  We should focus on the bill that allows for this behavior.

       We need new mods here. The current mods are terrible at being unbiased and just ban whoever they disagree with, then they complain when people make fun of them at TMOR. TMOR is filled with people who were banned for expressing a view that doesn’t match the mods view. Disgusting.

       This has been happening for so long and everyone refuses to acknowledge it. The mods here are basically creating 'white walkers' who will forever downvote the mods' posts because of stupid bans. Every time they fucking wonder why their posts get downvoted, and never stop and think "hmm maybe the hundreds of active reddit users I banned might have a grudge against me..."

       I'm curious what OP and others think about the obvious voting discrepancies between posts that get voted to the top of the hot thread and the top comments in those posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As others have pointed out in the past, we get lots of (apparently) pro-Donald posts quickly upvoted to the top of the hot thread, and then the most upvoted comments are critical/debunk attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads (I think) people to say that TD 'brigades' in the form of mass upvoting of posts themselves, but they don't bother as much with the actual comment section.
      </p>
      <p>
       (This makes some sense, part of the TD storming /all period was just about mass upvoting for visibility, while the comments were hardly ever substantive, just cheerleading. It's not brigading, per se, but it is a clear tactic for forum manipulation.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, it looks like TMOR and politics users 'brigade' the comments, but fail to really do much about the visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll just restate my initial curiosity: Why this discrepancy? Are we really to believe that TD is really good at upvoting posts for visibility and TMOR is really bad at downvoting posts to hamper visibility? Are we really supposed to believe that the comments are run by TMOR users (etc.) and that whoever is upvoting posts to the top of the hot thread just aren't interested in dealing with the comments section?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find the whole thing fucky and all about bad faith on both sides of this stupid ass argument folks keep wanting to have around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seem to be two options:
      </p>
      <p>
       It gets real iron-fisty around here: The gatekeeping stops (I'm calling out OP on this as well - much as I understand why you do it, I think your crusade is galvanizing the conflict, not resolving it). The brigading stops. The shill accusations result in immediate deletion of comments and the call for civility and rational discourse needs to be made loud and clear. Bans for violations fly until the culling is complete and this place reflects whatever those who hold the keys would like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Option 2: We just let this be a wild west free for all without whining about how it turns out. We disable voting entirely to foster this. Threads and comments stop being 'hot' or 'best', they just add to the mix. We effectively de-weaponize the debate and get back to free thinking and discussion.

       Wait, so your proof is a highly upvoted thread on r/conspiracy that calls out T_D brigading bots where anyone even

       of the post has anywhere from -20 to -50 points and no rebuttals as to why their points are potentially invalid? I'd have to do some digging since I could find it by scanning that thread, but around the time these T_D bot analysis threads were coming out there was also lots of evidence to show that these "T_D bots" were sockpuppets tied to TMoR specifically used to discredit this sub and associate it with T_D.

       I'm working on a script that will show what percentage of commenters on a particular post also regularly participate in a given subreddit. I will be compiling a report on the activity in posts close to the election and now, comparing crossover activity from the_donald and politics. I think it would also be interesting to perform sentiment analysis on the comments from these threads to measure in a very broad sense the support for the president over time.

       I agree but calling someone out is basically a shill accusation. When someone points out  a user only posts on TMoR or r/politics or has never posted outside of muh Russia threads they run the risk of being banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills exist on both sides. It is clear which side dominates Reddit. At this point TD shills sit back and relax. ShareBlue, thinkprogress etc. are making their own party look bad.

       The MSM narrative was that Hillary's e-mails weren't a big deal, people on here stayed up day and night going through them trying to prove it was a big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point stands, I am not saying "the MSM is wrong 100% of the time and you need to believe the exact opposite of what they say" or that we aren't allowed to discuss something if the MSM acknowledges that it exists  - which seems to be what you think that I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a generalization, you trying to find something that the MSM and

       I'm working on a script that will show what percentage of commenters on a particular post also regularly participate in a given subreddit. I will be compiling a report on the activity in posts close to the election and now, comparing crossover activity from the_donald and politics. I think it would also be interesting to perform sentiment analysis on the comments from these threads to measure in a very broad sense the support for the president over time.

       The fact is, we need numbers. Without quantitative analysis, this is all just noise.

       It's really not your fault.  I'm sure you were exposed to a misrepresented version of events.
