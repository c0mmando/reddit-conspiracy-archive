       Ya not just Disney characters. Pixar, Marvel, all superheroes for that matter, novels for kids and young adult literature.. I see what you’re saying but the parentlessness is a trope that has lived as archetype in stories of all kinds.

       Aaand who owns Pixar and Marvel ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Story goes that Disney never got over losing his own Mother. I don’t buy that one personally since many of the films he was behind were based on / stolen from old folk and fairy tales

       I think this way:
      </p>
      <p>
       From what we know about trauma, it yields the type of responses in the “victim” (viewer), that make a person an ideal consumer and plebeian.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        feels unsure of himself, insecure about the world around him, anxiety (unconsciously more likely to trust a parental type entity)
       </li>
       <li>
        creates addictive behaviors (trauma is the shovel that digs the hole in our soul that we try to fill with food, sex,drugs and anything else that gives us a positive initial feeling)
       </li>
       <li>
        learns (too soon?) the raw deal- your parents will DIE. This steals the mental slow realization - robbing the child of the natural existential moment that would be healthy for the forming mind, and instead shoving a copy, a fraudulent idea in there.
       </li>
       <li>
        trauma is the driver inside of family dysfunction. All are traumatized but to varying degrees. It causes emotional outbursts, distrust, anger, depression, it’s general emotional confusion- all these feelings, all not good, and you aren’t even sure where from.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Line from a book:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        ”Television trauma won’t kill you because you watch Snow White or Batman or Bambi or Nemo or Full House or Jumanji, but it will eat away at the human spirit and corrupt the soundness of the individual mind. The ubiquitous trauma that oozes from every pore and pixel on the screen is  hikacking the Hivemind- a death by a thousand paper-cuts. “
       </em>

       Fantastic, I think that analyzing the movies with their final objectives in mind is the way forward into reverse engineering their secrets, and we can analyze the effects we can see their stuff produces.

       Most of it isn’t that secret and takes little analysis beyond being open to it and not being so naive that you think, “They wouldn’t try to sneak controlling concepts in a little innocent tv show.” Why WOULDNT they? It’s a natural medium for control. Literally everything on tv has been run through the sieve, a checking system that DOES have some merit, albeit minor. They do have to check that no accidental/purposeful control techniques are used that would hurt people. They’d use that though (“words are powerful and we have to make sure no accidental negative subliminals) to be in there and put in whatever they want under the guise of... whatever they want. If people started watching TV with a discerning eye ... they’d be SHOCKED AND APPALLED AT WHAT THEY SEE.

       Disagree respectfully. These movies are about individuality making the heroes special. The sad, lost periods of the stories come when the heroes are surrounded by hive dwellers who bring anyone outside the norm down.

       If it's not a conspiracy, it's because everyone was raised by at least their mother so it's a heartstring that's easy to pluck; it's a an easy, go to setback over which the protagonist must overcome.

       If naming a club, that anyone would have access to if they paid enough money, Club 33 was enough proof, then Larry Bird is obviously a Mason.  I've looked at it before and beyond being involved in the Masons' youth group, the name of which escapes me, IMO there's no proof he was in the Masons as an adult.  Most Masons do not hide the fact.  Why would he?

       In Sufism woman are highly regarded which is in stark contrast with the barbaric patriarchal system that dominates it. ‘To know a woman is to know oneself’ and ‘ to know one self is to know the Lord’
      </p>
      <p>
       The feminine nature that we all have is all but forgotten by most. It runs amok. Woman control households from the shadows and with their emotions while the men run with an iron fist. This is slowly starting to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men are to be the tillers. To lift up the woman. To care for her. To make her strong and her roots deep. So she may properly take her role as the leader.

       Thanks for this, I totally get what you mean, I have noticed how the more patriarchal the society the more the woman is an special fragile creature,  the reason why insulting a mother is a terrible insult for a manly man on these type of societies. we are on the right track, thanks.

       Absent mothers is a trope that goes back to the oral traditions of folk and fairy tales, probably because death by childbirth was so common back then that a lot of children would have grown up without mothers or with step mothers. Since Disney's early films were based on fairy tales it makes sense they don't have mothers.

       That is the Mainstream explanation, thanks for bringing that here, I will put it on the description next time I ask a version of this question here later today, Im looking for the occult reason, for example the mainstream reason for the Disney films to have hidden sex references is animator shenanigans, but the real occult reason is subliminal programing to create fetishes and the sort, I was just wondering about the occult motives for the missing mothers.

       I see, in which case I'd say he might have been attracted to fairy tales because of the female tropes in them. A good book about women in these stories is From the Beast to the Blonde by Marina Warner, it also covers the 'monstrous feminine' such as witches, evil stepmothers etc. I don't know much about Disney's personal life despite being a big fan of animation, I will have to look into it and see if I find anything.
