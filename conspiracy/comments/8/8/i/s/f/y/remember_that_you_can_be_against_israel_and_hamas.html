        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ss: when ever the Israel Hamas conflict raises and is in the news, both sides fight and act like by not supporting them, you agree with the other. Both sides have terrible leadership and do atrocious things. Don&#39;t fall into the typical spiel today. Both sides conspiring to ruin it need to leave.</p>

<p>Edit: lets try to leave religion out of this and strictly talk Israel Palestine. I realize I haven&#39;t, but it&#39;s best to call them by their nationality. America&#39;s golden rule is freedom of religion, but also having a government free of religion. If people want to be our ally, I think they should adhere to this rule. Religious states like ISIS Saudi Iran Israel are insanely dangerous and do not have a place in a modern world working towards equality and understanding. So let&#39;s use nations not religion in these arguments. These religious states hide behind their religion. If we can strip them of that, they must communicate as human beings and their actions judged as such. It will also protect you from the simple fall back that you want all Jews or all Arabs dead. &quot;Who cares what religion they are, these actions are what we are mad about.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;m not blind to the fact that a key part of asymmetrical warfare is provoking retaliation upon innocents to crucify your opposition in the global press (see Western engagements in Vietnam) so let&#39;s not pretend a portion of those deaths weren&#39;t sought by the opposition in Palestine. Israel is clearly garbo for their actions and parts of the Palestinian opposition is trash for using innocents to their own ends.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that is the narrative they would like you to believe, but you should read this <em>incredibly</em> suppressed book, written by an academic Rabbi no less, detailing the history of Jewish blood sacrifice. </p>

<p>In addition to, or in the place of the book, you should watch this documentary detailing the same, but in a more approachable way  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynce_945vl4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ynce_945vl4</a>  It&#39;s called Darkness Visible, and finding a working copy is very hard, so if you like it, you should save it. </p>

<p>Here is a brief summary (as brief as can be), of some of the more famous cases, many of which resulted in the entirety of the Jewish population being expelled from whichever host nation they were then preying upon.</p>

<p>If you really want an esoteric treat, check out this OC of mine detailing exactly how the mythos of vampirism arose in Eastern Europe, and why it was a result of Jewish immigration to the area at the same time. <a href="http://archive.is/Ugm66#selection-1653.0-1653.231">http://archive.is/Ugm66#selection-1653.0-1653.231</a></p>

<p>That should just about dispel the false notions you&#39;ve been taught, and it&#39;s ok that you have them, but now you don&#39;t have to fall victim to propaganda any longer, so, happy day! </p>

<p>Enjoy :)</p>

<p>Yeah. I dated her for a while after, because im stupid and try to help people, and fell for her the more she talked about her life. </p>

<p>It was strange, and her bad habits started to direct upon me. The drinking and depression. She actually left me after I brought up seeing a therapist for her issues.</p>

<p>Time heals all things. I suppose my anger could diminish with time as well, if I allowed such. She was the one carrying the trauma after all. </p>

<p>SO, thanks for taking me down a Socratic path towards helping me realize im holding onto hate. </p>

<p>Me too. I called out the witch hunt against Corbyn without mentioning anything about the billboard, and was banned for supporting the billboard I made no mention of. I was responding to an article written by a Jew calling out Labour members who were using the hype to bring down Corbyn. So essentially I was banned for agreeing with an article that went against the chosen narrative.</p>

<p>I also got an instant ban from r/politics for questioning the narrative around the Skripal incident. No warning, just an instant ban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize Hamas rejects peaceful coexistence in its founding documents and calls for Jihad until they control it. Both sides have issues and thatis the point OP tries to convey.</p>

<p>Both sides have claim, controlled the area at times, and inflicted deaths on each other. There is no Perfect solution. This is amplified by the way Palestine refugees are treated. Unlike other refugees these cannot become part of the country they reside. Thier children live in camps without posibiljty of citizenship.</p>

<p>On the flip side if all Palestines were allowed in Israel they would severly outnumber the Jewish. Even the prior leaders before Hamas said it would be impractical and you might as well erase Israel if that happens.</p>

Also, I want to point out that here in the USA, the most ardent supporters of Israel are very lowkey white Christian nationalists who only support Israel because it gives American Jews a place to go out of the sight of non-Jewish Americans.

<p>The Balfour declaration was directly attributable to the actions of a clandestine and conspiratorial world Jewry then headed by Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild. It is the reason the US entered into WWII. It is the reason the holocaust death count is so severely exaggerated. It is the reason Churchill would not accept any of Hitler&#39;s dozens of treaties for peace. It is why all of institutionally taught history is a farce at best. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all. They&#39;re rapture fans. They support Israel because they think it&#39;ll bring Jesus back.</p>

<p>I was reading an article yesterday about how Jewish people basically created and run the comic book industry and they claim it was due to anti-semitism. This isn&#39;t true. The industry is culturally nepotistic and would give preference to other Jewish people. It&#39;s why most super heroes have Jewish roots.</p>

<p>Sorry if it seemed that way. No, just from your first comment, you claimed that the right wingers don&#39;t want Jewish people around. That&#39;s an ingrained belief that Jewish people tell each other but it&#39;s not really real. It&#39;s an indoctrination comment meant to get Jewish people supporting the cause.</p>

<p>Oh stop being so bloody defensive.</p>

<p>Most right wingers barely know shit about the middle east conflict because it&#39;s a topic that is mostly censored or biased in US media. Since 9/11 they&#39;ve supported Israel because AIPAC and the evangical religious leaders teamed up. There&#39;s also quite a few Jewish people in the alt-right movement so i&#39;m not even sure where you get this idea from that the right hates Jewish people.</p>

<p>Neither do you. People get bullied, this isn&#39;t just something that happens to Jewish people. I got jumped by skinheads before and got a few broken ribs. At the same time, I&#39;ve been jumped by natives and black guys too. I almost got thrown off a parkade by rednecks once because they drove by and called us fags. </p>

<p>Everyone has different experiences.</p>

<p>Call your HR, or the cops. There is already laws in place to deal with that kind of stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, name one fucking Jew in the alt-right, my dude.</p>

<p>The term &#39;alt right&#39; was created by Paul Gottfried, a Jewish guy from New York.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/218712/spencer-gottfried-alt-right">http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/218712/spencer-gottfried-alt-right</a></p>

<p>The term itself is just a buzzword run amok and attached to various factions of US conservatives. How a lot of that extremist shit built up was through different media talking heads, some of which happened to be Jewish.</p>

<p>Here in Canada, Ezra Levant owns RebelMedia which is considered an alt-right anti-semitic outlet. He started out promoting anti Muslim &#39;hate speech&#39; and spent the last decade conning right wing conservatives to hate anyone that isn&#39;t &#39;white&#39;.</p>

<p>The &#39;right&#39; wasn&#39;t originally anti-semitic and a lot of that white supremacist bullshit is just media hype.</p>

<p>With the Jewish persecution complex, it pisses me off because it&#39;s not fair to tell impressionable kids those kinds of lies because they develop a phobia of being harassed.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good documentary about the way Jewish kids are taught about anti-semitism.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/XNWF9CeoZdE">https://youtu.be/XNWF9CeoZdE</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s not really much different than the way Muslim or Christians indoctrinate kids to their faith. I don&#39;t care who you are, if you mess with kids, you&#39;re an asshole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Five of the &quot;protesters&quot; that died yesterday belonged to hamas military wings.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they were shot while on their own territory by Isralis military who had no legitimate reason to be there in the eyes of the International Community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Others were inciting violence and attempting to cross or destroy the border fence.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, because &quot;others&quot; were doing something which you disagreed with, that gives them the right to shoot just anybody who happens to be in the line of fire?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Where do you cut the line?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imminent danger.  That&#39;s the phrase you&#39;re going to want to retain.  But before you do, learn what it means.</p>

The list goes on.
  I have a Wife and Kids. I have enough to worry about at home. If some people on the other side of the world want to fight over holy land or whatever I dont care. Joshua trees only grow in 2 places. The holy land and the Antelope valley. I live in the Antelope Valley. This is the real holy land. We planted Joshua trees on the other side of the planet to trick people. Hows that for a conspiracy?

At best it creates economic chaos with the resettlement of millions of people, established businesses, and public systems already laid in place.

<p>Thinking that just giving away land is a as simple as that is foolish. &quot;BUT THAT&#39;S WHAT THE BRITISH DID&quot; Yes to a certain degree. However you would be insane to think that palestine then is as infrastructally stable as present day Israel. </p>

<p>To equate african migrants and black people are simply not the same either. There is a striving black jewish community in Israel, mostly from ethopia. They&#39;re ideals and values obviously match up with the common Israelis and that is why they are not being expelled.</p>

Most were regular Palestinian citizens tired of living under oppressive occupation. Israel hates all Palestinians and plays up the Hamas thing to try and justify their crimes. Its worth remembering as well that Hamas are a democratically elected political party, though not a very good one (name one who is though i guess)</p>

Nobody talks about the innocent people who have no power to change anything and are being pushed around left and right. Nobody talks about the Palestinians who were refugees and are still displaced and have no citizenship status and are stuck in the country they are in today with limited rights. Nobody talks about the people of Gaza who are at the mercy of foreign governments when it comes to travelling to and from Gaza and have to enroll on a register a year in advance to travel outside the country. Most of these people are just like any citizen. They don&#39;t care about politics, they just want to live, but in the media they are only painted as casualties of war with no solution to these problems in sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most Palestinians I meet do not support Hamas. As they teach teen and young adults, a lot get swayed towards Hamas violence. After they see its hurting their country, they don&#39;t support it anymore. When Palestinians try to put Hamas for peace, their leaders are murdered. Israel will aid Hamas as Hamas allows Israel to be a military force instead of a diplomatic force. </p>

<p>90% of the world want to work, raise kids, have a few nice things, and live without fear. Its the 10% who ruin it. This 10% gets power because wealthy people pay them and give them weapons bc it disrupts everything allowing these wealthy actors to retain control. If the people aligned in peace and worked together, the wealthy will lose power to democracy. This is not limited to Palestine as Israel does this too. Israel has these wealthy religious zealots that control their democracy to fulfill their religious fantasies. Most Israelis 20 to 35 like to drink dance and enjoy music but their fundamentalist leaders oppose this. They act like it is not blasphamey while calling American and Palestinians living the same lifestyle trash. </p>

<p>Its all rich and zealots ruining Israel and Palestine. These religious leaders talk about good being love and Nobel while living in hate. The religious heart of the Abrahamic religions is one of the most dangerous places on earth. How can these religions be noble while the evidence shows they are the opposite?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the whole &quot;Hamas hamas&quot; thing is a red herring. In many ways it&#39;s like the &quot;Mah Russia&quot; thing. Gaza is an internment camp from which people are not allowed to live which is blockaded to prevent some of the most basic necessities from reaching the people. If Israel could, they would probably do away with the whole strip - as in making hte people go &quot;poof&quot;. All israelis know that and they all wish it could be done just so  - &quot;poof!&quot;. Withe world [kind of] watching it&#39;s a bit difficult, so they keep tightening the belt hoping the hunger, disease and absence of medical help will do slowly that which they feel - unjustly, mind you - prevented from doing a little faster.</p>

<p>Hamas&quot; is the justification provided. Of course, it&#39;s not like the people of gaza have a say in who or what rules over them. They are glad to have any kind of organization that provides a semblance of order, just like in any prison camp. hamas, is simply an out-sourced boogey-mean, trotted out now and then to justify the unjustifyable. If tomorrow hamas came out professing eternal love for israel, recognizing it as a jewish state and giving up every single weapon, israel would be compelled to bring in ISIS or some such to keep the charade going. Actually, they did and are trying to do just that, but the hamas security has been fairly effective at catching the ISIS cells.</p>

<p>You know hamas is a made-up boogey-man by the enormous efforts israel makes to prevent reconciliation between it and the PA. No sooner Egypt mediates, that something happens.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good to know what this is all about is what I am saying. It is &quot;extermination by other means&#39; and calling it anything else is putting head in the sand.</p>

<p>I was reading an article yesterday about how Jewish people basically created and run the comic book industry and they claim it was due to anti-semitism. This isn&#39;t true. The industry is culturally nepotistic and would give preference to other Jewish people. It&#39;s why most super heroes have Jewish roots.</p>

<p>Regardless, I&#39;m not blind to the fact that a key part of asymmetrical warfare is provoking retaliation upon innocents to crucify your opposition in the global press (see Western engagements in Vietnam) so let&#39;s not pretend a portion of those deaths weren&#39;t sought by the opposition in Palestine. Israel is clearly garbo for their actions and parts of the Palestinian opposition is trash for using innocents to their own ends.

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not something that every Jew engages in. The most evil people in the entire world hide behind your religion and you need to take some time to seriously consider the truth within the statement &quot;until good [blank] stand against bad [blank], there are no good [blank]&quot;, because once the world at large becomes aware of this in full, they will want to be able to tell the good from the bad, but if you don&#39;t give them any way to do so, then, well, you run the risk of being the baby thrown out with the bathwater, to put it in a nice way.</p>
