       Guys I live in the New York City area and I am literally convinced that the weather is controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are lucky to get 3 sunny days a week and the rest are  all cloud cover or rain lately. Am I on to something or is this completely bogus?
      </p>
      <p>
       I started thinking like this after visiting Arizona where the weather is so damn nice every damn day!

       Yes it is a thing. Something is amiss with our world. Lots of guesses as to why they are spraying so much. With all the alien talk being thrown at us it could be prep for Blue Beam, it could be hiding an artificial sun, it could be anything. But yes it is happening, we all have eyes

       You know what else, I live in a high part of the area and i can see 30 miles in the distance and every time there is clouds, i can see the sun. Blaring over northwest jersey / Pennsylvania area where there are no people at all.
I guess this bothers me bc I hate cloudy days and it affects my mood.

       Blue Beam is essentially a planned government hoax in which they will use hidden technology to fake an alien invasion.  There are lots of theories as to how and when this will happen.  In the end the goal is to create a one world government, do away with religions, and get us to worship those already in power.  As for the haze on the horizon, it's pretty much daily now.  Lots of weird cloud shapes, patterns, and colors.  Like I said, who knows why, but when you get the defense team in these threads screaming "nothing to see here, your eyes are wrong" you know something is up

       There's a German engineer who claimed to work on the spraying devices attached to the planes and that the chemicals they spray include aluminum, barrium, strontium, etc. Seemingly for cognitive degeneration purposes, aluminum exposure has been indicated has having a relationship with Alzheimer's development.

       No, he said that he was just an aerospace engineer in Germany and that he resigned because of the lack of transparency surrounding the project when he asked his supervisors about it. It was part of a compilation video of different things related to chem trails, I'd have to track it down again.

       We have a lot of warm days, at times in January and February it would peak up in the 50's. One day February it hit 75. I pay attention to the weather a lot and this winter has not been anything even remotely close to feeling like it normally does. I cannot even count how many days we've had literaly 40 degree shifts over night.

       North NJ here, couldn’t help but think that today was the clearest blue sky I’ve seen in weeks. I see the majority of spraying take place around sunset but surprisingly today there was none that I could see. I happen to be driving back on route 80 from Pennsylvania tonight and around 10:30 PM out in Hackettstown, we noticed the telltale exes in the sky. The exes continued all the way back to about 5 miles west of nyc, Beyond that I don’t know but I think it’s safe to say that tomorrow, the sky will be back to that blanketed grey looking mess that we’ve become used to. So to answer your question yes this is really happening

       Don't forget that we are in a major solar minimum right now too and from what we know through history of these minimums is that it can affect weather.  The planet is not being protected right now from the immense solar winds coming from the sun's gigantic coronal holes.  If interested, spaceweather.com is a great site for info!

       They say its to combat global warming. Geoengineering as it is known officially. Spraying heavy metals into the air to reflect the suns rays into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality what we think of as 'climate change' could very well just be a result of this continued spraying of heavy metals in the atmosphere. They say that they are just doing it now and officially to begin in 2020. But listen, if the government is telling you that they are doing something, cuz the cat is out of the bag, guess what? They've already been doing it for 40 years in secret.  And maybe on a sinister note..  Those in control are acclimating or terraforming earth for dare I say it....non human entities(seriously)
      </p>
      <p>
       What we're beyond is proving that this is real. It is. We are now at the stage of finding out why.

       Hope its paying the rent, frenemy. Btw nobody ever contacted me (I think - there were a few strange emails I ignored) about shilling for the non-reality of chemtrails. Is it you know I'd do better than "it's just the weather", and you don't want the competition? But we could work together - you be the comic and I'll be straight man.

       I've measured 'persistent contrails' over 300 miles long, stretching through 3 countries, clearly visible on satellite images.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it's just water vapor, it's worth having a serious discussion about, since it's blocking the sun and blue sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still Geo-Engineering, even if it's incidental, which I personally very much doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously don't get why it's seen as controversial to talk about the effects aircraft have on our environment, especially when it is so visible.

       The problems with persistent contrails are huge. They block  sunlight during the day and then trap infra red heat that would normally be radiated into space at night. Here is Rosalind Peterson of California Skywatch addressing a UN debate on persistent contrails.

       Lol can someone do one of those memes of the guy sweating over a button. One side needs to say “Atmospheric carbon doesn’t increase temperature levels or change climate”, the other button needs to say, “water vapor from a jet engine totally changes weather and climate”

       To be fair you can't really compare the two. CO2 is not visible in the sky, these persistent contrails, whatever they're made of, are without a doubt blocking the sun and sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have an immediate visible effect. Some say these trails are actually trapping heat and creating global warming, but I'm not competent enough to know if that's true.

       The folks in the upper Midwest think they're being sprayed to create the weather you're experiencing.  You may not see the spraying, but you're (likely) experiencing the result.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just spent a few days crossing the Rockies, high desert, and the Sierras, and holy crap wow is there a TON of spraying out there.  MAY more than I see in my urban West Coast city.

       They are saying it's a solution to the global warming problem. Scientists propose spraying reflective particles in the air, in order to reflect the suns heat away from Earth back into space.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't conspiracy theorists saying this, but scientists funded by the UN and Bill Gates' foundation, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
       They even admit these particles could hurt or even kill people, but that it will be worth it in the long run, due to how many we will save from global warming catastrophe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same people also claim this type of program would be "extraordinarily cheep", and that anyone with enough money could just start doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Leading proponent David Keith is worth listening to in this Colbert Report from 2013, if you want to know what they are proposing.

       Of course conspiracy theorists claim this is all a cover to get people to be okay with spraying reflective particles in the atmosphere, for whatever deeper purpose is truly intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists also claim the persistent contrails we see today are a part of a deliberate Geo-Engineering program.
      </p>
      <p>
       A meteorologist admitted to me that what we see is a kind of Geo-Engineering, since it's changing the weather, even tho he thought it wasn't deliberate, but simply a bi-product of jet engines.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what, it's disturbing to look up some days and see the sky covered with what is without a doubt man made clouds, whatever their chemical composition.

       It's also worth seeing some of the Shasta County hearing where doctors, scientists, pilots and more made public officials aware of the extent to which these program destroy our health and environment.

       No I can only speak for NYC and is just a pattern that I noticed.

       I dont know why thiis happening but maybe in heavy population areas where the workforce works 10 hours a day and bad weather would just keep everyone inside not be able to enjoy the weather bc that would slow down productivity? Is this a crazy idea?
