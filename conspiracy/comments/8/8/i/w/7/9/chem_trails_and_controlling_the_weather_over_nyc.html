    <div class="md"><p>Thanks what is blue beam ill be looking for that now?</p>

<p>You know what else, I live in a high part of the area and i can see 30 miles in the distance and every time there is clouds, i can see the sun. Blaring over northwest jersey / Pennsylvania area where there are no people at all.
I guess this bothers me bc I hate cloudy days and it affects my mood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blue Beam is essentially a planned government hoax in which they will use hidden technology to fake an alien invasion.  There are lots of theories as to how and when this will happen.  In the end the goal is to create a one world government, do away with religions, and get us to worship those already in power.  As for the haze on the horizon, it&#39;s pretty much daily now.  Lots of weird cloud shapes, patterns, and colors.  Like I said, who knows why, but when you get the defense team in these threads screaming &quot;nothing to see here, your eyes are wrong&quot; you know something is up</p>

    <div class="md"><p>North NJ here, couldn’t help but think that today was the clearest blue sky I’ve seen in weeks. I see the majority of spraying take place around sunset but surprisingly today there was none that I could see. I happen to be driving back on route 80 from Pennsylvania tonight and around 10:30 PM out in Hackettstown, we noticed the telltale exes in the sky. The exes continued all the way back to about 5 miles west of nyc, Beyond that I don’t know but I think it’s safe to say that tomorrow, the sky will be back to that blanketed grey looking mess that we’ve become used to. So to answer your question yes this is really happening</p>

<p>They say its to combat global warming. Geoengineering as it is known officially. Spraying heavy metals into the air to reflect the suns rays into space.</p>

<p>In reality what we think of as &#39;climate change&#39; could very well just be a result of this continued spraying of heavy metals in the atmosphere. They say that they are just doing it now and officially to begin in 2020. But listen, if the government is telling you that they are doing something, cuz the cat is out of the bag, guess what? They&#39;ve already been doing it for 40 years in secret.  And maybe on a sinister note..  Those in control are acclimating or terraforming earth for dare I say it....non human entities(seriously)</p>

<p>What we&#39;re beyond is proving that this is real. It is. We are now at the stage of finding out why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve measured &#39;persistent contrails&#39; over 300 miles long, stretching through 3 countries, clearly visible on satellite images.</p>

<p>Even if it&#39;s just water vapor, it&#39;s worth having a serious discussion about, since it&#39;s blocking the sun and blue sky. </p>

<p>It&#39;s still Geo-Engineering, even if it&#39;s incidental, which I personally very much doubt.</p>

<p>I seriously don&#39;t get why it&#39;s seen as controversial to talk about the effects aircraft have on our environment, especially when it is so visible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are saying it&#39;s a solution to the global warming problem. Scientists propose spraying reflective particles in the air, in order to reflect the suns heat away from Earth back into space.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t conspiracy theorists saying this, but scientists funded by the UN and Bill Gates&#39; foundation, among others.</p>

<p>They even admit these particles could hurt or even kill people, but that it will be worth it in the long run, due to how many we will save from global warming catastrophe. </p>

<p>The same people also claim this type of program would be &quot;extraordinarily cheep&quot;, and that anyone with enough money could just start doing it.</p>

<p>Leading proponent David Keith is worth listening to in this Colbert Report from 2013, if you want to know what they are proposing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBu9VFurjzQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBu9VFurjzQ</a></p>

<p>Of course conspiracy theorists claim this is all a cover to get people to be okay with spraying reflective particles in the atmosphere, for whatever deeper purpose is truly intended.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists also claim the persistent contrails we see today are a part of a deliberate Geo-Engineering program.</p>

<p>A meteorologist admitted to me that what we see is a kind of Geo-Engineering, since it&#39;s changing the weather, even tho he thought it wasn&#39;t deliberate, but simply a bi-product of jet engines.</p>

<p>No matter what, it&#39;s disturbing to look up some days and see the sky covered with what is without a doubt man made clouds, whatever their chemical composition. </p>

<p>I dont know why thiis happening but maybe in heavy population areas where the workforce works 10 hours a day and bad weather would just keep everyone inside not be able to enjoy the weather bc that would slow down productivity? Is this a crazy idea?</p>
