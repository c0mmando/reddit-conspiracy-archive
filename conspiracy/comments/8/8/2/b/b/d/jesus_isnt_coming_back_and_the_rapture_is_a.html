<p>Gonna need a source on this. Most I have listened to say the opposite. That he was an amalgamation of earlier myths. </p>

<p>Not being mentioned for over 80 years after his death is a prime indicator. </p>

<p>If there was a magic man healing the sick and walking on water and other &quot;miracles&quot; it would have been the equivalent of front page news. </p>

<p>Over 80 years after he supposedly existed was the first written account. The apostles until after their own deaths. It is laughable. </p>

<p>Even if there was a revolutionary person it is certain there was no magic going on. No healing, no walking on water. None of it. </p>

Still something feels to be ramping up... like Tower of Babel kind of stuff. I think the verse from the Bible you mentioned pertained mainly to those at that time... but I do think we can&#39;t know specific dates because the Jewish and Roman calendars are all messed up.</p>

<p>The most compelling thing I can think of is the Sept 23 sign with regards to Revelation 12. They seem to match exactly.  What it was a sign of God only knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Composed AFTER the letters of Paul, Mark and Matthew were INTENDED as symbolic fiction, being written in a symbolic chiastic structure.</p>

<p>Only with Luke-Acts did Christians start to view the four Gospels literally.</p>

<p>The sayings of Jesus in the Gospels are things Paul originally said. See Nikolaus Walter&#39;s ‘Paul and the Early Christian Jesus-Tradition’.</p>

<p>The events in Mark and Matthew are based on the LXX, directly borrowing its language:</p>

<p><strong>The Donkey(s)</strong> - Jesus riding on a donkey is from Zechariah 9.</p>

<p>Mark has Jesus sit on a young donkey that he had his disciples fetch for him (Mark 11.1-10).</p>

<p>Matthew changes the story so the disciples instead fetch TWO donkeys, not only the young donkey of Mark but also his mother. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on both donkeys at the same time (Matthew 21.1-9). Matthew wanted the story to better match the literal reading of Zechariah 9.9. Matthew even actually quotes part of Zech. 9.9.</p>

<p><strong>The Sermon on the Mount</strong> - The Sermon of the Mount relies extensively on the Greek text of Deuteronomy and Leviticus especially, and in key places on other texts. For example, the section on turning the other cheek and other aspects of legal pacifism (Mt. 5.38-42) has been redacted from the Greek text of Isaiah 50.6-9.</p>

<p><strong>The clearing of the temple</strong> - The cleansing of the temple as a fictional scene has its primary inspiration from an ancient faulty translation of Zech. 14.21 which changed &#39;Canaanites&#39; to &#39;traders&#39;.</p>

<p>When Jesus clears the temple he quotes Jer. 7.11 (in Mk 11.17). Jeremiah and Jesus both enter the temple (Jer. 7.1-2; Mk 11.15), make the same accusation against the corruption of the temple cult (Jeremiah quoting a revelation from the Lord, Jesus quoting Jeremiah), and predict the destruction of the temple (Jer. 7.12-14; Mk 14.57-58; 15.29).</p>

<p><strong>The Crucifixion</strong> - The whole concept of a crucifixion of God’s chosen one arranged and witnessed by Jews comes from Psalm 22.16, where ‘the synagogue of the wicked has surrounded me and pierced my hands and feet’. The casting of lots is Psalm 22.18.  The people who blasphemed Jesus while shaking their heads is Psalm 22.7-8.  The line ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ is Psalm 22.1.</p>

<p><strong>The Resurrection</strong> - Jesus was known as the ‘firstfruits’ of the resurrection that would occur to all believers (1 Cor. 15.20-23). The Torah commands that the Day of Firstfruits take place the day after the first Sabbath following the Passover (Lev. 23.5, 10-11). In other words, on a Sunday. Mark has Jesus rise on Sunday, the firstftuits of the resurrected, symbolically on the very Day of Firstfruits itself. </p>

<p><strong>Barabbas</strong> - This is the Yom Kippur ceremony of Leviticus 16 and Mishnah tractate Yoma: two ‘identical’ goats were chosen each year, and one was released into the wild containing the sins of Israel (which was eventually killed by being pushed over a cliff), while the other’s blood was shed to atone for those sins. Barabbas means ‘Son of the Father’ in Aramaic, and we know Jesus was deliberately styled the ‘Son of the Father’ himself. So we have two sons of the father; one is released into the wild mob containing the sins of Israel (murder and rebellion), while the other is sacrificed so his blood may atone for the sins of Israel—the one who is released bears those sins literally; the other, figuratively. Adding weight to this conclusion is manuscript evidence that the story originally had the name ‘Jesus Barabbas’. Thus we really had two men called ‘Jesus Son of the Father’.</p>

<p><strong>Last Supper</strong> - This is derived from a LXX-based passage in Paul&#39;s letters. Paul said he received the Last Supper info directly from Jesus himself, which indicates a dream. 1 Cor. 11:23 says &quot;<strong>For I received from the Lord</strong> that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread.&quot; Translations often use &quot;betrayed&quot;, but in fact the word <em>paradidomi</em> means simply ‘hand over, deliver’. The notion derives from Isaiah 53.12, which in the Septuagint uses exactly the same word of the servant offered up to atone for everyone’s sins. Paul is adapting the Passover meal. Exodus 12.7-14 is much of the basis of Paul’s Eucharist account: the element of it all occurring ‘in the night’ (vv. 8, 12, using the same phrase in the Septuagint, en te nukti, that Paul employs), a ritual of ‘remembrance’ securing the performer’s salvation (vv. 13-14), the role of blood and flesh (including the staining of a cross with blood, an ancient door lintel forming a double cross), the breaking of bread, and the death of the firstborn—only Jesus reverses this last element: instead of the ritual saving its performers from the death of their firstborn, the death of God’s firstborn saves its performers from their own death. Jesus is thus imagined here as creating a new Passover ritual to replace the old one, which accomplishes for Christians what the Passover ritual accomplished for the Jews. There are connections with Psalm 119, where God’s ‘servant’ will remember God and his laws ‘in the night’ (119.49-56) as the wicked abuse him. The Gospels take Paul&#39;s wording and insert disciples of Jesus.</p>

For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.” That is why Jesus went to the dessert to fast and drive out his own demon that was hungry for power. He was battling his own ego and desires, he wanted to starve them before going after his real work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand. You need to contemplate such matters from an egocentric epistemic system. Quantum immortality is real (none of you would know, because as I&#39;m writing this obviously I am the first-person-conscious-observer of my life, and none of you are &#39;real&#39; in the sense that I am) and one of the conclusions of this is that impossibly unlikely events might in fact happen during my lifetime, because they are meant to. Because my life requires for them to happen. I know that probably doesn&#39;t make much sense without writing a massive tdlr post about it, but hopefully it inspires others not to be persuaded into a worldview within which the world happens regardless of their existence, and they are just sitting on the sides trapped in passivity, impotence and unimportance. No, the world is entirely <strong>yours</strong> . Everything you stop observing, stops existing. That is what the double slit experiment showed. That is why you made it out alive after that horrible car accident. Because the anthropic principle required for you to do so. And because you are the center of your universe, outrageously unlikely things might happen during your lifetime. </p>
