       Black people act as if they were attacked by all white people by being an ancestor of a race that was in slaved by Americans. Many white people were helpful during this time to the Africans trying to help them, that is why we don’t have slavery now. Why do a-lot of African Americans act like all white people are racist scum bags? I don’t hear People for Israel complaining about Hitler killing 6 MILLION jews. Nor Ukrainians complaining about Stalin, which literally their is not nearly as much of them as their was because of how many he killed. Any idea as to why they act like this and what their ideology is? I am not hating on Africans and i am not racist. I am just tired of seeing radio talk shows and tv shows talk about this way too much. I would like to know why its such a big deal compared to much worse things. Please i don’t need any hate just answers. I think my best explanation overtime is that they think that they deserve that attention and can get away with it. But i would appreciate actual answers thanks.

       Racism towards black people in America is so deeply ingrained in our society that unless you are black, and actually experience it, every day, you'd never notice it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pay a high-end special-effects/makeup artist to turn you into a black person for day.  It would open your eyes, if you're willing to see.

       Doesn't matter.  In the long view, not decades, but centuries, it will all wash away.  The concept of racism is a modern construct, from a historical perspective, used to replace other social hierarchies.  Soon enough everyone will be brown, and we'll find new reasons to hate and look down on one another.   The best way to avoid being at the bottom of the totem pole is to be at the top, regardless of your skin, caste, or culture.  Considering you think my sentiment is original, that plainly marks where you are placed on that totem.

       One of the more fascinating (to me) aspects of social media is the large contingent of folks, like you, that add nothing of substance to any conversation they inject themselves into, yet are driven by some preternatural force to always try and get the last word, even when that last word itself holds no value.  Like you're trying to project some image of yourself as the wise elder, passing judgement over all you survey, yet you never really live up to that image, since you never actually provide any meaningful dialogue.  Is it that you are simply too cowardly, even in this anonymous forum, to postulate an informed opinion of your own?  Too afraid to have your own perspective picked apart and dissected with what you seem to think are witty one-liners.  It happens so often, i can predict with reasonable certainty what your next response will be, if you both to keep at it.

       I think one of my favorite aspects of human genetics and evolution is the reality that the Caucasian races are genetically new, and recessive.  Which means, over time, a few more generations, maybe 5, maybe 30, everyone on earth will be dark brown, or close to it, again.  Why go back to Africa, when you can make wherever you are just as black?  All you need to do is impregnate white woman.  From what I'm seeing in America, that genetic transition is well underway.  All the politics in the world are not enough to stop mother nature.

       I am not 'into beastiality'; I'll skip...I suppose you can have the retarded Europeans (they are not a loss to the gene pool anyway as we know that the major predictor of IQ in offspring is the intellect of the mother).  White women are the least inclined to race mix of any people on earth because it is ALWAYS a step down the evolutionary ladder for us and for our offspring not to breed with our own type.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep impregnating the retards though...won't change anything for the vast majority of Ethnic Europeans...anyone who would bear a child and not get an abortion is already a race traitor to their people and setting themselves up for a world of trouble and sorrow.

       My face, since I just received them yesterday, and it is fresh in my mind, was delighted and in awe that my wildest dreams and desires had just come true.  0% 'black', 100% Ethnic European.  As far as my kids go...I already taught them and will also teach my Grandkids that to pollute yourself with the lesser races is to condemn your entire genetic line with inferior DNA; it is a betrayal of our race on a fundamental level that is irreversible and completely corrupted and debased.  IDK dude, I have never even once thought a "black" person was attractive...or even a brown person.  I love my own people, nothing wrong with that...besides if all goes according to plans that are now being considered and will soon be put in place the only thing you are going to have access to in the near future is your own cave pussy, in the mud age in 'wakanda', your dream nation...which is as it should be; the jews brought you here as slaves and we will send you back home as 'free men'.

       In the day that we decide to go back to Europe, we won't be asking, thought...in answer to your question...we will burn everything behind us and everyone in front of us better clear the fuck out.

       There is a part of Dallas somewhere in between i30 and i20 called Murder Alley.  Many of the people living there are poor for generation after generation, and have descended directly from American slaves.  There is a concerted effort, at least in the south, to keep these people down; otherwise, they would not have experienced such re-occurring poverty.  Many cities, including this area, disproportionately target minorities - and when I mean disproportionately, I mean 12% of the population makes up 50% of their stops/arrests.  These are just a few examples of systemic racism brought on by white people.  I am not sure how you expect black people or minorities to not be offended, or at least somewhat leery.

       Only as long as I get to throw all the browns out of my country there too...or kill them I guess, if they wont leave...brown people are PATHETIC LIARS...all of them could afford a ticket to go home to thier homeland and none of them want to...because it is easier to parasite off Ethnic European culture than to go make their own way on their own continent.

       The difference between me going back to my native land and brown people going back to their native land is that mine is a first world country and theirs is a mud age nation replete with genocide and slavery.

       You are...you know what a plane ticket is, right?  You could 'go to your wakanda homeland anytime you wanted'.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the semites brought you to the USA...Ethnic Europeans are not and never were the initial sub saharan african slavers (remember that we fought a civil war to set you free, which was completely stupid and will never happen again, unappreciative trash; we would be better off preserving our own people and just shooting you in the head, and resolving our conflict with our brothers like that, for all the gratitude it got us).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It was always semitic peoples (jews and arabs) who operated the slave trade.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that you can't tell the difference between Ethnic Europeans and Jews, but we are not the same race and we share one a few genetic ties with each other.  As a matter of fact, due to their love of raping and torturing blacks for the last 1,400 years of the 'islamic' slave trade, you share more DNA with semites than we do with semites as they are 40% black because of their murder, rape and torture of uncounted numbers of your people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what a 'penectomy' is?  The semites used to grab a young black boy and cut off everything (penis and balls) in one go...if the boy bled to death they had others.  After the penectomy they would march you naked across the burning Sahara to slave markets all over their empire.  Millions and millions of you died from infection, exposure and heartbreak in the sahara.  And they STILL do the same thing today, remember the arab who tried to sell his fully castrated 'gentle house slave' on facebook?  LMAO, I do.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        David Livingstone (Ethnic European) wrote of the [islamic] slave trade in the African Great Lakes region, which he visited in the mid-nineteenth century:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         "To overdraw its evils is a simple impossibility ... We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path. [Onlookers] said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer. We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead ... We came upon a man dead from starvation ... The strangest disease I have seen in this country seems really to be broken heartedness, and it attacks free men who have been captured and made slaves."
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Livingstone estimated that 80,000 Africans died each year before ever reaching the slave markets of Zanzibar.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And this was a
       <strong>
        TINY FRACTION
       </strong>
       of the Great Lakes Region of the Islamic (semitic) slave trade.  The number of blacks that have been raped, murdered and tortured by semites is probably impossible for a human being to number if they spent their whole life just counting the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not going to try to explain this to you but a handful of the smarter blacks have figured it out already...there is probably no hope for the ones who aren't smart enough to understand at this point...genetic dead ends anyway due to low IQ.

       The United States does not have a colomnular society, so I am not sure what you are referencing when you say ‘their own culture’.  The more you police people, the more crimes and criminals you will discover.  The absolute execution of law is tyranny, particularly the more frivolous the law (e.g. the controlled substances act).

       Holidays, names, food, entertainment, clothing and fashion, social standards, values.. ya know, culture... the differences between societies, the things that make us different... you need not look very hard for these simple, dumb crimes, I'm sure as soon as the owner of the ransacked vehicle would notice immediately.

       I believe there are some laws that must be followed to the tee, such as those around robbery - simply because what's mine, is fucking mine and if we are all equal, you have no right to impede on me or mine. Allowing any deviation from that would surely cause chaos, such as the lawless evacuated disaster zones we have come to see. I also believe that there are entirely too many laws, which is frustrating and gives a sense of tyranny, but police do not make laws, politicians do... so why hate the cops for enforcing them? Defending the ones who create the tyranny, while blaming those doing their jobs.

       The protection of private property is supposedly why society formed; however, there used to be more social grace.  I am not talking about finesse, I am talking about grace.  Grace is patience and virtue through love.  Grace is letting the poor people glean the fields.  Now, everyone is like, “I got mine, so fuck you.”  Ya, well, you know what?  I love you.

       Individualistic, yes... but when was the last time you noticed a white girl named laquanda or the likes? Or a black girl named Kate? Or a white guy who raps, that is wholly accepted by the black community, or a black guy who sings country wholly accepted by the white community? Darius Rucker and eminem but I mean wholly accepted.

       I think it's more like "I got mine, you do you, just don't fuck with mine, because its fucking mine". After a 40 hr work week, raising two little ones, and the rest of shit that's thrown at me by life, the last thing I am worried about is someone I don't consider my own, ie family. And I love you too, up till the point where you tread on me, cause I love mine more.

       It’s the legacy of slavery and the inbred forces of white supremacy that really disturb most black people today.
      </p>
      <p>
       White supremacy is an ever present reminder that black people are only out of slavery and legally considered humans/citizens, with the full protections of citizenship for only 50 years if you consider the voting rights act as the start of federal recognition of black peoples full rights in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       So slavery isn’t a thing in the past for a lot black people but a reminder of how easily humanity, dignity and safety can be stripped from them, today or in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Americans forget that black people only make up 12% of the population and at any point in time, genocide is a very plausible outcome of a “race war.” A war which most white supremacists are trying to encourage other whites to engage in.

       Well, if you took a bunch of white people and put them in a society where:
      </p>
      <p>
       you can't get a job because of the colour of your skin
      </p>
      <p>
       and you know you're getting arrested simply because of the colour of your skin
      </p>
      <p>
       and as a minority there are incidents in which the majority race does experiments on you because of the colour of your skin
      </p>
      <p>
       and 3 letter agencies funded by your government sow drugs in your community deliberately because of the colour of your skin
      </p>
      <p>
       and your kids are more likely to get shot for pulling out their drivers license to show the cop because of the colour of your skin
      </p>
      <p>
       you would see white people get pretty violent, I guaran-fuckin-tee you, little man. That is the kind of shit that disturbs the minds of the people for generation upon generation to come. It's like a splinter in your heart, no matter what you do, it's always there, even when you're just walking down the street to the corner store for some milk

       You realize that about 99.87% of cops were never found to be against their race just because their skin color and i am assuming that you don’t realize how much they like to bring up a past they never lived because you also probably don’t live in the U.S due to you spelling color like colour. Also a-lot of the stuff you listed is unproved bullshit. Also you absolutely can get a job if their is a bigot as the manager or ceo that is when it is like that you cant control other peoples mind sets and you have to deal with it. It is exactly the same as saying white people can not get hired because their skin color by other black people. I am sure their are black people who will not hire white people because their skin but their also is people who will, the same with white people. If what you meant by “experiments” is the KKK, the KKK has killed less black people than black people kill black people every month. I understand that white people can get violent. But would you of guessed that black people can get just as violent? I was not talking about todays society numb nuts i was talking about how they mourn on the past more than any other race, even ones with much worse history. As well does it make up for how Africans are about 25% of the population and do about 50% of all crimes? No it does not. I can stereotype the shit out of everything don’t try and use serotypes against me.

The only reason I’m being an asshole is because he was not focusing on the topic and spiting out utter bullshit because that is what many politicians and the public want others to think.

       Why do you think they were easily captured when they were also most likely the first people on earth.It is because they are predisposed to violence and not bound to learning.

       We can’t control everyone, i am sorry but thats not how the world works. Do you want to hear me say i am oppressed because their are black people who are racist towards white people every single day over and over, but feminism is even worse much worse. Equality is something that can’t be controlled. Feminism these days is just stupid and makes them look stupid because they want so called “equality” that no one else has. I think at this point its just everyone except the ones that are some what smart and not in need of attention to make white men feel guilty every else is jumping on the band wagon.

       Well it's not the majority but;  it's just the way it is,  the grand parents are still telling the stories of thier grand parents.  How many bad examples do you need to hear before you don't trust or hate a group of people?  Maybe it's a defense mechanism in their brain?

       It’s to make white people feel guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is most whites with some kind of European background had ancestors who were subjected to things like slavery and genocide at the hands of institutions like the Roman Empire or the Catholic Church long before the trans Atlantic slave trade.

       No problem. I’ve actually had a massive argument with a black guy about this who assumed I was racist simply because I am white.

      <p>
       No specific race or group has a monopoly on being used and exploited.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, ultimately it all comes down to wealth and class. The haves vs the have nots. The few in power vs the rest of us.

      <p>
       And don’t tell me that whites have all the wealth when the second largest land owners in the world are the Saudi Royal Family.

       for the same reason irish americans singlehandedly funded sien fien and the IRA for 200 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       or that native americans cling to cultures that are only shells if what they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       some shit burns itself on the memories of all the descendants to follow,  until it is forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       case in point--bacon's rebellion, and the white, anglo-irish indentured servitude and "transportation" to southern plantations before the switch to african chatel slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       these people did not come here willingly, in most cases it was prison, death, or transport--pick your poison. the average length of survival upon arrival was about 18 months for men, less for women. the option was chosen because theoretically once you served your time you were freed (don't let the name full you, they were slaves), given some start up money, and a plot of land, but this almost never happened. so there was a very bloody uprising in the mid-1600s in virginia that almost succeeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       after it was put down, the south never used indentured servants again--native born brits and scots and irish, didn't behave themselves. they were surly and combative. africans did, for the most part, and not because they were treated worse. the reason why is probablly related to their cultures of origin. the concept of whiteness and blackness was purposefully created at that time, because the white lower class were still causing trouble and trying to get the african slaves to join them.
      </p>
      <p>
       completely forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact that most white americans who came to this country did not do so willingly and were abjectly mistreated has largely been erased. even later waves of white immigrants true reasons for coming here and their circumstances is forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       one example: in the 1870s-1890s, the labor movement on america was on the verge of success. urban labor parties and country populist parties had voter turnouts of over 80% and strikes were not being undermined. so big coal, big glass, big steel, and big textile went to eastern europe recruiting the most desprerare--they offered them a meal, a ticket, and a job. and those immigrants destroyed labor in this country. it never recovered (the 20th century union myth is just that a myth--it was a product of a very unique economic and demographic situation between 1945 and 1965). those workers were horribly mistreated and paid almost nothing. none had been sitting around beforehand saying, "gee, i wish i could go to america."
      </p>
      <p>
       the statue of liberty is the sickest inside joke in our history. it was commissioned by j p morgan's architect at the time when the eastern european recruitment began. the slogan is the unironic, absolutely honest sentiment of morgan et al, but the most desperate, imminently exploitable, weren't wanted because of charity and a desire to liberate, they were wanted because of profit seeking. that damn pos statue is trotted out and whored everytime anybody objects to bringing in more of the most desperate and imminently exploitable. besides, she has nero's face. haha, jokes on us. good one.
      </p>
      <p>
       the true history of the statue of liberty has been completely forgotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       every single person, unless they are black, thinks their ancestors came here sua sponte seeking a better life. they didn't. they came for a few shekels of a finders fee, a bowl of gruel and moldy stale bread, and 12 hours workdays, 6 days a week. most intended to go home, as did the irish 50 years before them. no one's life got better until after ww2, and like i said, 1945-1965 was an aberration.
      </p>
      <p>
       question--why was irish immigration encouraged and facilitated in the 1840s-1860s? originally, because the north had no slaves and needed people they could pay slave wages to, and then, because they needed cannon foder (this is the same reason that the emancipation proclamation and 1864 republican anti-slavery, full black citizenship* platform occurred when they did. the north needed more cannon fodder. it had refused to allow african americans to fight up to that point and in fact, lincoln's original solution for blacks was to ship them all to latin america or to liberia, their choice. slaves incorporated into northern troops were classified as war contriband.  *the black citizenship would only be for veterans).

       What if it's simply because they aren't capable of achieving more? Why is it so hard to accept that perhaps some just aren't that bright?  Instead, one makes up incredulous, elaborate excuses.

       Even if that were true, which it surely is in many cases, it still places the blame and responsibility squarely upon their own shoulders.

       All of those other ethnicities have average IQs higher than 85 and are doing just fine these days.  I'm sure intelligence has nothing to do with prosocial behavior and success, though.

       Doesn't matter.  In the long view, not decades, but centuries, it will all wash away.  The concept of racism is a modern construct, from a historical perspective, used to replace other social hierarchies.  Soon enough everyone will be brown, and we'll find new reasons to hate and look down on one another.   The best way to avoid being at the bottom of the totem pole is to be at the top, regardless of your skin, caste, or culture.  Considering you think my sentiment is original, that plainly marks where you are placed on that totem.

       I'd love to see your face when you look at your DNA test results.  Even better, to be a fly on the wall when you find out who your grand-daughter is dating.
