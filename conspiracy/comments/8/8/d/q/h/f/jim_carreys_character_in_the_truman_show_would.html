       I'm a dime a dozen. Just like that lad from Poland...Max Spiers. He was a amateur conspiracy theorist that had found something that hit a nerve. He ran to a friends house one evening, acting crazy and weird. He then begain to throw up black vomit while yelling..."they did this. They got to me" and died right on the floor in his friends house.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, people that are in the public eye that are loud, obnoxious with their views, in your face and within numbers. That is the way to go about it.

       its cool, I only remember because I was interested in the story myself. His mum claimed to have received a text from him shortly before he died saying "your boy's in trouble, if anything happens, investigate". Creepy if true

       I agree. I remember the story bc I remember thinking to myself..."this is like a scene out of a movie".  Something else was fishy bc something happened regarding the autopsy and it was manipulated or fcked with someway or another.

       Good question and I know people like to say the would be willing to die for the truth to sound brave and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But....
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think its possible to even know the truth, so I have no interest in dying for anything.  If you think knowing the truth is possible, youre going to have a bad time and end up very frustrated.

       Live for yourself.  Fill your day with things that give you a dopamine hit without getting hooked on drugs...or get hooked on drugs, it wont matter in a million years anyway.

       While I love your advice, just want to point out that the term “drugs” should be changed in our vernacular simply because not all drugs are created equal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meth, Heroin, crack are deadly drugs that have nearly zero positive effects on your spiritual development.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, drugs like ecstasy, psylocibin, marijuana can actually help you develop your spiritual being into understanding yourself and God better. These drugs can obviously be abused as well but when taken correctly, they can have extremely positive effects on your overall attitude and perspective on life 😁

       LSD taken in the proper setting, with the proper mindset, and good friends, is almost always beneficial for the average person. I would recommend doing it once or twice a year, honestly, as long as you aren't predisposed to Schizophrenia and follow Leary's advise on Set and Setting.

       Always get a drug testing kit and make sure you’re taking what you
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       want to be taking. And also, be an informed drug user. Do research. Learn the effects and have a trip sitter or be with friends you’re comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for you and your friends sakes, know your medical history and what prescriptions, etc. you’re on in case something bad happens so that people around you can help / tell the hospital in case you have to go there.

       100% yes. God is real. If you have any questions just PM me :)

       Religion is a tool for social control and making money.

      <p>
       What you think is right &amp; wrong for you is between you and your relationship with God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all about a relationship with God. Like i said a couple days ago, God is fine with you smoking weed or doing some spiritual drugs... as long as you do NOT abuse them... just like food. You abuse food; you get fat and obese. You do too much MDMA, then yeah, your body suffer... Moderation is key!
      </p>
      <p>
       PM me if you have any questions about a "relationship" with God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its something that isnt really taught and the world wants you to think youre just some random act of evolution in the vastness of space so that the idea of a loving God who gave us the gift of life creating us is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be a vocal "atheist" when i first started using Reddit in 2011... but after learning truths about the illusions of our reality and personal experiences.. I cannot deny that humans have souls and there is a spiritual war going on to keep people in the dark.

       You know.. God is perfectly ok with that. There is so much deception in our world that it’s hard to fathom what God truly is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, and Jews believe this too I think but I came to this conclusion before I even know that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically every choice you make is made out of either love or hate. If you choose love more often, then your soul will have a more positive polarity as you go through life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This basically the message behind Jesus. “Accept Jesus as your savior” and you are able to get into “heaven”
      </p>
      <p>
       That is true, but what people fail to teach is if you don’t grow your soul in a positive direction, then you’re gonna end up where you started before “accepting Jesus”
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day we are all human and the rules of the game prohibit God from directly jumping out to non believers and proving he is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       On my spiritual journey, I have noticed that God does have a way of talking to us subliminally through numbers. I fell in love with the number 47 during my high school football days and I didn’t know why but it over the years I’ve used 47 as a guide in decisions and to be honest, my life has never been better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since your agnostic, maybe just try praying to God and give it a real shot to connect with the spiritual realm. You don’t have to go to church every Sunday or confess to a priest, just open your soul up to LOVE and God will let you know he’s there.

       The bible says even Satan will appear as an "angel of light".. God, and His angels, do not possess people. The biggest red flag is when people claim God is dwelling within them, or even dwelling in our world.. The Godhead of Christianity is completely alienated from His creation.

       Actually any drug will worsen Spiritual advancements. I don't disagree that they could have a positive affect on you but when advancing Spiritually will create false realities. If you really want to experience the astral and see people's energies then you really will not want to use drugs along the way. Take my word for it when I say you don't need drugs to advance on your Spiritual development :)

       I like the analogy of taking a helicopter vs climbing a mountain on foot. If you take the helicopter up, you must take it back down and it will be a short trip. If you climb your way painstakingly up then when you get there you can stay longer and experience it more fully. Ultimately we all must come and go and who knows how many trips we take, and just because one of your trips went one way doesn't mean another's will go the same.

       Very true analogy... I’ve also learned on this journey that everyone’s bodies react to things differently.. I just want the stigma that all schedule 1 drugs have no beneficial effects to go away! One Reddit comment at a time 😁

       Thanks for the advice! I do understand that cheating by using drugs isn’t a permanent fix, but after I took MDMA the first time I kinda realized that it was possible for me to be that kind, loving, and excited to be alive all the time in my everyday life and not just while on the trip :)

       I was saying that if you use drugs you'll mess yourself, soul, chakras up, and your energy too. Sure, you can do Molly or smoke weed and have a great time and be happy and excited to live and all that but no drug helps you advance Spiritually, if you try and "cheat" you won't get anywhere but good for you for being happy in life :)

       Hey! I know this thread is kind of old, but here’s something I read that really resonated with me and just from reading your posts here it makes me think you might appreciate it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it was the Buddha who said something like, “you can use the boat to cross the river, but once you cross it you should leave the boat behind.”
      </p>
      <p>
       What I get from this in terms of drug use for spiritual growth: MDMA, acid, Psilocybin, and DMT (ESPECIALLY dmt :) are very useful tools for facilitating spiritual growth. Indeed they really helped me find a sort of “God” type experience that totally rearranged my perspective on what that concept even means. However, once you get that message, continuing that journey WITHOUT the use of drugs can be even more fulfilling, and ultimately mind-blowing. Yoga, meditation, and things like that have catapulted my peace and understanding in a different, but sometimes even more profound way than my experiences with all sorts of psychedelics.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you scour my post history, I should note that while my psychadelic experiences were profoundly positive, I’ve also had trouble with alcohol, cocaine, and finally heroin during some of the darkest periods of my life. I’ve had a lot of struggles with depression and other mental health type issues for most of my life, and unfortunately that (among other things) led me to a pretty self destructive place for many years. Currently 112 days clean of ALL substances (not advocating that for everyone, it’s just something that I need,) and trying to continue to grow along spiritual lines to aid in my recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...that was a lot, but thanks for reading, I really connected with your posts here and I just had to chime in :)

       lol thanks for sharing what you’re saying totally “resonates” with me too :) I had a heroin problem in my past and I’m sober 5 months from it but it was a 7 year journey of crippling depression and overcoming it.. pretty crazy what kind of answers are out there when you look beyond what’s seen as legal and illegal

       Good advice, also the major issues with Herion, Cocaine and even Booze is they have physical addiction issues, not just addiction to the high, but they physically change the way your body processes things so that if you stop, your body fails.
      </p>
      <p>
       With booze this is why you get the shakes, booze supplements your body with a self made "drug" that eases out your movements, your body gets lazy and stops making it and let's the booze do the work.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you stop drinking for a day or two your hands get Shakey, because your body still isn't making it and is waiting for the booze to show up and do it's job.
      </p>
      <p>
       When your body completely stops making this (a hardcore alcoholic for years) and booze doesn't show up for 3 or 4 days straight...... You die.

       I feel largely the same way. Marijuana has opened my mind to the fact that there are different ways to experience the world and your brain is very complicated/diverse. I took Ectasy for the first time at a festival last year and it was amazing to experience just pure happiness and love. As a usually socially anxious person it allowed me to be myself and talk to people easier and I've been able to learn from that. I will be doing LSD for the time very soon and I'm really excited. Hopefully I will gain a new perspective on life and overcome many of the things that hold me back. I know how I want to be and how want to view the world and I think LSD will just make it click and everything will fall into place 😊

       Congrats on having an amazing first roll 😁 LSD may have an effect, but it might not be the answer you’re looking for. I have done it once and it actually is like ecstasy and the best parts of a shroom trip without the bad parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is really going to help you is understanding that God is ok with these spiritual experiences as long as you don’t ABUSE them!
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand if you don’t believe, but just give it a shot! What you think is right and wrong is between you and God. If you follow your moral compass and choose LOVE always.. God will bless you 🙏🏼
      </p>
      <p>
       Marijuana and shrooms were created by God after all!

       Yeah I kinda misspoke, I understand there is real medicinal value to opiates.. what I was referring to is people who use opiates recreationally.. which I used to be addicted to for 4-5 years so I know first hand how bad it can get

       I’m copy and pasting something I said to someone else who replied to me. You have a spiritual side, you just need to try and allow yourself to grow it.

       No you’re confused about what I’m saying. Religion is a tool for social control and making money.

      <p>
       What I practice is a personal relationship with God. What I think is right and wrong is between God and I. Not some priest in a booth making me confess sins to him or feeling obligated to go to church. There are good churches and bad churches just like there are good and bad people

       Reddit made me a firm atheist when I first joined it in 2011 but after personal experiences and growing my spiritual self, I won’t ever deny there’s a God again.

       We’re indoctrinated to believe we’re just a random chance of luck and we’re just monkeys on a floating space rock because they want you to think you’re too smart to believe in God.

       I've already conceded to the other poster that my comment was at best ill-thought out. So apologies for that. However, I don't believe in god, I beleive in science which is pretty awesome in itself. This has nothing to do with the MSM etc.

       haha of course everything is just a theory :) only cuz you mentioned the science thing I just have to say... God &amp; science can coexist. God could have created our world with the laws of physics and mathetmatics.. For example, the Golden Ratio could be a divine pattern for aesthetic beauty in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just like to remind people that we are so much more than fleshy bags of meat.. your soul is eternal and your human experience is a learning process for your soul because being human is one of the biggest lessons your higher self can learn from.
      </p>
      <p>
       That part of your brain telling you to "think rationally" because I sound crazy is normal.. it is definitely something you need to experience for yourself... just be open to it :)

       But... There isn't a god lol. Preconceptions based on ideals installed in you at a young age, and drugs made you feel better about the story of a single creator that kills his own creations thorough out the Bible. I think you have spiritual well being and religion all fucking confused.

       what the fuck? I was raised christian, the majority of everyone I know within religious confines are raised christian, indoctrination comes from an early age, i was indoctrinated to believe in god, as i got older, i realized the idea of a single creator and a permanent hell made absolutely no sense, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind what so ever now that there is not a hell, and most likely not a single creator because of that. If there is a single creator, he has nothing to do with the stories of a christian god in the bible.

       You are making very bold statements, albeit, they are still your opinion and respectable. At an early age, the idea of God and right and wrong through his judgement is normal.

      <p>
       As you get older, society tends to push us towards the idea that, now that were older, we dont need God to be good people (true) so we only told you that so you could be a good boy for christmas. Obviously theres no God dummy!

       I can't at all, most of the die hard religious people whome i argue with are all adults and all believe truly in god. literally no one from faith is comparing god to santa clause, that would be something i'm doing. the majority in america truly believe god is real and not santa clause, so no you can't say "society" says religion is a joke, because the majority making up "society" literally want it taught as fact in our school system.

       I agree, but it is different for everyone.  Opiates are my favorite, because of the way they make you think/feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often had out of body experiences at night when i would lay my head down after using opiates throughout the day.  Sleep paralysis would kick in, and suddenly i would be able to sit up, and leave my body on the bed, and i can tell you right now...the ''shadowrealm'' (thats what i call it) is a mirrored version of reality, except things decompose, are broken, switched around, upside-down, populated with strange demon like creatures--none of which ever interacted with me negatively though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think certain drugs are terrible for you--opiates being one of them, unless you are clever, and take in moderation, and keep from being dependent.  I was able to do so for about 6 years when i started using opiates, and controlled it and my desire to do them, but still, in the end, i took too much, too frequently, and became addicted--which getting away from sucks, unless you've got weed, and other stuff to help you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think each drug basically mostly offers something that is worthwhile, except for stimulants--i dislike stimulants very much...to me opiates have the most organic feeling--as in you can still almost be sober when you take them, even when taking quite a bit, but they alter your thinking, and make everything feel good.  Weed would be a close second, nearly tied though...

       I’m with you brother.. I’ve been clean from Black from a little over 5 months after doing it for the last 4-5 years and I’ve definitely had a spiritual awakening/recovery since getting clean from opiates... I live in Vegas so the opiate problem is really bad out here cuz the cartels run shit and have the best black lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Opiates are great for pain management but they’re so easy to get addicted to because it feels just like weed on steroids so it doesn’t seem bad until you start getting the sickness of withdrawals

       By stating "we will never know", doesn't that mean you are claiming to know? Maybe the third sentence would align better with the first two as "Maybe someday we will know, maybe we all know."

       Lol I agree whole heartedly except for the drug part. Seen way too much suffering and death, anywho.... Yeah you might start out down the rabbit hole thinking you can figure it out. But after a few years any logical person will realize it's impossible. I'd like to point out that doesn't mean it's pointless or that you can learn anything by digging. Just know you'll never put the puzzle together.

       I've been jailed several times for trying to get the truth out about Obama, Trump, and the coastal elites.  I don't like Trump, and I believe he is a pawn in the costal lizard's plan to bring the USA under complete democratic control. It makes sense when you consider that Trump is a climate denier. Who benefits from global warming? Lizard people, that's who. Who controls all the banks and media? Costal Lizard elites. Who promotes the low birth rate enducing debt? The rich. Where do rich gather? Warm costal enviroments, the kind perfectly suited for lizards.

      <p>
       When humanity is hiding in the hills, praying the Lizard people don't capture us to work as slaves in the cricket plantations, we will be cursing Obama's name

       There’s one that I rarely see discussed yet it’s arguably the greatest conspiracy of our time.
That’s of course if it’s true... which the evidence seems to suggest is at the very least plausible.

       But I won’t lead the witness any further. Genuinely interested to see what it might be?

       Obama is Osama.
That’s to say Barack Obama is one of the CIA agents whose job it was to impersonate Osama Bin Laden. I first encountered the theory in the High Level Insider threads and have since came across corroborating material in other sources - ranging from biblical scholars, to the prime minister of Pakistan. 
All of the information I’ve reviewed that’s led to me to the conclusion it might be plausible, is within the public domain- not hard to find at all. But if you don’t mind waiting, I’ll put something together and submit it as it’s own post.

       The lesson is the same as so many other movies with an artificial environment housed with brainwashed people and the antagonist finds a way out and learns of the outside world and the lies. The earth is flat.

       I def am interested. This type of stuff takes time bc a lot of this information will go over the average persons head if they aren't completely listening.  There may be a connection with this along with Egypt with the short amount of video I watched.

       The Siege in hindsight looks like predictive programming. Eerily similar to the 9/11 official story from how they got into the country, to their relationship with the CIA, to the draconian measures taken. In the movie they implement martial law. You get the feeling they wanted to post 9/11 but couldn't pull it off. Recommend everybody watch that movie to see how uncanny some of this stuff is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Movies like that helped set the stage for the wars in the Middle East. How do you get people on board bombing countries that are thousands of miles away and pose no real threat to Americans? You need propaganda. This type of programming planted the seed that people hated us for our freedom and that the War on Terror was necessary and so were wide sweeping actions that trampled civil liberties.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the way this stuff works is that it forces your mind to consider something so that when that something really happens your mind believes it to be likely and logical because it has already faced the possibility before.  As opposed to something foreign that doesn't make any sense that you lack an understanding of.
      </p>

       You have to ask yourself if that is what is happening with Russia on TV and News for the last 5 years or so. The majority of antagonist in TV shows and movies for the last several years has been Russia. Its something I always roll my eyes when I keep seeing. I definitely believe it to be true. This is how intelligence agencies and media likely work together.

       "Reality" is your brain mapping sensed data onto your personal cognitive framework. The more points that map, the more real it seems. When few points map, it seems fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does that cognitive framework come from? Core survival instincts, wrapped in layer upon layer of social conditioning. Nature + Nurture.

       Where does the social conditioning come from?

      <p>
       School, (which disseminates) stories (reinforced by) media (and kept in check by) peers. Trusted authorities. That's the root of all 'predictive programming'.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it simply, whenever you ignore gut feeling, you delegate your response to the program instead. Understanding the programming is a fine way to spend your time :)

       Fuck me! There's so many screwy things about 9/11 but for a movie director to have knowledge about this in the early 80s is mind boggling. I try to take things with a pinch of salt by actually got a shiver watching that. 3 times it points to that date, one of them framed perfectly as the clock tower is struck, shit me man. I think I need to watch The Wire now.

       This is actually highly probable.  If you think of what makes up matter, which is like 99.9% empty space (just like observable universe) and how matter basically is just electromagnetic fields that interact with eachother, where everything uniformly spins and travels at a similar speed, and your brain is made up of that matter...then you can take away that what we see is a construct of our imaginations.  In other words, dont think of it as your eye is a lens, that looks out into space, and differentiates depth, color, etc. because they are outside, in the environment...because your eyes actually absorb information, and that information is relayed to your brain, and what you think you ''see'' outside of your body, as the environment, is actually being seen in your minds eye, by a culmination of your senses being sent to receptors in your brain, and electrical activity stimulating certain parts of the prain that produce certain sights, sounds, feelings, etc.

       Matter is not matter at all...its electrical interactions between EM fields. Think of a endless field of a superconducting liquid with zero resistance (space).  Perturbations in the field cause swirling vortexes and vortices, which collide, spin, interact with eachother, etc--this can be replicated with certain fluid dynamics...

       Indeed. Truman touches Sirius between two pillars, and so begins his path of initiation. He left a house numbered '36', and pretended to like his neighbours, with a scripted greeting. More than meets the eye.

       Recently I learned that children are bred like pedigree dogs from film and TV actors as well as musicians and sports stars, and adopted into families who know their true parentage and ensure the children get the acting, dance or music lessons or whatever they need.  It's actually unusual for an outsider to become famous in Hollywood.  I believe a lot of stars grew up in their own personal Truman Show.

       Welcome To Parkland! (The Whole Hogg) - Extensive Cache of Videos From February 14, 2018 Event
      </p>
      <p>
       Massive collection of news clips reveals that all is not what it seems as portrayed by the US mainstream media (Deep State) when it comes to what really took place in Parkland Florida on February 14, 2018. This video provides extensive evidence that student actors were featured on numerous mainstream media channels and immediately rolled-out by the mainstream media in the wake of the school shooting which raises many important questions, particularly in relation to who acted as the director and liaison between the student actors and the mainstream media outlets. Video footage also provides verifiable proof that the March For Our Lives anti-gun rallies were not a grassroots movement as reported by the mainstream media, and instead were astroturfed by Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Democratic Party acting in collaboration with the mainstream media.

       So the film provides no clear answer to your question.

      <p>
       At best you’re just going to get people projecting themselves onto the film to come up with an answer.

       But I think the point of a film like that is to do the projecting yourself.

       I get what you're saying but for him to be comparable to being a conspiracy theorist in actual life, literally everyone in that real life would have to lie to him. Not under a skydome. The planet. I feel the film is more a study on the idea of the human zoo. Kind of closer to Jurassic Park than a conspiracy in this sense. "Let's watch the creature in its habitat" so to speak. My thoughts anyhow.

       I see the philosophical implications of the film's premise but not the connections to him being a conspiracy theorist so much. So yes it is literal I guess. If you want then it is a conspiracy against him, but for a benevolence the perpetrators have for his life, not for his suffering. It was living theater with one audience member unaware. Which in a subreddit of conspiracy theorists is impossible unless this is the only place in the world where everyone..is..right. Oh my god.

       I totally agree with OP but at the same time i really think that in order to be able to really find the truth a reality check needs to be done every certain time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you need to debate with yourself why it may be truth and why it may be not truth, and truly believe it by exploring forums from the opposition groups ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       important also to get your ego in complete control because it is very easy to fall into defending something not because you believe is true but because you want to "win" an argument.

       It's allegory. The artificial world of The Truman Show uncovers a lot of the same ideas as Plato's allegory of the cave. It's meant to be understood metaphorically, like most art.

       The movie is a symbolic journey about escaping an ideological prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone can use its symbolism to justify their comparative journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s the beauty of a film like that... project yourself onto it and it “speaks” to you.

       There is “Plato’s Cave” symbolism in both films...
      </p>
      <p>
       Matrix uses the same “stuck inside” symbolism but to a different effect. He is immediately exposed to the “lie” by outside forces and teams up with them to defeat an enemy, having the knowledge and power to cross into and out of both “worlds”. This is more similar to classic hero’s journey material, getting taken into a new world, make friends/allies and then together defeating the bad guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Truman Show is distinct in that he’s all alone and the enemy is unclear... as is our experience when we have to journey away from our ideological prisons. Truman is alone trying to escape something he’s not even sure what... that lack of clarify is exactly how untangling yourself from ideological shackles feels like. As the audience we just get to watch him framed within dramatic irony (we know more than him).

       The gnostic concept of being imprisoned in a world which is not "real" is the idea behind both films. Yeah, there are different story details but the overarching theme is the same.

       I don’t think the themes are the same and I think he films use the symbolism for different functions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you mean “premise”, the elements that set-up the character in a certain circumstance? Those are more similar. But themes relate to the forces of antagonism...
      </p>
      <p>
       In Truman Show the true force of antagonism is abstract as it’s literally everyone and everything in his prison, the prison itself, which is actually a metaphor for our mind. It’s is symbolic of an ever present ideology in his mind (the big brain/skull like dome he lives in). And they made it clear that isolated in our minds, we/he has no allies, not even his “best friend”, wants him to escape, as ideologies don’t want us to abandon them .
      </p>
      <p>
       In Matrix the force of antagonism is clear, Man vs Machine. Using the prison symbolism has only to due with “how” the machines have historically beat humanity... but it’s not the theme. The theme is about man reasserting himself over machine in the never ending man vs machine conflict. A dystopian warning about how the conflict could go in our future.

       I don't agree with this.  He was pretty scientific in the way he analyzed his life.  Before going "crazy" he started testing his environment to ensure that something was off.

       That's not scientific. To ensure that your hypothesis is correct you need to attempt to disprove it... not look for an echo chamber.   I agree that most people's "conspiracy" is another person's "crazy talk", but for those that want "vindication" then there is a correct way to do it.

       Lol the earth is flat, and you can't just go to Antarctica and hang out that's kind of one of the basic flat earth points... And the Truman Show is in so many flat earth videos because it's the basic theme of flat earth theory so kind of old news to FEers. Also, kind of weird you want FEers to freeze to death lol, do you want hollow earthers to die in fires and concave earthers to suffocate?

       Well by edge I meant whatever they think is there. There doesn't seem to be much consensus about a lot of the fe theorys. You'd think there would be some experiments or testable data to help them come up with a solid theory since it's "the truth". How hard can it be to prove?

       It's the same study either way, and you're correct that it's impossible to find. If the earth was truly ball, or oblate spheroid pear thing, as commonly described, then it would be easy to end the discussion with a simple proof. Instead it's always ad hominem, red herrings, straw men, etc. lame round about arguments.

       So you don't think there's any proof? You can do experiments in your backyard to prove the shape of the earth. There's photos of the earth from space. There's astronauts in space right now. The moon is upside down depending on which hemisphere you're standing in. You can literally watch the sun drop below the horizon. There's a huge amount of evidence. When someone can present proof to dispute any of that, that's when people that matter will start discussing the flat Earth. As of now it's dismissed easily.

       You basically just exemplified my previous statement. NASA is baloney town galore, and the appearance of things in the sky is a red herring. Without empirical evidence of earth curvature I won't believe it exists personally. The experiments you are talking about are very likely already based on the axiom the earth is a ball in the first place like the Eratosthenes experiment.

       There are a lot of things we all believe for years, or even forever, unless there is an event that sheds light and opens the door. How many people in the untied states believed buying a house was always a good investment until the 2008 market crash? How many people chain-smoked in the '50s because advertisers AND doctors claimed it was not bad for your health?
      </p>
      <p>
       In Truman's case, the 'sirus star' prop light falling into the road set off a chain of understanding for him. The unfortunate part about humans is that we like to stick to a singular mode of thinking unless catastrophically jostled out of it or slowly kneaded into understanding (or further obsfucstion, depending).

       This is a passive egocentric way of looking at the world.  With exception of the last point, everything you described are talking points being fed to you through your own echo chamber.  If you want to live like Truman, attempt to test the world around you.  Travel.  Listen to others you don't agree with.  Stop conforming the world to your perspective and test that perspective against something that you might not know.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "breaking away"... leave your social media behind and go play outside.  There is a beautiful world out there.... take advantage of it.

       Reddit is very much social media.  Just like any news organization, Facebook, or similar places for "information" exchange; unless you consider opposing voices as valid (despite the rhetoric of the group), you are in an echo chamber.  All the topics you pointed to were pretty specific to the subgroups you adhere to.  Hopefully you go further than this... but it doesn't show.

       Uh...the subject of the conversation is the possibility that either the world we live in is fake as in the Truman show, or the metaphorical comparison that we live in a world where evil or ill-intentioned forces control our lives.  Am I supposed to go to Two-X or r/funny for examples?  How can I avoid an echo chamber, where an echo chamber, as you put it, is the only place to have true discourse on the subject?
       <br/>
       If this is social media, I see where you're coming from, it's definitely NOT like Facebook in most meaningful ways.   If you mean I have a box that I type in and hit send for the world to see, then sure I guess it's exactly the same.

       And thank you, good luck to you too.

       Just for the record.  I'm specifically doing this so to ensure this isn't an echo chamber.  I don't see this happening here... which is why I think many people find solace here.

       In my experience, this is not an echo chamber.  You have pro trumps, anti trumps.  Flat Earthers, Holomatrix believers, people who think that UFO's are angels/demons, people who think that UFO's are extra terrestrial beings, people who think that UFO's are intradimensional, or come from the Hollow Earth.  This couldn't be any less of an echo chamber.  9/11 was in an inside job, no this other guy thinks 9/11 was the Saudis.  Everyone has their own theories and a lot of times, they directly contradict each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       And every time I comment, someone like you comes along and engages in healthy debate.  Which is good.  But it's not an echo chamber.

       One last opinion and I'll leave, if comments are upvoted to be the most noticable, then it is built to be an echo chamber.  You and others can look further, but that can be done anywhere (including platforms like Facebook).... but very few go that route.  Most will challenge you for being a nonbeliever :P

       Oh hello again kind internet stranger!  Thanks for the link, crazy they blocked the thread.  The video itself is very interesting, regardless of whatever message they were trying to get across.  If nothing else, it gives a behind the scenes look at how media is disseminated, giving much the same wonder as catching the camera crew's reflection in a car door in a final cut of a big budget Hollywood movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I'm sorry, can't really connect how a bunch of media outlets saying the same thing makes r/conspiracy an echo chamber, but you know what it's not my place to defend it this place, nor do I presume to be any kind of authority here.  My experience is that it isn't from my personal interactions and observations.

       You make arguement... although I was talking less about r/conspiracy and just reddit as a whole.  If any part of the platform can be used as a echo chamber, then the whole thing is susceptible to it.

       I will say that there are threads (like this one) that at least
       <strong>
        attempt

       to do better (although I don't think anyone should kid themselves into thinking that they can remove it entirely).

       He's been brainwash his whole life. Even if a stage light fell, that doesn't mean it's a fact. For example, the media explained it away and he could if brought that lie when he was younger.

         his life has to be believable to his viewers... thus he can't be brainwashed to the extent that we could.  (This is beside the point though since it doesn't apply to our situation.... but it does lead to the following)

       What is a metaphor?
      </p>
      <p>
       What you consider "conspiracy theorists" may have had very similar experiences. Not literally a stage lighting rig fall down in front of them with only sky above them – maybe it was three skyscrapers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they saw whistleblowers tell them their life is a lie before being disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they noticed that politicians are "crossing their fingers" all the frigging time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they noticed that the main stream media activities were on an annual loop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe their attempts to break away from their lives constantly didn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have to be fictionally obtuse characters if they didn't investigate these clues.

       To make your point clear, you think that conspiracy theorists have reason to believe their conspiracy the same way that Truman did?  News flash:  there is a theory that links all those items you pointed out.  It's called the
       <strong>
        human condition
       </strong>
       .  it states that people are greedy SOB that want to feel important.  Conspiracy theorists are no different since their whole rhetoric is created to make them feel like they are worth something.

       Most of all, I think the use of the term "conspiracy theorist" is applied too loosely, encompassing both mentally ill, looney nuts and serious investigators. Your insistence on using the term, especially on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       , which has a definition for "conspiracy", "theory" and "conspiracy theory" in the sidebar, puts your intentions into an unfavorable light.

       Yes. The Truman Show is a metaphor for the human condition.

      <p>
       You must have a lot of friends if you approach people with that premise. Does it give you a feeling of superiority, knowing people for what they truly are, looking through their greedy schemes? Ah, it seems you were talking about yourself. In my world, people are naturally and instinctively inclined towards empathy, sympathy and mutuality. That's why humans are at the top of the food chain. Only in an environment of scarcity do greed and SOBbyness become a viable survival strategy.

       Denialists embody a Truman who shrugs his shoulders every time despite all the clues that should nudge him into a deeper investigation of the world he's living in, coincidence theorizing all the blatant oddities away, content with his ignorance and slavery.

       Not deep enough. Perhaps this is the wrong subreddit for it. I don't view the movie through a conspiracy lens, but rather an allegory to reality itself, as in:

      <p>
       was that if you honestly and passionately struck out to find the truth of things, you'll find your own strange answers that don't quite meet the status quo. Look for peak experiences.

       Being that all our perceptions are suseptable to bias, you have to draw the line at "faith" somewhere before you become a nihilist.

       No.  Not if you stop soon enough.  Bit if you don't then yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assume that your observations can't be trusted.  Then you have to have faith that your a prori knowledge (math etc) is not dependent on experience... So you have to have faith that a "god" character is not lying to you.  If you don't have faith in that, then nihilism is your only option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have faith, but know what that faith is in so you can challenge it if the need comes up.

       The trick is too dissolve his famous proposition "I think, therefore I am."
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a limit to thinking. It's a tool as any other action that you may undertake, no matter how subtle and abstract. Thinking helps us navigate, plan, reflect upon this reality, and its product is experience. But it's still not the full picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try getting to the point where you can say: "I don't think, yet I still am."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the realm of mystical experiences that so much of our modern culture likes to dismiss as psychosis, schizophrenia, woo-woo, etc. It's because most have never had any experience even closely resembling this, nor do they care to seek it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mediation and religion will get you there slowly, if at all. Near-death experiences will get you there very quickly, but it's quite dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the best chance to get a glimpse for the Western thinking mind is through safe use of psychedelics. If you explore this culture, combined with the more esoteric teachings of religion (read as allegory, not as literal historical accounts), art, meditation, spirituality, you'll find your search for absolute truth accelerated.

       The problem is: "I think therefore I am" is a lie.  He knew that if he declared that there was no way to disprove that God may be an evil genius then he would be exiled by the church as Galileo was.  It should have concluded with "I think therefore
       <strong>
        something
       </strong>
       is".
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever had a dream and there are characters that you don't control?  That could be you... a side character in someone else's dream.  Fact is that there is no way to disprove mysticism or any other "supernatural" concept because science is restricted to natural observations... and if all those are fabricated then you have nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nihilism or faith.... take your pick.

       A lie is a lie.  No matter how you justify it, you are ultimately trying to protect others from a truth to make yourself be in control of the situation.  "God" can't give us truth any more than science can.

       Mystical experiences, synchronicities, deja vu all serve as reminders that true reality isn't just limited to consensus reality. Everything that happened to Truman is just a simplified, more digestible version of what can happen to you if you keep looking.

       Experience is only worth something if it let's you understand the world.  If this is a dream (maybe not even yours) then consistency should not be assumed.  Again... It comes down to faith.

       The only real thing is your experience of now. Then the choice is yours to leave it as it is, or attempt to find meaning in it. It's the choice between nihilism and faith, as you've stated, but the faith doesn't have to be blind.

       All faith is blind if you drill far enough down.  But believe what you want.  I'm done with this conversation.  If you are content not questioning reality that may have only been around for a moment and may end without warning, I'm not going to stop you.  As they say "ignorance is bliss".

       Also, the biggest key difference:
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally everyone but Truman was in on it. Of course his friends and family told him to stop and he had to push against them - they were in on it. They were part of the conspiracy, literally every single human Truman has ever met up until that point conspired against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       How big are the chances there's conspiracies out there that literally everyone is in on but you? If your friends, parents, partners IRL tell you you're a paranoid fucker and you see that as confirmation that you're on the right track in your conspiracy theory, I've got news for you: They're most likely right, you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       a paranoid fucker.

       Well, yes, in the movie everyone is 'in' on it but Truman.  It's a metaphor for how the people around you will 'play their part' in society to keep pushing the status quo whether or not it is good for you to follow them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is another very interesting part of the movie that hasn't been mentioned yet: during the film we get to see 'regular' people and their reactions to Truman as they watch the show. These are not actors, but rather the consumers of all media, even beyond the Truman show. They represent you and me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final scene of the movie is Truman crossing the dangerous unknown and reaching the edge of his own constructed reality, making another descion to leave his manufactured coccon world to expirence something closer to the truth. Millions of eyes are on him, we are the reactions of the regular masses in cuts as he leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final scene is two security guards who watched The Truman Show during their working hours. Even after these characters have seen Truman escape his cage and enter their world- something less manufactured- their reaction isn't to question what is constructed or manufactured for them by third parties in their lives, but instead to "check what else is on TV". This is the same reaction most will have to seeing the film, or to seeing a 'reality cracking event'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Truman show is an allegory for the pseudoenviroments and advertising/proganda holes we are all entrenched in and how there may be some ability to escape through understanding.

       I think that’s kind of the point? Many conspiracy theories don’t just come out of thin air, there is evidence, inconsistencies and other patterns that lead to alternate explanations for different events.

       Sounds like you’ve got your mind made up and that “conspiracy theories” aren’t ever accurate. Some people here aren’t rational, but many of us are. And many people much smarter than you question things that you blindly accept. There are people who manipulate the masses, and your attitude makes it easy to manipulate you. And that

       I'm actually looking for an actual conspiracy.  Not just your standard "people want power and will lie to get it".  At this point we should expect this as the default... not a conspiracy.  You are lying to yourself if you think someone (other than your parents) is driven by what's best for you despite their own position.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only conspiracy I've seen so far is that there are smart people that are "shining a light" on the curruption... if they want to be honest they would tell you the truth: these people rule the world... and the only way you can take it back is to actively better yourself so you can challenge your athority from within the system.

       There are many strange things about the Parkland shooting. Does that mean I 100% believe that it was a false flag? No, but there have been statements made by witnesses and other thing that do not jibe with the official story. You may not even be aware of those red flags.

       As far as I'm aware, I'm caught up on Parkland.  Everything can easily be explained by faulty memory, people misspeaking infront of a national reporter, police being (sigh) police, and citizens reacting appropriately to a horrific event that they were directly affected by.

       If you want an actual conspiracy (a lie that is constantly altering the way we see the world to benefit a select few) look no further than our economy.  The nation's wealth is held primarily by 1%.  This wealth is no longer based the gold standard so it is only dependent on what
       <strong>
        we
       </strong>
       decide.  Yet this decision is only resered (again) by a select few.  But this is accepted even though it in our ability to change though the barter system.  But no one talks about this because it's not a story that makes you special.

       I usually only see topics that make it to the top feed.  Meaning more people are buying the fiction that Parkland was a false flag than interested in actual issues.  I post for those people not for those that take it seriously like yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest (and I feel fine saying this now that we are about 10 layers down), I respect your message... but most people will unreasonably run with it.  I felt like a counterpoint was needed to keep them grounded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I tend to reserve my comments because we don't need this to be an echo chamber.  Without pulling ourselves back, we won't be able to reach those that are convinced that the surface level is reality.

       I thought about this movie for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've realized it's about a man who went along with the determined path, a predestined path that a person walks if they remain from journeying too far from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truman realized he was a victim of determinism and the only way out was through being a force of determinism himself, through practicing his will.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think The Cable Guy is Truman who grew up in a neglectful family in an alternate universe, but he inevitably didn't have the strength to escape his determined path and died for it.

       Follow evidence, not your gut. The Truman Show is a piece of fiction about the ultimate conspiracy-- a contrived hyperbole, not a narrative we should aspire to when applying skepticism to the systems which govern us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather, we should examine "conspiracy theories" of the past which have become well-supported common knowledge.

       It sounds punchy, but it's not really true. There's a lot that we can do to discriminate between fact and fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grant-funded studies which have methodological quality and have been peer reviewed/repeated are
       <em>
        clearly far more likely
       </em>
       to have credible results than other studies. Studies paid for by corporations with vested interest in the results. Studies making exclamatory claims with poor documentation, low sample size, non-peer reviewed and no repetitions. You can read them and decide for yourself from first principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for the news. You're right, at the core reporting is always just relaying observations and we decide whether or not to trust that they aren't lying/embellishing.  Some people clearly have an incentive to lie and inflame if you follow the money and the connections. Others make a living based on their journalistic integrity, they have a reading demographic who are generally educated and critical, and getting caught in a lie diminishes their integrity with quantifiable monetary consequences. We have a great wide internet with which to get multiple perspectives from large and small organizations, and when facts are repeated by, say, Washington Post, Democracy Now, CBS &amp; TYT, and then fact-checked by politifact and snopes, you can have a lot more confidence in their truth than if it were, say, something that fox and friends read on a blog that the president saw and tweeted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want, you can make up theories in which the entire internet is conspiring to make lies appear as if they are verified by diverse sources. It doesn't really fit Occam's Razor and it isn't really worth making decisions based on imo. You may as well theorize about solipsism (decarte's demon, or the Matrix). These all COULD be true, but if they were, they would be fundamentally outside of the reality we experience every day, and thus not terribly useful for
       <em>
        acting within
       </em>
       our reality. When considering any theory, one must ask if it helps us to make predictions, then measure the accuracy of those predictions. This is how relevant truth is found.

       Theories are models. Models do not equate to reality, if such a concept can even exist.

      <p>
       The caveat 'relevant' is not enough to mask the original meaning of finding truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Models do not reveal truth. What they do, instead, is fill gaps to satiate the desire to ask further questions. Consider the implications of that.

       One is never truly convinced and there is always doubt. Inference begins where deduction ends. I'm not arguing that an objective and provable truth is ever discoverable, just that some authorities are better bets than others and that the distinction can be made through reason better than intuition. This is what "evidence"
       <em>
        means
       </em>
       outside of the context of direct observation, so in this sense we agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       The points you're making are all fine in theory, but this is life and we must act. To act we must make decisions. To make decisions which benefit us we must create systems which make better predictions, and that means discriminating facts which are
       <em>
        consistent
       </em>
       between as many of our observations as possible. It is the distillation of "consistency" which account for the logic and the methods of rationality. "Truths" are the subset of available models which maximizes the consistency of our observations. "Knowledge" is the set of facts which have no unexplainable inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       From an epistemologically purist point of view, you're right, life is subjective. We will never know if the world vanishes when we turn our head. In that all knowledge originates from that which we experience, truth, in some sense, comes from the gut.
       <em>
        However
       </em>
       , in that the
       <em>
        consistency
       </em>
       between gut-derived observable facts is judged in the mind using first principles of logic, it is rationality, and not intuition which creates better models of prediction.

       This is nicely written, thanks for taking the time.

       It’s all true within certain prescribed confines of daily life, except you don’t touch upon the
       <em>
        validity
       </em>
       of the underlying processes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one delegates the work of thinking about the world to others, there had better be good checks and balances in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       What leads you to assume such checks and balances a) exist and b) actually serve your personal interests better than simply rejecting certain assumptions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Assumptions such as
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        when facts are repeated by, say, Washington Post, Democracy Now, CBS &amp; TYT, and then fact-checked by politifact and snopes, you can have a lot more confidence in their truth than if it were, say, something that fox and friends read on a blog that the president saw and tweeted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The suggestion that certain media outlets are more trustworthy than others is revealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you still believe in false dichotomies like “Fox News is untrustworthy, because its opponents are legion, and they can’t all be wrong” then you have a long way to go. They are
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       leading you astray.
      </p>
      <p>
       All mainstream media are liars and frauds whose role is to propagate agenda-pushing narratives, agendas which all roll up to the same masters, agendas that benefit from division.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weakness in this mindset boils down to a core assumption: that when one is confident about one’s cognitive toolbox, when it navigates daily life “well enough”, then it’s fine to delegate hard questions to trusted authority instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is your trust in each authority valid? How honestly have you examined it? At what point did you stop? I’m interested in the source of the confidence. From where does it derive, and what led you to consider certain sources as more trustworthy or accurate than others?
      </p>
      <p>
       School? History? The media? Your peers?
      </p>
      <p>
       If your answer reduces down to “someone else double checks facts for me, and other people check the checkers” then I’m afraid this assumption is false. The checks and balances you think exist are all circular and nobody is checking anything beyond a certain superficial and self-referential level, and especially not in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should reconsider if a framework based on trust in authority is actually serving you, rather than those who abuse it to exploit you.

       It reminds me of how there's the idea that those in control (illuminati, whoever/whatever) need to give the public a bit of honesty about what they're doing for their manipulation of reality to work. I don't remember where I heard it, but I like the idea of it. Like for example, the Truman show is a movie about living in a false reality. So is the matrix. So according to this idea, these movies are produced so the reality manipulators can
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       that they're being up front. A loophole of sorts.

       Depends on what group or individual we are talking about.  Some have good and useful instincts.  Some do not.  Once you realize a small minority of humanity, have horrific internal instincts in most situations, (often only guided by self interest at the expense of others) but outwardly display what they imagine is acceptable to those who surround them, your eyes will be open.

       Yall really taking life advice from a middle tier Jim Carrey movie. Look in at yourself and reflect on what you see cause you assholes got me believing that we didn't land on the moon, antivaxing, and chemtrails. I feel retarded for how gullible I was when I thought I was woke af. There are plenty of hard evident theories out there but no one is living on a set or a They Live scenario.

       This post was only meant as an example. Of course it is a movie. Idk how many commets thought they were being different by saying..." Yeah, but that is a movie." No shit. It is meant as a teaching tool thought.

       "Meant as a teaching tool," so are Fight Club and Taxi Driver then, which are more realistic and truer to real life but then again they're gd movies. You sound like one of my "trendy" professors throwing a popular sub reference in a powerpoint, the same way FoxNews or MSNBC likes to cherrypick or strawman unrelated points into a delusional ideal. If you want inspiration use real events and real stories. Use something concrete and reliable not a obscure reference to a unbelievable story.

       How about you come up with a better arguement, instead of deflecting. Do you even realize how much you take away from the point of view theorist in your comparison. You're basically saying stand behind what you're believing and you'll be right since Truman was but who also is a fictional character living in a micro dystopia. You're comparing Gary Webb or Frank Serpico to a character portrayed by Jim Carrey, which is the exact kind of comparsions we get from mainstream media, real events to social satire.

       I'm not deflecting from any argument. First of all, your working yourself up and second of all....being a conspiracy theorist can describe several different types of people. It is a pretty general label.

       You're missing the point. We're not defining what a conspiracy theorists is, but the legitimateness of a belief behind false inspiration and the thought process that turns an awry circumstance into valid suspicion. Truman Show is a good movie but don't go saying "See he was right even though none this didn't really happened." Reasoning like this is what I'm comparing to the media too. And also you used the phrase "first of all" on your 2nd point which is semantics, but it let's me know you're not really listening to yourself so why would you listen to me.

       In that case, I think what I would suggest is to force your way right into a 'work' area and ask to talk to the producer. Then, make a deal to keep acting, but with a couple of weeks a year off to go incognito into the world, paid vacations etc... rest of the time, you can stick around, bang an incredibly hot girl way out of your league, and basically enjoy yourself every day without REALLY working since you know you dont have to.

       You, and I, are not in The Truman Show or the Matrix. We are in Real Life, where most people hardly ever think about any of us except when we are in front of them. These movies appeal to conspiracy buffs because we think we each have a special unique insite into the human situation.

       The Truman Show is a direct reference to our flat earth enclosed by a dome.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Truman found the edge, he did not fall off, he found out that there was a barrier, and that barrier was the dome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats why we cannot go to the interior of Antarctica, because we would find the exterior of our reality.
      </p>

       They are hiding God. They are not hiding more land. Finding out that we are in an enclosed world would have no other explanation other than creation.

       I like discussions and I enjoy reading peoples post. But I hate it when people get impolite or choose to be overbearing with their opinions. I literally was sitting on my couch thinking of that movie (bc I really enjoyed it) and I just thought it was a interesting thought about conspiracy theorist. So I posted it. Some people have posted some extremely rude responses. I don't really get that.

       If you're upset because you think I'm personally characterizing you as an internet theorist, I'm not. 
You said Truman would have been that kind of person had he done nothing about what he believed was going on. That's a good attitude to have, I'd really like to see more of it, especially from flat earthers

       When Truman goes to touch the light, the camera angle is odd: we see Truman from ground level. This angle is used because it means that we see Truman touch the light in between

       What is a metaphor?

      <p>
       What you consider "conspiracy theorists" may have had very similar experiences. Not literally a stage lighting rig fall down in front of them with only sky above them – maybe it was three skyscrapers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they saw whistleblowers tell them their life is a lie before being disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they noticed that politicians are "crossing their fingers" all the frigging time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they noticed that the main stream media activities were on an annual loop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe their attempts to break away from their lives constantly didn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have to be fictionally obtuse characters if they didn't investigate these clues.

       Also, the biggest key difference:
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally everyone but Truman was in on it. Of course his friends and family told him to stop and he had to push against them - they were in on it. They were part of the conspiracy, literally every single human Truman has ever met up until that point conspired against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       How big are the chances there's conspiracies out there that literally everyone is in on but you? If your friends, parents, partners IRL tell you you're a paranoid fucker and you see that as confirmation that you're on the right track in your conspiracy theory, I've got news for you: They're most likely right, you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       a paranoid fucker.

       I think that’s kind of the point? Many conspiracy theories don’t just come out of thin air, there is evidence, inconsistencies and other patterns that lead to alternate explanations for different events.

       If you're upset because you think I'm personally characterizing you as an internet theorist, I'm not. 
You said Truman would have been that kind of person had he done nothing about what he believed was going on. That's a good attitude to have, I'd really like to see more of it, especially from flat earthers
