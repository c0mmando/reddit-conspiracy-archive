<p>The Israel Defence Forces have pioneered state military engagement with social media, with dedicated teams operating since Operation Cast Lead, its war in Gaza in 2008-9. The IDF is active on 30 platforms – including Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and Instagram – in six languages. “It enables us to engage with an audience we otherwise wouldn’t reach,” said an Israeli army spokesman. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade">https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade</a></p>

Also, just have a look around. This is supposedly a progressive leaning website, yet it&#39;s military worship &#39;round the clock. On virtually all of the popular subs, if you&#39;re critical of the military (the ones we should all be extremely critical of) you will typically either receive no upvotes or you will be downvoted.<br/>
Have a look at the number of upvotes a photo of someone&#39;s WWII grandfather gets. Have a look at the low subscriber counts on r/antiwar and r/endlesswar.<br/>
I think there&#39;s a good chance this site is essentially being reconstructed at all times by powerful military/intelligence computers &amp; shills, and maybe even a bit of server hacking or admin/dev team infiltration.  </p>

<p>In 2000 I was in University and my friend/classmate who was into the occult (though I don&#39;t think that part matters too much) had a very very rich best friend whose dad worked at or owned or something to do with a major US bank. </p>

<p>The bank employed a Saudi short term. She said that when he left, he left behind a very cryptic written note that warned about an upcoming attack on the US. It was not referred to as &quot;9/11&quot;, and I didn&#39;t think much of it because my friend had collected tons of planned apacolypse type occult documents, and this was just another of her &quot;it&#39;s coming soon&quot; chicken little things.</p>

<p>But when 9/11 happened, on that day I remembered the Saudi note story I was told. I don&#39;t think her, her friend or her friend&#39;s dad or any co-worker could have really prevented this. </p>

<p>Unrelated, in 1990 my friends, us being little kids, hypothetically determined how to destroy the United States (if we were Russia or something). Blow up Twin Towers and Pentagon. Though those targets are pretty obvious.</p>

<p>All footage released by Pentagon / NIST shows NO PLANE.</p>

<p>Only Jewish controlled MSM showed footage showing CG planes which the other networks then copied.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol the Israelis were arrested on 911 after the bomb detection dog started barking them (they also tried bribing the cops who pulled them over). See the FBI report. According to one witness, they were set up filming before the first explosion.</p>

<p>There is footage of the cutting charges going off on youtube.</p>

<p>We have photos of the &quot;Israeli art students&quot; with boxes of fuses for explosives taken in the WTC.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a lack of evidence or testimony. It&#39;s EXTREME corruption because Jews blackmail pedophile politicians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. When they give you the brush off like that you should tell them that you wish to make a statement. If you contact an Australian police force or the AFP and tell them you wish to make a statement then they are supposed to enter your statement into the public record. If you are an actual witness to an international criminal event then I strongly suggest you submit you statement to the AFP under the supervision of your solicitor. Good luck.,</p>
