       Thorium reactors are incredibly efficient, using just 1 ton of Thorium would produce as much power as 3.5 million tons of coal and 100 tons of Uranium. It is also insanely safe, as it requires plutonium in small amounts to make it generate heat, so unlike Uranium, a meltdown is insanely rare.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, we see almost no investment into this technology, and we continue to go to war for oil and coal. It seems like Thorium technology is being surpressed by oil or coal lobbies, and is seen by anti-nuclear energy advocates as dangerous.

       Just a guess, but I will bet it is being suppressed.  It seems like an obvious solution.  Why are we putting up all those ridiculous windmills?  They are disruptive to the environment and in some situations  seem to be causing distress to farm animals and hurting human health.  Don't even mention the birds being killed by these things.

       The reason its supressed is you cant weaponized thorium. It requires a catalyst to even react. So basically when we had the choice of using thorium or something that could be made into a bomb in a week.

       This is not true. Thorium is not being ignored. It's hard to mine and there are no proper supply chains.

       For all intents and purposes we have more thorium than we can use even with projected increases and transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a byproduct of mining rare earths like neodymium we produce enough thorium to power the earth each year. This is without even trying.

       You can mine good old dirt found anywhere on earth even and get thorium.

       It's because of US regulation that there is excess thrown. If its mined like in China it won't be as easy and using it as a fuel is hard as well. You need a few more countries besides China to convince the US to mine it.

       Yes there is. Thorium does not have a fissile isotope, you need other materials to get it started. Which brings up the supply chain issue.

       You can use U235 or spallation via a linear accelerator.   Remember the MSRE went critical on U233 which was bred from thorium.   You are making a non-issue into an issue.

       For all intents and purposes we have more thorium than we can use even with projected increases and transportation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a byproduct of mining rare earths like neodymium we produce enough thorium to power the earth each year. This is without even trying.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can mine good old dirt found anywhere on earth even and get thorium.

      <p>
       1 average cubic meter of the earth's crust has the thorium energy content when used in a LFTR to equal 17 cubic meters of oil, or 50 cubic meters of coal.

       Then you get the thorium and what do you do with it? How do you get it to power your reactor? Ahhh see you didn't think of that one did you. Well Thorium has to be converted into U233, first you have to irradiate the thorium with neutron radiation. Then when your thorium accepts a neutron it becomes Thorium 233, which then undergoes beta decay into protactinium 233, which will remain protactinium 233 for ~27 days, after which, if it has not absorbed any more neutrons will decay into uranium 233, and then can you introduce it as a nuclear fuel. Except it's more radioactive and more difficult to handle that reactor grade uranium. Now you know.

       That's untrue. The same effect can be achieved by touching small amounts of Plutonium to liquid Thorium.

       Yeah that's where the thorium gets it's neutrons from but it still has to go through the decay chain, you can't cheat physics.

        it requires plutonium in small amounts to make it generate heat, so unlike Uranium, a meltdown is insanely rare.

       So some things here aren't right.  In a LFTR the worst that can possibly occur is the reactor contents wind up in a passively cooled drain tank, fission stops, and the contents solidify until the reactor is repaired.  That is the worst event that can occur, they are 100% passively save.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thorium is fertile, not fissile meaning to start the reactor up you need some fissile material, U233, U235 or Pu239 all would suffice, but U233 would be ideal.  Thorium is transmuted into U233 which is what actually powers a LFTR.
