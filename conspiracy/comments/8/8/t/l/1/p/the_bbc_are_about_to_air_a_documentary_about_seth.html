       I will post the run down on here afterwards and let u know if it paints us all as morons. Despite the BBC's reputation they do occasionally give people on the fringes a fair shake. HyperNormalisation is an example of this. It is rare though. Usually we are painted as either anti-Semites or delusional.

       If anyone finds a link for people outside the UK to view it I am sure people in the comments would appreciate it.

       It's opened with talking about the Bernie/Clinton clashes in the primaries . Talking about the smearing of Bernie and his supporters by the Clinton camp and her supporters. Talking now about how Seth wanted to get more people registered to vote.

       Did they happen to mention the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYzB96_EK7s">
        Seymour Hersh audio
       </a>
       that was
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/892510925244203008?lang=en">
        tweeted out by WikiLeaks
       </a>
       right after it emerged? That's one of the tougher bits to brush off -- I've noticed they usually just pretend it never happened, or else misrepresent it (like, claiming Hersh was "fishing or information", without acknowledging that that totally fails to explain why he'd go on such a detailed 6+ minute monologue where he stresses the reliability of his own source...). No one's ever actually debunked any of the specific falsifiable claims Hersh made, to my knowledge. It's really awkward how all these hit pieces about Seth Rich "conspiracy theorists" conspicuously ignore that elephant in the room, so it would be nice if BBC did a bit better...

       That Seymour Hersh clip is never going to get mainstream attention 
because it's exactly the kind of thing Americans need to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hersh is a fantastic journalist and part of that disappearing vanguard of true American leftists that are now cranky old men disappointed in the stubborn neoliberal dogma of Democrats, Republicans and media like the NYT more interested in touting the party line than doing their jobs as journalists.

       Seymour Hersh did retract / rephrase his comment, so you can't really put too much weight on it.  However it still should have been mentioned.

       I havent followed this case near as close as some people here. That said, depending on the circumstances, couldn't the retraction by Hersh be taken as sign that his original statement is actually very damning indeed and that maybe someone got to him?

       Nothing about Guccifer.

       One of his neighbours was on and talked about when he saw him lying on the floor in the street he was alive and conscious. He said he looked up at him and made eye contact. This was when the police where taping off the area. There was nothing about him being alive after this point. Nothing about him being in hospital etc.

       The Fox News thing was weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       This millionaire, Ed Butowsky, he's all over the Seth Rich murder from the get go, offers to hire a private investigator for the Rich family, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So heres what happened with the private investigator and the Fox News report though iirc. Before Fox News broadcasted the story, it was reported by some local affiliate. A rookie reporter who had independently verified the claims that the private investigator was making  right? Thing is the source she independently verified what the private investigator was saying through was Ed Butowsky and his private investigation, unbeknownst to her that Ed Butowsky was bankrolling the same private investigator who was coming on the show. Then of course the local affiliate told the the private investigator that they had independently verified his claims, unbeknownsnt to the private investigator that the local affiliate's source was ed butowsky.
      </p>
      <p>
       i remember watching that guy admit he fucked up on the news and you can tell he was really upset about it. this guy was no swindler. He was definitely misled or lied to, i think intentionally. Idk by who though. he's a reputable investigator with solid credentials and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       the whole thing was a huge cluster fuck orchesterated, as far as I can tell, by Ed Butowsky. Idk if he fucked them over on purpose hoping the discrepancies would slip through cracks or what the deal was tbh. shit was turnt

       I would say it wasn't as bad as I expected. My biggest complaint was that it focused too much on the private investigators and journalists who investigated the murder. It would have been better if they had actually looked into it themselves rather then relying on info from partisan sources.

       It will put the event in a box, frames the narravtive and provides the accepatble questions (however edgy) from an international "reputable" investigation. Give it a few months and we'll have a documentary stateside, it'll show up here, narrow the subset of investigative questions, regurgitate answers from the creditted BBC interview and BAM, official narrative established.

       I'd link the quote, but something something bandwith of discussion but have a lively debate within that discussion.

       The BBC is an enormous institution. That has produced wall to wall programming since the birth of the medium.  Overall it is fairy mainstream non risk taking but there is good stuff too. You can't just discredit it based of this or that. You're going to have to be a bit more nuanced than that.

       Thought it was pretty balanced, for BBC. 
Couple of, non-political, questions came to mind:
      </p>
      <p>
       -It took him somewhere around three hours to walk home from the bar. Normally it would've taken him about 40 minutes. Where was he during these three hours? Did they try to use cellphone data to retrace his steps? Did they test his blood alcohol level?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        he was found in the middle of the street. The way this was shown, at least for me, could imply that a vehicle was involved, did they check all available cameras in a let's just say 2or 3 mile radius?
       </li>
      </ul>

       This was my biggest gripe with the film. It didn't address the actual crime at all. It was as though they just assumed the official narrative of it being a robbery gone wrong (which is absurd to me).

       They're paid professional lobbyists. They are all the dirty trick in itself, because they have nothing to do with the facts. We assume it is not true because those so eager to associate with it are disingenuous and lie. This documentary was 10% fact and 90% emotional manipulation.

       Bullshit. I believe he was murdered. It's only discounted because of the association with so many scumbags like Roger Stone. If something has enough flies around it you assume it is shit. He needs to keep Julian Assange's name out of his fucking mouth.

       Early on it uncritically states that WAPO declares "Russian hacking" as a fact.

       It has a commenter state that "conspiracy theorists" are questioning the so-called robbery because nothing was stolen! Yes, only crazy people would question the authorities.

       Has someone implying that to suggest that the DNC rigged the election in favour of HRC is insane.

       Classic BBC.

      <p>
       And for non-Brits, the BBC is state-run and is paid for by taxation. It is disguised as a license fee but every UK citizen knows it as a tax. You can go to jail if you watch TV without this "license". The UK government appoints the chairman and the board. Until very recently, there was an office of the MI5 inside BBC HQ.

       Did they happen to mention the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYzB96_EK7s">
        Seymour Hersh audio
       </a>
       that was
       <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/892510925244203008?lang=en">
        tweeted out by WikiLeaks
       </a>
       right after it emerged? That's one of the tougher bits to brush off -- I've noticed they usually just pretend it never happened, or else misrepresent it (like, claiming Hersh was "fishing or information", without acknowledging that that totally fails to explain why he'd go on such a detailed 6+ minute monologue where he stresses the reliability of his own source...). No one's ever actually debunked any of the specific falsifiable claims Hersh made, to my knowledge. It's really awkward how all these hit pieces about Seth Rich "conspiracy theorists" conspicuously ignore that elephant in the room, so it would be nice if BBC did a bit better...

       The Fox News thing was weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       This millionaire, Ed Butowsky, he's all over the Seth Rich murder from the get go, offers to hire a private investigator for the Rich family, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So heres what happened with the private investigator and the Fox News report though iirc. Before Fox News broadcasted the story, it was reported by some local affiliate. A rookie reporter who had independently verified the claims that the private investigator was making  right? Thing is the source she independently verified what the private investigator was saying through was Ed Butowsky and his private investigation, unbeknownst to her that Ed Butowsky was bankrolling the same private investigator who was coming on the show. Then of course the local affiliate told the the private investigator that they had independently verified his claims, unbeknownsnt to the private investigator that the local affiliate's source was ed butowsky.
      </p>
      <p>
       i remember watching that guy admit he fucked up on the news and you can tell he was really upset about it. this guy was no swindler. He was definitely misled or lied to, i think intentionally. Idk by who though. he's a reputable investigator with solid credentials and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       the whole thing was a huge cluster fuck orchesterated, as far as I can tell, by Ed Butowsky. Idk if he fucked them over on purpose hoping the discrepancies would slip through cracks or what the deal was tbh. shit was turnt

       I would say it wasn't as bad as I expected. My biggest complaint was that it focused too much on the private investigators and journalists who investigated the murder. It would have been better if they had actually looked into it themselves rather then relying on info from partisan sources.
