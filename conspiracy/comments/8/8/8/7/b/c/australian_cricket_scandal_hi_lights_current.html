       Short of it is this.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 Australian cricketers conspired to tamper with the cricket ball to gain a sporting advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
       It amounts to cheating... Plain and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Australians do not stand for cheating and cheats.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it is pretty big news.
      </p>
      <p>
       However... this story has been wall to wall news coverage. 6 days since it all started breaking and the first 4 articles on a prominent news website are this cricket story.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give you an understanding of mental and fat it has gone.
A Swedish newspaper ran the story and the New York Times did. What the fuck do they know about cricket!??!!
      </p>
      <p>
       They sat these kids/young men down in a press conference and just crucified them. Had them all breaking down in tears.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all so overblown and outrageous over a game of cricket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile we have the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers where trillions of dollars of tax evasion is going on with very prominent people including Prime Ministers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This story barely got one day of news coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about you but...
      </p>
      <p>
       Rich people conspiring to keep us all poor  is a way bigger scandal than sportsballers conspiring to cheat at sportsball.
      </p>
      <p>
       State of the current world sickens me.

       I have been consuming so much "new" media lately and love it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watching 2-3 hours of say Joe Rogan talking with intelligent people is just so absorbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is definite push back from "old media" trying to hang on to their power but I can definitely see it dying.

       Just hope TPTB don't get their claws into new media.

       Yeah they are all over new media trying to influence the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soros has a huge stake in Netflix in the last year and you only have to look who owns twitter and Youtube to understand the shady shadow banning and other tactics of late.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't control everything every where though. DTUBE and GAB are alternatives to YT and Twitter now.

       It's a reinforcing part of the echo chamber that a whole lot of people shape their beliefs by.

       Watch Korean movies vs Netflix vs Russian and you can see the propaganda at work.

       BTW Joe Rogan is an entertainer who skirts the edges of real conspiracies.

       Wow thanks, great reply.

       I have very similar frustrations with my family and friends.

       It's really hard to discuss anything in depth without being labelled an internet "believe anything" guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       What will it take for the illusion to be shattered for some people? I really don't think much anymore and there is an awakening happening with the Internet that even a cynic like me can't deny.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really do like a lot of what Rogan does, he has a large audience and it's show's like his that may drop the initial bombs that go viral to awaken the masses.

       Their efforts at doing this appear to be doing things like pushing CNN videos on YouTube or funding shills like Sam Seder who just parrot corporate media talking points. I'm not too worried. They'll co-opt some decent public figures in social media over time, I'm sure, but there will always be more and more decent people out there to rise up too. As long as social media can be decentralized enough to democratize the media people most actively engage with, I think we'll be OK.

       The media reports on quite a lot of things, but this one in particular has a LOT of people riled up. Can't say the media never reported on stuff like Wikileaks, but people just didn't care.

       The problem is media is feeding of the interests of the people. Panama papers are too much, thinking, worrying, realising how screwed everything is. people dont like to think, life's a shit as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a pop culture scandal is much more popular than a next level of thinking issue requiring putting your own world view on the line. Where as a sporting scandal is easy, it affects nothing of our lives, just our entertainment as mindless as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the problem with media is as much the fault of the people over worked, drained and beaten, weak to exercise their power to stand up against the corruption, as it is the very corrupt media who feeds this loop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence why current stance on global politics is to get people interested in politics, interested in getting into this mess and driving support for change is hard work), vs easy to digest media of social drama.

       Which came first, the public outrage or the media attention?

      <p>
       Because the media is going to report on what it thinks the public wants to hear about - Gotta sell papers/click afterall.

       Here the thing though.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are fed these constant ideas like what it is to be "Australian" or "American".
      </p>
      <p>
       You ever hear those words?
      </p>
      <p>
       "That's so unAustralian"
      </p>
      <p>
       "That's so unAmerican"
      </p>
      <p>
       So the narrative is that "Australians don't cheat".
      </p>
      <p>
       "Cheating is not the Australian way"
      </p>
      <p>
       Except that's bullshit.
      </p>

       Chapell bowled underarm to cheat the Kiwis.

      </p>
      <p>
       Heaps more examples of Australians cheating in all sorts of industries and even everyday life.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Australians always fight to the end" is another buzzword phrase that's bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Germany 4-0 Australia. We gave up without a fight in that match.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my point is... we are led down the garden path by these narratives and then outraged when the narrative doesn't fit our doctored beliefs.

       I don't know, your observation is definitely true, but I would put the blame on the masses. People much rather read about cricket, celebrities or other nonsense than actual important things such as the panama papers. "In a democracy people get the leaders they deserve."

       I stopped listening and watching cricket a few years back. I have no attachment to any of the cricketers involved. Cricket is still the most popular summer sport in Australia and has an import place in our culture. However the media coverage of this poorly executed attempt to cheat has received not just excessive media coverage but alarmingly disproportionate coverage. One reason why this has received such significant coverage is that the TV rights for cricket in Australia is currently being negotiated. Apparently all of the TV stations made offers significantly less than what Cricket Australia (CA) wanted. CA asked all bidders for the media rights to come back with better offers. Then the cheating scandal broke. So by beating this cheating story to death the media outlets have significantly damaged the reputation of cricket, the Australian team and reduced the bargaining power of CA. The media outlets now hold all the cards in the negotiations. It's very unlikely that CA will get the deal they want and by keeping this cheating story going they will save a bucket load of money.

       I am an American that follows cricket closely, and people who know me know this.  I have been asked by at least two dozen people what this scandal means and why it is important.  People who know me also know I am into conspiracies.  I answered more cricket questions yesterday than I have in my entire lifetime about any of the conspiracies I am into.  People don't give a shit.

       I am saying they don't give as  much of a shit about more important stores we should be outraged against.  I understand cricket is very important in Australia, and this was a bad incident, but the reason people were upset is that the integrity of the sport was called into question.   If this sort of response could have been mobilized to end child abuse or abduction we may have woken up to a better world this morning.  Instead, we woke up to a world where I suspect Australia will be more discrete when scuffing the ball from now on.

       Bancroft would have received the same or a similar punishment, i.e fine and demerit points via the ICC. I don't claim to be versed in how that relates to Smith following the days play press conference acknowledging his part in the conspiracy but assume at worst he may have suffered the same punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 12 and 9 month suspension has been handed down by the ACB under a 'disrepute' type ruling that all players would have in their contract with the ACB.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have conflicting opinions regarding the punishment personally. One one hand it's waaaaay over the top when under ICC law its not even considered to be worthy of even a one match immediate ban. I do have pride in the way not just our cricketers but sportspeople of Australia in general who in the large part participate fairly and give 100%, something that's acknowledged universally by their competitors and other competing nations fans.
