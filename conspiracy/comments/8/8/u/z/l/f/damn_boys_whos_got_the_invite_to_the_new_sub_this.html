    <div class="md"><p>Probably just another person in the &quot;distinct subgroup who appeared to be posting primarily in order to debunk conspiracy beliefs.&quot; This sub is full of them, and they aren&#39;t just &quot;skeptics.&quot; There is nothing wrong with skepticism, but the brand of &quot;skepticism&quot; we see in this sub is often over-the-top conspiracy denialism to the point of absurdity, and pushing of mainstream narratives.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-29/online-conspiracy-theorists-are-more-diverse-28and-ordinary29/9600834">this study of comparisons between subgroups of users in this sub.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a recent paper we used online comments to examine individuals who are interested in these types of ideas. We examined a complete set of comments over eight years from the conspiracy forum of reddit.com. (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>)</p>

<p>We were able to identify 12 distinct subgroups of individuals who used language in different ways and who varied widely in their interests and their posting habits. What they talked about strongly suggested that they held different beliefs and attitudes about a range of conspiracies.</p>

<p><strong>There was even a distinct subgroup who appeared to be posting primarily in order to debunk conspiracy beliefs (sceptics).</strong> This suggests that individuals involved with conspiracy theories may have quite different motivations, beliefs and attitudes. It may not be useful to consider them as a homogeneous group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the chart, this group appears to be a little less than 10 percent of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users, which is <em>way</em> more than I originally thought were here. </p>

Why are &quot;skeptics&quot; only skeptical of conspiracies?  Anything generated by CNN, the Washington Post, or any establishment PR machine, and so-called &quot;skeptics&quot; feel absolutely no need to question it.  </p>

<p>Just because that nimrod Michael Shermer named his shitrag &quot;Skeptic&quot;, doesn&#39;t mean that he, or his ilk, are skeptics.    Conspiracy theorists are the real skeptics because we question accepted narratives and we investigate.  Dammit. Grrrr.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve been on this sub for about two years and you haven&#39;t gained enough information on any of them to subscribe to at least 1?</p>

<p>If you do it for entertainment, fair enough. But then why argue something if you don&#39;t know enough about it to even make an argument?</p>

<p>You can believe what you want. But generally in the short history of Internet conspiracy forums, people who don&#39;t subscribe to any conspiracy theories are only there to basically cause trouble, troll, mock, disrupt conversation, etc. Previously a good way to see why someone was active in the community was to ask simple questions like I asked you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying by the very nature of conspiracies I wouldn&#39;t want to 100% commit to saying any specific one is true.  There&#39;s conspiracies I think could be true but none of us no for sure and I wouldn&#39;t trust anyone who says otherwise. </p>

<p>Honestly I wouldn&#39;t say I was arguing (granted I can be a snarky prick sometimes), I&#39;m just genuinely trying to get some information about this subject, not for any nefarious means or as a way to divert conversations. I love this sub, I love reading about conspiracies but from my point of view (you don&#39;t agree, I get it) there&#39;s no evidence of an organised attempt at subverting this sub. I feel this place is being ruined by people throwing about accusations and complaints to the point where a huge percent of comment threads just become about this subject. Which is why I vocalised this opinion. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest with you, man. I think it&#39;s way more likely that the people who are constantly moaning about shills are the ones which ulterior motives. What better way of disrupting a community than sewing animosity and doubt?</p>

<p>I know what i am talking about but please excuse my bad English, as well as the Format.</p>

<p>Fact is that Wind Energy is not „harmless“ or „Renewable“ at the moment, similar to nuclear Fission.</p>

<p>Windturbines get hot and when they fail the Gearbox fired up and release this mentioned Stuff, fact is also that we see a huge environmental Impact from the rare Earth Mining Process as well as in the Location of the Turbines, i am from a small Country in the north of Europe where we used a lot of Wind, the Anchor of this Turbines are not that small and remain in the Ground because the Provider do not need to remove it.</p>

Instead of the shills getting first word- they waste most of the thread responding to yours, and even if they do post a separate comment, your comment was placed first and has a better chance of being seen and upvoted above theirs. </p>
