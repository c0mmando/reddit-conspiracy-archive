<p>In a comment above you claimed that watching porn raises testosterone. You do realize that testosterone can make people violent, right? So if your concerned with the violence that you believe is plaguing our country shouldn&#39;t you really be a proponent for #nofap?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That article is absolute garbage.  High testosterone is not the problem at all and implying that is downright irresponsible.  A low level of testosterone with a high level of estrogen is more likely to cause a man to lash out.  It&#39;s not the hormone itself it&#39;s the imbalance.  </p>

<p>Porn does not cause imbalance in your hormones because it only temporarily elevates your testosterone, which is the exact same thing a good workout does.</p>

<p>The reason action movies, or games, are more of a problem is because they lower testosterone while raising estrogen.  To put it bluntly, you feel like a bitch after watching an action movie and men will tend to overcompensate for the feeling of being a bitch by lashing out at something to prove they are manly.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you get men going to bars getting drunk and picking fights with each other, I guarantee they weren&#39;t at home watching porn.  They were probably at home watching UFC or some action movie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s that sex is the #1 driver for humanity and always has been.  America recognized this and using sex as a carrot on a string is a HUGE part of the way capitalism works.  Most shit in this country is purchased, man or woman, to make some sort of impression on the opposite sex.  That is why the &quot;free love&quot; hippy movement was the main enemy of our government once upon a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>nofap is a totally government created movement because they need people to be driven to work and, as you said, reproduce again.</h1>

<p>Fun fact, violence in media actually LOWERS testosterone and raises estrogen.  You go see an action movie and come out less of a man for it.  Porn actually raises testosterone.</p>

<p>You are less likely to seek out female companionship if you are obsessed with action movies and video games than if you watch tons of porn.  I can personally attest to this.  I&#39;ve had girlfriends at times when I am playing no video games, but I&#39;ve always watched porn.  The only time I haven&#39;t had a social life is during periods of my life when I&#39;m playing a lot of video games.</p>
