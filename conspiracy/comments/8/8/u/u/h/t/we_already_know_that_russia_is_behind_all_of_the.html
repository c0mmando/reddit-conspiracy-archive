       The US and Russia have been using propaganda since the start of the cold war, and I'm not saying that either side is good or bad. There is a lot of propaganda and counter-propaganda that goes around, and a lot of people tend to get caught in the middle of it. 
I personally think that authoritarianism and propaganda are both evils. But how do you tell what is propaganda and what is the truth?

       Russia behind 9/11 conspiracies? LMFAO. Do you honestly believe the  government narrative about 9/11? Do you honestly think the Russians disseminate the awful, gaping holes in the official story?

       I think that Russia is negligible in all this. 9/11 conspiracy has been a largely American pushed phenomena- People have seen this bullshit from the beginning and a few more wake up each year. I wouldn't give Russia any sort of real credibility here, because then as OP has done, people might start suddenly thinking Russia was behind 9/11 instead of our own degenerate Elites.

       You're right, I was being cheeky and taking you too literally on purpose. Such is the nature of the day! Russia's influence on this topic has been like tossing some kindling into an already-raging house fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only point is that Russia does fund and support US dissidents and views that go against the US corporate/bureaucratic power nexus because in at least a narrow window, their interests do align. And I'm thankful for it. RT has given a platform to numerous US journalists and activists who never would have had a chance to say what they say on US-owned corporate media, including Abby Martin, Chris Hedges, Mike Papantonio, Lee Camp, Jesse Ventura, and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no illusions as to
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       Russia gives them a platform, and I certainly don't trust Russia, but without them, the US media landscape would be in a worse position than it already is.

       I'm completely aware that the US isn't necessarily good, but Russia isn't either. The US creates a ton of anti-Russian propaganda, and Russia has every right to create anti-US propaganda in turn. But that's the thing, it's probably isn't good to get caught in the middle. Hypothetically lets say Bush or Bin Laden or Russia did 9/11, so what, can you do anything about it? How can you or I make a difference?

       First, we make a difference by spreading the Truth. And the Truth is that 9/11 is not as it appears. The evidence points towards an internal job by our Elites and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the Russians. Saying the Russians did 9/11 only makes things worse and allows the degenerates that run this country to get away with further crimes.

       If Russia is behind 9/11 Conspiracy theories, then good on them because they have put forth a lot of compelling and truthful evidence to suggest that 9/11 was indeed a complete shitshow of lies and deception

       The US and Russia have been using propaganda since the start of the cold war, and I'm not saying that either side is good or bad. There is a lot of propaganda and counter-propaganda that goes around, and a lot of people tend to get caught in the middle of it. 
I personally think that authoritarianism and propaganda are both evils. But how do you tell what is propaganda and what is the truth?

       I think that Russia is negligible in all this. 9/11 conspiracy has been a largely American pushed phenomena- People have seen this bullshit from the beginning and a few more wake up each year. I wouldn't give Russia any sort of real credibility here, because then as OP has done, people might start suddenly thinking Russia was behind 9/11 instead of our own degenerate Elites.
