       With the Snowden leaks you could learn about what the government does but you really don't have any control with what you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the CA/facebook leak you as a person actually can do something about it by not using Facebook and push politicians to regulate what social media sites can do with our data. Real actions.

       I don't trust our "duly elected" representatives any more than I trust Zuckerberg, and politicians regulating social media seems like the worst kind of ceding control of our information to those who would use it against us. We need truly decentralized and distributed forms of communication, the type any of this regulation would undoubtedly make illegal.

       Not nothing, we start using our own forms of communication that aren't mediated by billion-dollar tech firms. The technologies to do this already exists, and early platforms are already in development such as BitChute, Dtube, Mastodon, Gab.ai, Diaspora, Steemit, etc.

       I feel we've given too much power/credit to FB.  People are actually afraid to delete it.  Just get rid of it.  It's time to move on as a society.  Now that we've glimpsed the power of connectivity, we'll find a better avenue, one that better looks out for the wellfare and wellbeing of its users. I think it would be wonderful if the world sent a strong message that we won't tolerate having our feeds manipulated, having our privacy and free speech eroded, our society polarized.  It's time for the beast that Zuckerberg has created to turn upon him and take him down.

       I don't disagree with you, but we really don't have that better avenue yet, and if we silence ourselves on the currently popular social media platforms, we lose the ability to connect to people and actually spread these messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't used FB in years, and never did do much on it anyway, but I still use reddit. You do to. Reddit might be marginally better in a few aspects, but it's still fundamentally the same top-down control network set up. Even fringe subs like this are becoming increasingly controlled, and we're forced to retreat to ever-smaller subs to be able to even have open conversations about many topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do need to move away from these platforms, but until we actually have viable alternatives, it seems like ceding unnecessary ground.

       You can thank admin’s for that. I’ve always thought having admin‘s on a site was a stupid idea. Unless you’re going to rotate them out every six months to a year to prevent corruption and biased thinking, it’s stupid to have them. We see it every day on Reddit, tons of Admins always censoring and trying to shut people up. It’s a goddamn mess. Peoples voices are squashed left and right now.

       It's easy to say that but I've been arrested for graffiti and it's really not a fun time.  They take it weirdly seriously and the person arresting me said they do so because it's seen as a degradation/collapse of society.  Which it is in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I don't think vandalism ever really made big marks. I think the best course of action is to wear the sheep's clothing. Penetrate deep into the underbelly of the beast, and rip it's heart out from the inside.  That's the only way to make real change we have left.

       You secede too easily. I’ve been to jail for trespassing. It’s not a fun time but also was a waste of my time when I realized I was surrounded by people in for more legitimate crimes. 
A dude by the name of Banksy sure as hell has made big marks around the world through
       <em>
        graffiti
       </em>
       so why can’t more people? What you just mentioned takes planning and time by a dedicated group of people. This isn’t the hunger games.

       Ah I see your point.  I think comparing oneself to banksy before doing that is a bit premature, though. Banksy, while making a mark, is still considered "just a street artist." And I think most people, to whom the message is intended, don't actually pick up on the implications as much as they're meant to.  While I agree art is influential and definitely a tool to persuade (propaganda), but I think aspiring to be like Banksy, who, in a world of millions of graffiti artists is the only truly world famous, mainstream artist.

       Yeah you can maybe get some people in your town or city to think a little about some slogan you write on a wall, but that's such a small drop in a huge bucket. While yes, I admit my scheme was on the static other side in terms of scale, I think it's the Long Con that really makes a difference. Considering They have been at it for millennia, they have game plans they're working on now that were set yeeeears ago.  If we compare the magnitude and power of the people we're up against, vs a few words in spraypaint on a wall, it's daunting.

       I wouldn't say I severe easily since I got arrested twice and each time I just pick a new name and style so they can't connect me back, I just don't think that the medium of graffiti is really going to make any difference in The Fight.

       It’s exactly why I say if more people did it, in terms of just political influence on a larger scale than just a random town here n there, I think it would start to impact a lot of minds. At that point, it’s basically not art or graffiti, it’s blatant homemade propaganda by and for the civilian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it’s not a final solution to fix anything. And you’re right about infiltration. It’s just a long process that most people, who will only have simple ideas at first, would probably be too afraid to dig deeper for.

       You're on social media right now. You're effectively saying "Don't communicate with people publicly on the Internet."
      </p>
      <p>
       Gee, that kind of sounds like what the powers that be would like us to do, isn't it? If we all dropped out of social media and stopped exposing their lies constantly? It almost seems as if their goal IS to get us to leave social media.

       Well put. This is what I've been trying to say as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly we have to be somewhat smart about how we use social media, and I won't to pretend to know what that means; not for me, and certainly not for anyone else. But what I do know is that if we, meaning any person who wants to expose any facet of the corruption and conspiracy that exists in our institutions, if we silence ourselves due to the personal risk and lack of privacy, we've already lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether the Snowden revelations are true, and whether he's who he claims to be or not, one massive effect of those leaks was a chilling effect on free speech. Not taking it away, but like you said, causing us to censor ourselves, to silence ourselves. The Panopticon Effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       One effect of the Trump/Russia narrative, particularly the Russian social media influence campaign (regardless of how true it is), has acted as Part II of this operation. We're being conditioned not to trust viewpoints that go against the mainstream, whether from the left or the right. We're being conditioned to dismiss any argument that goes against our own as being disinformation. And the "right" is not immune from this either; certainly ShareBlue is real and active, yet it, too, acts as a distraction and a division.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to be able and willing to speak our truth freely, and we have to be willing to develop trust amongst actual people. If that's not on social media for you [not directed at you personally, AB], so be it. Talk to your friends and family and neighbors about these things. If we can be silenced and distrustful of anyone who doesn't think exactly like us, we will be such an easy population to finally quell and control completely.

       It really comes down to the philosophy of the truth. What is it? What do I actually believe in, given all the data? I can believe anything but I have to ignore
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       facts for anything to actually be concrete. The only thing I can believe in is that every experience is completely different from the next and that negative or positive leanings depend on so many factors from the spectrum of mental health to the environment that someone was raised in as a child to the natural rejection of acceptance of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the internet is a place where we can somewhat quantify our world, but what it really does is just show how diverse and fucked up it is overall and fundamental truths we believed in can no longer be sheltered from the diversity which often leads to doubling down or completely evaporating them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a constant triangle of society, environment, and economy, and they all pull and push at different moments. It is overwhelming to take into consideration the fluctuations of every branch of these three angles. I think this is a partial reason people have such a hard time with adjectives in SJW movements because it takes into consideration far more degrees of the social angle than we've previously been able to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with that said, I think human truth does have a limit to the factual observations a single person can make. And really the only plausible next step is one of a far greater mind that can see the mathematical ebbs and flows of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, I have no idea if this makes any sense, but it's just a ramble of how I feel about all of this. We're still in the very early stages, but without a doubt, the next step of the internet in such unpredictable times is to improve it's predictability models.

       The elites want an internet they can easily dismiss
      </p>
      <p>
       Journalists want the internet to be chaotic so they monopolize journalism and wont lose income to internet sources
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the internet is made of real, credible people, that means we are all news sources
      </p>
      <p>
       Your Facebook account is not anonymous, and that's why the elites fear it...
      </p>
      <p>
       So it makes sense for them to turn against Facebook now as people are becoming too woke and independent
      </p>
      <p>
       Same for Twitter to some extent
      </p>
      <p>
       So when Pgate blew up and Trump got elected, the elites needed to defensively smear the whole internet... "conspiracy theories! Fake non-MSM news! Anon trolls! Facebook is a traitor against the democracy ("Princess Hillary")..."
      </p>
      <p>
       If the internet loses social media and goes back to anonymous echo-chambers... Well, then none of us can claim to be real.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a retreat into mythical MSM-reality where nothing is real unless you read it in a government-sponsored textbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it would create a precedent for future advertisers to avoid non-liberal-tyranny forums. Consequently, the future of the internet would be that developers would focus on "harmless" platforms, where nothing ever gets challenged and a Toyota ad is never out of place. Look, for example, at the subreddit
       <a href="/r/stopadvertising">
        /r/stopadvertising
       </a>
       which aims to attack reddit's financial base by spying on subs Stasi-style. In order for social media to stay free and incorruptible, there needs to be special focus on preserving the subs that Stasi-types want to spy on.

       Fascinating perspective.  There is no inherent evil withon the confines of the software of facebook.  Even if the information is being aggreggated and used against us, this needs to be weighed against the potential for good, coordinated change.  The thing is, it does not seem to be happening.  But it may be a tool that can be activated on future notice.  As OP says, this is what they fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       They probably have enough information on these generations and need to tone it down to reduce their risk of it becoming a tool against them.

       Well, it's definitely not organic.
       <br/>
       Someone with power is pushing it for some reason and since so many MSM outlets are also pushing it, it's pretty safe to say the motive is malicious.
       <br/>
       Whatever though. Facebook needs to go, so I'm certainly not going to stand in the way on this one.

       I have the same impression. When obvious things get blown out of proportion it always looks like there is some manipulation behind it. Users data has been collected, users data has been used, now is time for Fb to go. Mission accomplished. Now let’s move to the next thing.

       It's because the MSM narrative cant be controlled with people on facebook. Facebook is a place where you can get a lot of information, whether true or false. Because of that, MSM and TPTB need to further control the narrative. If a war or genocide is happening, you can pretty much use FB as a way of telling the real story, so long as you have the credible information. At the same time, you could have 100 journalists writing that its not happening or they can spin the narrative to say its a good thing. But in the end, its up to the individual to come to their conclusions. Truth is going to be somewhere in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collectively now, the reddit hive-mind is anti-FB which is a good and bad thing. If FB is gone, there will be an alternative that might be more controlled. But it will be a way that MSM can gain their 'credibility' back.

       I don't mean to let my pessimism tear you down, but c'mon. Even if Facebook and Google do go down, which is the fucking long shot of all longshots, rotb will have other companies and platforms ready to step in and take-over. It'll be the same shit with a different name and different talking head puppets doing the public relations work. Otherwise those companies are too big to fail and the information they gathered is just too damn useful to tptb. Maybe Zuckerberg gets and slap on the wrist in terms of some fines but that dude is at most gonna retire to a tropical island with billions still in his bank account. IF he sees any time, and I personally think that is basically impossible, it'll be short lived, super-cush time in a luxery cell with big screen TV and internet and body gaurds to keep him safe from the other white collar criminals in separate cell blocks. Otherwise, Google and Facebook are probably in the " To big to fail" category and if their corporate worth plummets they'll probably get federal bail-out money.

       I think the only way out for us normies is to just simply start killing the rich. Put them back in their place. Numbers are all we will ever have against them.

       People need to learn from zombie movies like The Walking Dead. Eventually the numbers will overwhelm a party of people. We outnumber them 1000 to one. there’s really no reason to be afraid. Sure there would be bloodshed or violence but it would be very short-lived due to the sheer amount of people power. I really wish people would stop being retarded and see this. It is really just the flick of a switch or a change of perspective but it’s trying to change everybody’s world view and perspective at the SAME TIME to implement the change.

       I'm guessing this. Apathy and acceptance to the fact our lives are being monitored 24-7 and there's nothing most people can do about it. This has been going on a long time and is just now coming out after so many people have become addicted to social media that is almost a necessity to many people and their careers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised to see some more stories of terrorist or school shooters being thwarted due to their digital footprint or some kids that got kidnapped being rescued because of their digital footprint. I could definitely be wrong on that last one though, I can't quite figure out why there haven't been more stories like that already. They couldn't catch Nicolas Cruz so maybe all that data gathering isn't as useful for preventing crime as tptb would have us believe. Maybe it's just useful for drawing up profiles of people that would make good assets or patsy's. Maybe they don't really want to prevent all those crimes cause theres no money in it whereas if the crimes continue it keeps people dependent on the federal government and keeps the money flowing to domestic surveillance and security programs. Kinda goes hand in hand with the constant push for more gun control.

       Just another in a long line of fabricated distractions to give us something to discuss and argue over. Something to placate the unruly masses and the just-scratching-the-surface "conspiracy theorists." A helpful tip: if it's not about putting more money in your pocket and/or giving you more freedom to live life on your terms, then it's probably nothing but a manufactured distraction.

       Calling information control is probably valid,  but then any focus of attention is control,   from others,  or yourself.

       Its not decided that anyone in particular is going to capture attention over the long run.

       It's probably the case. People hear about it, get angry and call for action. Then the news stops making it a headline, congress lets the culprits off the hook and the system continues to fuck people over. BUT the people think the problem was solved so they don't care anymore.
