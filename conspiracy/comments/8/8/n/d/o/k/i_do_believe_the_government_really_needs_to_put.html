       Disarm the citizens so they can't do anything against their own economic disenfranchisement? Guns could ensure that citizens are able to demand the proper social accommodations to being forced out of work, among so many other things.

       The bargaining has already taken place and you weren't invited.

       You think the inevitable job-losses that increased automation will bring about wasn't considered? Having a gun won't get you your job back. Good luck waltzing into the bosses office with a gun and demanding your job back from GardenBot#5989.

       Well, I didn't downvote you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we are talking about mass automation and the elimination of work- do you expect people to starve? To become serfs? There must be some form of compensation if they are going to eliminate the means of providing for ourselves. People must be ready to demand their share of the automation pie. You can't expect millions to happily die in the streets.

       Why should an employee pay compensation because they chose a superior means of production at the sacrifice of number of employees?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example (Random numbers, don't look into it) if it normally requires 5 people to mow a large field with push-mowers and the employer buys a BIG ride-on lawnmower, requiring only 1 person to do the work of 5. Why should that employer compensate the 4 that lost their job?

       I'm talking on the Societal level. If we disenfranchise millions of people from work and a means of living, what do you expect them to do? You have broken the Social Contract, which means a new one must be drawn. These people won't accept starvation en masse.

       How will they find unemployment once almost every job is automated? Do you honestly think people should starve? Automation should provide plenty of fruits for everyone to enjoy- not just a few at the top. There's no reasons for people to die, like you advocate.

       Automation causes problems because we have a society built on people having jobs. If you replace people with robots, then they can't provide for themselves within the context of our society- which means we need to change our society.

       You're the one who thinks that automation and the current model of society can go hand in hand, and are justifying the starvation of millions. I don't think I'm the unrealistic one here lol.

       I don't believe in disarming citizens. But I do believe that we will more see people turning those weapons on one another rather than the government. We will always prey on the easier targets. If this country truly descends into chaos, no one will be safe from anything. It's not as simple as THE people vs the government. It's PEOPLE vs anyone that's is not their community. We already see it in how we treat each other on our media platforms and the so called divide. Now just give those very people guns or a reason to have a gun.

       Doesn't justify disarming at all. If the government of the capitalists want to fuck over the average citizen- guns mean the common people still have leverage at the bargaining table.

       Well like I said, I don't want any form of disarming. Not only would it not work, it also WON'T work. I'm just staying an additional risk in the equation. Fallouts don't spill in one direction. There are hundreds of scenarios of bad that would happen from disarming and not disarming. But prime #1 is like I said, it won't work and it isn't plausible.

       And to do harm is what I'm saying, and that's a greater risk. 
Eg:
You and I live out midwest with our respective families. I have a storehouse of food to feed my family but you, having just descended into abject poverty because of chaos reigning across the country, have no way to feed yourself and this hypothetical family that you are responsible for. I can't feasibly share any of this food with you, or I flat out reject to share it. You have an arsenal, I do not. No one is coming to assist you and some members of your family are on well on their way to the grave by the end of the week without food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having no other options, what would you do? You have no access to food, and the nearest markets are empty. But you have an arsenal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And please try to answer that honestly and not nobly.

       You didn't answer my question. If you don't want to then thats fine. I gave a hypothetical. In reality I would have that arsenal. And in reality I would shoot you the first time you eyed my storehouse. Or of feasible, band together with you, to take other people's storehouses. At that rate we'd be well on our way to create, dare I say, our own government?

       I answered your question. If you are armed, and I am armed- then there is no power differential. Then perhaps we could work together. But if my family is starving, and you have no way to defend what you have, what do you think is the natural human reaction? This is why we must all be armed.

       But if you were a white racist, and I was a Mexican, you'd come get me anyway right? Even with no power differential. Power differential isn't a key factor in preventing bloodshed. It can be a detterant sure, but hate is much stronger.

       Remember we are races but still at the end of the day (or the world) that we are all the human race. We are not only known for the worst but also the doing the best during the worst. It happens every day in big and small ways that are not on tv.

       If the shit were to hit the fan the only way forward is by working together. It's actually what we need to do more of now, and need to keep fighting to do.

       Being armed is a right. Being prepared is smart. Helping each other survive is our duty. Fighting evil in all forms should be a shared value.

       If I have guns or not "i" would still try to come take what you have.  "Evil" exists with or without guns.  If I didn't have a gun I would come with explosives, knifes, whatever... it would just change my approach.  You however are still not armed and will be powerless to stop anyone.

       I disagree, it's just another form of economic viability. Religion can exist just as much along side as it has with capitalism for centuries. Government implemented socialism on the other hand is different. For the government to control the masses, religion must be wiped out.

       Millions of jobs HAVE disappeared, due to automation, the labor base relocating outside of the West, use of slave (prison) labor, and use of legal unpersons with no rights for labor.  It's not a hypothetical future, it's current and past events.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fantasy that every single job can be automated and that there is no more need for proles is a neoliberal fantasy.  Automation is not easy and not always profitable.  The more likely outcome is that Porky will drastically reduce the cost of human labor by the means I've mentioned above, most likely in the West by re-introducing large-scale slavery (it already exists in the American gulag, better known as the criminal "justice" system).  Even with slavery though, there will still be wageslaves, and there is immense pressure to push down stuff like programming or the trades to the level of Wal-Mart jobs.

       As someone who actually thinks about these systems, who knows people who actually work on automation; it isn't easy, and it isn't just a matter of writing a program to do shit but engineering a body, and finding the materials and energy to run robotic laborers.  The way automation is more likely to kill jobs is by streamlining production processes, rather than some lazy fantasy that robots are going to do everything just the way it's been done before and no one has to think about anything.  That fantasy comes from people who don't actually work or engineer anything, they just sit on the top, reap profits and manage people.
