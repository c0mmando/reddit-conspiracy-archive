<p>But if we are talking about mass automation and the elimination of work- do you expect people to starve? To become serfs? There must be some form of compensation if they are going to eliminate the means of providing for ourselves. People must be ready to demand their share of the automation pie.

<p>Automation causes problems because we have a society built on people having jobs. If you replace people with robots, then they can&#39;t provide for themselves within the context of our society- which means we need to change our society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for admitting that.</p>

<p>Remember we are races but still at the end of the day (or the world) that we are all the human race. We are not only known for the worst but also the doing the best during the worst. It happens every day in big and small ways that are not on tv.</p>

<p>If the shit were to hit the fan the only way forward is by working together. It&#39;s actually what we need to do more of now, and need to keep fighting to do. </p>

<p>Being armed is a right. Being prepared is smart. Helping each other survive is our duty. Fighting evil in all forms should be a shared value.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>If I have guns or not &quot;i&quot; would still try to come take what you have.  &quot;Evil&quot; exists with or without guns.  If I didn&#39;t have a gun I would come with explosives, knifes, whatever... it would just change my approach.  You however are still not armed and will be powerless to stop anyone.  </p>

<p>Flip the scenario now.  You come for my food.  My weapons may not guarantee I will be successful... but it gives me a better chance.... and even if I fall I will content knowing I died fighting on not on my knees begging.  </p>

Government implemented socialism on the other hand is different. For the government to control the masses, religion must be wiped out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Millions of jobs HAVE disappeared, due to automation, the labor base relocating outside of the West, use of slave (prison) labor, and use of legal unpersons with no rights for labor.  It&#39;s not a hypothetical future, it&#39;s current and past events.</p>

<p>The fantasy that every single job can be automated and that there is no more need for proles is a neoliberal fantasy.  Automation is not easy and not always profitable.  The more likely outcome is that Porky will drastically reduce the cost of human labor by the means I&#39;ve mentioned above, most likely in the West by re-introducing large-scale slavery (it already exists in the American gulag, better known as the criminal &quot;justice&quot; system).  Even with slavery though, there will still be wageslaves, and there is immense pressure to push down stuff like programming or the trades to the level of Wal-Mart jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As someone who actually thinks about these systems, who knows people who actually work on automation; it isn&#39;t easy, and it isn&#39;t just a matter of writing a program to do shit but engineering a body, and finding the materials and energy to run robotic laborers.  The way automation is more likely to kill jobs is by streamlining production processes, rather than some lazy fantasy that robots are going to do everything just the way it&#39;s been done before and no one has to think about anything.  That fantasy comes from people who don&#39;t actually work or engineer anything, they just sit on the top, reap profits and manage people.</p>
