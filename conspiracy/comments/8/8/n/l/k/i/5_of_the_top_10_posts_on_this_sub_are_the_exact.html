    <div class="md"><p>You really shouldn&#39;t generalize. I consider &quot;Liberals&quot; to be a term for centrist fools, but just because someone holds Left beliefs doesn&#39;t mean they have a mental disorder, just like someone who holds Right wing beliefs isn&#39;t mentally disabled. We&#39;re all people- our True enemy are the Neolib/Neocon Corporatists who get everyone to buy into the L/R debate. Newsflash- there can&#39;t even be a real L/R debate until the ruling apparatus of the Republic is restored to the people.</p>

<p>All that said- I agree, the news coordination is absolute bullshit. I assume you&#39;re referring to the news affiliates all reading the same script? There&#39;s a reason I call the news Corporate Propaganda.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all in this together, against the Elites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Highly simplistic to say &quot;the left&quot; that have ruined the meaning of &quot;liberal&quot;. Like much political terminology e.g. liberal, democracy, freedom, left / right, there are complex histories behind their (ab)use today. They don&#39;t get born in purity and then get pulled away by evil henchmen; they are in dynamic relations with other terms and with changing social and economic circumstances.</p>

<p>But if one takes the time to do their homework, it makes the song that much more rewarding. Honestly- almost everything Ochs references should be common knowledge to school kids. The fact that it isn&#39;t should speak volumes.</p>

<p>The media started the fake news term and Trump and his supporters flip it on them. This is the mainstream news pushing their fake news talking point again. Therefor the talking point is the opposite of Trump and his supporters. So do you consider Trump supporters as a group that does not contain conservatives? </p>
