        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tomorrow is Easter Sunday and also coincidentally April Fools.</p>

<p>Tomorrow it also is the day &quot;they&quot; predict the Chinese Tiangong-1 space station is crashing to earth losing altitude right now at this very moment.</p>

<p>You can track it live : <a href="http://www.heavens-above.com/GroundTrack.aspx">HERE</a></p>

<p>&quot;The time for Tiangong-1&#39;s uncontrolled descent remains highly uncertain, in large part due to how quiet the sun has been.&quot; - Space.com</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; also predict as it falls into the atmosphere it could possible reign down fireballs.</p>

<p>Now,</p>

<p>we jump to Ed Dames who is described here on his site as:</p>

<p><em>&quot;The world&#39;s foremost remote viewing teacher, and creator of Technical Remote Viewing, Major Edward A. Dames, United States Army (ret.), is a thrice decorated military intelligence officer and an original member of the U.S. Army prototype remote viewing training program. He served as both training and operations officer for the U.S. government&#39;s TOP SECRET psychic espionage unit.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Him and a team of remote viewers have been predicting what they call &quot;The Kill Shot&quot; that will come sometime in the future.</p>

<p>The kill shot is defined by them as:</p>

<p><em>&quot;the event is in fact a series of solar flares that are so devastating to the Earth, it may cause the death of billions and change life on Earth as we know it.&quot;</em></p>

<p>So right before they predict the &quot;Kill Shot&quot; is to happen there will first be a precursor event they describe as below:</p>

<p><em>&quot;What would be that final, recognizable event just prior to the Killshot Sequence? The best that we could come up with, pushing ahead, the best that we could come up with was… what appeared to be a space shuttle being forced down by what appears to be a meteor shower.</em></p>

<p>*For those of you who are not remote-viewers let me give you a little bit of insight into what remote-viewing is in terms of the skill. Most of the information that we derive from the target is in terms of word/idea concepts – patterns of information that we perceive [then] search our memory for words, and apply those words… and move on.
The information we had that led us to believe that we were dealing with a space shuttle, as a final precursor event to the… a space shuttle coming down, as a final precursor event to the Killshot was a collection of those rough sketches. So analytically we’re saying it looks like a space shuttle coming down… &quot;
*
They say the Precursor event is what seems like a space shuttle falling to earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/31/03fef570-f0ab-4816-9da7-3df1b2f163bb/resize/620x/46980f02d09b03fcc974045fb6b02a10/tiangong-ap-18088394762534.jpg">This is what China&#39;s falling space station looks like from earth</a></p>

<p>Seems to look a little bit like a space shuttle No? I am no remote viewer but I would imagine if i was remote viewing and seeing something like this maybe I could come to the conclusion it was a space shuttle instead of a space station.</p>

<p>Now,
The Blue Star Kachina is said to be the ninth and final sign before the &quot;Day of Purification&quot;, described as a catastrophe or a &quot;world engulfing cataclysm&quot; that will lead to the purification of planet Earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Star_Kachina">This is a HOPI Indian prophecy/legend</a> written by Frank Waters. There are 9 signs leading up to the event. The 9th and final sign goes as so:</p>

<p>*&quot;The ninth and final sign of destruction is described by White Feather as, &quot;You will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease.&quot;
Blue Star Kachina
*</p>

<p>Now,</p>

<p>There is a lady who is a Quantum Healer using Hypnosis who has several clients and in a video she describes many of them having the same kind of thoughts on a &quot;Coming Event&quot; most of them say will happen very soon &quot;Around the end of March&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvR7LmGSkU0">THE VIDEO HERE</a>of her describing this has gone somewhat viral. Her clients mostly see a huge light/energy wall bombarding the earth and changing everyone/everything. The event will leave people changed and with certain &quot;Gifts&quot;. </p>

<ul>
<li>On top of all this we have been following events worldwide that include but are not limited to:</li>
<li>Huge Cracks in the Earth being found worldwide</li>
<li>Loud BOOMS shaking houses around the country and worldwide</li>
<li>Strange Eerie Lights in the skies</li>
<li>Weird sightings of unexplained Phenomenon </li>
<li>Strange animal activity and Mass animal deaths</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these and others can be seen documented: <a href="https://youtu.be/TVC5RZWBVS0">Here on this video and on this channel</a></p>

<p>So as you can see a lot of weird, strange, and odd converging of events.</p>

<p>What does it mean?</p>

<p>Who knows.</p>

<p>Edit--
Also to Add I watch the <a href="http://gcpdot.com/">GCP DOT</a> from time to time. It really means nothing but it looks unusually high at the moment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome post. This is old school conspiracy stuff. You build an intriguing story based on your collected information and point it towards an impending cataclysm. The part about people being left with certain gifts after the earth is bathed in light is also interesting. Anyway, just like any other day, who knows what the future may bring? Thanks for posting. </p>

<p>OP also used the word cataclysm, but an all destroying solar storm would be better described as ekpyrosis. Ancient Greeks and other cultures believed in periodic huge floods and fires.</p>

<p>Kataklysmós is ancient greek for inundation, the destruction of the earth by water. Ekpyrōsis is greek for conflagration, the destruction of the earth by fire.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekpyrosis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekpyrosis</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ekpyrosis (/ˌɛkpɪˈroʊsɪs/; Ancient Greek: ἐκπύρωσις ekpyrōsis, &quot;conflagration&quot;) is a Stoic belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by a great conflagration every Great Year. The cosmos is then recreated (palingenesis) only to be destroyed again at the end of the new cycle. This form of catastrophe is the opposite of kataklysmos (κατακλυσμός, &quot;inundation&quot;), the destruction of the earth by water.[1]</p>

<p>The concept of ekpyrosis is attributed to Chrysippus by Plutarch.</p>

<p>Here are the skills:</p>

<p>a) your mind has been mapped by the CIA</p>

<p>b) you want to go on an ego trip</p>

<p>c) you repeat the information the CIA feeds you (using their brain mapping and satellite technology) onto the internet in order to feel important</p>

<p>The CIA gets feedback on their mapping technology and can also influence groups in an untraceable way.</p>

<p>No, they don&#39;t. You can literally be put in a mental hospital for these views. With good reason, mind you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should the BBC staff be put in the mental wards? From a BBC documentary:</p>

<p>The LIDA machine was made in the 1950&#39;s by the Soviets. The CIA purchased one through a Canadian front for Dr. Ross Adey, but didn&#39;t give him any funds to evaluate it.</p>

<p>I provided those funds from my project in 1981, and he determined that the LIDA would put rabbits into a stupor at a distance and make cats go into REM.</p>

<p>The Soviets included a picture with the device that showed an entire auditorium full of people asleep with the LIDA on the podium. The LIDA put out an electric field, a magnetic field, light, heat, and sound (of course light and heat are electromagnetic waves, but at a much higher frequency than the low frequencies of the electric and magnetic fields mentioned above).</p>

<p>The purported purpose of the LIDA was for medical treatments; however, the North Koreans used it as a brain washing device during the Korean War. The big question is: what did they do with the technology? It could have been improved and/or made smaller. It is unlikely that they abandoned something that worked.</p>

<p>Direct communication with Ross Adey: While he was testing the LIDA 4, an electrician was walking by and asked him where he got the &quot;North Korean brain washing machine.&quot; Ross told him that is was a Russian medical device.</p>

<p>The guy said he had been brain-washed by a device like that when he was in a POW camp. They placed the vertical plates alongside his head and read questions and answers to him. He said he felt like he was in a dream. Later when the Red Cross came and asked questions, he responded with what had been read to him while under the influence of the device. He said he seemed to have no control over the answers.</p>

<p>The LIDA is PATENTED IN THE US. Why? They are not sold in the US – the only one I know that exists is the one that was at Loma Linda Medical Center where Adey used to work. </p>

<li>This is the First Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>We are told of the coming of the white-skinned men, like Pahana, but not living like Pahana men who 7 took the land that was not theirs. And men who struck their enemies with thunder.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Second Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>Our lands will see the coming of spinning wheels filled with voices. In his youth, my father saw this prophecy come true with his eyes — the white men bringing their families in wagons across the prairies.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Third Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>A strange beast like a buffalo but with great long horns, will overrun the land in large numbers. These White Feather saw with his eyes — the coming of the white men’s cattle.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Fourth Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>The land will be crossed by snakes of iron.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Fifth Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>The land shall be criss-crossed by a giant spider’s web.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Sixth sign</li>
</ol>

<p>The land shall be criss-crossed with rivers of stone that make pictures in the sun.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Seventh Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>You will hear of the sea turning black, and many living things dying because of it. (Oil-spils)</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Eight Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>You will see many youth, who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom.</p>

<ol>
<li>And this is the Ninth and Last Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>You will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the point is those are symbolic, not literal.  Since we can now attach symbol to literal (iron snakes = rail), and we assume we&#39;ve attached/seen up to at least the 7th sign, interested parties are looking for 8 (unless passed) and 9 (certainly has not passed).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps there are a number of people who interpret US Space Station Skylab having fallen to Earth in 1979 as the ninth sign. According to &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; it appeared to be burning blue, much like the prophecy&#39;s Blue Star. I wasn&#39;t there so I can&#39;t say much, but it&#39;s interesting to think on.</p>

<p>IMO the hippie movement of the 60s much more closely relates to the eighth sign than any recent events (pipelines et al.)</p>

I don’t get it at all.

    <div class="md"><p>I actually really enjoy it. For one it’s free, but it’s also 100 pvp definitely the most ppl on a multiplayer map at once. It’s got a good element of skill mixed with luck. You fall out of a plane land on the island and scavenge for resources and weapons. The maps great, and gameplay more arcadey than most pvp shooters which is a more playful element that many FPS are missing. And you don’t have to be really good to enjoy it because basically you can make you goal just staying alive as long as you can, and the games progress quickly so you never know you might get lucky and win. Not to mention the building element which is huge and very impressive to watch these building wars as players face off shooting guns at each other meanwhile building awesome structures insanely fast for defense and advantage. Battle royal games in general are quite addicting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m familiar with the mechanics, I’ve played a few Battle Royals type games, H1Z1 a while back and I play PUBG pretty regularly, both 100 ppl matches.
I think that’s part of the reason I didn’t really car for it, it’s just another take on an existing platform.</p>

<p>And while credit is due for it adding some extra mechanics, I personally feel like it’s <em>too</em> much, the game just give off a vibe like “this is a kids game” to me, my nephew loves it though lol.</p>

<p>Just me though, but like I said I think the construction/deconstruction aspect is s cool idea, and it certainly adds a new depth to gameplay, I just don’t love it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve followed the GCP, just the idea that there is a raised awareness level around certain events, like 9/11. </p>

<p>They have tracked it since the 50s or 60s, and one thing extremely interesting to note is that the range of the signal is supposedly 5 to 60 Hz, but for a rather long time they routinely did not measure &quot;spikes&quot; because their instrumentation only could adequately handle up to 35 Hz (I think).  And so what they did for a long time was literally throw out data that contained any spikes, and then concluded that it had a much smaller range than it actually has.  </p>

<p>FWIW I actually found out about it because I was trying to find what the noise in my ears was, and it&#39;s no tinnitus. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s something like this: the Earth&#39;s ionosphere starts about 80kms from earth. It&#39;s comprised of charged particles (ions) and is known to reflect radio waves (the ionosphere is a crucial component to radio communication on earth). The difference in electric potential between the ionosphere and Earth creates an effective capacitor between the two, and since the ionosphere is pretty uniform around Earth the potential difference is evenly distributed along the distance between the Earth and the ionosphere, and comes to about 200 volts per metrer. This, in turn, means that the resonant frequency of earth, out at least the ionosphere cavity (the part in which we humans live) is about 7.5 cycles per second (Hertz).<br/>
The human body has an electronic signal too. The sound of our heartbeat racing down the aorta, from the heart, and echoing back on itself once it hits the bifurcation in the lower abdomen creates an interference pattern. When one holds their breath, relaxes, or enters a meditative state they can &quot;fine tune&quot; this signal to a natural resonant frequency within the body. The signals, moving in synchrony with one another, travel up and down the body at the speed of sound (within the body) at around 7.5Hz. And of course, since we have charged particles within our bodies, we produce an electronic signal due to all this movement, which is transmitted into our environment.<br/>
Since the ionosphere cavity and our bodies both resonate at around 7.5Hz, this suggests a tuned resonant system between the two, and oscillators within a resonant system can transfer energy to one another. In deep meditation the human and the ionosphere can transfer energy between each other, and this occurs at a wavelength of around 40,000km (about the perimeter of the planet), which travels around the world at about one seventh of a second through the electrostatic field. The more tuned oscillators there are within a tuned resonant system, the stronger the signal, and the more efficient the energy transfer. Also, the more tuned oscillators there are within a tuned resonant system, oscillators vibrating out of phase can more easily get locked into phase through a phenomena called rhythm entrainment. So therefore, when multiple people are mediating, they are transferring energy between each other and the ionosphere, and when more meditators join in its easier for them to then fall into sync with everyone else and easier to transfer energy.<br/>
The Schumann resonance is the measuring of the fluctuations in the ionospheric signal, which is linked to fluctuations in mass consciousness, since fluctuations in the Schumann resonance can be measured when multiple people meditate in synchrony around the planet. The theory is that when there are irregular fluctuations in the ionospheric signal, there are mass shifts in conscious awareness occurring. A notable example would be the massive fluctuations that occurred on 9/11, which coincided with a mass shift in public consciousness. It can&#39;t exactly tell us <em>what</em> is happening, but it can tell us at least that <em>something is.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, friend! I&#39;ve been learning about it myself recently. Been on a bit of a personal quest down the rabbit hole of consciousness for the last couple years, but only recently had I thankfully come across the specific information to make the Schumann resonance theory &quot;click&quot;, instead of it just being that thing where I think &quot;oh yeah it&#39;s some global consciousness thing...&quot;  </p>

<p>The ninth and final sign of destruction</p>

<p>so what about the other 8 signs? have we seen evidence they have already been fulfilled too?</p>

<li>This is the First Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>We are told of the coming of the white-skinned men, like Pahana, but not living like Pahana men who 7 took the land that was not theirs. And men who struck their enemies with thunder.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Second Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>Our lands will see the coming of spinning wheels filled with voices. In his youth, my father saw this prophecy come true with his eyes — the white men bringing their families in wagons across the prairies.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Third Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>A strange beast like a buffalo but with great long horns, will overrun the land in large numbers. These White Feather saw with his eyes — the coming of the white men’s cattle.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Fourth Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>The land will be crossed by snakes of iron.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Fifth Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>The land shall be criss-crossed by a giant spider’s web.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Sixth sign</li>
</ol>

<p>The land shall be criss-crossed with rivers of stone that make pictures in the sun.</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Seventh Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>You will hear of the sea turning black, and many living things dying because of it. (Oil-spils)</p>

<ol>
<li>This is the Eight Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>You will see many youth, who wear their hair long like my people, come and join the tribal nations, to learn their ways and wisdom.</p>

<ol>
<li>And this is the Ninth and Last Sign</li>
</ol>

<p>You will hear of a dwelling-place in the heavens, above the earth, that shall fall with a great crash. It will appear as a blue star. Very soon after this, the ceremonies of my people will cease.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know if telegraph lines ever got dense enough to be considered a &quot;web&quot; ... but phone lines maybe could be, and those predated paved road.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is the first I&#39;ve heard of this prophecy, so it&#39;s all fun and new to me.</p>

<p>Fire And Ice - Poem by Robert Frost
Autoplay next video</p>

<p>Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I&#39;ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very interesting this post, I like to read and almost belive these stories, but the Hopi part, may be like the revelation on the bible, they are talking about the americans destroying their way of life, many americans flags have blue and a star on them. &quot;Its not a blue star&quot; you might say, but nither is Tiangong-1&#39;s flag, or any marking, it will fall as a red burning star.
But I dreamed of a map, upside down, and it was burning, it could mean that our entire world is corrupt and will burn, or that I just stopped playing league of legends (that was the map). Either way, we soon shall see.</p>

<p>Just a random thought and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to an increase in solar activity or similar factors.</p>

<p>I feel like a fricking walking conductor sometimes. Elevator buttons (started covering my thumb at a hotel stay because I started to become apprehensive to touching the damn thing bare skinned after two zaps), the metal frame besides the door leading to my porch, a hook that suspends floor mats at my local gym, zapped twice by it and it was stronger than the elevator call button too.</p>

<p>My final moment in this world will be the result of alot of electricty, I just know it. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Tomorrow is Easter Sunday and also coincidentally April Fools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hey this is a great post and I&#39;mma let you finish, but Beyonce&#39;s.. wait.. no.. but <em>there are no coincidences in this reality.</em></p>

<p>Did you know 4/1 used to be the New Year?  <em>In 1564, Pope Gregory XIII introduced a new calendar, designating January 1 as the start of the new year.</em>  According to the legend, it was this change that started the whole &quot;April Fools&quot; tradition.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a bit of the puzzle I don&#39;t know what to do with:</p>

<ul>
<li>4118 days between 9/11 and Dec. 21, 2012 (the end of the world!)</li>
<li>4118 days after Dec. 21, 2012 is April 1st, 2024.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, in numbers, 09/11/01+4118d= 12/21/12+4118d= 04/01/2024.  What&#39;s it mean?  <em>No idea</em>.</p>
