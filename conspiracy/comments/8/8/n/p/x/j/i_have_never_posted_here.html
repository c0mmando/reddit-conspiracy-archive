       But I shared on Facebook the video of the Sinclair script that's going around right now.  Now, I'm not a popular man in terms of friends, but if I post pics or videos of my daughter, likes comments and views follow.  If I post about dinner I made, likes and comments.  If I post about sports (cause I do), likes and comments.  Always.  If I post, I always refresh my feed to see where it is.  It's usually 3rd or 4th on my news feed.  I posted the video, along with a little commentary 4 hours ago.  No views, no likes, no sign of it anywhere save for my own page (like if I look at my own profile).  Seems odd to me, maybe nothing, but I thought I would share.  My wife thinks I'm crazy.

       You're right to be asking questions. Seeing as it was censored from
       <a href="/r/videos">
        /r/videos
       </a>
       , I wouldn't be surprised if Sinclair reached out to facebook to shadowban anyone reposting the video to limit the spread. They all work together..

       Things like this video make people think, when people think, they ask questions. When people ask questions they seek the truth. When people seek the truth the left/right paradigm loses its stranglehold. When the paradigm fails people realize that were all in this together and we have a common enemy that wants to keep us oppressed.

       Facebook is a silly giant echo chamber where actual conversation and opposing opinion is not encouraged.
Use it to keep tabs on family, if you NEED to keep it. But I say delete your account and never look back.

       Usually the only reason I use it, but when something like this happens, at very least I have to try and say something.  I feel like the post was, I guess, "shadowbanned" or whatever FB calls it.  Just struck me as very odd considering how anything else I post is handled.

       Social networking is severely altering human cognition across the board, especially for younger generations and children who are raised on it. It's robbing us of our life skills. When everything is considered, it's a weapon against us.

       You know, I really try to be patient and understanding with people, but at this point I just really must ask... are you like 12 years old or just totally socially retarded? I see these kind of comments from you all the time, and it's not constructive at all. Actually, it's quite annoying.

       This is what my spouse and I did. We took the Richard Stallman approach and forbid our kids from using anything that's not free and open source software (FOSS). My spouse and I are by no means coders or developers but in this age of community documentation, you'd be surprised how easy it is to flash an open source ROM on an unlocked android phone. My oldest son and I spent a really frustrating but fun Saturday getting his phone to work.....and that's the deal in our household: want the 'toys' your classmates have? Then you need to research the FOSS options available to you and come to Dad with a recommendation....it teaches them how to build their electronics ecosystem instead of buying an app for it. The whole house does it and its more fun that way.....the reality is, 'keeping up with the Jones' is a real phenomenon with school-aged children and as parents its exhausting always explaining why they can't have what ALL of their friends have at school, so we've channeled those desires into a FOSS/hobbyist mindset where they must build it and it must be free and open source. Plus the Foss stuff works well on second hand laptops or smart phones (ex:lineage 15.1 which just cane out is essentially Android Oreo and works on a junker Samsung Note 2 we tried)....we even repurposed his kano computer (raspberry Pi) into a Firetv-like box for the family room where we watch shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, TLDR just look for FOSS versions of corporate software to get off the product mentality. Its a fun adventure for the whole family!

       Not sure what fortnite is but we've been pretty chill about video games...only in the sense that they had an Xbox before we thought to do this. I suppose I'll have to cross that bridge once they want a new system; although at this point I think they'd know what the answer is so maybe they just haven't asked yet for that reason lol.

       No, no worries. Haha you've incited a pretty hilarious family conversation over here. I asked my son what kind of Xbox he has (he says Xbox one - a couple years old now but before the FOSS stuff we've been doing). I asked if there's a new console he'd ever wanted. According to him the Xbox one is still new-ish but he says "we weren't sure we'd ask anyway because we thought you forgot about the Xbox." Haha so apparently they thought I'd have confiscated it too so they all decided not to risk asking for a new one thinking the request would prompt me to re-evaluate the one they already have in light of our new FOSS arrangement.

       Hasn't Facebook begun to implement some system that checks news reported on Facebook? In order to stop the spread of "false information" they now have an automated system and also actual people devoted to going over posts that people put on Facebook and either taking them down or approving them?

       Dude, my account is 4 years old.  I'm sorry that because something has come to light, people start asking questions.  I'll also note, my post had nothing to do with Sinclair, or speaking negatively about them.  It was a post about possible Facebook censorship.

       Because of how ironic it all is. When the far right accuses everyone of "fake news wahwahwah", but they are actively producing THE fake news with poorly scripted propaganda.

       No worries. That video has been all over Reddit the past 24 hours. Repeatedly. No one is trying to censor this video. Social media is about censoring, but not this message.
      </p>

       Its not just Sinclair that does this. ALL media is biased and pushing an agenda. It's good that you've woke to this, you need to dig further though. This video in particular, is being shilled by some unknown organization for some unknown reason. And hard. EVERYTHING we hear about is because somebody wanted us to hear about it. You can tell when its the same story with the same words, such as in the video you posted. This particular video is no different. I've no idea who's behind the push or what their motives are. But I don't believe the activity we've seen on this sub and the ridiculous amount of times I've seen this video posted the past 24 hours is organic. Not saying your not. And again, I'm glad you've become aware that portions of the media are biased. I hope you're aware that they are all biased and are all always spinning and pushing their agenda.

       In any case you know what else I think is a bit fishy, all of the Facebook hate. So good old George Soros comes out at Davos and says the social media is a menace to society. Then a few months later everyone is on that band wagon. Fishy, fishy, fishy. Not saying that I think social media or Facebook in particular are good for any of us. Quite the contrary. I just find it suspect how quickly the media turned on good old Zuckerburg. Anyways, that's my 2 cents on the subject. Welcome to the sub, enjoy your Sunday!
