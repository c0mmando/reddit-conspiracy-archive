<p>Disney also has a RDFI wristband at some parks. 15 years ago disney had a kiosk that took your picture and emailed it to you. Back then I knew that it was to get your info and close up of your face.</p>

<p>I love Disney Land but this will be the future everywhere if we don&#39;t stop it.</p>

Before they did this it was a very common occurance.  People still try to do this only to get to the gate &amp; told they not only cant use the ticket but just lost whatever money they paid to the person that sold it to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrist rfid chips with a barcode linked back to your photo or credit card info is one thing but giving up your fingerprints to a company like Disney is a scary thought. If you could assure me that they only use the fingerprints in the data base Solely for this one reason, then yeah cool. But I guarantee it for other reasons. Another pro for the fingerprints is that they could run them in the criminal data base so make sure no pedo or sick cunts would be allowed into the parks with children. It’s just the cons and them being Disney that give me the heebeegeebees</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From their privacy policy page (for what it&#39;s worth):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We offer the convenience of Ticket Tag at the entrance of many of our theme parks and water parks. Ticket Tag helps to facilitate ease of re-entry into our parks and helps prevent fraud.</p>

<p>In order to use Ticket Tag, you simply place your finger on a reader. The system, which utilizes the technology of biometrics, takes an image of your finger, converts the image into a unique numerical value and immediately discards the image. The numerical value is recalled when you use Ticket Tag with the same ticket to re-enter or visit another Park. Ticket Tag does not store fingerprints.</p>

<p>Also, from my experience, you pick which finger to scan at entry. You can pick any of your digits to scan. How will they know what finger it is or do anything with one print?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean kinda, unless you&#39;re stuck at the dead end of the triangle grinding away hours of your life for minimum wage and no other way out and you&#39;re stuck. It&#39;s all perspective and everyone is living this reality differently. </p>

<p>I am happy people can flourish and prosper with this system we have but a lot of people really get stuck and get overwhelmed. Not to mention how shit it is in countries that are extremely poor. </p>

<p>Now my gripe is the technology that is kept from all of us. </p>

<p>There is so much hidden and secret technologies that have been kept from us due to greed and it really pisses me off.</p>

<p>Instead of liberating the human race from the grueling tedious rat race we are perpetuating, it&#39;s kept from us to milk more money out of us even further while they tinker around and have fun with all of this advanced technology. Some of it literally reverse engineered from ET space craft.</p>

<p>Some things slowly leak out to the public through corporations but the real big game changers are kept locked in bunkers and stifled behind patent suppression (over 5,000+ suppressed patents exist)</p>

<p>Different energy systems. Advanced propulsion systems that would completely alter the way we transport and our reliance on fossils fuels, which props up the petrodollar.</p>

<p>New ways of living and new materials and ideas. Even new mathematics and physics that would revolutionize the energy sector and far more. Imagine how much more creative as a species we could be with these kind of things being released. It would help us evolve and move forward as one United species. The human race. As we are all one, more connected than we think. </p>

<p>But instead it&#39;s kept from us. Instead we are modern day slaves, propping up an outdated system that no longer serves us and instead entrenches us and keeps us controlled. Instead we are force fed negative bs and told we are separate from each other and to hate and compete and judge and be better than and get more than others, blah blah blah fucking blah. Told to buy stupid shit to feel good and just buy more material bullshit to fill that gaping hole you feel in your stomach that is the spiritual devoid as you are totally disconnected from true oneness and immersed in a false illusory matrix reality.</p>

<p>Can you see what I&#39;m getting at? Can you see why I&#39;m so pissed off about suppressed technology? Excuse my rant and word wall but holy god fucking bless there is a lot that we truly do not know about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that creepy considering it&#39;s their park and anyone going is doing so of their own free will.</p>

<p>My guess is that the tracking is Disney&#39;s way of trying to manage density at their parks.  Right now there are more hotel rooms on property at Disneyworld than the entire Orlando area had when the Magic Kingdom opened.  If you add in all the off-property hotel expansion, even with the expanded number of parks (Epcot, etc), it&#39;s way more visitor density than I suspect they were originally designed for.</p>

<p>Disney grows profits by packing more people into the parks, which means they have to figure out how to manage the crowds and try to create an experience that isn&#39;t just standing in long lines for everything.  I suspect they&#39;re really aiming for dynamic crowd management if they aren&#39;t already there?  Too many people in one spot?  Bring out a parade or band or something close by to draw parts of the crowd away.  FastPass is just a way to get people to make ride reservations.</p>

<p>The corporate sponsorships seem entirely predictable.  I think Epcot was one of the first big ones, mostly because it was an expensive park and by then it wasn&#39;t about Walt&#39;s futuristic (if neofascist) vision, but a business.   At this point it only makes sense -- Disney can sell sponsorship and corporate brands get to be front and center to millions of consumers, many of whom are on the more affluent end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>I have a lot of good Disney experiences, but after our last family trip there I&#39;m pretty convinced the park model has been broken by pushing visitor density too far.  The rides are designed for much smaller crowds and you can&#39;t get enough FastPasses to make up for the long lines.  They need to consider having fewer theme-park style &quot;rides&quot; and start making attractions with continuous, long-term slow movement, where &quot;the line&quot; is part of &quot;the ride&quot;.  Sort of like seeing a movie, but while in continuous movement.</p>

<p>The problem is they also trade on nostalgia.  You can&#39;t significantly overhaul many aspects of these parks without destroying the nostalgia, and expanding the parks with large new attractions is extremely expensive.  They do some expansion, but based on my last trip there 3 years ago I think they&#39;re mostly in a &quot;more density&quot; mode.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have also filed a patent to track your visit via footprint. </p>

<p><a href="https://consumerist.com/2016/08/02/disney-nabs-patent-for-foot-tracking-technology-it-could-someday-use-in-its-parks/">The method also includes generating a first foot model using the first foot shape and the first foot appearance and tagging the first foot model with the guest data,” the patent explains. “The foot model can be used to identify a particular guest and the guest data can be used to output a customized guest experience to the guest.”
So, perhaps Disney notices that you keep having to run to the bathroom and suggests a nearby vendor selling electrolyte-filled drinks.
Disney seems to think this is less creepy than other methods: right now, technology that tracks guests and matches them up with some identifying characteristic “are limited to rather invasive methods, such as retinal and fingerprint identification methods,” the patent reads. “These methods are obtrusive and some guests may not feel comfortable providing this type of biometric information to a third party.”</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Visited Disney a few months ago and wore the Disney RFID bracelets.  I liked the convenience of the tickets and room key and credit card info stored.  We were on It’s a Small World and when our boat came up to a certain part of the ride, a sign said Goodbye (our names).  Could not figure out how our names appeared at that moment on that ride until I thought of the bracelets.  Confirmed online that the bracelets are indeed tracking your every move throughout the park in addition to facial recognition.  Not sure why this level of tracking is needed in Disney but it did freak me out.  I don’t mind the credit card info being stored and even my fingerprint because they do tell you ahead of time and their reason for requiring the fingerprint is logical imo, but tracking you on rides and throughout the park is a bit much.  That’s a lot of data to collect...where is it all going and for what reason?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is totally logical. It probably saves them millions a year in abused passes and people sneaking in. I really don&#39;t get how it is disgusting. What are they going to do with the information? Honestly? How many other things know what your finger print is? Who would want to buy your finger print? It doesn&#39;t unlock anything special. </p>

<p>Although someone already pointed out the prints are not saved, they are instantly deleted, let&#39;s pretend they are actually saved, because this is a Conspiracy subreddit, and someone will say it. The police could get prints from a crime scene, and run it through their database, let&#39;s say nothing comes up. Then Police can run it through Disney&#39;s database and get a possible match. </p>

<p>They take your fingerprints and take your picture as a way to identify you in the event that you/your child goes missing, then they have a readily available image of you from that day. Or on the worse side of things, to be able to identify someone who wants to shoot up a place that sees thousands of people each day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disney Dollars were introduced in 1987 and discontinued in 2016. They were an alternative to what would amount to a gift card, except worse since they couldn&#39;t be tracked if it was lost and could be easily damaged. 
Most that are still around are in the hands of collectors but they are still accepted at Disney parks as most items that were used for admission or had monitory vaule, regardless of age, is still accepted. </p>
