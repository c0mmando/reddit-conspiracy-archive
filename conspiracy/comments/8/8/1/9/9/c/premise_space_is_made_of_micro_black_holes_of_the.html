       Since they are the planck mass energy density and curve space to singularity - many of them in a row can act as a spacetime bridge, a wormhole - giving rise to a wormhole structure of space in which quantum entanglement arises as an intrinsic feature.

       On 'numerology' claims
      </h1>
      <p>
       There is no numerology or fuckery going on when you take the quantum vacuum energy density derived by mainstream quantum field theory equations (the supposed energy of empty space), and envision how much energy is in the proton volume - you yield the mass of the observable Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is taking an absolutely enormous number (10
       <sup>
        93
       </sup>
       grams / cm
       <sup>
        3)
       </sup>
       and an extremely tiny volume (proton volume 2.831 * 10
       <sup>
        -45
       </sup>
       m
       <sup>
        3)
       </sup>
       and just so happening to end up with the mass of the Universe (10
       <sup>
        55
       </sup>
       grams).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no numerology or fuckery going on that once you realize this would make the proton a black hole (due to mass in a volume) you can apply the holographic principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we're dealing with even larger equations (how many planck energies fit on the proton surface divided by how many planck energies fit in the volume) - and absolutely nail the protons actual rest mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give you an idea - that is
      </p>
      <p>
       ~47000000000000000000000000000000000000000 fit on the surface.

      </p>
      <p>
       We are taking these enormous numbers, dividing them and multiplying by the planck mass.

       Skeptics explanation for deducing the very near the exact proton rest mass: Chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of what critics propose, there is no alternative explanation for the mass of the Universe being equivalent to the amount of vacuum fluctuations that fit in the proton volume, and the rest mass via the holographic principle. It's not because of any known physical constant, any physics trick, etc. It's simply what it is.

All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter."

       Hey D8 I love all the work you put in here and the respect you give to the greatest scientists of our time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like a lot of people can't get around the interconnectedness of elementary particles because they're still stuck in the EPR mindset where lightspeed limits information transfer.  Quantum physicists really put the nail in that coffin, though, and it is abundantly clear that something is connecting particles and is unimpeded by spacetime.  I love the holographic idea and how a realm without spacetime solves the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't looked into it, but I wonder if Haramein has done any work connecting the holographic universe to the wave/particle duality and the observer effect.

       These quotes still just illustrate to me that the truth we have yet to discover, is so far beyond what we can currently describe, that even the smartest of us still equate it to a God, just as our earliest ancestors thought everything about nature equated to a gods actions and desires.

       Just because you can't think of more alternatives doesn't mean there are only two. And the second alternative (a creator) is even
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       probable because then you have to suppose even more improbable things - the creator's creator, the creator's creator's creator, the creator's creator's creator's creator's origins and so on (since simply saying "oh he always existed" is very proofless and as valid as saying "no I did it").

       No, quite the opposite. I'm comparing and showing how that is as valid as the end of the world or god, which is not much. But the are ideas (like as string theory) that are mathematically consistent and truthful which makes them actually valid.

       you just assert that stuffs starts existing without reason without anybody ever giving a proper explanation for this. A creator is more plausible to this date then other explanations. There is a reason why many people try their hardest to postulate beginningless theories. IF tthere is a beginning that a creator is more plausible than "nothing" simply because everything that we observe has a cause.

       Sorry your view is not supported.

      <p>
       Claiming we have no evidence is incorrect. Everything we know in our physical world had a cause to begin. Everything physical but you claim we have no evidence stuff needs a cause. You know which theory has zero evidence? Yours. The universe beginning without cause would be unique, no evidence for that.

       That is evidence actually. You simply "believe" the universe is special from everything we know and totally behaves differently and came into being without a cause. Your view appears to need actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your view relies on a universe that came into being without any cause. If you hold this view you are pretty alone and more importantly without much actual evidence.

       Those who support this line of thinking appear to hold this view merely as a form of defense against the implications of the cause

       One of the best books I ever purchased was in the discount Barnes and Noble bin when I was around 12 (before I had ever taken a real physics class). It was called "The Compasses of God" by Martin-Luther something. It covered in laymans terms quantum and macro physics, Schrodinger, etc. Brilliant in that a young girl could understand it's contents, it basically stated what every physicist has stated since - there is
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       that can never be accounted for in science because we cannot observe it. Interesting stuff. What you believe that
       <em>
        something

       is is up to you.

       The radiation would evaporate the black hole as it can only radiate plank mass, thus it's entire self. I believe the term blackhole is inaapropriate for the situation described
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it would be more accurately described as a non-zero tachyonic field or it's interaction. Similiar to the Higgs Field.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Higgs field might have further intricities with Holofractual theory. It is responsible for giving mass to the Weak force, thus breaking Electroweak symetry. In simple terms in extremely hot temperatures(think at the start of the universe) the weak bosons are identicle to the Photon. A possible theory suggests all the forces, including possibly gravity, were indistinguishable at the very start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this would point to a single dimension which than fractured into the respectic parts as temperature cooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went on a bit of a tangent, but I really dislike the term Black Hole as really few aspects of Holofractual allign with an actual Black Hole.

       Ok, then more like this point breaks the infinity limit at this scale rather than 'black hole,' and bends into itself or another dimension. And isnt it a theory that the all is made up of a photon or part of a photons presnce. This stuff is super intersting, especially the discovery of a possible 5th force.

       I'm a physist hobbiest so I can't comment too much on this particular theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I wouldn't go into infinity scale. A tachyonic field is faster than the speed of light. Possibly infinite fast(and indeed all charged tachyonic particles will reach practically infinte speed due to Cherenkov radiation). The Higgs field, a tachyonic field, does not produce tachyonic particles because quantom fluxtuations induce tachyonic condensation before it reaches negative energy. Hence the Higgs boson is not tachyonic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the entanglement is through a tachyonic field without using particles, it might permit information exchange/storage at an infinite(or close to or practically infinite since they are infinjtely close to infinitd without technically reaching infinity.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This would not actually require bending of spacetime, which I think alligns with Holofractuals information storage inside the vacuum energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I imagine Holofractual is that the vacuum energy from the proton's volume space stores the information for the entire universe. The Proton(or other particle) than interacts and shares information through the field interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking about it more however makes me dubious why the Proton would be the boundary for the information storage. Holofractual focuses alot on the Proton, but this would dictate special properties it particulary has. I cannot think of a mechanism to attribute these properties just to the Proton.

       There is also the latest work in Planck Stars. They find a very similar micro-black hole object of the planck density that Nassim is describing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interesting thing about this object is because it's so gravitationally curved, even if it evaporated in it's frame instantly, from the outside it would look 'frozen' for billions of years!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While it would be expected that such a repulsion would act very quickly to reverse the collapse of a star, it turns out that the relativistic effects of the very extreme gravity such an object generates slows down time for the Planck star to a similarly extreme degree. Seen from outside, the rebound from a Planck star of stellar mass takes longer than the timescale of the universe to date, such that stellar mass black holes seem to be stable to an external observer. Even more elegantly, the emission of Hawking radiation can be calculated to correspond handily to the timescale of the gravity effects on time, such that the event horizon that 'forms' a black hole naturally evaporates as the rebound proceeds.

       Really? I'm no astronomer, but I think there is a decent chunk of evidence for the existence of black holes. And why would you find them so hard to accept in the first place, just theoretically? It's a simple enough concept: put a shitload of matter in one place and it has so much gravity nothing can escape. Why do you think that is bullshit?

       Astronomers don't look at black holes. They study celestial objects. ASStrophysicist and cosmologists cook up bullshit like  dark matter and dark energy and black holes and worm holes and time travel because their math has gone complete retard. All because if a pesky experiment by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley.

       One idea I've been contemplating lately is how the photon factors into everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constant theme in 'alternative' texts is the light=love aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the whole thing is a self-feedback loop constantly evolving itself based on said feedback, and the underlying mechanisms are holographic using the EVM as a framework, we could summise that the information feedback network is holographic as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead, we have our "projection" -- and I've always interpreted reality/multiple dimensions as the various projections of light through the jitterbugging EVM.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think it plays a bigger part. The photon is unique as an elementary particle, and I think it is important to the "information" system in terms. Perhaps light represent the "collapsed" holographic state of information (ie. a specific point on the surface of the black hole).

       You have to keep in mind he is using estimated mass of the visible universe, as we do not know the actual size/mass. This value will itself change as mass moves away from us due to expansion. Thus it will work with other particles depending on the timeframe you measure visible mass of the universe.

       Oh boy. So lets do this....again. Im a Layperson. I have no degree in phyics, but let me disect this nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: its total BS Science.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Spacetime is quantized - made of tiny spherical black holes of the planck length diameter and planck mass energy density. These black holes make up spacetime like molecules that make up water.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       A Blackhole is when spacetime is so distorted that a singularity forms, a area so massive that nothing can escape. A Blackhole is the Physical Manifestation of Infinity. There is no actual Planck Length or Planck time. They are fictive units so certain calculations make sense. Molecules are made up of atoms. Atoms are made up of Electrons Protons and Neutrons. Protons and neutrons are made up of Up and Down Quarks (2Up for 1 down for the Proton, and 2 down 1 up for the neutron) They are held together by Gluons which as the name implies holds them together. They are Pointparticles. Which means that they do not exist as a 3Dimensional shape. They should be imagined like a pinprick in a canvas. They are not spherical. The Spherical shape is do to orbiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every elementary particle has wavelike properties. That is something very difficult to wrap your head around. This means every particle has a chance to exist in a certain position and or at a certain velocity (uncertainty principle). Spacetime is the consequence of the interaction of masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       So everything that the OP wrote in that paragraph is wrong. Literally everything. That is quite an achievement i have to say.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since they are the planck mass energy density and curve space to singularity - many of them in a row can act as a spacetime bridge, a wormhole - giving rise to a wormhole structure of space in which quantum entanglement arises as an intrinsic feature. ER=EPR (entanglement is due to physical wormholes).
       </p>
       <p>
        In plain english : The entirety of space and time is entangled
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, just no. So much words that have absolutely no meaning in the context. Quantum entanglement is something entirely different. If everything would be entangled with everything else then that universe would have very different properties then ours. In Plain english
       <strong>
        Its Bullshit
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       (Ignoring the "link spam" and marching  on...)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is no numerology or fuckery going on when you take the quantum vacuum energy density derived by mainstream quantum field theory equations (the supposed energy of empty space), and envision how much energy is in the proton volume - you yield the mass of the observable Universe.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The Proton volume is not a fixed volume. The charge radius is based on how far away a proton with a charge of +1 can attract a electron with a charge of -1. This charge radius is not fixed and is only an approximation. It can be bigger and smaller depending on temperature and velocity. Which kind of makes your assumptions invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       those are just easily verifiable facts that have been proven by countless experiments. Quantum Gravity is something entirely different, and it doesnt at all reconcile Spirituality or occultism. Its Fan Fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing even remotely Divine about People for now.

       I dont know how many months (or years) it took for Op to come up with that idea or how many people where working together to get to this loony conclusion. But, thats time he/she aint gonna get back. But in all honesty though, feel free to pick my comment apart. If what you say is factual i will end up learning more. If it isnt factual and just more fan fiction...then you would have wasted time just as op Did.

       Nope. It's the point at which our mathematical understanding of the universe ceases to apply. They are both very real things.

       But his claim in no way depends on this, so I'm not sure why. Also, you meant "due".

       yep, i do a little physics 101, because many people forgot those things. its good to get a quick refresher. And yeah, i was typing fast and had Dorito dust on my fingers.

       With consciousness you mean Divinity i guess (different names, same fuzzy thing). Aslong as you die, it aint.

       Thanks, while cooking i noticed i misread the first thing. He describes the quantum foam theory (i think) which is intriguing i do have to say. I would edit that but its

       Well, if it makes ya feel any better, his argument about people not being Divine has no basis in the logic of his argument.  And I also disagree with him, because our very consciousness may be a result of quantum entanglement in our microtubules, which may be tiny supercomputers more or less.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physics is nice and all but he in no way applies it TO consciousness, which researchers are trying to do (like Dr. Hameroff at U. Of Arizona).
      </p>
      <p>
       Funnily enough, that guy you were responding to says "With consciousness you mean Divinity i guess", so if he himself is conscious he just proclaimed his own Divinity.  :)

       Yes, it does. Our current view of physics don't apply to consciousness, but that IN NO WAY means it isn't a part of it - we just don't understand it yet. You could have said the same for the origins of the universe and the microcosm.

       I think it does.  You know why?  Because subjectivity can be fully explained in an objective nature...that's what I think at least.  And the more we learn the more the hard problem "goes away".  That is why knowing all is
       <em>
        nous

       in a way.  The more you know the more you are like God, in a way.  And you do that by way of

       Hmm. Perhaps I do not fully comprehend the hard problem. But my understanding is that even if we can imagine the mechanism for consciousness, we can still ask why there's something subjectively experiencing it. I just don't see how that answers it.

       I think we evolved subjectivity with intelligence.  And I further think that humans do indeed run the gamut from philosophical zombies to completely aware beings, and that individuals themselves vary in consciousness.

       Because you have reached a critical threshold of intelligence.  And I would say are at a point of relaxation where fight or flight is not a necessity, so the mind turns itself from objective machine to subjective observer.  Have you ever been in "zombie" driving mode?  I have, and it's scary.  But in a way a form of zen.

       I think you're confusing "free will" with "consciousness". Consciousness and determinism are not incompatible. The "free will" discussion is separate. Just because your actions may be completely determined doesn't mean you're not subjectively experiencing them. In fact, your subjective experience
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       be an illusion; who would it be deceiving?

      <p>
       In fact, the fact that
       <em>
        you are conscious

       <strong>
        only

       thing you can know with 100% certainty. Like Descartes said, "I think, therefore I am"

       Our subjective experience could be an illusion, deceiving oneself (we exist outside of spacetime).  The reason I said the "sitting in your head" thing is I was wondering if you have subjectively experienced astral projection, near death, etc.

       I don't know if it can be "solved" by human-level intelligence. I think it requires a philosophy that humans don't have the computational capacity to understand. Its on the same level as comprehending the fact that the universe's existence violates causality (if it's some sort of infinite loop, it's uncaused. If existence itself had a "starting point", it's uncaused. Yet here we are...)

       I have a few anecdotes in that thread (from today as well...talkative for me).  I've been pretty lucky, and I've had a smattering of various kinds of interesting phenomena, and that's not even addressing the psychedelics side of things, which I am much less experienced than many about.  But I know enough...don't know if you have ever seen it, but a Johns Hopkins study found that people that do magic mushrooms on average consider it the most rewarding/life-changing event they've had.

       I'd say I'm inclined to agree with you on the majority of your points. Whenever I see something regarding the indras net idea of the universe it seems to just look at certain values in a vacuum without taking into consideration that many of the observations are not constant. But I do always find it fun to read when it's posted.
       <br/>
       Regarding Planck length though, I believe the value is correct and real because it is mostly made from newton's gravitation constant and the speed of light in a vacuum, but the significance of it is not that it is a quantized minimum length as many people seem to believe

       there has been excellent work done on black holes that are actually singularity free - and guess what? They do this by utilizing planck energy densities.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The key feature of this theoretical object is that this repulsion arises from the energy density, not the Planck length, and starts taking effect far earlier than might be expected. This repulsive 'force' is strong enough to stop the collapse of the star well before a singularity is formed, and indeed, well before the Planck scale for distance. Since a Planck star is calculated to be considerably larger than the Planck scale for distance, this means there is adequate room for all the information captured in the black hole to be encoded upon the star, thus avoiding information loss.

       This is the exact type of object that Resonance Science puts forth as the proton black hole. It's even hypothesized to be the same size! Weird.

       <p>
        In the Bohmian view, nonlocality is even more conspicuous. The trajectory of any one particle depends on what all the other particles described by the same wave function are doing. And, critically, the wave function has no geographic limits; it might, in principle, span the entire universe. Which means that the universe is weirdly interdependent, even across vast stretches of space. The wave function “combines — or binds — distant particles into a single irreducible reality,” as Sheldon Goldstein, a mathematician and physicist at Rutgers University, has written.

      <p>
       So yes. If spacetime is made up of a Bose-Einstein condensate of light, a planck density of empty space, it would support a Wheeler Wormhole network / quantum foam interpretation that would in turn support a pilot wave interpretation of QM which would in turn support an inherently non-local cosmos.

       You are right, but then again we can never truly know. Since a blackhole is a "blackbox" no information that can describe the internal structure can escape (hawking radiation does not contain useful information about the internal structure) i was given my own opinion on that matter. So you get that point.

       an einstein rosen bridge needs to propagate either through space and (or) time. If you use a einstein rosen bridge to "probe" a blackhole you are in effect changing the geometry of the Blackhole making any information gained invalid. The only valid solution is a many body calculation. That is for now not within our technological reach.

       Never speak in absolutes when discussing theoretical knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just so you know, the big bang theory is "theoretical". It's not absolute fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that is FACT right now is that nobody can explain how gravity works, we know there is a force that acts on mass and we can approximate how it's going to act but as far as understanding the mechanism which is acting and how it works we are clueless.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more evidence that our understanding of physics is wrong than there is evidence of anything we think we know being absolute.

       Actually science has taken some leaps on understanding the possible mechanisms of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists theorize the Weak bosons aquire mass from the Higgs Field. This is why the Higgs Boson was so important. Electroweak symetry breaking put a hole in the standard model. The resolution was a Higgs Field giving the weak bosons mass. Predicting and finding it gives credence to this theory. Think of gravity(for the weak bosons) as the Higgs Field tugging on the bosons which tug on spac3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less certain they are on the mechanisms of other gravity causes. The primary mass giver, quark-gluon interaction, is in it's infantile state. Additionaly the Higgs Field allows other fields to exist at energies we cannot test yet. Think of quark-gluon mass as quarks tugging and slowing each other through gluon interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are no longer clueless about mass and gravity, however much more needs to be understood.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First off - we have no idea what the internal structure of a black hole is. It's actually the place where our physics breaks down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a blackhole is a "blackbox" no information that can describe the internal structure can escape
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Look at it this way. Our observable universe is a black hole, the singularity of that black hole is the big bang. We are describing the internal structure, day by day. I've known this since an early age, because there is an observable universe. At the edge of the observable universe is a boundary we cannot see beyond. It is a Schwarzschild radius, a cosmic event horizon. Zoom out enough on something and it disappears or takes a new form. Information from our observable universe cannot escape because it is in "a black hole", information would have to travel beyond the event horizon, which is expanding at the speed of light. You'd have to fast forward the information without fast forwarding anything else so that it catches up to the wavefront of expansion. So far this seems impossible, but holofractal implies new concepts that could make it possible. We won't know until we explore that.

       I used to think that, but I no longer do. I used to be peacefully atheist/agnostic (Dawkins is a pain in the ass), but I can no longer say that I support that atheist viewpoint. Nor am I saying I switched from atheism to theism. Hear me out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've looked at this from every angle I could research and imagine. The result is amazement. The more we look into things, the more we reveal the infinite nature of the universe and ourselves. At one point I fell into what they call an abyss, and then I came out on the other side. It was one of the best experiences I've had. Some call it enlightenment, others call it Kundalini awakening. Whatever. I know it exists now. We're on a journey. This is described by the monomyth or hero's journey. It isn't defined by it, only described by it. The monomyth is a pattern of the universe that we have discovered. Buddhism has the same concepts. Let go of your ego and ask the universe. The universe is out there, and it is also inside you.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you awaken from this illusion, and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death — or shall I say, death implies life — you can conceive yourself. Not conceive, but feel yourself, not as a stranger in the world, not as someone here on sufferance, on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental. What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself. So, say in Hindu mythology, they say that the world is the drama of God. God is not something in Hindu mythology with a white beard that sits on a throne, that has royal perogatives. God in Indian mythology is the self, Satcitananda. Which means sat, that which is, chit, that which is consciousness; that which is ananda is bliss. In other words, what exists, reality itself is gorgeous, it is the fullness of total joy.
       </p>

        The Earth is not a big rock, infested with living organisms, anymore than your skeleton is bones infested with cells. The Earth is geological, yes, but this geological entity grows people. So the existence of people is symptomatic of the kind of universe we live in.

       IMO, the abyss is that realm of thought, not where you get lost and confused and reprimanded by the universe, but it is where you experience the true nature of the universe and then everything starts to make sense. Past, present, future merge into one endless possibility which describes our existence. For example, we are just one planet out of trillions. There is another planet out there that is a mere million years older than ours. A million years isn't much as far as the universe is concerned, but it is huge as far as evolution and consciousness goes if we compare it to ourselves. There are thousands of these planets, older and younger than ours. On some of those planets there must exist life forms, evolving. Why wouldn't they? It is not even questionable to me that there might be "aliens" out there in space far more advanced than us, it is a fact provided to us by the universe and our ability to observe it. If you know the universe, then you will know this is a fact, not a fantasy. We are aliens to them. They are aliens to us. But we are all sharing in this same energy that has been set about by the cosmos, this energy that lets us see and touch matter, this radiation from energetic celestial objects that randomly or accidentally programs DNA "code" to eventually create us. But how could this be an accident? DNA aims to survive and evolve for its environment. The species of DNA consume each other in what is called the food chain or circle of life, and through consumption of DNA by other DNA-species, DNA evolves further and incorporates new traits about the environment. Viruses also program DNA. As far as we know this process has no end or final goal. Pretty much anything could happen. Have a look at some deep sea species, they are aliens. Our aliens. The abyss, and DNA, are like the ouroboros:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It [ouroboros] also represents the infinite cycle of nature's endless creation and destruction, life and death.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       When you die, your friends and family remember you. How is that so? Because our consciousness is a shared energy, it is a crowd sourced affair that you might say exists in a higher dimension for lack of a better term. All of the ancient civilizations, through their religions, tried to comprehend this realm where thought happens and where experiences exist. Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity. They were attempting to explore and understand the unphysical. Heaven, akashic records, the spiritual plane, whatever you want to call it. We could not possibly evolve to the point we are at unless our consciousness was like this. Evolution trends towards higher consciousness. Why is that? Every past species we know of was a step in the right direction, until humans and collective consciousness arose out of this cosmic-DNA feedback loop, and from that, spawned intelligence. We cannot survive space. Machines can. The next step I believe is artificial intelligence. If our consciousness and intelligence can somehow be put into machines, we will evolve further and adapt to new environments besides Earth. We will become even closer to our maker, the maker of the stars, that which breathes life into the universe. This was the plan all along. It is the nature of the universe. It has already happened though, in another time and place, if only you understood the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Einstein still exists in our consciousness and he still shapes the way we look at physics. He is dead, but his concepts live on. His concepts were helped along by all the other conscious humans during his time period. It's a shared affair. We still have Sherlock Holmes shows on TV, because Arthur Conan Doyle imprinted himself into our collective consciousness through his spirituality and art of writing. You brush your teeth in the morning because other conscious beings discovered it to be a good way to maintain oral health. Everything about us is shared consciousness. When you're a baby, everyone helps you become conscious. Without that help, you do not become conscious on a human level. There are anomalies such as the wild children who grew up in the woods and lack the shared consciousness we have. Their consciousness lines up with wild animals, as this is the environment they live in. It is only when we conscious humans step into that person's life and attempt to teach them math and language that they "join" the collective consciousness the rest of us are all part of. So you see that consciousness cannot thrive or evolve without other consciousness helping out, and consciousness itself is an environment "to be in". You might ask yourself then, what helped out our consciousness?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apologies for the wall of text, I'm working on better ways to describe this stuff. This isn't a copy paste so there might be some contradictions here and there, but I think the point has been made. There is so much more about this universe than what we know or think. We've barely scratched the surface. It makes me happy to be alive and able to experience it all for a while.

       nah, cause you just took what i wrote at face value.  his explanation gives me a place to start myself off and work from, but i also know the context of alot of those quotes that op misapplied.  alot of religious and spiritual talk bordering on that anunaki/pseudohistory bullshit kinda gives it away.  coupled with what i DO know that i know about physics and the cosmos, it kinda just helps with the puzzle.

       But there is an actual planck length.  That is what
       <strong>
        quantum
       </strong>
       physics is all about, on small scales the universe really is quantized.  This is a natural consequence of quantum uncertainty and the probabilistic nature of elementary particles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The planck length is calculated through constants in the universe such as the speed of light.  I think light and other constants like the cosmological constant also point to the quantization of the universe.

       I don't think he's referring to entaglement of particles in the sense of entangled pairs in the Bell experiment.  He means that there is some sort of dimension that exists independent of spacetime that allows instantaneous information transfer throughout the universe.

       Let me preface this by saying that i love wondering about reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Suggesting that anyone
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       knows what's going on is absurd. They might have some really good ideas, but to suggest that humans can grasp reality through our tiny keyhole of perceptions is arrogance in its purest form. What we perceive as light is less than 0.000002% of the EM spectrum. We can use machines and tools to expand our keyhole, but we will never know what the sun "looks" like because we're simply incapable of perceiving all the data it's broadcasting.
      </p>
      <p>
       An unusual hit of dopamine leaves us catatonic, awash in emotions. 200 years has morphed our language so much that we now differentiate between american and British English. We have no idea what is pushing the universe apart or holding galaxies together so we call it dark matter and dark energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's
       <em>
        so much
       </em>
       we don't know that claiming to know anything for sure is no more than hope and wonder.

       The fact that you can use a cheap MEMs sensor to detect rotation shows that is not true.

       Well the experiment lays out more than that. What are your thoughts? Do you think something so damning and endorsed by the Air Force would get published today? I mean you see idiots all over the place thinking the ether doesn’t exist because school told them it doesn’t. How fucked is it that science is used to betray us and when people try to warn us of what is happening we get accounts like yours ready and willing to scream “nothing to see here”.

       Hey man, nature magazine 1986. Give it a search yourself. If you really need a link I’ll double back when you post your response. Backed by the USAF they were able to improve and replicate the results of the Michelson Morely experiment as well as definitively prove that relativity is a hoax. They also posted a damning sidebar on the state of science and how those in the ivory towers have weaponized science to dumb us down. Try getting an article like this published in Nature magazine today. They warned us but we didn’t listen! Enjoy the read my friend and I’m stoked to be here!

       There's no reason for the government to hide the fact that space can curve and relativity is a thing lol. Gravity is real. Science is real. Maybe not all modern ideologies are "there" yet but relativity is definitely real. Reality is a malleable fabric. If you're really on the "flat earth/firmament" side (which I still believe in, half and half) why don't you regard the space inside the firmament is literally a third dimensional realm? A realm of matter bound by LAWS that God established, INCLUDING gravity and relativity and all that jazz.

       Irrelevant since they don't teach there. Science is external to political influences. Science is not a "guess", it's millions of scientists debunking themselves with tests, studies and experiments and observing which conclusions they can draw from the results. If you don't understand that maybe keep reading the bible and pray for an invisible sky-being :)

       Prayer is in any form or thought directed towards God as if you were speaking to him. Praises are also usually head up high and hands high, while more humble prayers of repentance are on your knees and head down. Zeus is a man bound by a carnal body, Yahweh would think him out of existence. You're not even trying.

       If the sun was replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the earth wouldn't get sucked in. It would continue to orbit as normal, because the mass hasn't changed, and the earth is in a stable orbit with the gravitational field produced by an object of that mass, whether it be a star, a black hole, or anything else.
       <br/>
       The reason everything doesn't get sucked up is because most things (at least those measurable) are stable. The blackholes that make up the 'fabric of spacetime' are in stable relationships with one another.

       “It is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses, to remember that the dullest most uninteresting person you can talk to may one day be a creature which,if you saw it now, you would be strongly tempted to worship, or else a horror and a corruption such as you now meet, if at all, only in a nightmare. All day long we are, in some degree helping each other to one or the other of these destinations. It is in the light of these overwhelming possibilities, it is with the awe and the circumspection proper to them, that we should conduct all of our dealings with one another, all friendships, all loves, all play, all politics. There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal. Nations, cultures, arts, civilizations - these are mortal, and their life is to ours as the life of a gnat. But it is immortals whom we joke with, work with, marry, snub, and exploit - immortal horrors or everlasting splendors.”..C.S. Lewis

       It's really hard to explain, but I feel deep down many of us kind of "know" parts of this. Basically just imagine everything exists now, is eternal, and we're basically the same 'mind' (everyone's consiousness is the same "me"), and we all created or are part of the same reality in a holographic (2D projected but looks and feels 3D) matrix-type thing. We're just going through one tube/string of life in this period.
      </p>

       It's a megagigantic mindfuck and I recommend just imagining and thinking about it the next time you're grabbing a shower, that's where I started to get a hang of this type of thinking. Imagine that a single water droplet in the shower could contain the same entire cosmos you live in right now, and there's "you" in that waterdroplet along with all of your friends, and the time it took for it to hit the floor of your shower and mix in with the other water droplets was the age of the entire cosmos, which we have yet to complete, but we also HAVE completed it but our minds are experiencing - for whatever reason - that it's just a day in March of 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then imagine you and the entire cosmos is in a water droplet too, and a gigantic you is taking a shower too and watching that waterdroplet we're all in, and he's in a waterdroplet too, in an endless loop.

       I suspect that the big bang never happened.  That what we see as space-time is an illusion brought about by our inability to experience and understand the compact simultaneous nature of the universe.  I suspect that every event in the universe occurs simultaneously, but which we can only experience linearly temporally and in 3 dimensions. I suspect what we call time, for example 1 second of time, is just us experiencing two sequential instantaneous states of reality (parallel universes, maybe?) that are slightly different.  Between these two states of reality are an infinite number of states slightly different from the last, which is perceived as time passing in 3-D space, with one state of space-time eventually becoming the other state of space-time, one second apart.  If there is no big bang, and time is an illusion, there will also not be the heat death of the universe.  What we predict to be the heat death of the universe is simply the furthest point in the timeless cosmic egg we find ourselves in that we can observe.
       <br/>
       Only consciousnesses which can only observe the universe in 3 dimensions can experience time and space.

       Ahh the Grand Conspiracy. It's a time-space lucid dream that we slowly ascend out of into the 5th dimension - where this time-space continuum was birthed. We are all the same singularity experiencing itself within a certain set of "laws". We grow into ever-expanding maturity and responsibility of the dream until we exit/merge with it completely and reside where Truth does - Beyond time-space.

       Nassim is the one claiming to have a new, unified, model of physics.  Something which has eluded the greats:  Einstein, Hawking, etc.  Thus, the burden is squarely on him to prove his theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several links here that critique his claims:

       You don’t “prove” theoretical physics. You gather experimental evidence that supports it, and you try to falsify your own claims, both of which Nassim does. He has modified and refined his theories continuously just like the established branches.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve read the critiques. None convince me. Modern physics is as much of a joke as Nassim, judged by their own standards. Pretty much all of modern physics relies on foundational paradigms that are either taken for granted or also cannot be proven or tested. General Relativity is a total sham.

       Spacetime is quantized - made of tiny spherical black holes of the planck length diameter and planck mass energy density. These black holes make up spacetime like molecules that make up water.

      <p>
       Since they are the planck mass energy density and curve space to singularity - many of them in a row can act as a spacetime bridge, a wormhole - giving rise to a wormhole structure of space in which quantum entanglement arises as an intrinsic feature.

       I have always understood holography to involve four ontologically distinct entities.
The hologram itself.
The thing that it's a hologram of.
The gadget that makes the hologram from something else.
And the conscious observer who sees the hologram as a projection of whatever it's a hologram of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The universe is everything -- including all four of the foregoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to say it's a hologram implies it's only one of these four.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm right so far, then what are the other three?

       Actually science has taken some leaps on understanding the possible mechanisms of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists theorize the Weak bosons aquire mass from the Higgs Field. This is why the Higgs Boson was so important. Electroweak symetry breaking put a hole in the standard model. The resolution was a Higgs Field giving the weak bosons mass. Predicting and finding it gives credence to this theory. Think of gravity(for the weak bosons) as the Higgs Field tugging on the bosons which tug on spac3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less certain they are on the mechanisms of other gravity causes. The primary mass giver, quark-gluon interaction, is in it's infantile state. Additionaly the Higgs Field allows other fields to exist at energies we cannot test yet. Think of quark-gluon mass as quarks tugging and slowing each other through gluon interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are no longer clueless about mass and gravity, however much more needs to be understood.

       Sorry your view is not supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Claiming we have no evidence is incorrect. Everything we know in our physical world had a cause to begin. Everything physical but you claim we have no evidence stuff needs a cause. You know which theory has zero evidence? Yours. The universe beginning without cause would be unique, no evidence for that.

       <p>
        Great, you have evidence that patterns exist. But no evidence of a god. Understand?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is evidence actually. You simply "believe" the universe is special from everything we know and totally behaves differently and came into being without a cause. Your view appears to need actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your view relies on a universe that came into being without any cause. If you hold this view you are pretty alone and more importantly without much actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who support this line of thinking appear to hold this view merely as a form of defense against the implications of the cause

       If the sun was replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the earth wouldn't get sucked in. It would continue to orbit as normal, because the mass hasn't changed, and the earth is in a stable orbit with the gravitational field produced by an object of that mass, whether it be a star, a black hole, or anything else.
       <br/>
       The reason everything doesn't get sucked up is because most things (at least those measurable) are stable. The blackholes that make up the 'fabric of spacetime' are in stable relationships with one another.
