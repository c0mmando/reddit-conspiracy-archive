       That isn't easy to demonstrate but it's as true on the global-scale as it is in your own life, so I encourage you to
       <em>
        look again
       </em>
       at your own past circumstances.  How many times have you been forced to ask yourself
       <em>
        what are the damn odds?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       When an event directly related to 9/11 happens on one of these pseudo-anniversaries, it's foreshadowing of things to come.  Have you noticed the MSM has been promoting the "deep state" narrative lately?  It's always been quietly in the background but, like the patsies picked for "terrorist" events, it's steadily becoming more obvious (and with both, intentionally-so).
      </p>
      <p>
       How long would you expect it to take for the official 9/11 story to fall apart in open court?  I'm thinking one physicist and about five minutes.  (
       <em>
        Well, you see, airplanes are made of aluminum, density 2,700 kg/m

        to stay in the air in a very different way..
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Any lawsuit is likely to expose to the public (a version of) the truth about 9/11 and the "deep state".  It'll all be as calculated and planned as all the preceding events.  None of it happens for a single reason, it's all
       <em>
        plans within plans
       </em>
       in this cosmic play.  (Personally, I liked the
       <em>
        Dune
       </em>
       version of the story more than all this.)

      <p>
       Suicide bombers, falling towers, and a fainting candidate are all very different-- until you step back and look at them symbolically.  Suddenly all these events become the same story repeated again and again.  This reality only has so-many stories and it used up all its romantic comedies on Zeus.  That guy was a

       This is known as poisoning the well. Is calling you crazy or on drugs fair? No, it's not. Is exploring cognitive biases as another potential explanation for your hypothesis fair? Yes, it is.

       I'm pretty convinced of numerology stuff. Here's my take:
      </p>
      <p>
       3 is the symbol of the trinity: mind + body + spirit
      </p>
      <p>
       6 and 9 are mutliples of 3.

      </p>
      <p>
       this describes 11
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't trust them at first, but some of the numerology stuff is spot on.
      </p>
      <p>
       just google the number and write numerology or angel numbers after it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be curious to know what you think.
