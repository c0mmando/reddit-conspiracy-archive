        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1><em>If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6, and 9 then you would have the key to the universe.</em> - Nikola Tesla</h1>

<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/87sphj/its_been_16_years_since_911_and_theres_an/">my previous post</a>, I listed two likely dates for upcoming events: 03/28 and yesterday, 03/31.  While only one of these dates had a terrorist event, I believe both predictions were accurate.  (Check out the last post if you&#39;re wondering <em>why</em> these dates.)</p>

<h2>03/28 2018, 16y6m16d after 9/11</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>A U.S. judge rejected Saudi Arabiaâ€™s bid to dismiss lawsuits claiming that it helped plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and should pay billions of dollars in damages to victims. - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/87w9q9/saudi_arabia_must_face_us_lawsuits_over_sept_11/">r/worldnews post</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>There are no coincidences in this reality.</em>  That isn&#39;t easy to demonstrate but it&#39;s as true on the global-scale as it is in your own life, so I encourage you to <em>look again</em> at your own past circumstances.  How many times have you been forced to ask yourself <em>what are the damn odds?</em></p>

<p>When an event directly related to 9/11 happens on one of these pseudo-anniversaries, it&#39;s foreshadowing of things to come.  Have you noticed the MSM has been promoting the &quot;deep state&quot; narrative lately?  It&#39;s always been quietly in the background but, like the patsies picked for &quot;terrorist&quot; events, it&#39;s steadily becoming more obvious (and with both, intentionally-so).</p>

<p>How long would you expect it to take for the official 9/11 story to fall apart in open court?  I&#39;m thinking one physicist and about five minutes.  (<em>Well, you see, airplanes are made of aluminum, density 2,700 kg/m<sup>3,</sup> to stay in the air and skyscrapers are made of steel, density 8,000 kg/m<sup>3,</sup> to stay in the air in a very different way..</em>)</p>

<p>Any lawsuit is likely to expose to the public (a version of) the truth about 9/11 and the &quot;deep state&quot;.  It&#39;ll all be as calculated and planned as all the preceding events.  None of it happens for a single reason, it&#39;s all <em>plans within plans</em> in this cosmic play.  (Personally, I liked the <em>Dune</em> version of the story more than all this.)</p>

<h2>03/31 2018, 16y6m19d after 9/11</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Four suicide bombers killed two people in multiple attacks in northeast Nigeria in the latest assault since the government announced it was in ceasefire talks with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram">Boko Haram</a> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/88ltcx/four_teenage_girl_suicide_bombers_have_killed_two/">r/worldnews post</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One terrorist attack, right on schedule.  Four suicide bombers kill two people like four planes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6kr3al/technology_thousands_of_years_ahead_of_whats/">dustified</a> two towers.  One of the four bombers blew up in a field as one of the four planes crashed in a field.</p>

<p>Remember when Hilary Clinton <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/09/11/hillary-clinton-9-11-memorial/">collapsed just outside the 9/11 memorial</a> around the same time as a tower 15 years earlier?  That video that <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4153002/Man-filmed-Clinton-s-collapse-called-hero.html" title=":cough:bullshit:cough:">was &quot;accidentally&quot; recorded</a> and shared <em>everywhere</em> as the MSM just can&#39;t get enough of that amateur footage.  </p>

<p>Suicide bombers, falling towers, and a fainting candidate are all very different-- until you step back and look at them symbolically.  Suddenly all these events become the same story repeated again and again.  This reality only has so-many stories and it used up all its romantic comedies on Zeus.  That guy was a <em>playa</em>.</p>

<h2>4/22 2016, 6066 days after 9/11</h2>

<p>My magic powers of insight, foresight, and fivesight say my next post will be on 4/23.</p>

<h2><em>Bring in the clowns!</em></h2>

<p>Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7rs567/secret_technology_being_used_against_us_kinetic/">trollbots</a> will be along shortly to say this is all coincidence.  We&#39;ll also see phrases like <em>observer bias</em> and suggestions that anyone who believes any of it is either crazy, on drugs, or both.  Ever notice it&#39;s always the &quot;skeptic&quot; comment that gets the most votes?</p>

<p>Guess you&#39;ll just have to decide for yourself-- or wait and see what the 22nd holds.  In the meantime, enjoy finding eggs hidden by a giant rabbit on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the northern spring equinox.  Oh, and don&#39;t forget all those distinctly-pagan things are all &quot;because Jesus&quot; just please don&#39;t ask how or why.  (<code>09/11/01+4118=12/21/12+4118=04/01/24</code>)</p>

<p>This is known as poisoning the well. Is calling you crazy or on drugs fair? No, it&#39;s not. Is exploring cognitive biases as another potential explanation for your hypothesis fair? Yes, it is. While discrediting people based on fallacies or ignorance should be countered, &quot;skepticism&quot; should not be a dirty word. </p>

<p>Just keep in mind Littlewoodâ€™s law, that 1-in-a-million â€˜miracleâ€™ types of events should (statistically) be experienced about once a month. So, there actually is a chance of some mind-boggling stuff occurring with some regularity.</p>
