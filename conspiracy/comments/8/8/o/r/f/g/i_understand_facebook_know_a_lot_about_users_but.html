    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I&#39;d actually really like to hear an honest answer as to why McAfee left his own company. I <em>have</em> read some answered questions on Quora from those who have worked with him, and those were all quite positive.

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fucking hit-piece Batman. That article it hilarious. It&#39;s so fucking ridiculous I don&#39;t even know where to start breaking down the ridiculousness without writing a book about it. Love how they say things like a physical switch to disconnect the battery is worthless because the real problem is software and anyone who gets within contact range of your phone can simply switch the phone battery back on. Show me another phone with a built in Stingray detector and physical switchs to turn everything from the camera to the battery off then tell me it&#39;s worthless for privacy. Then tell me it&#39;s priced at just over a grand but it&#39;ll probably fail because it&#39;s next closest competitor is priced at fucking $16,000 didn&#39;t do so well. Jesus Christ where do they find people cunty enough to write these articles for them and how do they sleep at night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting to contrast the Verge article with this one from Newsweek:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/john-mcafee-privacy-phone-smartphone-590373">http://www.newsweek.com/john-mcafee-privacy-phone-smartphone-590373</a></p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<p>&quot;Kyle Wilhoit, a senior security researcher at DomainTools, adds: “I’m a proponent of any privacy-focussed product, and that includes smartphones. To be sufficiently secure, there would need to be a combination of physical and virtual security mechanisms embedded into the device. I would be curious to see the full feature set of such a phone.”&quot;</p>

<p>Wonder if I should go with Newsweek and their collection of opinions from various industry professionals on this one or go with the Verge and their sellout of an author who didn&#39;t offer up any opinions other than her own? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Facebook worked to help trump. This is a huge common tactic, pick one person and subject to smear while it’s going on every else. They chose Facebook because Zucc was planning on running, let “Russian troll farms” roam free on the platform, and “gave” data to CamAnal. The same thing happened to Martin Skrelli. He pissed off the wrong shareholders and was deemed “pharma bro” when in reality, big pharma people are doing the same thing as we speak, but 10 fold. </p>

<p>It’s to shine a light on a certain someone with the subject, thinking us peons will just pay attention to them and not the others hurting our society in the same way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea its not trivial but convenience as a consumer priority is waning. I was a big home automation fan that was novice in nature (read techcrunch and watched revision3 type reviews of big corporate tech on YouTube)....did it all; nest doorbell cam, echo&#39;s, firetvs, Stringify, Plex, you name it. Then all of the Facebook fatigue set in with politics and the r/degoogle and r/dontbeevil stuff was compelling so in December I made my 2018 goals around the theme of &quot;de-product myself&quot;.... Kodi, flirc, Emby, deleted Facebook, cancelled Netflix and Hulu and PS Vue, uninstalled Nest and then bought an android phone and flashed Lineage. Its not trivial but the community documentation at this point is sound. The biggest hang up was realizing I needed a carrier unlocked phone to do it. Other than that, de-producting myself has been relatively easier than I anticipated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gave up Android for a Blackberry a couple years ago to escape Google&#39;s grasp. Yes, even if you encrypt a Blackberry phone all the 3 letter agencies have the decryption key. However, it keeps Google away from my day-to-day activities.</p>

<p>Just recently I downloaded all of Google&#39;s data on me. There was a 700MB JSON file of my location history, and a complete history of what apps I opened and at what time on the Android phone, not to mention a few other things.</p>

<p>To answer your question OP, I think what other people are saying about Android without Gapps is preferred. Just never connect it to your Google account.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because no one from google flirted with the idea of running for office, and SOMEONE had to be thrown under the bus for the orange one&#39;s victory. Who knows what else is even going on behind closed doors? Maybe FB wasn&#39;t playing ball as willingly as other tech companies, or other tech companies that are closer to the seats of power would stand to benefit from them eating some shit.</p>

<p>Maybe a little of all the above.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? Because Google didn&#39;t supposedly help Trump win the election. &quot;People&quot; are in an uproar about privacy and &quot;the Russians&quot; not out of principle but because Hillary lost. The DNC and establishment powers that be want to put the blame for this loss on anyone but their inability to get with the times. If they take down Facebook then it sends a message to every other social media company.  And it will help them win the next time they try to shove a status quo, pro-establishment candidate down our throats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something is up with the way MSM just threw Facebook and Zuckerberg under the bus. OP is right, there are a lot of other companies out there doing the same chit, google included. MSM was all pro Zuckerberg, they could have ignored this story but went in on him and basically destroyed any chance at his rumored 2020 plans. I&#39;m just wondering who is behind it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was using google recently as a timetracking tool, it captures every movement you make and you can see each step with timestamp historically. Its actually quite neat. Of course its optional, you don&#39;t have to activate google location services, so I don&#39;t see much of a problem with it. I would have a problem if it was mandated by government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think you need to worry about google?</p>

<p>Where do they store their data?
Who provides the internet to other ISP?
Now we are talking about BIG data collection, from all these small timers (google/amazon/apple)</p>

<p>Look deep. Go back to he basics.
You&#39;ll find the answer.</p>

<p>THEN get worried. Google is small fry in this game. Pawns and puppets to keep the masses entertained.</p>
