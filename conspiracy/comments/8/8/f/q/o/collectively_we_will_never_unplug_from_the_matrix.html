    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of whatever shadowy figures we believe are lurking behind the conflict and misery in the world, <em>none</em> of it would be possible without our myopic, profane fixation upon security and comfort, money and status, pleasure and power, pursued to the exclusion of that which deep within our hearts we know is <em>true wealth</em>.</p>

<p>In spirit, in essence, this is no different than the elite&#39;s lust for domination and control. It is no exaggeration to say that our elites <em>grow</em> out of the seeds sown by our own egotism, antagonism, and divisiveness. They are as much a creation of our collective selfishness as we are of theirs.</p>

<p>In other words, our society is one whole organism.</p>

<p>If you want to plant the seeds of a new society, start by cultivating a new <em>you</em>; one that teaches truth the only way it can be taught.</p>

<p>With <em>love</em>.</p>

<p>You are correct sir. We allow them to exist. They exploit the weaknesses for security, comfort, status, etc. that you mentioned, but we are the ones who allow them to. Once we defeat that part of our selves, the ego, the part that wants to be dominant, then we will have defeated &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>It is ironic, but the only way we can defeat our shadowy overlords is to fight a war against our own selfish impulses. Once we achieve that, they become irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all fine and well, but people are cunts. Are you suggesting that I love cunts? Because that&#39;s really fucking tough. </p>

<p>The other day I was feeling all lovey and I gave some dude a cigarette. He then proceeded to take a swipe at my dog. Not five seconds after I had proactively niced at him with giving him gifts! My poor basset hound! Just because he barked! HE THEN CALLED HIM AN UGLY MOTHERFUCKER!</p>

<p>No. It&#39;s best to love people in the abstract, but to not be around them unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Because they&#39;re mostly cunts.</p>

<p>Yes, but if you are around them you still have to give them the cigarette, metaphorically speaking. To be Christ-like, you have to expect that kind of response. You have to embrace it. It will happen. It&#39;s the death-spasm of an ignorant response to kindness. </p>

<p>Remember that many people see kindness as a set-up... as a kind of trick. That&#39;s because any time anybody has been kind to them throughout their life it was a prelude to trickery, deceit and violence. They expect you to be an asshole, and when you&#39;re not it sets them on edge.</p>

<p>You did the right thing, but you&#39;ll have to do it ten more times before that guy accepts that you&#39;re actually a nice guy and not somebody trying to set him up.</p>

<p>Or he could just be a douche.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Loving people unconditionally means to me, that you are acting in their bests interests.  That you&#39;re compassionate enough to take the time and effort to see where they&#39;re coming from; to walk in their shoes.  You don&#39;t have to let people take advantage of you or give in to their wishes.  I don&#39;t see that reinforcing dependent behavior patterns to be healthy for people.  Sometimes people do nice things for others to make themselves feel good so they can tell themselves that they&#39;re a good person.  That&#39;s just another expression of ego.
To genuinely love someone takes effort and understanding.</p>

<p>I believe that everyone is trying to do the best that they can in life and no matter how bad a person they are, this still applies.  Anyone who&#39;s a douche learned that trait.  If people get fed garbage emotion, that&#39;s what they&#39;ll feed others.  Emotions carry energy and people with bad energy picked it up from somewhere.  That&#39;s not to absolve them of responsibility, since everyone has the ability to let go of whichever energy and emotions the wish to, but what prevents that is once again ego.
Just remember that if you&#39;re a douche back to him, you simply dump more shit on his pile.  It reinforces his attitude by showing him that as far as he can tell, you&#39;re a douche too, and he&#39;s right to behave that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buddhism isn&#39;t quite the right response either.</p>

<p>I think Buddhism, ironically, is based on selfishness. It&#39;s all about taking the rightward path for <em>you</em>. It tells you how to escape samsara, but it doesn&#39;t tell you how to do it collectively.</p>

<p>The trick is to find the right balance between looking out for number one and taking the risk of telling other&#39;s what&#39;s up and who is the enemy. Buddhism wouldn&#39;t really accept that we have an intractable enemy, but the OP does.</p>
