<p>Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.</p>

<p>European political researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D. C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Dammegard received this email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department:</p>

<p>If you go to page 6 of that link above, you will see that Scott Earhardt does in fact work as a detective in the Metropolitan PD.</p>

<p><em>In Summary</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School occurred on February 14, 2018.</p></li>
<li><p>A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD.</p></li>
<li><p>On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities).</p></li>
<li><p>Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD, which had not existed before February 15.</p></li>
<li><p>The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department received a permit application for March For Our Lives demonstration “several months prior to the actual event”.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Remaining Questions</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can Never Again MSD apply for a permit “several months” BEFORE the group had even been formed?</p></li>
<li><p>How can an application be made for a permit for a “March For Our Lives” demonstration “several months” BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Those were the facts I could pull from the article and it does seem to cite credible sources. The situation is indeed suspicious.</p>

<p>Well the wiki for it says it was all planned four days after the shooting.</p>

<p>On their website <a href="https://marchforourlives.com/faq/">https://marchforourlives.com/faq/</a> it says it was planned all by the students themselves. </p>

<p>The officer said it was reserved 7 months prior with 7 months of planning. What do you not see here?</p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t planned by them why can&#39;t i edit the wiki for it and put was actually planned by planners 7 months prior and had little to no input from the students? Why does the website hype the children instead?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then the wiki should be edited to say it was planned 7 months prior and the children didnt plan it at all yet it has never a protected page of course. The website should as well be changed bevause it is misleading.</p>

<p>Also CBS says differently. According to the journalists that followed them and made a 39 day documentary said the did it in 4 days.</p>

<p>It says booked 7 months prior with 7 months of planning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you believe a random email with no letterhead or actual details just the words ‘several months’ sure. There is this - <a href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/foia/upload/March-For-Our-Lives-application_Redacted.pdf">https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/foia/upload/March-For-Our-Lives-application_Redacted.pdf</a></p>

<p>End of the day all I was asking was why you were saying seven when there seems no evidence to support ‘seven’. There is evidence that shows an application made on the 20th of feb, and there is anecdotal evidence that says ‘several months’. People should weigh the evidence and be skeptical. Skeptical of the official story of course but certainly skeptical of people making big claims (7 months) with no evidence at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree this is suspect, but what in particular is the issue here:
Is it that the march had its permit but was not publicized as it should have been if it was not a secret?  Is it that the march must have booked speakers and figureheads before Parkland and appears to have replaced them all with Parkland survivors?  Is the suspicion here stemming from our general suspicion in the official story, with Hogg&#39;s dad being FBI, the suspect being arrested far from school, the teacher claiming she saw body armor, etc.?  All are legit reasons to be concerned (don&#39;t get me wrong), I&#39;m just curious what you guys think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting find.</p>

<p>Googling it comes up with a few articles such as</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/march-for-our-lives-gun-control-rally-bumped-from-mall-by-talent-show/2018/03/01/ad8c7268-1cc6-11e8-9496-c89dc446c2d3_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/march-for-our-lives-gun-control-rally-bumped-from-mall-by-talent-show/2018/03/01/ad8c7268-1cc6-11e8-9496-c89dc446c2d3_story.html</a></p>

<p>Which say that the permit was applied for and given in Feb/March, which is at least partly backed by the fact that their original submission was denied as others had taken the space they wanted at some mall.</p>

<p>However they needed 2 permits, one with national Park service and one with DC police. There&#39;s plenty of info about the first, but the DC permit was not released or commented on according to a half dozen articles I just read. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all likelihood the email is a total fabrication.
The source for this story is Professor James Fetzer. He is the person who provided a screenshot of this email purportedly obtained from a friend of the anonymous recipient. Fetzer is a conspiracy theorist and Holocaust denier: Fetzer has written: &quot;My research on the Holocaust narrative suggests that it is not only untrue but probably false and not remotely scientifically sustainable.&quot; Fetzer has also claimed that Mossad death squads were responsible for the Sandy Hook shootings. He has stated that Jews or Israel were involved in a conspiracy to commit the 9/11 attacks as &quot;a contemporary variant of the old, antisemitic conspiracist canard about the disloyalty of Jews and their usurpation of power in the name of communal interests and the accumulation of wealth.&quot; 
Fetzer is a nutjob and every article on the web claiming the permit applications pre-dated the shooting hold up this email as the sole evidence.  This is fake news of the worst kind.
See the link below or just Google Fetzer and the picture becomes clear very quickly.

    <div class="md"><p>On your very post you wrote Never Again MSD was formed after the shooting. You mentioned March for Our Lives requested the permit months prior. Why then do you ask how Never Again MSD apply for a permit months before the group was formed? </p>

<p>Seems clear to me they simply joined the organized event for March for Our Lives, don&#39;t you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.&quot; Am I really the only one who sees what a blatant violation of the Constitution this is? We have a RIGHT protected by the highest law of the land to peacefully assemble and protest - and now, the government requires us to ask for its permission to protest its policies. While I certainly don&#39;t agree with the &quot;March For Our Lives&quot; people (as it was really just a march against gun rights), they shouldn&#39;t need a permit to exercise a right. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not the only one that requires a permit now... </p>
