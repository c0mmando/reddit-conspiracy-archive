    <div class="md"><p>You are wrong. Archaeologically speaking there are countless examples of tool marks on bone. We came out of the trees to eat animals </p>

<p>Humans are omnivores. We have eaten every and anything. It is how we got here. To deny this is laughable </p>

<p>High protein while growing and high carbs when older. Basically like a lizard. Which I am well aware of as I have raised lizards. </p>

<p>So fundimentally you want rare flesh when young and rotten fruit when really old.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying if you want to play the old school card, the species we supposedly evolved from didn&#39;t eat animals. Just because your body CAN eat something doesn&#39;t mean that its beneficial for the body. I&#39;m not denying that at all? Just pointing out that the body has a rough time digesting meat, and animal products in general. Hence why on a plant based diet your muscle repair time is improved. Hence why the older body builder classes are dominated by vegans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put a kid in a room with a bunny or antree and see which gets eaten. Silly argument. </p>

<p>Funny though because I had it with my grandson. </p>

<p>There is an area where idiots release rabbits. The highway interchange is covered in them. Seriously. The city had to deal with it and put up &quot;no rabbit drop off signs&quot; </p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>I said to him &quot;oh hey the bunnirs are coming up&quot; on his way home one time.</p>

<p>I said let&#39;s pull over and catch one to eat. And he said he wants to cuddle one. I said he better go first!</p>

<p>He is a vegetarian now by his own choice at 6. Both his parents are omnivores.</p>

<p>A few Millenia from now we will be eating only man made food. 100% lab made foods. So this is all really moot. I mean it is quite <em>kingdomist</em> to think animals are so much better than plants. </p>

<p>Even thought they are canivores their metabolism requires them to be in constant source of nourishment</p>

<p>A strictly vegetarian diet could easily introduce your system to some nasty shit. Of course unless you spend the bulk of your time sourcing your sources. </p>

<p>I embrace my diet. I raise my own pork and chickens and turkeys. Almost 100%</p>

Category 3 material is clearly defined in Article 6 of Regulation 1774/2002 and is essentially material from slaughtered animals declared fit for human consumption, but are either those parts not consumed by humans or are in excess of human food requirements.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah you are interested onto something alright. Being tired all the time and constantly needing to nibble on something. I worked with a guy with your diet. I called him &quot;The Shrew&quot;</p>

<p>A strictly vegetarian diet could easily introduce your system to some nasty shit. Of course unless you spend the bulk of your time sourcing your sources. </p>

<p>I embrace my diet. I raise my own pork and chickens and turkeys. Almost 100%</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to obtain 100% of my vegetables myself. Unless I stop working and make that my job.</p>
