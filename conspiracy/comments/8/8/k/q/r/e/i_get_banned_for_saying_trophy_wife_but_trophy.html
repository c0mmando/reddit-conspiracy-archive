    <div class="md"><p>No. I made a comment saying &quot;trophy wife&quot; which was deleted but a post with &quot;trophy husband&quot; wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>If this sub is also defending/condoning what was done it really makes me wonder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the third time... Your comment was about another person, the other comment was about themselves.</p>

<p>For the second time I am not condoning or defending anything, I am explaining to you how you broke the rule. A long standing rule.</p>

<p>It sounds like you would prefer 4chan</p>

<p>It seems like this sub is the same, turning into a 4chan (that&#39;s why you mentioned it.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh. I swear. I put called someone a trophy wife. Not yourself. Why is this so hard for you?</p>

<p>Personally rules are for suckers. To keep the content above name calling is the intent. But if you think someone is an idiot you should be allowed to say as much. Instead of having to do it in some round about fashion.</p>

<p>The trophy husband comment was referring to <em>himself</em></p>

<p>Your trophy wife comment was about a hot latina. </p>

<p>Racist and sexist. Wake the fuck up.</p>

<p>Feel free to call yourself an utter fucking moron. Call me one and you&#39;ll get deleted.</p>
