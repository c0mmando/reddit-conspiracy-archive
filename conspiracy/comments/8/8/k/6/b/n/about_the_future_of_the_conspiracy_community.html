        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">36</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-03-31 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/HibikiSS.html">HibikiSS</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys. So I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about recent events, a lot of people are frustrated with the shilling and there have been a lot of downs from our side
because of the censorship going on at reddit. There are dark powers that don&#39;t want the corruption we talk about here to reach others so we are constantly under attack...
Since a lot of mods that are loyal to the conspiracy community have exposed the brigading, the constant attacks and the stalking against them to the admins and there has been 
almost no response, It&#39;s safe to say that there is a lot of corruption going on in reddit itself. I&#39;m not saying all the reddit staff is involved but considering some mods get death threats often, well we have reasons to be paranoid.</p>

<p>User <a href="/u/magnora7">/u/magnora7</a> created a new website called <a href="https://saidit.net/">Saidit.</a> I was hoping you guys would join us over there in order to have a better control of the attacks going on against us, but It&#39;s also to weaken their monopoly of
information. Basically I&#39;m not telling you guys to quit reddit either, I think we still gotta keep up the fight over here. As I already said, the people in power don&#39;t like the fact that we expose the corruption going on in nearly all governments and 
as much as I think the quality of reddit itself has gone down, this place still reaches a lot of people. So I think It&#39;s important we take the responsability to continue posting about the political conspiracies. No I&#39;m not trying to turn this into a 
fight of political conspiracies vs non political vs alternative stories, those of you who follow me know that I post about all that kind of shit. I&#39;m just explaining the importance of exposing the corruption of politics. If we can weaken their monopoly of information
we will be able to get a whole bunch of people not only on our side, but also against the true criminals behind the conspiracies.</p>

<p>So, we gotta constantly keep up the fight over here, organize ourselves at Saidit at the same time, while using all our resources to convince regular users to leave reddit by exposing them to the corruption going on and make them go over there too. So I&#39;ll need all the help you can give
me to make regular users see the truth. All political subs, no not just here but even outside reddit itself have huge amounts of censorship and exaggerations of political correctness going on and we are probably the biggest community out there that knows about the secrets the people in power keep hiding from everyone, so we better take offensive actions don&#39;t you agree?</p>

<p>I also call the guys of TMoR and shills in general that attack this sub to surrender. I don&#39;t know what caused you to go down this path, be it apathy or a need of money or whatever, but for all the reasons I talked about before, you gotta admit there is a meaning in
what we do if the information we talk about here reaches others and the constant attacks and demonization against the conspiracy community make that difficult. I admit we have our flaws but nobody is perfect. You can&#39;t use the excuse that what we do here doesn&#39;t matter anymore... so If you can tell us why you do it, who do you work for and 
if you can expose them in any way, I&#39;m sure we would all appreciate it!</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you have all noticed it, but we are in the middle of an information warfare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actions that prompt us to consider taking conspiracy discussion to somewhere other than Reddit are paradoxical.  These Reddit actions (and inactions) creep and accrue over a long period of time, yet some actions are so brazen and so impactful that they seem to be quite sudden.  Plus, some actions that force us to consider where we could go aren’t even implemented by Reddit itself (example:  YouTube’s recent activities).  </p>

<p>The writing is on the wall &amp; we won’t know what the final straw will be until it happens so we shouldn’t ignore it. </p>

<p>What’s the best way to get people to start using Saidit?  Maybe, as individuals, we need to adopt a mindset of preparing for the future by doing something that’s slightly inconvenient, but is necessary (like exercising, or saving for a rainy day.)  By using saidit; posting and commenting there, we can build a spot for the future.  And we can’t keep putting it off because the future might just come much more quickly than we imagine.  </p>

<p>For those who have concerns about whether or not Saidit is legit, please note that you don’t have to provide an email to join.   And, you should review <a href="/u/magnora7">/u/magnora7</a>’s history. If unfamiliar, he has an extensive history on reddit in r/conspiracy, r/CST, and r/magnora7.  If you want to hear him, he did a Higherside Chats episode:  <a href="https://www.thehighersidechats.com/magnora7-the-rothschild-world-order-the-ownership-of-everything/">https://www.thehighersidechats.com/magnora7-the-rothschild-world-order-the-ownership-of-everything/</a></p>

<p>I only know <a href="/u/magnora7">/u/magnora7</a> through limited interaction but I’ve admired his writing; I notice that he has real human emotion; and I also noticed that he seems to try to improve the way that he communicates and relates with people.  Most of all, I appreciate that he has made the effort to create Saidit.   If I’m wrong about him and he’s actually some kind of shill, then I’d have to salute his work because he has sold me.  I think he’s for real, and I think he’s provided a path forward.  </p>

<p>The main conspiracy sub is one that was compromised. You can see that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/88ir92/cops_fbi_cia_dod_etc_think_there_are_3_kinds_of/">post here</a>.</p>

<p>BTW, the message itself must have been pretty dangerous to their agenda to have merited such suppression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had a similar experience. It&#39;s just a matter of time until all the subs are corrupted, because the admins are corrupted and thus the mods are slowly becoming corrupted on every sub too.
