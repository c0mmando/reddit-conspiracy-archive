<p>Why do some wheel hubs or rims of cars on the highway seem to &quot;flicker&quot; as if they are lighted by a strobe light in real life now? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because wheel hubs usually have holes or gaps and whilst it&#39;s moving at speed there&#39;s not much time while the light is hitting the gap therefore the movement of the wheel causes that &quot;strobe effect&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure actually, someone posted it awhile back. Think it was a bbc doc on climate change. Look up something like “Inuit people sun has moved” there is a 3 minute clip out there that tells the story. Basically they have extra daylight now and the sun sets on the other side of the mountain. And the prevailing winds changed as well</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots and lots of people notice this. There is a great comment in this thread with pictures. The issue is a large portion of people on Reddit are people who work at desks. I contest, as someone who works outdoors for the last ten years, that these changes are very noticeable and talked about openly by contractors, construction crews, hunters, Inuits etc. Reddit isn’t exactly the place to have this talk. Watch the video and ask some people who hunt as they are usually the first to chime in about the changes in our sky </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I have a seasonal sinsail of sorts crafted on a wall. Summer sun setting lights a portion of the wall and it only occurs for a few weeks. There has been no noticeable change over the last decade.</p>

<p>There are people who study the sun with scientific equipment. No reports from them. </p>

<p>The sin does not rise or set differently than it ever has. Take Manhattan henge for example. Twice a year hundreds await the sunset in NYC. </p>

<p>Man are they gonna be pissed when it doesn&#39;t show up!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah the old “Inuit people lie” reply. I get it, another thread like this got nuked and was full of tons of “nothing to see here” comments despite direct observation from your brothers and sisters speaking openly about these changes. Whereas your comment just sort of lazily dismisses it because some sort of authority would have told us, I find this funny, in a conspiracy forum no less. Don’t worry, I guess big brother will keep us abreast on any changes, silly me</p>

<p>Got it. </p>

<p>You enjoy the paranoid delusions. I will base my fears on something with a little more credibility. </p>

<p>BTW can&#39;t you envision how the sin would appear to rise in a different spot in the Arctic? I will stick with more logical yet mundane reasons.</p>

<p>For our planet to alter its course enough to change its position we would all know about it..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the planet has shifted on its axis. and continues to shift. the wobble is changing. this is evidenced by observing the exact position of the constellations at night. they are changeing. THAT is whats being covered up. this bullshit about convex earth and fake suns is being put out to confuse the gullible. i stargaze nightly. the north star is positioned differently almost monthly. star chart gps enabled apps are off consistantly bye as much as ten degrees. i am witnessing this myself.   none of the observatory&#39;s will comment on it,offer an explanation. they will just hang up on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sun is fake though. Just because it doesn&#39;t fit what you currently are open to, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not there. Just based on youtube videos that people were putting out since 2013 you can notice a pattern. First reports of the sun going blank and predictions of ice age amidst the whole &quot;global warming&quot; propaganda. Then the chemtrail spraying picked up and people were wondering what they were trying to cover up. Then a bunch of footage of what appeared to be two suns. People thought it was Niburu. The sun itself was pretty much never visible due to heavy spraying. Then all of a sudden the sun looks completely different. You can find footage of the simulator randomly coming on at night in some countries. Footage of it flickering. It is not the sun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it’s not much of a leap to reconcile to two. The planet didn’t shift, the fake sun has a different orbit. Or could be both. We shifted and there was a need some sun #2. Try getting the NASA shills to address the NASA patent regarding the fake sun</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m having the most difficult time trying to come up with reasons for why they might have put one of those in the sky. I don&#39;t believe in the heliocentric model of the universe. I believe there is some kind of domed structure encapsulating our existence. I can see that all of the NASA fakery is to hide the flat earth / dome structure, but for the life of me, I can&#39;t figure out a reason that conforms to the flat earth worldview for why they would put an artificial sun in the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but then you get to the question of how the ISS manages to stay in space without a machine shop to fix deadly leaks or unexpected part failures. How many valves and seals are on that thing? Not one failure? Seems like a statistical anomaly. Besides, who cares if space is real inside the dome. It&#39;s not the galaxy far far away type stuff that they teach about in school and in movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there are scientists outside the US saying that the sun simulator is to hide whatever is behind it and people have caught strange stuff in the sky near these fake suns. The scientist said this technology is to hide Niburu coming towards the earth and the evacuation of the elite to prevent hysteria. Creepy enough Dr. Harrison the NASA astronomer that wanted to do a press release on Niburu approaching randomly died of “cancer” before he ever made a public announcement. The NY Times article got pulled and nobody ever mentioned it again. </p>
