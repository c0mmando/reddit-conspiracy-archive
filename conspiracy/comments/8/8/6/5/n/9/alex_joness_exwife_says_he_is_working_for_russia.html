<p>My Questions and thoughts?</p>

<p>Could IW be apart of Cambridge Analytical as a distraction tool, or to use to discredit  opponents?</p>

<p>Did Russia tell Alex Jones&#39;s to the Gay Frog thing?</p>

<p>What else did Russia tell him to say? </p>

<p>What other clues are there, that support this thoery?</p>

<p>Could this explain his comments and involvement in 2016 election?</p>

<p>How long has he been working as a Russian Operative for?</p>

<p>Could this be the reason why his wife left him, and she has been too scared to talk about it until now?</p>

<p>Was the REAL Alex Jones killed, and replaced by a Russian clone?</p>

<p>Here is a picture of a <a href="https://m.imgur.com/gallery/vUA0j">corgie puppy</a>. I love you, and have a fantastic day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the fear mongering is way overblown. I don&#39;t believe in Russiagate. I believe that elements of the US and Global Elite would prefer and benefit from new a cold war. And I think that this post, despite it&#39;s sincerity, plays into that. </p>

<p>AJ sold out to <em>Western Elites</em> sometime after his Bohemian Grove stunt in the earliy 00&#39;s. Russia is a bit player in all of this. You should look a lot closer to home before thinking that Russia is the cause of all our problems. Russia is absolutely <em>nothing</em> compared to the effect, power, and influence of the Western Elites on your daily life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I guess. </p>

<p>Yeah, I get that everything is a Russia boogeyman. In the past it was typically Republicans and right wing types that went after Russia. Reagan and his evil empire speech comes to mind. </p>

<p>I get that it&#39;s easy not to believe in Russian influence/collusion. But right now we have no proof other than U.S intel guys under oath saying it was Russian hackers who attacked the DNC. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as bad as the MSM claims, but I don&#39;t put it out of the realm of their capabilities nor the connection with Donald and Russia in an effort to gain a president more friendly to them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn1ZK2kcfQ8&amp;amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn1ZK2kcfQ8&amp;amp;t=1s</a></p>

<p>People sometimes put Israel on a scale of massive intelligence agency influence. Well, Israel is like the size of New Jersey. Russia and China could have a lot more influence in things as well. Not to forget the good ole U.S.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do YOU have an innocent reason for the ties between UKIP, National Front, Germany&#39;s NDP, Golden Dawn, Jobbik in Hungary, Beppo Grillo, and so on and so on? Why are these anti-eu supposedly nationalist movements inexplicably putting Russia&#39;s interests arguably ahead of those of even their own? </p>

<p>Putin controlling neofascist movements in Europe and now the USA is not a conspiracy theory, it is a fact. A conspiracy theory would be that Putin is turning the Syria into a slaughterhouse to pump immigrants into Europe to stir anti-EU nationalist fascist movements he can control to weaken western unity allowing Russia to annex the eastern bloc countries and become a world power. One that has weight yeah but not provable. But the rest of it is fact.</p>

<p>&quot;The Russian government maintains a restrictive and complicated visa regime for foreigners who visit, transit, or reside in the Russian Federation.  A U.S. citizen who does not comply with Russian visa laws can be subject to arrest, fines, and/or deportation.  Russian authorities will not allow a U.S. citizen traveler with an expired visa to depart the country, effectively stranding the person for up to 20 days, until local authorities grant an exit visa.&quot;  </p>

<p>Russia is evil because Putin paid off the Russian debt to the international bankers, so they make no interest payment.  Of course, we have a $20T debt so we make a huge interest payment to the international bankers.  </p>

<p>Putin is also not afraid of the international bankers.  </p>

<p>People like Trump and Putin are loyal to their own countries.  Same with the Presidents of Poland and Hungary, but I do not recall their names.  </p>

<p>Why would you support a politician that sells out their own people?  That is the real question.  The Bushes, Clintons, Obama, Trudeau, Merkel, Macron, May, etc. are all NWO globalists who sell out their own countries for the benefit of the international bankers.   </p>

<p>As for human rights abuses, how many people did the Canadian military kill in Iraq and Afghanistan?  </p>

<p>Russia is not even close to being the worse.  Sorry.  The U.S. Is the worst.  I would guess that Communist China is high up on he list.   </p>

Because Russia invaded Afghanistan about 20 years before we did! And what Russia is doing in Syria right now? The millions dead or displaced? Not to mention Ukraine. </p>

<p>If anything Russia and Putin are for a new NWO, its just a fascist right wing NWO. I imagine you&#39;ve read Foundations of Geopolitics, right? Its Putin&#39;s playbook, and it was written by a self-identified Fascist. Golden Dawn, UKIP, National Front, NDP, Jobbik and others are all somewhere between far-right and proud fascist, (look at Golden Dawn&#39;s flag), and <em>strangely</em> they are all so close to Putin that some of them face accusations of being spy fronts. Oh yeah and they all support Assad&#39;s regime in Syria strongly, something that&#39;s a bit odd of ultranationalist groups for a dozen nations to have in common, eh? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, shit!  My apologies.  I was exchanging responses with someone else.  I thought you where them.  My bad.  I will remove the &quot;retard&quot; comment.  LOL. </p>

<p>So North Korea calls itself the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea, but it operates as a totalitarian dictatorship.  </p>

<p>South Korea is the Republic of Korea, and they have elections between different political parties.  </p>

<p>China is called The People&#39;s Republic of China, and The Communist Party of China is the name of the ruling political party.    </p>

<p>I am basing my comment on the name of China and the way they operate their government.  There is essentially one political party, and a ruling class.  I am pretty sure that China does not have different political parties.   </p>

<p>I have been through this with other people.  We do more business with Communist China than non-Communist Russia because the NWO globalists who control the industry in the U.S. and elsewhere are some mixture of Communists and Fascists.  This is why they moved manufacturing to Communist China.  </p>

<p>Mexico also have Communist leanings.  I think that Mexico is not a Communist state like China is, but Mexico does sympathize with Communist causes.  </p>

<p>My political affiliation is irrelevant, when it comes having intilligent discussion on a theory. Unlike you, I can put my personal opionions and beliefs aside and look at new facts that may conflict with them. I could due with the insult but thank you for your counter evidence. <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/believe">Just because new information challenges your beliefs, that does not make me your enemy.</a></p>

<p>Now what proves that it is a fake? Because Alex Jones said so? He didn&#39;t even call it a fake. He simply stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can&#39;t wait for Putin to give me a hashtag to use against Hillary and the Dem...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a deflection from the truth, and blame it on the obvious opposition. Why should we take his word as gospel, when he hasn&#39;t provide any actual evidence to support that it is a fake? A joke, and accusing the opposition does not count as evidence.</p>

<p>I am curious however to know why you believe in Alex Jones? </p>

<p>When did you first learn about him?</p>

<p>What is your favorite conspiracy of his?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just because they are state funded by russia, doesnt mean that there isnt truth to some of the stories that they run. its actually a decent way to find out shady things that the american government does and wont admit to. they talk about palestine and all sorts of things that are real and terrible that the MSM infiltrated with CIA wont speak about.</p>

<p>i dont understand why people think they will find something that is the: &quot;one bastion of news truth.&quot; its a very simplistic way to view the world around you, and is no way based upon reason or reality. the truth is in the middle, everything is grey, just about everyone has a different perspective/ drive for all of their thoughts/views.</p>

<p>plus, it is good to watch to understand the narrative russia is trying to make about the US.</p>

<p>you should take in all information, sort through it as best you can, and try to see what aligns with what you know and what you can verify through your daily life. unfortunately, thats the best we can hope for with the advent of 24 hour news and the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The two media outlets are not really comparable.  Vice is, for the most part, a culture and society-based publication, largely dominated by opinion pieces.  RT is a state-owned news company that holds itself out as a fact reporting media outlet.  I think its readily apparent though from a disinterested, objective position that RT&#39;s content is substantially, if not wholly slanted in favor of Putin (not necessarily pro-Russian), both from an editorial standpoint and factual reporting standpoint.  What I mean by the latter is that RT does not hesitate to &quot;bend the truth&quot;, if not outright intentionally misrepresent facts when the subject is particularly sensitive or important to the interests of Russia&#39;s current administrative regime.</p>

<p>Perhaps, but it&#39;s not impossible to say one is more credible than the other. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vice is, for the most part, a culture and society-based publication, largely dominated by opinion pieces</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this was more &#39;the most part&#39; and &#39;largely&#39; true 10 years ago, there is no denying that since the involvement and investment of the likes of hbo, Disney, Bill maker etc, thats it&#39;s expanding empire is moving into more news reporting and long form journalism about things like war, Geopolitics and globalism etc that essentially puts a hipster trendy millennial spin in MSM propaganda. It&#39;s very clever actually. </p>

<p>But they still so their other stuff like videos and  articles about vaping weed, cooking shows with rappers,  the latest sneakers etc etc which is the style of content I more prefer from them.</p>

<p>Probably their most egregious examples where their youtu.be video about isis and their hbo episode about climate change. Riddled with bullshit and disinformation propaganda,  essentially the entire premise of these pieces was false and just putting a hipster trendy millennial spin on the MSM narrative. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending RT or saying they are the most credible outlet on the planet, I&#39;m just making a comparison. </p>

<p>And from a &#39;disinterested objective position &#39; vice is less credible than RT, as jonestown correctly asserted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve lived in Ukraine and thereabouts and during Maidan and a few years of the war.  I returned home for a Christmas after being gone for 3.5 years with many stories and experiences about the matter but my family solely wanted to educate me about the great dangers of Russia.  They had no interest in hearing first hand experience about the area they are so knowledgeable about from CNN and MSNBC (a liberal family) but rather instead they pointed frothy insults at me.  I was even living in L&#39;viv for half of this time so I knew all of the Russia-is-bad politics but I wasn&#39;t prepared for American insanity, it can really catch you off guard.</p>

<p>So isn&#39;t Alex Jones&#39; ex-wife mentality unstable?  You don&#39;t have to be all that creative to say that Russia did it when that is all that you are hearing 24/7.  I&#39;m well versed in the frothy nonsense in California as well as Ukraine.  I also know the frothy nonsense about Russia from living in Colombia where my neighbor watched CNN all day.  Its the same info pipe and it makes people crazy and stupid no matter where they are living.  You must know that deep in Africa somewhere there must be a man watching CNN off of his solar panels and is shaking his fist at the sky over Russia.</p>

<p>Did Russia tell Alex Jones&#39;s to the Gay Frog thing?</p>

<p>Please educate yourself on this one:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Hayes#Atrazine_research">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Hayes#Atrazine_research</a></p>

<p>So you learn that frogs are in fact turning gay from crop pesticides (Atrazine).</p>

<p>Alex is a loud mouth. Of course he got all worked up about that one.</p>

<p>You think Russia told him to do that? Or do you think it&#39;s plausible that Alex is fully capable of shouting about conspiracies from a rooftop with a megaphone, without Russia&#39;s help? Occam&#39;s razor my man. Russia is the boogeyman, might wanna give that one a break for a while...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just because they are state funded by russia, doesnt mean that there isnt truth to some of the stories that they run. its actually a decent way to find out shady things that the american government does and wont admit to. they talk about palestine and all sorts of things that are real and terrible that the MSM infiltrated with CIA wont speak about.</p>

<p>i dont understand why people think they will find something that is the: &quot;one bastion of news truth.&quot; its a very simplistic way to view the world around you, and is no way based upon reason or reality. the truth is in the middle, everything is grey, just about everyone has a different perspective/ drive for all of their thoughts/views.</p>

<p>plus, it is good to watch to understand the narrative russia is trying to make about the US.</p>

<p>you should take in all information, sort through it as best you can, and try to see what aligns with what you know and what you can verify through your daily life. unfortunately, thats the best we can hope for with the advent of 24 hour news and the internet.</p>
