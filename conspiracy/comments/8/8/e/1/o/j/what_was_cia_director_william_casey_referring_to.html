Politicians are the criminals.

Money is fake and used to enslave the people (buy bitcoin)
Smart people who question things are termed &quot;Conspiracy theorists&quot; and crack pots
The mainstream is misinformation.  </p>

<p>Everything is bullshit.  Literally everything the American people and western culture believe is absolute fucking bullshit.  </p>

<p>When you try to explain this to &quot;educated people&quot; they think you are crazy because they&#39;ve been indoctrinated by organized criminals that lie to you about everything.  </p>

<p>Having kids in this world is an act of cruelty in my opinion. 
As human beings, we should all be free to live our lives how we see fit. If you really think you are making a positive difference in this world by getting married and having ten kids, you do what you want. Just know that the system is fully rigged to ensure you don&#39;t succeed in raising those children.</p>

<p>LoL. That is EXACTLY one of the preferred options the PTB want to evoke... exterminate your kind (family line). That&#39;s why they promote Gender Dysphoria, homosexualism, Feminism, multi-ethnicism (mixed race, namely white-black) and all that.

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of valid points.</p>

<p>Quoting Paul was interesting to me.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder,  who would refuse the love of the truth that would have saved them?     Also makes me wonder WHY would they do so?</p>

<pre><code> I wonder why God would send delusions so that those who are perishing would be further removed from the equation.
</code></pre>

<p>Folks with common sense and a good head on their shoulders would be well off to disbelieve everything until they take the time to examine it in detail.</p>

<p>Then they should stand back for a moment and ask themselves why it is so important to them.</p>

<p>Paul lays it down in 12.    I wonder why a God would need to field test an audience?</p>

<p>If God is so far removed from the suffering,  then what kind of God would that leave?</p>

<p>I mean,  There are so many folks that are just plain stupid.<br/>
    Would a God worthy, cradle the infirm or crush them?</p>

<p>Would he enable the infirm by &quot;smartening them up?&quot;</p>

<p>If you wanted to file a complaint regarding God,   who do you go you?</p>

<p>Or are you just supposed to piss on yourself and scream at  the sky?</p>

<p>It certainly does make me wonder what this word means, &quot;Truth&quot;...I don&#39;t think it means what we think it means.  We know that definitions change over time...so &quot;Truth&quot; could actually be so foundational to LIFE that they are inseparable.  And as they are incapable of being divided, one who holds them divided collapses into ruin by their very nature.  &quot;Truth&quot; by its nature would be all pervasive, like aether...and that leaves the only other Universal force of Division/Cutting (sword/words), or that which brings difference to the Universal so that it might be more than Universal (infinity, infinity +, infinity ++, infinity ++++).  Division (cutting) is by its own nature additive or expansion force while at the same time being a subtraction force (as much as cell division is additive in complexity and form; it is also destructive...so a full blown paradox right there).  </p>

<p>&quot;A house (form/human/mind/thought) divided, cannot stand.&quot; - Jesus (odd saying because he is saying like 5 things at the same time here depending on the perspective of the viewer...it is an open ended statement).  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>We can not survive divided from Truth/LIFE</p></li>
<li><p>To become divided as in cell division means that something is unstable and cannot be &#39;ALL&#39; or &quot;Truth&quot; anymore (true, as it must from that point forward be infinity +)</p></li>
<li><p>In order to stand, we must obtain ALL or regress to infinity?  (a weird one for sure but in terms of cycles I suppose it makes sense).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>IDK there are other thing packed in here and I am just totally winging it...you know, I haven&#39;t really settled down to think deeply about it.  I suppose that as it appears to be paradox it is more a functional explanation of the LIFE cycle than anything else.</p>

<p>It is not a question of guilt, sin or error but of fitness.  </p>

<p>When I was young we raised horses and occasionally one was born with a defect...it was unfit to live.  Nothing could make it &#39;fit to live&#39; and oh god how we tried...it was heart wrenching to lose a baby like that.  But it was not an error on their part...but a corruption that would not be allowed to continue due to the nature of reality.  They had neither lost or gained anything, incurred no debt or advance by being born in this world and dying in this world any more than energy is advanced when is changes it character from the electrons in the wall socket to the excited state of the light bulb.  There is no debt there, there is no sin there...it is either in a particular state or not, I suppose.</p>

<p>LMAO from that perspective we are literally in Hell in this current manifestation as there are so many nonsensical and totally arbitrary and meaningless BINDINGS put on us to regulate value when no value is specified by the character of status change within an energetic system.  Haha; hideous!</p>

<p>I died when I was little and I will tell you that what I know of God is not comprehended by the human mind.  We can only make an abstraction of the ideal and even that is pathetic and utterly PROFANE.  There is nothing wrong with returning to ALL/Truth because you didn&#39;t &#39;make the cut&#39;...this is not a humiliation in any way.  It is a judgement made without any values at all and one based solely in fitness {maybe; I need to think about this, because what IS IT if it is not based in value...what is the purpose of life, know what I mean jelly bean?  One doesn&#39;t cycle for nothing or there would be no expansion or additive progress; so no infinity +.  However this same principle is RIDICULOUSLY pervasive in almost everything we do...even breathing...inhale (expansion/complexity) exhale (contraction/unity) and obviously THAT has a purpose.  I think.  I just keep ramming into paradoxes through all this.}</p>

<p>Anywhoooo this is getting long and I wanted to read a bit before crashing out.  ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I see it, Casey/CIA&#39;s &quot;disinformation program&quot; means one of the DeepState elements of controlling the sheeple. When you look at it from Casey&#39;s/NeoCons perspective, it&#39;s a disinformation world controlled by the privileged Rabbits (religious dominators) who have crafted the Golem/ Goyim to serve <em>God&#39;s Chosen</em> (aka Children of &quot;Abrahamson/ Jacobson/ Etceterason&quot;). And the way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem">operate the Golem is to erase the memory</a> ...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the word emet (אמת, &quot;truth&quot; in Hebrew) written on its forehead. The golem could then be deactivated by removing the aleph (א) in emet,[6] thus changing the inscription from &quot;truth&quot; to &quot;death&quot; (met מת, meaning &quot;dead&quot;). Rabbit Jacob ben Shalom arrived at Barcelona from Germany in 1325 and remarked that the law of destruction is the reversal of the law of creation.[7]</p>

<p>Casey has an interesting history. He was a conservative that sided with Republicans. He was a Wall Street stooge that got his start coming up with ways that businesses could come out unscathed by the New Deal. He also had experience with some secret ops before getting into politics. He’d work as a shill for Wall Street under Nixon.</p>

<p>He was a staunch conservative that ran Reagan’s first campaign. He would then get nominated and confirmed to head the agency after Reagan won.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/juFSNpjbVN4">I don&#39;t have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It&#39;s a depression. Everybody&#39;s out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel&#39;s worth. Banks are going bust. Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there&#39;s nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there&#39;s no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be.
We know things are bad — worse than bad. They&#39;re crazy. It&#39;s like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don&#39;t go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is: &#39;Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won&#39;t say anything. Just leave us alone.&#39;
Well, I&#39;m not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get MAD! I don&#39;t want you to protest. I don&#39;t want you to riot — I don&#39;t want you to write to your congressman, because I wouldn&#39;t know what to tell you to write. I don&#39;t know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you&#39;ve got to get mad. [shouting] You&#39;ve got to say: &#39;I&#39;m a human being, god-dammit! My life has value!&#39;
So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell: I&#39;M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I&#39;M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!
I want you to get up right now. Sit up. Go to your windows. Open them and stick your head out and yell - &#39;I&#39;m as mad as hell and I&#39;m not gonna take this anymore!&#39; Things have got to change. But first, you&#39;ve gotta get mad!...You&#39;ve got to say, I&#39;M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I&#39;M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE! Then we&#39;ll figure out what to do about the depression and the inflation and the oil crisis. But first, get up out of your chairs, open the window, stick your head out, and yell, and say it: I&#39;M AS MAD AS HELL, AND I&#39;M NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS ANYMORE!</a></p>
