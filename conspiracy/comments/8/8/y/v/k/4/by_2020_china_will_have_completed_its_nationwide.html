        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/surveillance-03302018111415.html">https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/surveillance-03302018111415.html</a></p>

<p>By 2020, China will have completed its nationwide facial recognition and surveillance network, achieving near-total surveillance of urban residents, including in their homes via smart TVs and smartphones.</p>

<p>According to the official Legal Daily newspaper, the 13th Five Year Plan requires 100 percent surveillance and facial recognition coverage and total unification of its existing databases across the country.</p>

<p>Authorities in the southwestern province of Sichuan reported in December that they had completed the installation of more than 40,000 surveillance cameras across more than 14,000 villages as part of the &quot;Sharp Eyes&quot; nationwide surveillance network, the paper said.</p>

<p>Guangdong-based Bell New Vision Co. is developing the nationwide &quot;Sharp Eyes&quot; platform that can link up public surveillance cameras and those installed in smart devices in the home, to a nationwide network for viewing in real time by anyone who is given access.</p>

<p>&quot;Sharp Eyes&quot; comes from a ruling Chinese Communist Party slogan, &quot;the people have sharp eyes,&quot; which traditionally relied on the eyes and ears of local neighborhood committees to keep tabs on what its people were up to.</p>

<p>Soon, police and other officials will be able to monitor people&#39;s activities in their own homes, wherever there is an internet-connected camera.</p>

<p>A Chinese internet user who asked to remain anonymous said the social media platform WeChat has also begun issuing warnings to anyone posting messages that the government deems undesirable.</p>

<p>&quot;The internet and our smartphones have been under government surveillance for a long time already,&quot; the user said. &quot;A friend of mine in Anhui is under surveillance, and he tried to buy a plane ticket to go overseas, but he couldn&#39;t leave the country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We can be placed under restriction or persecuted by them, or asked to &#39;drink tea,&#39; [with state security police], or placed under surveillance, at any time,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Overall, it feels as if we&#39;re not free at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&#39;Social credit&#39; system</p>

<p>The Sharp Eyes system will be implemented in tandem with a &quot;social credit&quot; system that makes simple actions like buying a train ticket subject to sufficient social credit.</p>

<p>Under a pilot social credit scheme, people who are considered to be &quot;troublemakers&quot; by the authorities, including those who have tried fare-dodging, smoked on public transport, caused trouble on commercial flights or &quot;spread false information&quot; online will now be prevented from buying train tickets, the government announced earlier this month.</p>

<p>Employers who fail to pay social insurance or people who have failed to pay fines will also be on the restricted list, which takes effect on May 1.</p>

<p>The administration of President’s Xi Jinping is currently building a social credit system allowing government bodies to share information on its citizens’ trustworthiness and assign a &quot;social credit score&quot; to citizens.</p>

<p>In early 2017, the country’s Supreme People’s Court said that 6.15 million Chinese citizens had been banned from taking flights for social misdeeds, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Imagine that this is your daily life: While on your way to work or on an errand, every 100 meters you pass a police blockhouse. Video cameras on street corners and lamp posts recognize your face and track your movements. At multiple checkpoints, police officers scan your ID card, your irises and the contents of your phone. At the supermarket or the bank, you are scanned again, your bags are X-rayed and an officer runs a wand over your body — at least if you are from the wrong ethnic group. Members of the main group are usually waved through.</p>

<p>You have had to complete a survey about your ethnicity, your religious practices and your “cultural level”; about whether you have a passport, relatives or acquaintances abroad, and whether you know anyone who has ever been arrested or is a member of what the state calls a “special population.”</p>

<p>This personal information, along with your biometric data, resides in a database tied to your ID number. The system crunches all of this into a composite score that ranks you as “safe,” “normal” or “unsafe.”Based on those categories, you may or may not be allowed to visit a museum, pass through certain neighborhoods, go to the mall, check into a hotel, rent an apartment, apply for a job or buy a train ticket. Or you may be detained to undergo re-education, like many thousands of other people.</p>

<p>A science-fiction dystopia? No. This is life in northwestern China today if you are Uighur.</p>

<p>China may no longer be the bleak land of Mao suits, self-criticism sessions and loudspeakers blaring communist slogans. It boasts gleaming bullet trains, luxury malls and cellphone-facilitated consumer life. But when it comes to indigenous Uighurs in the vast western region of Xinjiang, the Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.) has updated its old totalitarian methods with cutting-edge technology.</p>

<p>The party considers Uighurs, the Turkic-speaking ethnic group native to the nominally autonomous region of Xinjiang, to be dangerous separatists. The Qing Empire conquered Xinjiang in the 18th century. The territory then slipped from Beijing’s control, until the Communists reoccupied it with Soviet help in 1949. Today, several Central Asian peoples, including Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrghyz, make up about half of the region’s population; the remainder are Han and Hui, who arrived from eastern China starting in the mid-20th century.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, small numbers of Uighurs have violently challenged the authorities, notably during riots in 2009, or committed terrorist acts. But the C.C.P. has since subjected the entire Uighur population of some 11 million to arbitrary arrest, draconian surveillance or systemic discrimination. Uighurs are culturally Muslim, and the government often cites the threat of foreign Islamist ideology to justify its security policies.</p>

<p>I have researched Xinjiang for three decades. Ethnic tensions have been common during all those years, and soon after 9/11, Chinese authorities started invoking the specter of “the three evil forces of separatism, extremism and terrorism” as a pretense to crack down on Uighurs. But state repression in Xinjiang has never been as severe as it has become since early 2017, when Chen Quanguo, the C.C.P.’s new leader in the region, began an intensive securitization program.</p>

<p>Mr. Chen has brought to Xinjiang the grid system of checkpoints, police stations, armored vehicles and constant patrols that he perfected while in his previous post in Tibet. The C.C.P. credits him with having quieted there a restive ethnic group unhappy with its rule. In his first year governing Xinjiang, Mr. Chen has already recruited tens of thousands of new security personnel.</p>

<p>As multiple news outlets have reported, he has also deployed high-tech tools in the service of creating a better police state. Uighurs’ DNA is collected during state-run medical checkups. Local authorities now install a GPS tracking system in all vehicles. Government spy apps must be loaded on mobile phones. All communication software is banned except WeChat, which grants the police access to users’ calls, texts and other shared content. When Uighurs buy a kitchen knife, their ID data is etched on the blade as a QR code.</p>

<p>This digitized surveillance is a modern take on conventional controls reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and ’70s. Some Uighurs report getting a knock on their door from security agents soon after receiving a call from overseas. Last autumn one Uighur told me that following several such intimidating visits over the summer, his elderly parents had texted him, “The phone screen is bad for our old eyes, so we’re not using it anymore.” He had not heard from them since.</p>

<p>Xinjiang authorities have recently enforced a spate of regulations against Uighur customs, including some that confound common sense. A law now bans face coverings — but also “abnormal” beards. A Uighur village party chief was demoted for not smoking, on grounds that this failing displayed an insufficient “commitment to secularization.” Officials in the city of Kashgar, in southwest Xinjiang, recently jailed several prominent Uighur businessmen for not praying enough at a funeral — a sign of “extremism,” they claimed.</p>

<p>Any such violation, or simply being a Uighur artist or wealthy businessman, can lead to indefinite detention in what the government euphemistically calls “political training centers” — a revival of punitive Maoist re-education camps — secured by high walls, razor wire, floodlights and guard towers. A revered Uighur Islamic scholar is said to have died in one of those centers this week.</p>

<p>According to Radio Free Asia, a county official and a police officer in southern Xinjiang were instructed by superiors to lock up 40 percent of the local Uighur population. Adrian Zenz, a researcher at the European School of Culture and Theology, estimates that 5 percent of the Uighur population across Xinjiang has been or is currently detained — more than 500,000 people in all. Local orphanages overflow with the children of detainees; some children reportedly are sent to facilities in the eastern parts of China.</p>

<p>Why are so many Uighurs subjected to these harsh policies? A Chinese official in Kashgar explained: “You can’t uproot all the weeds hidden among the crops in the field one by one — you need to spray chemicals to kill them all.” The C.C.P., once quite liberal in its approach to diversity, seems to be redefining Chinese identity in the image of the majority Han — its version, perhaps, of the nativism that appears to be sweeping other parts of the world. With ethnic difference itself now defined as a threat to the Chinese state, local leaders like Mr. Chen feel empowered to target Uighurs and their culture wholesale.</p>

<p>Some people in the Chinese bureaucracy and Chinese academic circles disagree with this approach. They worry that locking down an entire province and persecuting an entire ethnic group will only instill long-lasting resentment among Uighurs. Or they note that Mr. Chen’s policies are so burdensome and so costly that they will be difficult to sustain: Han Chinese residents of Xinjiang also complain about the inconvenience and cost of living in such a police state.</p>

<p>Then there are the international repercussions. Blanket repression in Xinjiang can only hurt China’s bid for the world’s respect, just when the Trump administration’s chaotic foreign policy offers Beijing an opportunity to enhance its own standing. Forget the image of President Xi Jinping as a responsible internationalist at Davos. Nothing shreds soft power abroad like coils of razor wire at home.</p>

<p>There’s an old Chinese joke about Uighurs being the Silk Road’s consummate entrepreneurs: When the first Chinese astronaut steps off his spaceship onto the moon, he will find a Uighur already there selling lamb kebabs. And so even as Mr. Chen cracks down in Xinjiang, the Chinese government touts the region as the gateway for its much-vaunted “one belt, one road” initiative, Mr. Xi’s signature foreign policy project. The grand idea combines a plan to spend billions of dollars in development loans and transport investment across Eurasia with a strategic bid to establish China’s diplomatic primacy in Asia.</p>

<p>But while Mr. Xi’s government promises the world a new Silk Road through Muslim Central Asia and the Middle East, the Xinjiang authorities attempt to contain a purported “Uighur problem” by incarcerating many good citizens and spying from every street corner and mobile phone. The C.C.P.’s domestic policies contradict its international aspirations.</p>

<p>How does the party think that directives banning fasting during Ramadan in Xinjiang, requiring Uighur shops to sell alcohol and prohibiting Muslim parents from giving their children Islamic names will go over with governments and peoples from Pakistan to Turkey? The Chinese government may be calculating that money can buy these states’ quiet acceptance. But the thousands of Uighur refugees in Turkey and Syriaalready complicate China’s diplomacy.</p>

<p>Tibetans know well this hard face of China. Hong Kongers must wonder: If Uighur culture is criminalized and Xinjiang’s supposed autonomy is a sham, what will happen to their own vibrant Cantonese culture and their city’s shaky “one country, two systems” arrangement with Beijing? What might Taiwan’s reunification with a securitized mainland look like? Will the big-data police state engulf the rest of China? The rest of the world?</p>

<p>As China’s profile grows on the international stage, everyone would do well to ask if what happens in Xinjiang will stay in Xinjiang.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>embraced. this is the real beginning of the end. welcome it. let the micro chipping begin. cybernetic implants, genetically modified foods, mass surveillance, facial recognition, illegalization of private lands, removal of rights to protest and to defend yourself. it is really ramping up faster and faster. the thing that is crazy to me is how easily it is all happening. we are the minority now who speak out against this stuff. your sesame credit score will be important to our children. I already know my children are the generation that will willing hand over our rights to own guns in america. that should happen in about 10-15 years. the new world order will take hold not by force but by vote. the last of our god given rights and freedoms will be taken not with a bang not even with a wimper but by resounding applause. the real campaign being run against us is to make us look wrong about everything and make our children feel like they know more than any other generation by implanting new and weird trends and telling the world they are right and good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what gun laws are and are not. there is just a massive push for more restrictions on what we can own and they want to put some broad and vague limitations on who can own guns for now. that isn&#39;t the point of my original comment. the small elementary school age kids now are being brain washed and indoctrinated and when they are voting aged people they will gladly vote out all guns. </p>

<p>I mean we cant be saying the government is run by child sacrificing shadow government hell bent on a globalist agenda to bring about the rule of the new world order and at the same time send our kids to public school and eat FDA approved beef...

    <div class="md"><p>You had everything spot on, but you have this one wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the new world order will take hold not by force but by vote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how did they get those votes? The answer is mass immigration of non-whites.</p>

<p>Whites vote pro 1A and pro 2A. Non-whites do not. Look at how non-whites <a href="http://thealternativehypothesis.org/index.php/2016/09/02/non-whites-of-every-stripe-vote-democrat/">vote in the USA</a>.</p>

<p>So how did we end up with so many non-whites in America?</p>

<p>Well, America was designed by our founding fathers to be a country for free white people. <strong>The Naturalization Act of 1790</strong> (3 years after the constitution) explicitly <a href="https://imgur.com/PcXLlzs">restricted citizenship to &quot;free white people.&quot;</a></p>

<p>This was until the Immigration Act of 1965. Ted Kennedy said <a href="https://imgur.com/ijnCPhI">this</a> to the senate upon introducing the bill. Looking back, we can see this is all lies. Complete lies.</p>

<p>All throughout the west, not just in America, our politicians allowed mass immigration of non-whites into our country under the premise of &quot;diversity.&quot; Not one western country was allowed to vote in this matter. There was no referendum on the most important policy in European history. Our politicians decided for us. Democracy is an illusion. </p>

<p>Now you might be thinking, why do our politicians want homelands of European white peoples to be flooded with Latin Americans, Arabs, Asians, Africans etc. If this was happening to any other group of people, it would be considered a genocide (according to <a href="http://www.un.org/ar/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf">UN definitions</a>). The obvious answer of why our politicians wanted mass non-white immigration of getting more votes from these minority groups, but the real reason is a lot more insidious....</p>

<p>The ethnic replacement of white people was planned 100 years ago. Research the <a href="https://therionorteline.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/100416_2343_forarthurka1.jpg?w=700">Kalergi plan</a>. Look at who <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vFgnl8LGHVw/WUGK58DJ7vI/AAAAAAAAd84/OeHZWnZYxw85G9uLi3U2i3tLB1d2uM08wCLcBGAs/s640/1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1%2B1.jpg">funded</a> it. And look at how it is <a href="https://imgur.com/a/9LGsM">affecting America</a> (full article <a href="https://cis.org/Jewish-Stake-Americas-Changing-Demography">here</a>). That article right there will blow your mind. It explains exactly why the elites have a vested interest in changing the demographics of the West.</p>

<p>Driving down the IQ via mass migration of the 3rd world is literally what the <a href="https://153news.net/files/photos/2018/02/04/15177973557ceedc_l.jpg">Jews want</a>. They want a slave population.</p>

<p>The Jews. The Jews want white genocide. They want white people to be replace in their own homelands. They don&#39;t want white people to have kids, which is why you see all the anti-natalist propaganda. I also wouldn&#39;t be suprised to find out that the Jews were behind the dropping fertility in the west. They want whites to hate themselves, which is why public education teaches kids about slavery, the holocaust, colonization, taking America away from the natives etc. They want whites to race mix. They literally want the end of the white race.</p>

<p>And by the way large scale miscegenation is also genocide (according to <a href="http://www.un.org/ar/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/osapg_analysis_framework.pdf">UN definitions</a>) to the host population. </p>

<p>The Jews, the same group of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/aLqLw">people who own the media</a>, also promote miscegenation.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://imgur.com/a/E8e8R">Tinder</a> is owned by them</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/unspectateur/status/752541093653164032?lang=en">Blacked.com</a> is owned by one of them </li>
<li><a href="https://imgur.com/a/QgOox">Mindgeek</a>, the owners of all websites under the PornHub Network, is controlled by them. (I wonder why you see so much cuck and interracial porn? hmmm...)</li>
<li><a href="https://squawker.org/culture-wars/underwear-company-meundies-is-obsessed-with-race-mixing-ads-whos-behind-them/">MeUndies</a>, an underwear outlet that promotes race mixing in their advertising campaigns, is owned by them.</li>
</ul>

<p>And there are countless of other examples. </p>

<p>So now I want to go back to the original comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the new world order will take hold not by force but by vote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. There was plenty of force involved, but nobody cared enough (or was too scared) to do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true, there is tension between the Chinese government and the Uighur Muslims living in the far west Chinese province called Xinjiang.  I&#39;ve heard FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds of Newsbud.com talk briefly about Xinjiang in the past, and how the CIA is causing trouble there because the CIA always relies on ethnic warfare -- creating division in populations along ethnic lines.  (For example, the CIA in Vietnam created massive social divisions between Christian Vietnamese and Buddhist Vietnamese -- but that&#39;s another long post.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I saw this post made by someone at Newsbud.com , referring to the CIA&#39;s Gulen network (Gulen is that Turkish exile guy in Pennsylvania that the CIA loves so much) : </p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsbud.com/2017/12/15/the-battle-for-texas-sibel-edmonds-goes-after-pocketed-politicians-at-the-capitol/">https://www.newsbud.com/2017/12/15/the-battle-for-texas-sibel-edmonds-goes-after-pocketed-politicians-at-the-capitol/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Gulen is a joker in the CIA deck being played on a very large and longterm geopolitical arena. Aside from the concocted wars in the middle east the Gulen network is especially used to incite terrorism inside China by the Uighur ethnic groups. The goal is obviously to obstruct and perhaps halt the Chinese belt and road initiative which is now picking up steam and moving forward rapidly. Once China together with Russia and the central Asian republics manage to get this gigantic project on its way there will be no stopping it and only a matter of time before the middle east and europe also get onboard. That the United States is using this kind of terror tactic to destroy economic and trade development only shows how far the moral decay has gone. If this is not reversed soon the US will find itself completely isolated and marginalized in a world that wants to move away from war and mayhem towards progress and opportunities.&quot;</p>
