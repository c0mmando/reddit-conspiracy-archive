       Theory works like this. TPTB know that you can't fool all of the people all of the time. So they have the MSM for authoritative and official narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSM is there for the majority of the public that enjoy conformity of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you always have a few dissenters and skeptics. So to keep them happy, we have alt news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alt news is for those people like things to make sense and would rather know something closer to the truth, even when the truth is unpleasant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deal here is that it's ok to know a bit more and even to be outraged. TPTB don't mind if you know a bit more (or even a lot more) just as long as you never actually do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr; alt news could be seen as a blend of controlled opposition and limited hangout.

       Problem is they are independents until they hit the voting booth. Where they chicken out and vote for the usual suspects. Speaking as an independent myself, who didn't chicken out in the voting booth.

       That's because they've been fooled into thinking a vote for 3rd party is a wasted vote. If enough people in the media convince the public that this is true, then they won't vote 3rd party and their vote really would be worthless. It's a self-fulfilling prophesy.

       You would think that if the sole motivation for a news company was to make money by catering to an audience, then there would be some big channels who would want to cash in by producing content solely for independents, which is the largest block of people in the United States. What we see instead are channels that appear designed to push you into the Republican or Democrat category.

       I understand what you are saying, but you've missed the point twice.  "Independent" in the first comment you replied to means that the news outlet is free of influence by government or corporate interests.  You misunderstood it as politically "independent".  Has that cleared things up?

       Endorsed and certified, the trick is to give the perception of freedom. You know the truth is out there somewhere obfuscated under all that empty vernacular and nonsensical chatter. I hope that news video redpill a whole lot more people. The newspapers are probably the similar. It's not a public relations firm it's a propaganda relations machine. It's sold with a soulless smile, way too much make up and faked concern...stay classy MSM(like a turd in a punch bowl).

       I agree with you so much on this theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the weekend wasn't there something like 15,000 viewers on this sub? If that many stumbled on the truth and got loud about it, we could do something. But between lack of time and fact based resources, we all fall prey to divide and conquer tactics. Even some alt media is using this to divide people. So just like mainstream news consumers, we do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read, investigate, verify, compare, contrast, and always be flexible enough to change your mind in light of new facts. That's the only way to find the truth.

       Alt news sites are going to have less access to information, less time to dig deep, less interviews with concerned parties, and less cross checking from other agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big guys like Reuters and AP have far more parties interested in debunking them, and their profitability is tied to a global network of journalists and media agencies respecting their reporting. Lies get called out and corrected more often.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problems really arise when you can't specifically locate their lies and thats where alt news comes in. News sources that can risk credibility running stories that may or may not be true, but this grants huge power to ask different questions and explore different stories. AP won't spend time on HAARP, for example, because the topic has been ostracized.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll never silence alt news because there's barely any threads between them. When you run any story you want you become a wild beast. The best you can do to control the narratives is run parallel agencies polluting the water with as many preposterous claims as possible.

       All this hoopla about Sinclair making its anchors deliver a company-written editorial! But have you listened to the actual content of the editorial? Synopsis: fake and biased news is getting into the MSM but we pledge not to do that. That's pretty benign. Just worthless TV company claptrap that nobody pays any attention to.
      </p>
      <p>
       For your consideration: 1. Many local news feature stories are sourced nationally and run with the same or only slightly different wording on many stations. So, this is not something really new, except perhaps for Sinclair specifying exactly how it was to be done. 2. The content of the message is pretty much correct. Watch NBC Nightly News for an example of liberal-establishment bias in story after story. They don't exactly make things up, they just choose their wording carefully and assume "facts" that are not really in evidence. 3. If Sinclair was known to be a liberal corporation and did the same thing, the message would be seen as calling out Fox News and little or nothing would have been said about it.

       I think your conclusion is correct, but your narrative is a little bit circular. I think TPTB were forced into controlling alt news sources after the events of 2008. There you had at least two major upsets that were not part of the establishment plan - the Arab Spring and the campaign of Barack Obama. Both were only made possible by social media.

       I never used to see any writers for
       <em>
        The Nation
       </em>
       magazine on "mainstream" television programs like Nightline and Meet The Press.  Then beginning, I think, in the late '80s or early 1990's, David Corn began working for
       <em>
        The Nation
       </em>
       , and Corn also began appearing on TV news shows.  I was completely surprised when I first saw a writer for
       <em>
        The Nation
       </em>
       actually invited onto mainstream TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corn's latest book, by the way, is called "Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin's War on America and the Election of Donald Trump."
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin's war on America??  More like America's war on Russia....
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure, but I think the great Victor Navasky was no longer the publisher of
       <em>
        The Nation
       </em>
       when Corn began working there.  By the way, I think Katrina vanden Heuvel is an excellent publisher too -- I always enjoy hearing what she has to say when vanden Heuvel appears on TV.  Not sure how Corn got into
       <em>
        The Nation
       </em>
       in the late '80s or early '90s.  Would be interesting to find out.

       When you are controlled by fear, you are controlled by the same fear as mainstream media. Spiritually devoid media exists in the alt world as well. If you are only making people more afraid and confused, you are not empowering them with knowledge, quite the opposite.

       James Corbett is the only one I currently fully trust, but trust isn't really needed anyway... we're supposed to have our critical thinking turned on at all times, and we're supposed to assume everything new bit of information may be false unless we've fact-checked it and found good supporting evidence.
       <br/>
       Also, with that said, I'm going to point out that the PTB suck bad at making their shills look legit, and the vast majority of us are always on the lookout for shills and reports that don't quite feel right, so they'd have a hell of time producing a believable alt news shill.

       Any source of news or media will be biased towards it's user base. This is why the daily show was the only one that actually came close to honestly telling the news. It was making fun of everything for the most part, so it wasn't as biased but it really spoke about the issues.

       Check out MGS2's codec calls, has references to this kind of stuff. Some of it is pretty sketch, considering when it was made.

       21st Century Wire, John Pilger, Seymour Hersch, Media lens, some smaller news sources under IMPRESS can be much better, you need to be critical of every story and figure out what they aren't reporting. The selection of what is or isn't news worthy is important.

       Actually its just the long term outcome of first past the post voting systems. They're destined to narrow to 2 main voting blocks. Its a flawed system.
